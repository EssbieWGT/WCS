The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the two companies have agreed to split.

Ford will now take sole ownership of the joint partnership’s two battery plants built in Glendale, Kentucky. The Hardin County plant sold its first EV battery in August, with batteries from the plant powering the all-electric Ford F-150 Lightning.

A second completed plant next door has yet to begin production and is currently mothballed, meaning it's offline and standing by for possible reactivation.

SK On, the South Korean company’s battery unit, said it will assume control of the EV battery plant in Tennessee, according to the WSJ.

The split comes as the auto industry moves away from EVs amid dwindling demand.

BlueOval SK External Affairs Director Keli McAlister released the following statement:

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear began his Team Kentucky update Thursday discussing the news. He said he still has confidence Ford will deliver for Kentucky and remain a strong partner.

""We are in communication with Ford seeking to understand the impact of this announcement and the direction the company intends to take,"" Beshear said. ""I remain optimistic about the future of these facilities, but there's no question actions taken out of Washington by this current administration and Congress has made it much more complicated, and it may take longer to achieve the desired results in those factories.""

Beshear said he expects an update on next steps from Ford early next week.

Earlier this year, Ford announced a nearly $2 billion investment into the Louisville Assembly Plant to produce a new electric truck.

But details about most projects are kept in the dark. If you know of a data center coming to your community, or if you have thoughts or information on data centers in Oklahoma, please fill out our form.

Big tech companies have plans to build more than a dozen data centers in Oklahoma to keep up with increased computing needs from artificial intelligence. Some will require enough electricity to power entire cities. Oklahoma’s two largest utility companies are investing more than a billion dollars in new sources of power to keep up with demand and plan to pass on some of the cost to residential customers.

The Frontier found at least 18 data center projects in the state that are either now under construction or awaiting government approvals. The newsroom used public announcements, land records, meeting agendas and air permit applications to compile that count.

The state’s two largest utilities, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Public Service Company of Oklahoma, have said in regulatory filings that new demand from data centers and other industries will require more power than they can now produce. The utilities are already looking to pass the cost of new transmission lines and power generation on to all customers, including residential users. Though power prices are lower compared to the nation at large, Oklahoma residential customers already pay some of the highest prices for electricity in the region, second behind Texas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The average per-kilowatt hour price for Oklahoma residents was up 7% in September from the same time the previous year.

John Laws, Gov. Kevin Stitt’s former secretary of budget and now a consultant for OG&E, told state regulators in May that big new users want assurances that OG&E will have enough power to fill their needs before they sign agreements with utilities. Laws noted that these big new users come from a variety of industries, including manufacturing, refineries, the federal government, data centers and cryptocurrency.

“The changes in recent prospective loads are unprecedented, both in the sheer size and the volume of requests,” Laws said.

A report from the Corporation Commission’s Public Utility Division in June warned that the data center boom could lead utilities to overestimate demand based on speculative proposals and unverified projections. Some data centers could close or never be built, leaving the remaining ratepayers in the state to pay for billions of dollars in new power generation.

Historically, adding new large customers has helped spread fixed costs across a broader base, supporting affordability for all customers, said Matt Rahn, a spokesperson for PSO.

“Our commitment is to protect our existing customers by ensuring new customers, including data centers, pay their fair share or contribution to the costs their load on the system creates,” Rahn said. “We’re also evaluating a large energy use tariff to further ensure prices reflect the cost to serve each customer group, keeping rates fair and balanced for all.”

Ken Miller, vice president of public and regulatory affairs for OG&E, said the company is building protections for existing customers into its new large load contracts and working to develop a new tariff for larger customers.

“The need is just tremendous,” Miller said. “As you see, not just here in Oklahoma, but the country and world, the world is electrifying, and we are all trying to keep up with that increased pace of electrification.”

A few of the proposed data centers in Oklahoma include plans for solar energy facilities to power them, including a set of five data centers planned in Stillwater and at least one of two proposed Google data centers near Muskogee, land and air permitting records show.

Oklahoma passed a law earlier this year that gives companies more options to buy or generate power on-site. But the law does not require companies to generate their own power.

New state law could add charges to electric bills

Another new state law, Senate Bill 998, which took effect in August allows utilities to recoup costs from customers to build new natural gas power plants as soon as construction begins.

OG&E lobbied for the new law. The utility believes it will save ratepayers money in the long run as it keeps financing costs from building up over the years, Miller said.

“It’s akin to a mortgage and you’re building a house and paying off the interest early instead of later,” he said. “The savings to customers comes by eliminating the long-term financing of those construction costs.”

But Oklahoma attorney A.J. Singer, who represents the Oklahoma chapter of AARP, says it’s more like an apartment building where current tenants pay more each month so the landlord can build new rental units, while current renters will never see any actual benefit. AARP lobbied against the legislation and believes it will only benefit large, for-profit utility companies, said Joy McGill, AARP’s associate state director of advocacy.

OG&E has already unsuccessfully tried this year to use the new law to charge customers more while it builds two new natural gas power plants as part of a $506.4-million plan to increase generating capacity. OG&E proposed charging customers an average of 55 cents extra per month starting in 2026, which would increase each year to an average $4.41 a month by 2031.

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, rejected OG&E’s cost-recovery plan in November because the new law hadn’t taken effect yet when the company submitted its application. The commission will allow OG&E to recover some of its costs to build the new generators, but only after they are put into service and provide power to customers. The average cost to consumers was not included in the Corporation Commission order.

The commission also ordered OG&E to come up with a plan to create a new tariff on large users like data centers by July 2026, in hopes of defraying future costs for residential customers. Both AARP and the Oklahoma Industrial Energy Consumers group have asked the commission to reconsider its decision to allow OG&E to recover costs from customers, though the commission has yet to rule on that matter.

In its current case before the Corporation Commission, Public Service Company of Oklahoma is also seeking to pass along the costs of building and buying new generation to customers, including in-progress construction costs to build two new natural gas generators.

PSO said in its application filed in September that it plans to purchase and build more than $1.25 billion in new sources of energy and will seek to recover $539.8 million in construction costs from ratepayers to build new natural gas-fired generators that are part of the expansion plan.

A Corporation Commission administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the case in February.

Singer said AARP will likely oppose the request, but he hopes the Corporation Commission will work to require big industrial users to shoulder more of the cost in the future.

“There needs to be some kind of guarantee from these data centers that if the utility and its ratepayers expend a bunch of funds to build out infrastructure and generation for these extremely large loads, that they’re going to be here in 15, 20, 30 years,” he said.

A shortage of power

Demand for electricity from data centers is expected to triple by 2030, making up around 14% of all power usage in the U.S., according to a recent report by McKinsey & Company.

Most of the increased demand comes from commercial and industrial customers that are coming on to the grid and “with electric needs far greater than PSO has experienced in the past,” Matthew Horeled, vice president of regulatory and finance for PSO said in testimony before the Corporation Commission.

As of September, PSO had 11 new “large load” customers under letters of agreement or contract, representing about 779 megawatts, enough energy to power around half a million average homes.

Several industrial parks in PSO’s service area were also in late-stage negotiations with large-load projects, Horeled said.

Unless it acquires new sources of power, PSO will face a 31% power deficit of 3,124 megawatts by 2031, a gap that could power 2 million average Oklahoma homes, according to its application to recover costs from customers.

One new customer that recently signed a preliminary letter of agreement with PSO will eventually need over 1,000 megawatts at any given time, roughly enough to power 666,000 average Oklahoma homes.

OG&E predicts that it too will eventually see a significant generation deficit unless it invests in new sources of power. By 2035, OG&E projects it will face a shortfall of 3,459 megawatts to meet demand, or about 38% higher than it is capable of generating.

OG&E is already preparing its next request for proposals to acquire new electrical generation resources, which will require it to bring a new application before the Corporation Commission in order to recover the cost of new generation from customers, a spokesman for the company said.",https://www.readfrontier.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/data-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-11 13:02:51.362400

For decades, demand for electrical power has remained stable. Utilities could count on highly predictable growth patterns to guide their capacity planning. However, the power requirements of AI and data are placing increasing pressure on power infrastructure, creating significant challenges for grid operators, utilities and developers alike.

While data centers aren’t the sole driver of rising load, they are a dominant factor shaping future demand forecasts. The power intensity of Artificial Intelligence/High-Performance Computing (AI/HPC) and the ever-growing power needs of cloud infrastructure are key drivers. To illustrate the power-intensity of AI, you only need to glance at NVIDIA’s product roadmap. An upcoming version of its flagship GPU solutions is projected to use 1MW – a volume of power that was the IT load of an entire data hall not long ago. Soon, that amount of power will be used by a single rack, not to mention the cooling and other supporting system power needed to support the required operating environment for these new products.

The power consumption of this equipment, combined with the overall growth in cloud-based IT, is leading to data center projects that require a volume of power previously unthinkable just a few years ago. Recent projects announced in locations such as Texas and Louisiana will utilize 1 GW, 2GW or more – equivalent to the demand from an entire city concentrated into just a few buildings. How much power does that add up to across the country? A recent research report by Goldman Sachs predicts that power demands from AI and data centers will reach 92 GW as early as 2027, driven by a volume of investment by major tech firms that is rapidly approaching $1 trillion.

How can utilities expand the capacity of the U.S. electrical grid to keep pace with this skyrocketing demand? It’s a question that comes up in every conversation I have with peers at utilities, and it dominates every industry conference I have attended recently. One thing that is certain is that this challenge will not be solved with a single solution and will require collaboration from both supply-side and demand-side stakeholders.

Building additional capacity and flexibility into the grid with renewable energy DERs, for example, will be an important part of the overall solution. However, a recent Duke University study poses a fascinating hypothesis regarding this issue: What if we don’t need to build new or expanded power plants to meet the power demands of AI and data centers?

Duke’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability recently published a report titled “Rethinking Load Growth: Assessing the Potential for Integration of Large Flexible Loads in US Power Systems” that outlines a strategy for utilities to meet the nearly 100 GW of projected power demands of AI and data centers with existing grid capacity. The key is for utilities and data center operators to work together in a collaborative way that utilizes flexible load management.

Rather than focusing capacity planning solely on total load, utilities would also need to focus on load shape and flexibility. A critical facet of flexible load management is for utilities to incorporate periodic demand curtailment as part of their collaboration with AI companies and data center operators. Duke’s research showed that if AI and cloud data center operators were willing to accept short-duration curtailments of less than 50 hours per year, utilities could accommodate a massive amount of new data center load without having to add more generation capacity. During these periods of curtailment, data center operators would shift workloads by controlling compute and storage resources– strategies that tech companies are already incorporating into their operational strategies. This approach is suitable for end-user-owned data centers but may not be as feasible for wholesale and colocation data center operators. However, utilizing onsite generation during load reduction events is an operating strategy that could be more broadly applicable to all ownership types.

According to the study:

“Flexibility allows large electricity users to temporarily reduce consumption during periods of grid stress by shifting workloads, utilizing on-site generation, or adjusting operations. By leveraging flexibility, new large loads can be interconnected more quickly while reducing the need for premature investment in additional power plants and transmission lines….”

Their point about reducing the delays for interconnection is a critical part of the story because accelerated interconnections help make this a win-win for data center operators and utilities. By agreeing to work with utilities to allow for short-duration curtailments, data center companies would benefit significantly from much faster approvals of interconnection requests. This is a significant benefit to data center operators, given the backlog of interconnections that is leading to substantial, costly delays for data center projects. The current backlog is driven in large part by the inflexibility of current requests for large loads, which are based on guarantees for a 100% maximum electricity draw 24/7/365, regardless of other demands on the grid. It is this rigidity in those terms that drives the need for significant upgrades to the grid.

The most time-intensive and costly infrastructure upgrades required for new interconnections are often associated with expanding the transmission system to deliver electricity during the most stressed grid conditions (Gorman et al. 2024). Suppose a new load is assumed to require firm interconnection service and operate at 100% of its maximum electricity draw at all times, including during system-wide peaks. In that case, it is far more likely to trigger the need for significant upgrades, such as new transformers, reconductoring of transmission lines, circuit breakers, or other substation equipment. Introducing more flexibility into those terms would enable utilities to expedite interconnection requests, allowing data center operators to plan with greater confidence and deliver facilities to customers more quickly.

In September 2025, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) issued a Level 2 Industry Recommendation for Large Load Interconnection, Study, Commissioning, and Operations. Utility system planners and operators are advised to adopt a proactive approach to enhance system reliability through actions focused on interconnection, planning, operational readiness, and disturbance recovery. Strategies that leverage NERC recommendations, combined with innovative and flexible load interconnection prioritization, can help overcome current challenges and accelerate AI data center integration.

Flexible load management is not achieved with a flip of the switch, though. Making it a reality will require utilities to take important steps such as utilizing transmission constraint modeling, creating demand performance frameworks, revisiting how they construct rate design, employing a more collaborative approach to working with large-load customers, proactive reliability strategies, and more. At PPL, we proved that orchestrated energy can unlock real flexibility. In the first year of our Pennsylvania connected distributed generation pilot, curtailment amounted to only 9.5 kWh across 768 events, representing less than one percent of annual output. Nevertheless, the program still expanded hosting capacity, enabled same-day interconnection approvals, and reduced upgrade costs. The result was faster timelines, lower costs, more satisfied customers, and, most importantly, a replicable model for integrating even the largest new loads, including data centers.

Having a unified, holistic strategy for planning, asset management, resiliency, and regulatory compliance provides a strong foundation for achieving each of those pillars of flexible load management. But even if your utility does not embrace the specific model proposed in the Duke study, taking steps to build more flexibility into how you meet growing demand still has significant value – including for better leveraging renewables and other DERs to meet overall demand and peak demand scenarios. These initiatives are hard work, but worth it to successfully meet demand without requiring massive capital investments that put the burden on ratepayers.

The split marks a reset for one of the major U.S. electric vehicle battery partnerships, coming as slowing EV demand and the loss of U.S. subsidies push South Korean battery makers to reshape their U.S. strategies and accelerate expansion into the energy storage systems business.

SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, which supplies automakers including Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp, said a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will assume full ownership and operate the Tennessee plant.

""The production start schedule for the Tennessee plant remains flexible at this time, as it is related to the ownership transition,"" SK On said.

In 2022, SK On and Ford invested $11.4 billion to build the joint battery plants in the United States.

SK On said the move reflected a strategic overhaul of assets and capacity aimed at enabling it to respond more quickly to market changes, accelerate its North American energy storage system business, and strengthen productivity and cost competitiveness in its battery operations.

The company said the restructuring is expected to improve its financial structure and profitability by sharply reducing debt and cutting fixed costs.

SK On posted an operating loss of 124.8 billion won ($84.72 million) for the July-September period, nearly double the 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter due to slowing EV battery shipments.

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers.

SK On has been expanding into the energy storage system business to offset weaker EV demand. In September, the company signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems.

A new survey from the National Association of Realtors found that businesses are focused on energy efficiency when purchasing or leasing commercial property. The responses came from over 2,000 realtors, more than half of whom reported that promoting a building’s energy efficiency is valuable when listing it. Similarly, a third of realtors said green building certifications increased commercial property value.

While 70% of respondents said clients found utility and operations costs to be important considerations, only 27% said clients were focused on renewable energy systems such as solar and geothermal. Even still, 35% of realtors said it was important to understand how solar panels impact a real-estate transaction. Behind-the-meter solar infrastructure that directly powers buildings can lower utility bills, as can net metering, and proper insulation prevents heat or cooling loss.

In a recent House hearing on energy efficiency, hearing witness Kara Saul Rinaldi, chief policy officer of the Building Performance Association, said that energy efficiency can guarantee building longevity and support the grid.

“Energy efficiency in buildings and appliances lowers costs for families and businesses,” Rinaldi said during the hearing. “Advancing energy efficiency across the US reduces demand on our energy system.”

Beyond lowering energy bills and aiding the grid, a new report from the Building Performance Association also found rising employment as a result of green building construction and upgrading existing structures. The energy-efficiency industry is “creating more jobs than any other energy sector” and the number of energy-efficiency jobs has “nearly doubled since 2021.” What’s more, energy efficiency is the “largest energy sector” in most states.

A study released this week by the Environmental Integrity Project found that 27 states have reduced budgets for their environmental agencies over the past 15 years, adjusted for inflation, and Texas was among the worst offenders.

The Lone Star State is among seven that have axed a third or more of their funding for environmental oversight. Indeed, the 33% funding reduction for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality was the nation’s seventh-largest. Lawmakers whittled the agency’s budget from $615 million in 2010 to just $413 million last fiscal year.

Texas also was among the two-thirds of states — 31 to be exact — that also took an ax to staffing for their environmental agencies. Those states eliminated 3,725 positions, or about 13 percent of total jobs, over the past 15 years. TCEQ faced a 2% force reduction over that time period.

“These deep reductions mean that the Trump Administration’s proposed downsizing of the EPA would have an increased impact on pollution control efforts across the country,” the study’s authors wrote. “Not only will the federal pollution cop no longer be on the beat, state authorities may not show up either.”

President Donald Trump’s budget proposal would cut the EPA’s funding by 55%, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans have recommended slashing it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a 5% decrease.

Amid such a federal downsizing, many states won’t be able to take on more environmental oversight responsibilities because years of budget cuts have effectively neutered their ability to manage pollution, according to EIP’s study.

Calling out the Lone Star State

While Texas isn’t alone in slashing away at its environmental protection agency, the state’s actions warrant special attention because of its brisk growth and its large concentration of polluters, according to the report.

To that point, EIP created a special case study on the state in its report. The environmental group called out Texas for:

• Cutting TCEQ’s budget at a time when the number of companies requiring air pollution expanded by 15% statewide.

• Allowing such a high turnover rate at TCEQ that, last year, 30% of its workforce had less than two years’ experience and half had less than five years’ experience.

• Enabling TCEQ — which is led by three appointees of Gov. Greg Abbott — to operate as “reluctant regulators” who encourage polluters to “self-govern and self-police,” as described in one of the state’s own reports.

In EIP’s analysis, Annalisa Peace, executive director of the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, warns that Texas’ environmental regulators don’t receive the necessary support from agency leaders to carry out their work.

“They do have a lot of people who want to do good, but [the leaders] make it very hard on them,” said Peace, who’s observed the TCEQ for roughly three decades.

If the U.S. continues to resist carbon price, we are choosing to surrender our hard-won industrial advantage.","For decades, American industry has held a quiet, underappreciated competitive advantage: On a per-unit basis, much of our heavy manufacturing — steel, aluminum, cement — is cleaner and more carbon-efficient than many of our major international rivals’. This “carbon advantage” is a powerful tool, reflecting years of technology shifts and strict local environmental regulation. But this position of leadership is fragile, and the United States risks forfeiting it entirely if we continue to ignore the global momentum toward pricing carbon. A new initiative launched at the recent COP30 makes this threat immediate and undeniable.

The new global carbon alignment

At COP30, held in Belém, Brazil, in November 2025, a group of nations formally launched the Open Coalition on Compliance Carbon Markets (the coalition), a voluntary initiative that strengthens environmental integrity by encouraging experiences-sharing. It is focused on aligning domestic carbon-pricing systems, harmonizing Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) protocols, standardizing accounting rules, and exploring long-term market interoperability. In short, the world’s major economies are taking concrete steps toward creating a unified, predictable global price signal for carbon.

The idea is rooted in rigorous policy research, building on work from the Global Climate Policy Project (GCPP) at Harvard and MIT. The GCPP’s September 2025 report outlined the potential: A voluntary coalition of nations coordinating on robust carbon-price floors could significantly cut global emissions; raise trillions in revenue for emissions-reduction and adaptation efforts; and, critically, prevent a chaotic and economically destabilizing patchwork of unilateral border measures. The coalition essentially serves as the technical and political engine for realizing the carbon-priced future the report envisioned.

During COP30, a diverse set of countries joined the new coalition. The ranks now consist of Brazil, China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Germany, Mexico, Armenia, Zambia, France, Rwanda, Andorra, Guinea, New Zealand, Monaco, Singapore, and Norway. Seven of the countries in this group account for more than two-thirds of total U.S. goods exports. They’re now working together to implement mandatory carbon pricing frameworks, incentivizing emission reduction domestically and providing a competitive edge when facing border charges on exports.

The fragility of the American advantage

The implications for U.S. energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries are staggering. Analyses from our own work and from groups such as the Climate Leadership Council have consistently shown that U.S. heavy industry is, for the moment, among the least carbon-intensive in the world. In steel, chemicals, glass, and cement, for example, the carbon intensity of U.S. production is among the lowest in the world. This is partly the result of cleaner electricity supply relative to competitors, and partly the result of relatively modern industrial facilities.

But this leadership is fragile. As countries in the Open Coalition implement carbon pricing, they create two reinforcing incentives: first, for their domestic firms to accelerate investments in clean industrial technologies; and second, for their governments to implement Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) to protect those firms from dirtier imports. Firms in those jurisdictions will begin to benefit from a combination of carbon cost signals and financial support that reward cleaner production.

The carbon cost signal to the U.S. would also be clear: If the U.S. does not adopt policies that provide similar incentives, the carbon advantage that currently benefits U.S. exporters could narrow or even disappear.

What makes this situation even more alarming — and arguably more likely — is that this global acceleration toward lower emissions comes as U.S. policy moves aggressively in the opposite direction. The Trump administration, for instance, aims to extend the life of coal-fired power plants. A recently signed executive order defines coal as a critical mineral and proposes to repeal power plant regulations like the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards and Carbon Pollution Standards. The Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy are even looking into using backup diesel generators to meet high energy demand.

These actions, by diminishing the costs of polluting, jeopardize the health of both adjacent communities and downwind states, while weakening America’s industrial-carbon advantage. As other countries increase their decarbonization efforts, U.S. policies are widening the gap, making our energy grid — and the production that relies on it — more emission-intensive and more vulnerable to trade penalties.

Understanding where plants are most vulnerable and which new tools and practices are helping remains essential as the industry braces for deeper electrification, rising load and increasingly erratic winter weather.
Top Winter Problem Areas Across North American thermal plants, EPRI sees the same winter trouble spots repeat year after year.
That has been changing since NERC introduced the EOP-012 cold weather standard.
NERC recently reported early progress in its first annual Cold Weather Data and Analysis report, submitted in October.","Are U.S. power generation owner-operators getting better at winterization and freeze protection? According to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), the answer is yes, and not by a small margin.

“Anything that you focus on like that is going to result in improvements,” said Brad Burns, program area manager for Fleet Management and Operations at EPRI.

Burns oversees research in integrated asset management, plant management essentials and cycle chemistry, three areas deeply tied to practical O&M and seasonal readiness. He said owner-operators are now taking winter preparedness more seriously after several years of severe cold events exposed long-standing weaknesses in instrumentation, insulation and plant procedures.

The improvements are measurable. Plants are investing in more structured work management processes, more frequent walkdowns and more robust engineering reviews. New technologies are entering the field. And the strong push from NERC’s cold-weather standard is forcing changes that would not have happened on their own.

But while progress is real, Burns said the job is far from complete. Understanding where plants are most vulnerable and which new tools and practices are helping remains essential as the industry braces for deeper electrification, rising load and increasingly erratic winter weather.

Top Winter Problem Areas

Across North American thermal plants, EPRI sees the same winter trouble spots repeat year after year.

“Sensing lines and instrumentation is probably the biggest one,” Burns said. These small-diameter impulse lines operate in low- or no-flow conditions, making them extremely vulnerable to freezing. Once they freeze, the consequences can be immediate.

“You can’t continue to fire a boiler without drum level. If it sees that there’s no drum level as a false indication, because the sensing line froze, guess what? Unit trip, you’re offline,” Burns said. “And it’s very difficult to get units back online in cold weather.”

Problems almost always trace back to poor insulation and heat-tracing: missing or damaged insulation, improperly installed heat-trace systems, or systems that were never sized correctly in the first place.

Cooling systems also suffer when temperatures drop. Burns cited icing in cooling towers, cooling water intakes and service-water systems, particularly when a cooling-tower cell is taken out of service and freezes solid.

Fuel and material handling add another layer of risk. Coal and limestone systems can freeze, diesel fuel can gel, and natural-gas curtailments during extreme cold create operational constraints even if equipment itself remains functional. Burns noted that more plants are moving to dual-fuel capability to maintain reliability when gas supply tightens.

Even human mobility becomes an operational constraint. Some plants require tire chains, traction gear or specialized cold-weather PPE simply to allow operators to move safely around the site and perform routine duties.

What Went Wrong During Uri/Elliott – And Why It’s Changing

During Winter Storms Uri and Elliott, heat trace systems often failed because they had never been tested under real extreme-cold conditions.

“Of course they test their systems to make sure they’re functional, but not under full load, maximum cold conditions,” said Burns.

In many cases, the only indicator of whether heat trace was functioning was a single LED light — not a true assessment of whether circuits could hold full load without tripping.

“They didn’t have any sophistication in those systems,” said Burns.

He noted that plant management was also reluctant to spend on freeze protection unless they had no choice.

“Let’s be honest here, power plants are not going to spend money on freeze protection systems when they need other critical equipment,” Burns said.

That has been changing since NERC introduced the EOP-012 cold weather standard. The rule requires owner-operators to establish cold-weather preparedness plans, perform seasonal readiness tasks, document deficiencies and prove their units can operate in extreme cold conditions.

As Burns put it, “It forced them to do it.”

The standard has led to improved CMMS usage, pre-season walkdowns, checklist discipline and engineering analyses of winter performance. NERC recently reported early progress in its first annual Cold Weather Data and Analysis report, submitted in October.

Newer Technologies EPRI Sees in the Field

While administrative improvements are important, several notable technologies are emerging that directly reduce winter risk.

One is the growing use of instrument enclosures with real-time monitoring. Instead of relying on spot checks, operators can verify heat-trace performance and enclosure temperatures from the control room.

“Having enclosures for your sensing lines, and having those enclosures monitored in real-time with temperature and things like that, that’s a whole technology that’s emerging,” Burns said.

Another trend is the adoption of guided-wave radar (GWR) for drum-level measurement, particularly in HRSGs with triple-pressure drums exposed to the elements.

“It’s basically a device that’s mounted on a chamber,” Burns said. “It sends low-energy pulses down a probe that’s reflected back up to the device, and it detects the drum level without use of sensing lines.”

These changes align with what Emerson is seeing across the industry. Marty McDonough, senior business development manager for the company’s power business, said utilities are adopting wireless temperature monitoring, acoustic sensors and non-intrusive flow meters at a pace that would have been unlikely a decade ago.

“Once you have a wireless system, then it’s easy to add monitoring points,” McDonough said. “It’s very cost advantageous once the gateways and the system are in.”

Emerson is also seeing structural changes in how drum-level measurement is specified. Historically, GWR was more of a brownfield upgrade. Today, McDonough said HRSG OEMs themselves are requesting it on new projects.

“We actually have the HRSG OEMs coming to us from the experiences of the end user, saying, ‘Hey, we want guided-wave radar here. We don’t want to do wet legs and impulse lines anymore,’” he said.

But despite regulatory pressure and technological progress, Burns noted that budgets remain tight.

“Most plants in the U.S. and North America nowadays, they’re just not swimming in cash,” he said. “They’re being forced to look at every dollar they spend, and those dollars are not going to go towards cold weather preparedness, unless they feel like it’s a real reliability risk or a compliance risk.”

But industry experts say attitudes about cold weather reliability are changing. Severe cold events have forced utilities — particularly in the South — to make winterization upgrades. McDonough said these regions are now among the most proactive in pursuing new monitoring, eliminating freeze-prone wet legs and upgrading heat-trace verification systems.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cc-pp-hrsg-winter-storm-uri.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:05:24.844778

Filing consolidated weekly entries is especially appealing for high-volume importers but comes with its own set of complexities in the current trade policy environment.
These initial trade remedy actions in 2018 were just the beginning of what is now an almost eight-year-long, increasingly complicated but fundamental change in U.S. trade policy.
Now, existing FTZ manufacturers as well as manufacturers considering the program must recalculate the savings opportunities from FTZ usage.
By Rebecca Williams, Managing Director, Rockefeller Group Foreign Trade Zone Services and Eric Dalby, VP Support, Professional Services at Descartes","In 1934, when Congress passed the Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) Act and established the FTZ program, the U.S. economy faced a policy environment similar to today’s: high (and prevalent) tariffs and heightened concern for protecting domestic industries and encouraging domestic investment. Then, as now, policymakers sought mechanisms to help U.S.-based companies stay competitive in the face of escalating costs by offsetting the burden of high tariffs.

For decades, FTZs have been used actively and on trend with overall U.S. import and export statistics, providing importers, exporters, and manufacturers with a toolkit to manage customs duties, streamline operations and bolster cash flow. Today, however, recent tariff actions on steel and aluminum that for most countries doubled to 50% under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as well as sweeping International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) reciprocal tariffs imposed on nearly all commodities from all countries, have upended global trade and shifted the FTZ landscape significantly.

As trade tensions push import duties to record highs, companies big and small are looking for ways to insulate themselves against tariff volatility and stabilize cash flow against economic uncertainty. While FTZs are resonating as a strategy to mitigate or avoid absorbing higher tariffs into operating costs, the program is not a silver bullet. Instead, FTZ participation in 2025 demands a more nuanced cost-benefit analysis that weighs the traditional advantages of FTZs compared to the current benefits against changing trade policy.

Traditional FTZ Benefits

Licensed by the U.S. FTZ Board, FTZs are secure, designated sites traditionally located within 60 miles or a 90-minute drive from a U.S. port of entry (although FTZ sites now are often located at further points as well), in which domestic and foreign merchandise (i.e., inventory) receives the same treatment by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as if it were outside the commerce of the United States. FTZs enable companies to defer, reduce or eliminate duties, depending on where goods end up (e.g., distributed domestically or exported to avoid applicable duties and taxes).

Historically, one of the most important FTZ benefits was inverted tariff relief for manufacturers. Through the Boggs Amendment of 1950 and regulatory clarifications in the 1980s, U.S. manufacturers could import higher-duty inputs, process them domestically, and release finished products into the commerce of the U.S. at lower duty rates of the finished products. This helped manufacturers reduce overall tariff costs, enhance profitability and get on more even footing with offshore manufacturers.

Put another way, it gave U.S.-based businesses federal approval to rationalize what historically was “irrational tariff treatment” in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S. (HTSUS). Irrational tariff treatment is when imported parts and materials are assessed at higher duty rates than the finished goods they are incorporated into. Without the ability to invert duty rates, companies would be financially incentivized, from a customs duty treatment perspective, to import finished goods rather than produce them domestically.

Beyond inverted tariffs, FTZs offer additional benefits:

Export relief: Goods brought in and stored or manufactured in an FTZ can be exported in bond without incurring quota charges or U.S. duties, insulating businesses from the adverse effects of tariff hikes. Plus, merchandise exported from FTZs to international customers and subsequently returned can be admitted to an FTZ for storage, repair and export again without being subject to duties.

Cash-flow benefits: The timing of when duties are paid makes a significant difference to cash flow. By deferring the payment of duties until goods leave an FTZ, companies improve working capital. By bringing the duty cost closer to when goods are sold to the customer, companies can shorten the cash cycle and optimize cash flow. Depending on how fast a business turns its inventory, this can be a critical part of a company’s ability to maintain its U.S. operations.

Weekly customs entry and Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF) savings: MPF is paid per customs entry (.3464% against the value reported on the entry) but has a maximum amount today of $651.50 with routine incremental increases each year. However, FTZs permit qualified companies to consolidate an entire week’s worth of shipments out of the FTZ into a single weekly customs entry, thereby creating the opportunity to possibly save broker entry fees and significantly reduce annual MPF spend. Filing consolidated weekly entries is especially appealing for high-volume importers but comes with its own set of complexities in the current trade policy environment.

State and local tax savings: In states that assess ad valorem tax on inventory, such as Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Puerto Rico, inventory held in FTZs may be preempted from such taxes through the federal FTZ law. Likewise, some states have codified state-level tax benefits, such as Arizona’s reduction of up to 75% for real and personal property held in FTZs. These tax exemptions and reductions—above and beyond the traditional duty benefits of the program—create additional financial incentives and help further reduce operational costs for FTZ users.

A Changing Trade Landscape

For decades, these advantages attracted a diverse mix of manufacturers and distributors into the program. In 2018, however, key tariff developments began to disrupt the global trade landscape. In January 2018, the U.S. imposed safeguard tariffs on solar panels and washing machines from all sources (except Canada) under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. In March 2018, Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum took effect, with temporary exemptions for Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and the EU. By June, however, exemptions had expired for Canada, Mexico and the EU, and Section 232 tariffs were imposed.

In April 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) released a list of 1,333 China-origin imports for proposed 25% Section 301 duties, as part of a broader and new trading strategy with the East Asian nation. Within days, China imposed retaliatory tariffs of its own on U.S. exports. By June, the USTR proposed a new list of products from China, worth $50 billion in trade, to be subject to Section 301 duties of 25%. These initial trade remedy actions in 2018 were just the beginning of what is now an almost eight-year-long, increasingly complicated but fundamental change in U.S. trade policy.

Interestingly, with the first six months of 2018 also came a pivotal shift in how FTZs function today: a change to mandating the election of Privileged Foreign (PF) status for imported merchandise at the time of admission to an FTZ, which locks in an item’s classification and duty rate on that date. For decades, imported raw materials, components and finished goods were largely admitted into FTZs in Non-privileged Foreign (NPF) status, which requires classification on the item’s condition as removed from the FTZ at the duty rate in effect on the date of entry. For FTZ manufacturers authorized by the U.S. Department of Commerce, NPF status elected for imported parts and components is what drove inverted tariff benefit (i.e., the ability to apply the finished good duty rate to the value of the parts/components consumed in the finished good). With 2018’s new tariff actions, the Administration through the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Commerce began requiring FTZ imports to be admitted in PF status. PF status “locks in” the normal, or Most Favored Nation (MFN), duties and any remedy tariff rates on goods at the time of their admission into an FTZ, which means the imported component’s duty and tariff rates apply even if the finished good made in the FTZ carries a lower duty rate.

What does this mean in practical terms? It means the inverted tariff benefit for FTZ manufacturers was essentially eliminated in April of this year when the PF status admission stipulation began applying to nearly all imported commodities from all countries of origin via IEEPA reciprocal tariffs. Now, existing FTZ manufacturers as well as manufacturers considering the program must recalculate the savings opportunities from FTZ usage. For some manufacturers, the program may continue to make sense or drive even more benefit, while for others the program may no longer make sense. Paradoxically, tariffs intended to protect U.S. jobs are simultaneously hampering some FTZ manufacturers from promoting domestic production, the original intent of the program. If the same finished product is made in another country, under IEEPA reciprocal tariffs, it still offers a lower overall tariff rate when imported than the imported parts and components used to make the finished product in the U.S. If the goal of current trade policy, however, is to reshore and nearshore manufacturing, don’t FTZ manufacturers still need the inverted tariff benefit to rationalize what is otherwise still an irrational HTSUS?

FTZ Advantages Today

What are the main advantages for FTZ users today then? For many importers, it’s cash flow: by delaying duty payments, companies can preserve capital. This benefit, however, depends heavily on inventory turnover. Large retailers cross-docking goods through distribution centers may realize little advantage as goods enter U.S. commerce within days, triggering prompt duty payments. By contrast, businesses holding inventory for weeks or months can extract more meaningful benefit from duty deferral, such as industrial distributors, seasonal retailers, or exporters awaiting foreign buyers.

In the absence of inverted tariffs, the importance of export relief has grown. Manufacturers that ship even a portion of their production abroad can typically eliminate duties altogether on exported goods. For many businesses that traditionally relied on inverted tariffs, this now represents one of the few clear savings opportunities. Additionally, some manufacturers that previously had little reason to consider FTZs are now compelled to join the program precisely to avoid duties on outbound shipments.

While tariff relief is the focus for many, ancillary benefits remain material. Although now more administratively complex, weekly entry/MPF savings continue to appeal to some while the compliance requirements may outweigh the fee savings for others. Inventory and real/personal property tax abatements are still available in states such as Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arizona and Puerto Rico, but these benefits are not guaranteed. They require negotiation with local impacted tax recipients and cannot be assumed across the board. Companies that install imported production equipment in their FTZ production facilities can also achieve duty/tariff deferral benefits on the machinery until it begins being using in production.

Looking Ahead: Uncertainty and Opportunity

The FTZ program is at a crossroads. Its historical role as an engine for tariff rationalization for U.S. manufacturers has been curtailed, but its potential as a platform for cash flow management, export relief and targeted ancillary tax savings is legitimate. In addition, pending litigation, including possible Supreme Court rulings, could dramatically reshape the tariff landscape overnight. A rollback of tariffs could potentially restore inverted tariff benefits for many industries and commodities, while new tariff exemption frameworks could offer parallel relief.

For importers and manufacturers, the shift in trade policy has forced more sophisticated supply chain analyses. Establishing and operating an FTZ requires significant time and investment in an extremely complex trade compliance environment. Understanding if setting up and operating an FTZ makes sense in the context of this complexity is not a simple exercise. For tax and finance professionals, determining whether FTZ participation will yield measurable benefit requires a more granular assessment of inventory turn rates and export volumes. Companies must model turnover rates, tariff exposures, and compliance costs in detail to decide whether an FTZ is advantageous for the organization’s unique product mix, trade patterns, and risk tolerance.

Parting Thoughts

For businesses, agility is critical. Companies must reassess FTZ participation regularly, model cash flow implications under various scenarios, and assess measures for ancillary benefits, including engaging with local authorities on property and inventory tax opportunities where appropriate.

For policymakers grappling with the challenge of reconciling tariff policy with industrial strategy, FTZs may represent an underused tool. In an era when tariff policies are used both as protectionist levers and geopolitical instruments, FTZs provide a stable, regulated framework for balancing trade governance with competitiveness.

FTZs are not loopholes. They are highly regulated, overseen by U.S. CBP and the Department of Commerce, and subject to annual reviews and public interest considerations for manufacturers. In many ways, they are better suited to provide equitable tariff mitigation than ad hoc exemption processes. A 2019 econometric study conducted by The Trade Partnership titled The U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Program: Economic Benefits to American Communities quantified that—all else being equal—employment, wages, and value-added activity are higher in areas with FTZs than similar areas without FTZs, and that a company’s access to FTZ benefits has substantial positive ripple effects throughout its U.S. supply chain.

And so, as they were conceived, FTZs are an effective mechanism for encouraging domestic manufacturing and facilitating global competitiveness.

December 11, 2025

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) launched the Clean Air Act Resource for Data Centers webpage to provide data center developers, local communities and Tribes with a central location for Clean Air Act (CAA)-related resources. These additional resources further two core pillars of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative—making America the artificial intelligence (AI) capital of the world and advancing cooperative federalism.

Looking exclusively through the lens of the CAA, OAR’s specific new resources provide state and private sector partners with regulatory information, guidance and technical tools that can assist with modeling, air quality permitting, and regulatory interpretations relevant for data centers and AI facility development.

This webpage and EPA’s CAA reforms provide transparency for data centers and AI development across the U.S., speeding up the ability to build data centers and the necessary backup generation. These efforts will help decrease the cost of new facilities while preserving the reliability of our electrical grid and keeping electricity rates down. This ultimately will reduce the cost-of-living for Americans who rely on data centers and AI for their daily lives—from ensuring food at the grocery store to photos on their phones.

“The global race to harness the power of artificial intelligence and build data centers is underway. President Trump’s AI Action Plan made it clear; we need to win that race and establish America as the home for of the next great technological forefront,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “EPA is diligently working to eliminate burdensome regulations and ensure data centers and related facilities can be built in the U.S. as we Power the Great American Comeback. Developers, local communities and Tribes will now have easy access to the tools they need to build big, beautiful data centers and AI facilities.”

“Good rulemaking and policies must be coupled with sound public knowledge regarding regulations. As EPA works to enact policy that helps make America the AI capital of the world, our new webpage provides an essential resource to those looking to understand the current regulations,” said EPA Assistant Administrator for Air Aaron Szabo. “OAR is pleased to be able to respond directly to the request from developers, local communities and Tribes who have been asking for these resources since day one. EPA is committed to following the law and helping Americans do the same.”

Many of the current CAA requirements that impact the building of data centers date back to the 1990s when the available technology was vastly different. Historically, these rules ensure companies maintain proper pollution control. However, many of these requirements have not been updated to reflect technological advancements of the 21st century. The digital revolution has ushered in new needs and new industries, which demand a holistic approach from EPA to update rules and further cooperative federalism in this rapidly growing space. As EPA continues to advance rulemaking to streamline permitting and end overly burdensome Biden-era requirements that stunted the development of data centers and AI facilities, the following tools will provide much needed guidance and clarity on the current CAA rules as developers, local communities and Tribes navigate this uncharted territory.

OAR’s webpage is broken up into the following sections:

Regulator Resources: Power sources are a major concern for planning data center and AI infrastructure. This section provides links to information on rules that apply to stationary combustion turbines and stationary engines—common sources of primary and backup power for data centers—and which are subject to various new source performance standards for certain air emissions and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants. Before building, it is important to understand the regulations in place.

Air Permitting Resources: This section houses EPA guidance documents, letters responding to permitting requests, and interpretations of permitting regulations. Understanding how EPA has handled permitting in the past based on the agency’s statutory obligations will allow those looking to develop data centers and AI facilities to see what permitting requirements they may face.

Modeling Guidance Documents: Over the years, EPA has released several modeling guidance documents and clarification memoranda that help developers show compliance with CAA air quality standards as they build. In this section, users will find EPA’s Guideline on Air Quality Models which provides models, tools, and methods to use when dealing with CAA regulatory air quality requirements and lists the agency’s preferred air quality models for use in the Prevent of Significant Deterioration (PSD) programs. There are also modeling resources to assist with permit applications and showing compliance.

In addition, and in line with EPA’s commitment to advance cooperative federalism, EPA’s OAR staff will also be available to consult with permit reviewing authorities and individual sources on a case-by-case basis. OAR will update the webpage to reflect the most up to date CAA regulations and guidance material available.

OPINION – Just a few miles from downtown Los Angeles, the Sterigenics sterilization facility in Vernon poses a silent threat to surrounding communities. The plant uses ethylene oxide (EtO), a toxic gas classified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a known human carcinogen, to sterilize medical equipment. Yet, many residents are not aware of the dangers of what they’ve been breathing for years.

In 2016, the EPA determined that EtO is up to 60 times more carcinogenic than previously believed, but the agency didn’t issue a public warning. When the 2018 updated National Air-Toxics Assessment finally revealed cancer-risk hotspots around sterilization plants nationwide, it was too late for many. In places like Willowbrook, Illinois, and Laredo, Texas, modeled cancer risks reached 6,400 per million people, more than 60 times the acceptable federal threshold.

In Vernon, the story bears striking similarities. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) identified the Sterigenics facility as a “Potentially High-Risk Level Facility.” While the agency requested an “Early Action Reduction Plan” in 2022, including emission monitoring and temporary shutdowns, these measures were implemented years after residents had already been exposed.

For all the communities living near the Vernon facility, this contamination is a personal issue far more than just an environmental problem. Ethylene oxide doesn’t just vanish once released. It lingers in the air and builds up in the body over time, increasing risk for breast cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.

According to an EtO exposure map, Maywood, for instance, lies at the very center of the life-threatening emissions from the Vernon plant. In 2025 alone, the ongoing legal action against Sterigenics in Illinois resulted in 97 settlements, totaling over $30 million in payments to plaintiffs. This precedent can become an incentive for Maywood’s community in their pursuit of justice and compensation.

This crisis persists mainly due to loopholes in the EPA’s regulations. Many EtO facilities operate under Clean Air Act exemptions that allow them to avoid the modern pollution controls required of other industrial emitters.

The EPA’s 2024 rule for sterilization facilities introduced stricter EtO limits and requires leak detection, but it comes after years of delay. Still, enforcement remains uncertain, and oversight is split among federal, state, and local agencies, leaving gaps that companies can exploit. Even now, local regulators like the SCAQMD can monitor, investigate, and fine facilities, but have no authority to provide health screenings, relocation assistance, or compensation for affected families. The result is a patchwork system where accountability often blurs into bureaucracy.

Los Angeles needs actions focused on community well-being, not corporate convenience. First, federal institutions must enforce continuous air monitoring at every EtO facility and ensure public access to real-time data. People living near these potentially hazardous plants need to be constantly informed about the air quality they breathe.

Moreover, the Clean Air Act loopholes that exempt older plants from modern controls must be permanently closed. These exemptions were designed for exceptional cases that prioritize national security and were not meant to be granted loosely without consideration for the communities affected by toxic exposure.

Lastly, but most importantly, the at-risk areas need immediate medical screenings and state-funded cancer registries. This way, the federal government will finally gain a clear picture of this crisis and begin providing timely treatments and compensation to the affected people.

Los Angeles residents deserve transparency, justice, and, most of all, clean air. The EPA’s silence has already cost lives and trust. It’s time for decisive federal and state action to ensure that no one must wonder whether their next breath will turn them into cancer patients.

As carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects take off in the U.S., more states are seeking primary enforcement responsibilities to issue and enforce Class VI injection well permits, known as primacy. State primacy is seen as a method to streamline well permitting and allow for greater local government control. On November 12th, 2025, the EPA announced that it had approved Texas’s Class VI injection well primary enforcement application, joining a cohort of five other states with Class VI primacy: Wyoming, North Dakota, Arizona, Louisiana, and West Virginia. In this Insight, we dive into the process by which states apply for primary enforcement responsibilities, discuss the implications of primacy for the industry through the lens of Texas and Louisiana, and spotlight the expected approval timeline for Class VI permit applications still under EPA administration.

Getting Primacy

Class VI wells are used for the geologic sequestration of anthropogenic CO2. To receive primary enforcement, states must follow a four-phase process outlined by the EPA, shown below. There are currently eight states working through various phases of the approval process; of active applications, Colorado is the sole state that has progressed into Phase III, with all other states working on Pre-Application activities at Phase I. Once primacy is reached, the EPA will hand over any Class VI permit applications currently in review to the state. Of the six states with primacy, three (West Virginia, Arizona, and Texas) were granted primacy in 2025.

Permit Pause in Louisiana

Among states that have been granted primacy, Texas and Louisiana present two contrasting approaches to the program’s rollout in 2025. Like Texas, Louisiana has garnered attention for CCS projects primarily owing to its siting near major energy corridors and favorable local geology. While Texas begins the process of accepting and reviewing all Class VI permit applications, Louisiana has paused new Class VI application submissions for the near future and is instead focusing on five priority sequestration projects. This pause comes just under two years after receiving primacy in December 2023. Louisiana is currently working through a backlog of 33 Class VI well applications.

In his October 2025 executive order issuing the moratorium, Louisiana Governor Landry stated that the pause will allow for a balanced approach that considers the concerns of citizens, streamlines the permitting process, and ensures environmental due diligence. However, the pause could prove to be untimely. Contrary to most other energy transition technologies, CCS continues to benefit from bipartisan support at the federal level. This, and the fact that the pause has no explicit end date, has raised concerns among industry leaders and investors in the state that capital could be redirected to other states with active and efficient primacy programs.

Texas Chugging Along

While states continue to develop the best approach for their programs, the EPA continues to review and grant Class VI injection applications with a target turnaround of 24 months. Of the 70 Class VI applications currently in review, 18 will be transferred to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), the regulatory body responsible for overseeing Class VI applications in the state. This should go a long way towards increasing the EPA’s permitting efficiency. Notably, the RRC has stated that they anticipate Class VI applications in Texas to be reviewed in just six months, with another six-month waiting period before injection can begin. Other states with multiple sequestration projects, like California, Illinois, and Indiana, have not indicated that they will be pursuing primacy at this time, relying solely on the EPA’s approval process.

Going forward

As more states apply for and are granted primacy, stakeholders will watch closely to see how state-led programs influence project development, regulatory efficiency, and a broader path to decarbonization in the United States. Louisiana’s decision to pause application processing introduces some uncertainty to the industry even as it attempts to shore up its primacy process. Texas’s one-year turnaround for Class VI applications is ambitious and could signal strength to investors if achieved with regularity. However, states not pursuing primacy could also stand to benefit from permitting efficiency gains as the EPA’s backlog is cleared.

Wealthy coal plant owners – like NRG and Luminant – now have permission to avoid installing readily available, common-sense pollution controls and move forward with spewing more toxic emissions into the air.

The EPA decision withdraws a strong federal rule for Texas, finalized during the Obama Administration, that would have required upgraded or new pollution control equipment to be installed at 15 of Texas’s dirtiest coal units (see list below). In its place, Trump’s EPA approved a regional haze plan from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that would require no pollution reductions. EPA also approved a different yet related regional haze plan from the Texas government that would likewise require zero pollution reductions from massive polluters.

Regional haze impairs visibility in natural spaces and national parks. It is produced when large industrial sources, especially coal-burning power plants, emit harmful pollution that mixes with sunlight. The Clean Air Act calls for states to propose their own plans for reducing regional haze, and if those aren’t adequate, EPA is required to implement its own federal plans that comply with the law. In Texas, haze plans from TCEQ – whose commissioners have all been appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott – have consistently been so weak they would do nothing to reduce haze in any meaningful way.

Statement from Emma Pabst, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Manager

“For the last 20 years, Texas and EPA failed to properly implement the Clean Air Act’s requirements to reduce haze pollution in Texas, and today’s decision makes clear that both care little about clear skies on our public lands. Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants, and TCEQ and EPA have an obligation to reduce emissions from these facilities. But both agencies continue to blatantly disregard public input and show us – again and again – that our skies and our health aren’t important to them, especially when it comes to giving wealthy donors a pass to pollute. Americans are getting sicker, and this Administration is paving the way.”

If we can do it for the Everglades, we should be able to do it on other important issues that touch all Americans.","By Chelsea Henderson, republicEn.org

Twenty-five years ago this week, history was made when the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was signed into law after years of negotiation between the U.S. Congress, the Clinton administration and the state of Florida. This $8 billion (at the time) agreement solidified a federal-state partnership to preserve the greater Everglades ecosystem, which had been stressed by decades of water flow manipulation, unhealthy agricultural practices and unchecked urban development.

CERP was the top priority of my boss at the time, Sen. Bob Smith, a Republican from New Hampshire who called the intricate ecosystem “America’s Everglades,” an attempt in part to convey to his constituents nearly 1,500 miles away that his attention on this crown jewel was warranted.

As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which led the charge on authorizing the extensive components of the CERP, Smith set the tone for the proceedings. That started with his declaration at a Jan. 7, 2000, field hearing in Naples, Florida, that there was “no daylight” between him and the late John Chafee, his predecessor and the former EPW Committee chair with a reputation as a strong environmentalist.

The standing room only crowd cheered.

The fate of the Everglades and attempts to pass this historic restoration effort had been in question after the unexpected death of Chafee, who had been on the record as a strong proponent of the project. But the staunchly conservative Smith quickly nipped those fears in the bud and kicked off a robust set of hearings and negotiations that lasted most of the year.

CERP was being negotiated as a key part of the Water Resources Development Act, the biennial bill authorizing projects under the scope of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Ironically, the Corps was responsible for many of the issues facing the ecosystem, harkening back to a day when we prioritized development over ecosystems. But the Corps would be critical to restoring the ecosystem back to some better version of its original glory.

Enactment of the CERP was no small feat. Appropriately so; given the cost and the environmental and economic ramifications, it shouldn’t have been easy to push through Congress like many of today’s big bills. This was an era when congressional committees did due diligence to the landmark legislation they drafted.

This was an era of bipartisanship.

And looking at the accomplishment through today’s bitter political lens, passing the Everglades legislation bipartisanly feels even more remarkable. What truly made this effort special was the level of commitment from Republicans and Democrats alike to seeing the project through to the day, Dec. 11, 2000, when President Bill Clinton signed it into law.

Next to him stood an array of lawmakers across the political spectrum, including Smith, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sens. Bob Graham and Connie Mack of Florida, and most of the Florida congressional delegation. Spirits were high. Witnessing this signing is easily a top-three career moment for me personally.

But Dec. 11, 2000, isn’t just in the history books as the day the CERP was enacted. In fact, probably only a handful of us who were there at the time even remember the specific date. Dec. 11 was also the day the Supreme Court heard arguments in Bush v. Gore. But even the divisive 2000 election didn’t crush the bipartisan will to get the Everglades restoration done or the amity between the lawmakers (and staff) present for the signing.

2025 can take a lesson from 2000. We aren’t always going to agree, but we can still conduct ourselves with grace, kindness and respect without sacrificing tenacity. If we can do it for the Everglades, we should be able to do it on other important issues that touch all Americans.

The split marks a reset for one of the major U.S. electric vehicle battery partnerships, coming as slowing EV demand and the loss of U.S. subsidies push South Korean battery makers to reshape their U.S. strategies and accelerate expansion into the energy storage systems business.

SK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, which supplies automakers including Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp, said a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will assume full ownership and operate the Tennessee plant.

""The production start schedule for the Tennessee plant remains flexible at this time, as it is related to the ownership transition,"" SK On said.

In 2022, SK On and Ford invested $11.4 billion to build the joint battery plants in the United States.

SK On said the move reflected a strategic overhaul of assets and capacity aimed at enabling it to respond more quickly to market changes, accelerate its North American energy storage system business, and strengthen productivity and cost competitiveness in its battery operations.

The company said the restructuring is expected to improve its financial structure and profitability by sharply reducing debt and cutting fixed costs.

SK On posted an operating loss of 124.8 billion won ($84.72 million) for the July-September period, nearly double the 66.4 billion won loss in the previous quarter due to slowing EV battery shipments.

In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that electric-car sales could fall by around 50 per cent following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers.

SK On has been expanding into the energy storage system business to offset weaker EV demand. In September, the company signed a deal with U.S.-based Flatiron Energy Development to supply lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for energy storage systems.

Other South Korean battery makers, including LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, have also been repurposing EV battery production lines to produce energy storage systems due to the phasing out of U.S. subsidies.

Energy storage batteries have a similar chemistry to automotive batteries and are used to power facilities such as data centres.

Original announcement link Source: Great British Energy","The £1 billion Energy Engineered in the UK (EEUK) programme will mobilise public and private investment to unlock critical supply chains and create thousands of skilled jobs.

As part of this programme, GBE is opening its £300 million GBE Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks, designed to tackle urgent bottlenecks in key components such as blades, turbines, transmission cables and converter stations.

This investment will build manufacturing capacity and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of offshore wind deployment and electricity network innovation.

The fund is a key part of the UK Government's modern Industrial Strategy which sets out a ten-year plan to boost investment, create good skilled jobs and make Britain the best place to do business.

GBE will work alongside partners including the National Wealth Fund, Scottish National Infrastructure Bank, and The Crown Estate to unlock financing for large-scale manufacturing projects.

To cement the UK’s position as a global leader in deepwater offshore wind, GBE is also establishing a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme in partnership with FLOWEX, bringing together industry leaders to unlock the industrial opportunity from the next frontier of offshore wind deployment.

With strong public backing and collaboration across government and industry, Energy Engineered in the UK will deliver:

High-value manufacturing capacity in the UK

Skilled, well-paid jobs for communities across the country

A resilient supply chain for future low-carbon technologies

Great British Energy CEO, Dan McGrail, said: 'Great British Energy is investing in British industry, we are helping to create jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring clean energy infrastructure is built here in the UK. This programme is about more than funding; it will help overcome the current challenges and ensure the benefits of a world-class supply chain are felt in communities across the country.'

Energy Minister, Michael Shanks, said: 'We want our clean energy future to be built here in Britain as part of our modern Industrial Strategy. This fund will boost our manufacturing capabilities for offshore wind – supporting jobs and growth in communities across the country.'

Great British Energy Director of Supply Chains, Rob Gilbert, said: 'Energy, Engineered in the UK, is a national initiative to drive down technology costs, crowd in private finance, and use our unique role between the public and private sector to support structured market interventions. This programme will help the UK energy sector to learn collectively, scale deliberately, and compete globally – not just on cost, but on homegrown, long-term capability. This will create jobs, economic growth, and energy security for all areas of the UK.'

Background

The £300m GBE Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks scheme Guidance and link to the online application portal will be available on the Great British Energy website from Thursday morning, along with other supporting documents.

Great British Energy’s £1 Billion funding for clean energy supply chains was announced earlier this as part of the Industrial Strategy launch

EEUK will invest an initial £300 million in grant funding for supply chains through the Great British Energy (GBE) Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind and Networks, and will invest a further £700 million in renewable energy supply chains within this parliament. This will ensure the clean energy revolution is built in Britain, bringing GBE’s total contribution up to £1 billion.

Further detail on the £700 million will be announced next year, including through the launch of an Investment Fund in Summer 2026.

As part of EEUK, Great British Energy (GBE) is today confirming the development of a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme – a whole-value-chain approach to accelerate the deployment of floating wind and other deepwater technologies (“deepwater wind”), with the consideration of a competition on deepwater wind foundations and supporting serialisation as the initial areas of focus. In partnership with FLOWEX to advance floating offshore wind, the programme will set out clear next steps, timelines and delivery pathways that demonstrate GBE’s long-term commitment to the sector and to a system-wide approach to cost optimisation and UK industrial value creation. Guided by an expert team, this initiative will shape commercialisation pathways, reduce technology costs, kickstart supply chain investment and establish the UK as a global leader in deepwater offshore wind.

The programme will accelerate modularisation and standardisation of manufacturing, delivering cost reductions across the value chain, while working with partners across the sector, including wind turbine Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Working with such partners, the programme will develop commercial structures and demand signals that provide predictable, bankable markets for UK-made foundations, giving investors confidence to commit to long-term capability building.

Urban mobility in practice: where the Mini EV shines The Mini EV wasn't designed for high-speed cross-country driving.
However, in terms of sales volume during certain periods in China, the Mini EV has already surpassed the Model 3.","The Chinese Mini EV, which costs just over an iPhone, is already being touted as the world's cheapest electric car and raises an uncomfortable question for the industry: why is urban mobility still so expensive in much of the world?

In a market where a brand-new car is often synonymous with luxury, the emergence of an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone seems unattainable, but it's not. In the R$25 to R$30 range, the Mini EV shows that it's possible to have an affordable, functional electric car designed for city driving, breaking with the notion that electric vehicles are only for the wealthy, corporate fleets, or early adopters.

At the same time, this electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, is not just a curious product: it has become a global case study. The Mini EV outsold the Tesla Model 3 at various times in China.It is manufactured on a large scale, targets very short-range urban mobility, and proves that there is pent-up demand for simple, compact, and affordable solutions.

How did the electric car that costs little more than an iPhone come about?

The idea behind this electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, is straightforward: to meet the needs of those who require a basic urban vehicle, without luxury, but with the essentials for everyday life. Instead of betting on giant SUVs, movie screens on the dashboard, and excessive power, the Mini EV is born with a different priority: It should fit in the budget of someone who buys a premium smartphone today, not a car that costs R$ 150.

The Mini EV is the result of a partnership between Wuling, General Motors, and a Chinese giant in the sector, combining industrial scale, mastery of electric technology, and a production chain optimized for low cost. The result is a car that, in its simplest configuration, costs less than $6, or about R$25 to R$30, a price that positions it as the cheapest electric car in the world today.

In terms of its proposition, it doesn't try to compete with mid-size sedans, luxury SUVs, or high-performance models. The focus is entirely on urban mobility.: short trips, daily use in dense urban centers, easy parking, and sufficient range for a typical city routine.

Mini EV: the world's cheapest electric car that became a pop icon.

The full name is Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, but the world ended up shortening it to Mini EV. Despite its tiny size, the impact was enormous. It became the cheapest electric car in the world and, at the same time, a style icon among young Chinese people.

The Mini EV offers versions for two or four people, a single electric motor, and a typical range of... 120 to 170 km in urban use and rechargeable using a standard 220V outlet.

No superchargers, no complex infrastructure. The idea is: you get home, plug the car in, and the next day it's ready for another cycle of short trips.

What's surprising is how this inexpensive electric car has taken on a life of its own in pop culture. It's customized with stickers, flashy paint jobs, neon lights, and even kits that simulate Lamborghini-style doors.

The Mini EV has become an object of personal expression. At urban mobility events in China, it's common to see ""mini EVs"" competing to see who has the most creative design.

For a product conceived as an essential urban mobility solution, this transformation into a desirable item demonstrates its widespread appeal. Instead of simply being ""the cheapest electric car in the world,"" it has become a symbol of a new way to move around cities.

How is it possible to have a electric car That cheap?

The inevitable question is: how can an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone be viable? The answer lies in the combination of three factors: extreme simplicity, industrial scale, and a total focus on cost.

First, The Mini EV delivers only what is essential.The seats are simple, the finishes are functional, the dashboard is digital but basic, and many features considered ""convenience"" in other cars are replaced by cheap solutions.

Instead of a sophisticated multimedia center, there's smartphone support. Air conditioning is present, but without any technological frills.

Secondly, the Chinese production chain allows for the large-scale manufacturing of this inexpensive electric car, with a more competitive workforce and tax benefits geared towards electrification.

The Chinese government has been subsidizing electric vehicles for years, which helps to reduce the final price and encourage mass adoption.

Third, the Mini EV is extremely lightweight and compact. This reduces the amount of materials used and allows Smaller batteries, which are precisely the most expensive part of any electric car.

Less weight, less battery, less cost. The result is an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone, while still fulfilling the basic promise of transporting people safely in urban environments.

Urban mobility in practice: where the Mini EV shines

The Mini EV wasn't designed for high-speed cross-country driving. Its natural habitat is urban mobility: narrow streets, scarce parking spaces, short commutes, and heavy traffic. In dense cities, An inexpensive, small, and easy-to-park electric car offers obvious advantages.

For those who live and work in the same area of ​​the city, a range of 120 to 170 km is more than enough.

Charging via a standard wall outlet solves the problem for those who don't have access to fast charging networks. And the cost of energy is much lower than that of gasoline, which reinforces its economic appeal.

In the context of urban mobility, this electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, offers another benefit: silence and zero local pollutant emissions.

In cities with increasingly polluted air and constant traffic jams, Every inexpensive electric car that replaces a combustion engine vehicle helps reduce noise and polluting gases.

Therefore, the Mini EV is often cited as a living laboratory of what a city with more compact electric vehicles could look like, designed not for showing off, but to solve everyday commutes in a simple way.

The threat to major automakers and the Tesla effect.

When people talk about electric cars, many automatically think of Tesla. However, in terms of sales volume during certain periods in China, the Mini EV has already surpassed the Model 3.

And this sends a clear message to the industry: There's a huge market of people who don't want luxury, they just want a cheap electric car that works.

Traditional automakers like Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault, Toyota, and others have accelerated their electric compact car projects, trying to occupy this space before it is dominated by ultra-cheap solutions from China.

Citroën, for example, launched the AMI, an urban electric microcar. But in markets like Brazil, it still costs over R$100, a far cry from the proposition of an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone.

The Mini EV, with its crushing price tag, is forcing the entire industry to rethink costs, platforms, and even the logic of profit per unit.

If it's possible to make the world's cheapest electric car with a well-defined, essential package, why do so many models still cost double or triple? This is the question that bothers the boards of directors of car manufacturers.

Would an electric car that costs little more than an iPhone work in Brazil?

From an urban mobility standpoint, the Mini EV would be a perfect fit for cities like São Paulo, Curitiba, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, or Recife. Short distances, heavy traffic, tight parking spaces, and high fuel costs create the perfect scenario for an affordable electric car.

The problem is that the current Mini EV model wasn't designed to meet Brazilian standards. It still doesn't meet all local safety requirements, such as front airbags and stability control, and it lacks Inmetro certification to be driven as a passenger vehicle here. In other words, the world's cheapest electric car is still facing regulatory hurdles.

Some import companies are already studying adapted versions, with reinforcements and additional security systems, to try to make something similar viable in the domestic market.

If this happens at a competitive price, an electric car costing little more than an iPhone could explode in adoption and put significant pressure on the entry-level segment, where today a basic combustion engine car easily exceeds R$ 80.

What the Mini EV reveals about the future of urban mobility.

Ultimately, the Mini EV is less about itself and more about what it reveals. He proves that the future doesn't have to be made up only of giant, expensive cars full of screens.

This shows that there is room for a new generation of small, affordable electric vehicles that are deeply connected to real urban mobility, not just the idea of ​​status.

An inexpensive electric car like this, comparable in price to a top-of-the-line smartphone, reveals a shift in mindset: perhaps it doesn't make sense to pay a fortune for a vehicle that sits idle most of the time and travels, on average, only a few kilometers a day.

The electric car, which costs little more than an iPhone, opens the door to a broader discussion about consumption, cities, public transportation, bike lanes, micromobility, and urban planning.

If such an inexpensive solution already exists and works on a large scale in another country, the issue ceases to be technological and becomes one of politics, regulation, and business model.

And those paying attention to this transformation realize that the Mini EV may be just the first of many. As new generations of compact electric cars emerge, with greater safety, better finish, and still a low price, the pressure on the current mobility model is likely to increase.

If the world's cheapest electric car is already a reality, the remaining question is simple: What is preventing our cities and our laws from truly enabling this more accessible urban mobility?",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Carro-eletrico-que-custa-menos-que-um-iPhone-vira-fenomeno-mundial-Mini-EV-com-custo-por-volta-de-R-25-mil-desafia-montadoras-vende-mais-que-Tesla-na-China-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 13:03:44.020233

Offshore wind creates good union jobs, provides reliable energy, and makes our environment healthier and our air cleaner.","A federal judge has vacated President Donald Trump’s executive memorandum, lifting the pause on federal permitting for wind energy projects in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by over a dozen state attorneys general and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Several state-based climate jobs coalitions filed an amicus brief supporting the lawsuit. The brief described workers’ and labor unions’ extensive investments of their time and resources to train for the offshore wind energy sector, which promises to be a large and growing source of domestic jobs.

This legal decision is a major victory in efforts to deliver clean power to communities across America.

“As energy demand rises and utility bills are burdening working families, we need reliable, domestic energy sources that keep the lights on and provide family-sustaining jobs for our communities,” said Climate Jobs Massachusetts in a statement. “Offshore wind projects have created thousands of jobs in Massachusetts alone, and our union members have invested millions of dollars to train workers in specialized skills for building them. With several more projects ready to go, the wind industry will bring thousands more family-sustaining jobs to Massachusetts, as long as the federal government issues the necessary permits. This ruling is an important step towards green-lighting the clean energy projects our region desperately needs. We thank Attorney General Campbell for her leadership in standing up for workers and the clean energy projects that will benefit our communities in countless ways.”

“President Trump’s unpopular and illegal wind ban undercut the ability of Maine and New England to become energy independent and stabilize electricity prices for working families. It left nearly completed wind projects abandoned offshore in other parts of New England, stalled critical port development in Maine, laid off thousands of workers, and kept a large amount of clean power off of the grid that could have brought hundreds of millions of dollars of savings to households across the region. Union members in Maine invested in specialized training to prepare for offshore wind – training made possible by hundreds of thousands of dollars in union-backed workforce development. These workers are ready to build the next generation of clean, reliable power. Political interference took those job opportunities away,” said the Maine Labor Climate Council. “We thank Attorney General Aaron Frey and the coalition of attorneys general for their leadership in holding the federal government accountable and defending a clean energy future that benefits working people.”

Climate Jobs Rhode Island stated, “This decision protects good union jobs, years of workforce training, and the future of a clean-energy industry that Rhode Island workers have helped build from the ground up. Climate Jobs Rhode Island joined our regional labor partners in filing an amicus brief to show exactly what was at stake: the livelihoods of skilled workers who trained, worked, and sacrificed to make offshore wind real in our state. Today’s ruling means those workers can keep doing what they do best, building America’s energy future with union skill, safety, and pride. Thank you to AG Peter Neronha for standing with workers and defending our state’s future. We are ready to keep building.”

In Rhode Island, the federal government is also waging separate challenges to Revolution Wind, a 704-MW offshore wind project set to power 350,000 New England homes and support over 1,000 jobs. The federal government issued a stop work order on the project in August 2025, and while a subsequent federal court ruling allowed construction to resume, workers remain uneasy about the future of their jobs. Climate Jobs Rhode Island and the Rhode Island AFL-CIO recently released a video featuring workers on the project.

Climate Jobs New York also jointly announced with environmental groups the delivery of more than 14,000 petition signatures from New Yorkers urging continued advancement of wind project permitting and offshore wind development. The signatures, collected through collaborative organizing efforts, signal that New Yorkers clearly understand the value of offshore wind for jobs, energy costs, and the environment.

“New York’s offshore wind industry is creating thousands of family-sustaining union jobs, strengthening local economies, and building a more resilient energy system,” said Esther Rosario, Executive Director of Climate Jobs NY. “This ruling brings much-needed stability to the permitting process and to the lives of the workers across our state who depend on these projects. The public’s strong support shows how urgent it is to continue to move forward.”

“This decision is a victory for Ironworkers in Maryland and our brothers and sisters from across the labor movement. For years, we in labor have known that offshore wind is a critical piece of our energy future, and accordingly, we have invested heavily in training our members to work in this industry,” said Kendall Martin, President of the Ironworkers District Council of the Mid-Atlantic States. “This week’s legal victory is an important step toward ensuring that training will continue to be put to use. Offshore wind creates good union jobs, provides reliable energy, and makes our environment healthier and our air cleaner. As energy demand is skyrocketing and costs are burdening families, we need to bring as much domestic, affordable power online as possible. Offshore wind is ready to provide that power. Let’s get back to work building it.”

Part of the problem is the inherent complexity of these kinds of projects, like data centers and first-of-a-kind plants. But there’s another problem: the companies that actually build these projects — called EPC firms for engineering, procurement, and construction — often lack strong incentives to control costs or deliver on time.

That’s the thesis behind Unlimited Industries, a new startup focused on using AI to develop multiple project designs upfront and reduce project risks. So what would it take to actually cut costs and shorten construction timelines?

In this episode, Shayle talks to Alex Modon, co-founder and CEO of Unlimited Industries. The company recently announced a $12 million fundraise as it emerged from stealth. Shayle and Alex cover topics like:

Tag: Latitude Media, covering the new frontier of the energy transition.

Shayle Kann: I’m Shayle Kann and this is Catalyst.

Alex Modon: As a third party contractor, your incentive is really, we only make money when the project costs more and takes longer. So yeah, high level what’s broken is it’s the incentive structure.

Shayle Kann: Coming up: Is there a better way using modern technology to build big capital projects?

I’m Shayle Kann. I lead the early stage venture strategy at Energy Impact Partners. Welcome. All right, so here’s a cycle that I have seen play out many, many times. Developer X of project Y wants to go build a big new project and somewhere in the development process they engage in EPC, EPC being an engineering, procurement, construction firm, there are many of them. Many of them are very, very large and they’re kind of ubiquitous. If you’re going to build the big capital project, they engage the EPC and then there’s a fairly painful process from there on where it’s slower than they want it to be. They have to go through multiple cycles of iteration. There’s a value engineering, the cost comes in higher than they expect, and then at the end of the day, a bunch of change orders anyway. And there are cost overruns, there are time overruns.

It’s not necessarily the fault of the EPC, right? Lots of things can happen in the world, but the process of actually getting big projects constructed is notoriously hard, and some folks have been wondering whether there’s a way to leverage modern technology, AI included, to do it better. Certainly that is the opinion of Alex Modan, who is our guest today. Alex is the CEO and co-founder of Unlimited Industries, which is a startup that recently unstealthed to basically be a modern EPC. They’re trying to start from scratch to build a company that will do engineering, procurement and construction with new technology, with a different business model to try to get projects built faster, more on budget, potentially cheaper. It’s an interesting question and it applies to everything from data centers to power generation projects, battery storage projects, new chemical plants, anything that we might build that’s a big capital project, so it’s relevant to basically everything else that we talk about here. Anyway, here’s Alex.

Alex, welcome.

Alex Modon: Hello. Thanks for having me.

Shayle Kann: Thanks for being here. Let’s talk about EPC, engineering, procurement construction. You founded a company based on the premise that it could be done better, so I want to start with what’s wrong with it today. As you’ve observed EPCs and how they work fundamentally, what is the problem that you see?

Alex Modon: Yeah, well, it might be first contextualizing the what is EPC and where does it play in the value chain? So to start this, let’s just imagine we’re going to build, I don’t know, let’s just say a data center project. So if we want to go build a data center project as an owner of a project or a developer of a project, the first thing that we do is we kind of find the land and we contract that and we start to figure out what permits we need. We figure out what power we need to buy, and then you typically go find an offtaker or some sort of tenant for that actual data center project or again, whatever the product is that comes out of the facility, the last big contract that you’re trying to do is go find the third party that’s going to design and build the thing.

EPC, engineering, procurement construction is basically the vertically integrated or all three of the design, manage the supply chain, actually manage the build of the project, all three of those in one contractor. And for all intents and purposes, they are the people who design and build the thing that EPC piece. And so I think when I got into it, I was actually really excited the first time we went to go work with an EPC thinking that there’s going to be all these different kind of disciplines and institutional knowledge under one shingle. I think the biggest thing that’s challenged with the industry today is that the incentives between the developer, the person who actually wants to build the thing better, faster, cheaper, or some sort of metric like that versus the third party, the incentives are so fundamentally misaligned because of how these contracts get produced. You either have, the vast majority of these contracts have some element of cost plus where we’ll give some sort of guidance about how much the project’s going to cost.

But as a third party contractor, your incentive is really, we only make money when the project costs more and takes longer. Or there’s sometimes these contracts that run on a fixed firm basis where that third party will actually say, Hey, we will build it for this much, but they define the contract so tightly that inevitably what happens is when you learn something through the design process or when things change, which inevitably they always do, you get issued these massive change orders and at that point that’s where that third party EPC typically makes all their margin just because you’re already working together and you can’t really easily leave. So yeah, high level what’s broken is it’s the incentive structure, the incentives between the third party or the actual developer who wants to build better, faster, cheaper, and the third party who’s in control of making all the decisions about what gets designed and what actually gets built.

Shayle Kann: If I’m being charitable to EPCs, and I asked the question of why is it cost plus typically or fixed firm, but where change orders are the norm, I would imagine in part it is because there’s one, there’s this time lag, right? There’s signing the contract on day one, but they’re actually procuring the commodity materials six months later, a year later, 18 months later, whatever it might be. Those prices are volatile. They would have to hedge them every single time if they weren’t going to do that. Not to mention labor availability and labor costs and all this other stuff. Is it because they just can’t wear that kind of a risk, the time risk? Or is your experience that there’s a different reason why it ended up being cost plus or fixed firm with all sorts of change orders?

Alex Modon: No, I mean definitely to steelman, it’s because it’s ultra complex to build these projects. There are hundreds of people that’ll be involved in how the thing gets designed that manages the entire supply chain to get it built and then manages all the boots on the ground of the project that’s actually doing the building. So there is tons of complexity and the reason that these contracts are structured in this inherently flexible way is because it’s really hard to know upfront how much exactly is the thing going to cost. So yeah, I mean it certainly has evolved this way because when you think about these projects, and I mean the small version of these are like a hundred million dollars, the more normal version of these is many hundreds of millions, and then the bigger ones are certainly in the meaty billions of costs. So because you have all that risk, the contracts effectively are this big risk mitigation strategy, and the easy way for the e PC not to take any risk is just to say, we’re going to get a margin on top of what it costs us to build a thing, but the problem is that there’s no motivation then to make the thing cost less.

If anything, there’s a motivation the other way to make it cost more.

Shayle Kann: Yeah. You mentioned there’s a lot of people and a lot of uncertainty. I mean, I guess one way I think about it is that there’s a spectrum of different types of projects. On one end of the spectrum is a thing that looks the same every time you build it more or less. I mean maybe a version of this would be, I don’t know, utility scale battery projects or utility scale solar or something like that where we’ve built hundreds of them, they generally look the same wherever you go. And you would imagine that on those types of projects it would be pretty well known. Maybe there’s some commodity risk, maybe there’s some labor risk, but broadly speaking, the designs are going to be similar and the experience is high. And then on the other end of the spectrum, there’s a first of a kind thing that’s never been built before and they’re obviously your error bars on the cost and the time, the labor and all that is going to be highest. And then there’s a bunch of stuff in between. I imagine data centers are in between actually because in some ways they look the same. There’s like a powered shell, the shell is a building, but then inside the data center there’s all sorts of innovation. Is this one liquid cool, this one using which Nvidia chips? Is it using- How is it designed? There’s so much innovation in that space that it’s changing all the time,

Alex Modon: Which also changes the facility too. These changes trickle out for sure.

Shayle Kann: Right. So I guess as you think about this, the incentive structure being misaligned, do you view it as being more misaligned on I guess relatively speaking, easier stuff to Bill because there you should be able to have high level of certainty on what the cost should be, or is it more misaligned on the esoteric stuff because the error bars are even higher and so the risk aversion of the EPC leads them to way over price, for example?

Alex Modon: Yeah, I mean definitely the contingencies are the egregiousness of this cost misalignment is certainly true with the more custom the project gets. So the first of a kinds are a great example of that, or you even mentioned data centers that are shifting in their requirements of course have more and more of this baked in. It’s basically just correlated to risk. How much risk is there in this solar has less and less risk as we deploy more and more the exact same way. Same thing with utility storage, but I do think that where you see, so you definitely get misaligned contracts or misaligned incentives, which kind of balloon costs, and that is the kind of status quo for how you contract these things anyways, but the other thing that falls into this is how projects broadly are approached. And so if you think about how we build products, we have a metric for it. We say, Hey, we’re going to make this widget, it’s going to come out of a factory. We’ll have some sort of cost per widget metric, and that allows us to approach these projects with this continuous improvement type approach and drive costs down. That’s like our learning rate. I think arguably that’s why solar has fallen so aggressively is because we keep kind of making, or at least I should say the module costs, which is even different than, this is maybe a side tangent, but it’s different than the actual install costs.

Shayle Kann: Yeah, well, it’s actually the problem with solar is that the module costs have fallen much faster than the installed costs have. We haven’t solved it on the construction and all the other commodity materials and stuff.

Alex Modon: And that’s all progress happens with this highly iterative process and this continuous improvement process that we get out of manufacturing a thing. But when we move into projects world, everything’s a snowflake. It’s like everything’s n of one. Even a project that we’re building, we built lots of refineries. That next refinery that we build is still an N of one project. And because it’s approached in that way, you don’t really get any sort of benefits of learning through that process. And by definition, each project’s going to be unique. It’s a different piece of land. But, and again, maybe this is a tangent, but that’s another big problem in the industry is everything’s done from scratch. So even if you’re going to go design a slightly different data center or a solar project or something else of that sort, every tweak or change that you make effectively reintroduces the entire redesign of the process. And so yes, there’s some stuff that gets lifted, but the overall amount of work that happens is not the kind of delta of the change. It is a significant rehaul of work and it just keeps us from learning and iterating to improve how something gets designed, not just in terms of saving engineering costs, which is actually a pretty small piece of the cost anyways, but actually having a better design that improves the overall cost or performance of the facility.

Shayle Kann: I guess one thing I wonder is, okay, so let’s take EPC, engineering, procurement and construction. Just taking at the simplest base layer of what the work entails, let’s just say you could dramatically improve because what you’re describing is the learning I think I guess maybe is on all three, but predominantly on engineering. Can you design this thing so that it’s fast and easy to design is definitely going to work upfront. My guess is that in most of these big capital projects, the E out of EPC is the smallest slice of the pie in terms of total cost. And the bulk of the cost probably comes from a combination of procurement, the actual physical materials, much of which are going to be like steel and cement and aluminum and commodities that have prices that vary. And then construction, which is sort of a function, it’s an outcropping of how the engineering occurs, but certainly is also just driven by construction process and labor and so on. So as you think about where is there an opportunity to deliver cost reduction and also cost certainty, how much of it is the E versus the P versus the C?

Alex Modon: Yeah, totally. Okay. So those are two separate things, right? So let’s say cost certainty versus an overall reduction cost. On the certainty side, everything, it’s really kind of planned out or teased out in the engineering portion. And so generally, again, lifecycle of these projects are you start with some conceptual design, you understand maybe plus or minus 50% how much the thing is going to cost. Then for the most part you dig into this front end engineering design and you’ll get to totally changes per project, but say you get to plus or minus 10% a cost, and that gives you enough confidence to go to a lender, an actual bank and say, Hey, let’s underwrite this project. We think you’re going to get the IRR you need, and then we move forward. But in the vast majority of projects, when you go to final investment decision and you have plus or minus 10% estimates, you’re only maybe 30% of the way through your engineering, 70% you still have to go do, and it doesn’t make sense to do it upfront because it takes a lot of time and it costs a lot of money and it’s a lot easier to finance that with the actual lender’s money rather than the development capital.

So the certainty that you have going into a project before you actually take the money from the bank to go build it is actually pretty low. There’s so much more work to go do and you just don’t do it because there’s a high marginal cost of the engineering. So one way that you really reduce all the risk, if you will, or all this uncertainty from how the project’s going to work, is if you could instead just take these projects further through the design process so that by the time you’re doing your earthwork, so you’re moving some sort of ground, you’re actually a hundred percent done. You have your issue for construction package, which doesn’t happen today. And so there’s that big piece on how do you remove uncertainty, how do you remove costs? I mean, yeah, you’re totally right. The engineering cost is anywhere from three to 10% or 15% of the project costs.

So it’s not a huge lever in itself. But if you think about the way these projects are designed today, because again, such a high marginal cost to engineering, what you end up doing is you only really design something one pass through. There’s no sort of iteration, there’s no optimization of design, and that leads you to a spot where you make early decisions, you freeze those design decisions, you do the next stage gate of design of your design process, and you eventually get stuck in these very low local optimums rather than ever understanding what the global optimum of that design process is. So yeah, I can get more into how we approach this problem, but there’s huge gains and opportunities to use the E to rapidly reduce the P and the C.

Shayle Kann: Okay. Let’s talk about how to use technology, which is I think what you’re alluding to here. This is an area where my suspicion is generally it’s not the first category of AI adoption or at least it hasn’t been historically. Where do you see the biggest opportunity? Where are the step function improvements that one can achieve by leveraging modern technology, be it AI or something else?

Alex Modon: Yeah, so we have built a lot of technology to help accelerate that pre-construction phase. So this is basically the E and lots of the procurement management side of things. And we have a software and kind of like an AI native version of this that helps accelerate the chemical design, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural controls. And in doing that, we basically are building a platform that allows us to remove that risk, but at a very, very low marginal cost that helps you accelerate through the design process, not just saving time, but exploring a much wider search base and getting to much greater levels of definition before you actually have to freeze designs. That has a big impact. To previous point, it is just removing uncertainty, reducing costs through optimization.

Shayle Kann: Can you go a level deeper on that? What does that actually mean to reduce uncertainty using software? What are you actually doing?

Alex Modon: Yeah. If you start a project today at zero, completely uncertain, and as you start specifying or defining bringing definition to that project, which is the process of engineering it, you start to remove risk. You say, Hey, we can actually size a pump that will solve that moving the fluid from point A to point B, or actually we can design a tank like this to hold this amount of volume. And once you start providing that level of definition, you remove a lot of the ambiguity, but there’s still tons and tons that goes into the thousands of documents that you’ll generate to design a plant fully. So this is what we have built. It is a platform that our engineers use. I think the important distinction here is this is not like a software technology that we sell. It’s like we use this as an internal tool ourselves.

So our engineers have this AI platform that has all of their data in one place, all the requirements about the project, all of the potential vendors that could be used, and they use it to basically accelerate that design process really significantly. We haven’t redefined how you’re engineering these projects. We’ve significantly augmented the people that are doing that work so that they’re able to just with the same amount of time and capital, they’re able to define way more and provide way more engineering definition as well as time to optimize those designs. So you can remove suboptimal design.

Shayle Kann: Can you articulate a little bit what is distinct about this from the EPCs? Have been using engineering software that is super mature for a long time, maybe that’s the problem, but what’s distinct about what you just described from what you could just get off the shelf to design a project?

Alex Modon: Most of the software in this industry really hasn’t changed much in the last maybe 20 years. And I again kind of always come back to the incentive structure. There’s no real incentive structure for an EPC to want better software. It’s the same reason your law firm doesn’t necessarily want AI software to help them accelerate and reduce their billables. So the way these softwares work now is that there’s a bunch of distributed software solutions or maybe decentralized solutions. So you’ll have a CAD tool that you use to actually do the designs. You’ll do almost all of your rough engineering or hand calcs in Excel. You’ll use dedicated simulation software for some sort of fluid design or structural analysis or whatever that might be.

And then you use another tool to review those PDFs with a tool to put red lines on them and go through design cycles and then push to drafters and then other tools to manage how do you reach out to your vendors? And anyways, there’s all these different software solutions that you’re using in order to do engineering. And what we built from day one was just a modern version of the software. So we put all those different disparate tools into one underlying platform and we gave modern software to them, which is automatically doing version control and collaboration and everything that you would expect out of just a modern tool. And what that allows us to do is not just have much more streamlined workflows, but it allows us to build AI in as a core primitive to the solution. So now sometimes our engineers will do some sort of work manually within one of our softwares, but often they will dedicate delegate a task to an AI that knows how to use all those tools in our software so that it can do that design task, do that design task, and then surface that back to the engineer who delegated it.

Shayle Kann: So it’s at least in significant part, it’s like integration of a bunch of what otherwise are kind of disparate workflows to allow for faster iteration and more automated iteration. You do a change somewhere in one piece of software right now you’d have to go to another piece of software, make the change in that software, see how it changes the other thing, do that over and over again. So it’s like building everything into a single comprehensive suite basically.

Alex Modon: Yeah, totally. There’s one underlying data model. There’s not the same piece of data that shows up in 10 different softwares, and that’s really helpful not just again for streamlining your own workflows, but it’s so that an AI can do it and it doesn’t have to manage all these different tools and interfaces that the same information is repeated but out of date and or edited by the wrong person who didn’t have permission or something of that sort.

Shayle Kann: When you say AI in this context, what do you mean? Is it LLM type AI where you’re like, I want to be able to, in my single pane of glass, be able to ask what would happen if I changed all the screws in this entire project from X to Y or something like that? Is it LLM ai? Is it? What is the ai? There’s also a version of what you’re describing that’s like enterprise software for sure, but doesn’t a big data component to it, but it’s not inherently AI.

Alex Modon: Yeah, no, it’s like an exact use case, the one that you gave that you would do. So we’ll record all our meetings and that meeting you’re having with a handful of different disciplines of engineers or people who understand the commercial, the agreement and what that’ll trigger through that recording is a bunch of tasks for Ais to go do and it’s us. You just basically mentioned a trade there. It’s like what if we had, I don’t know, one type of material over another type of material, one type of conveyance over another type of conveyance for this project to this material an AI will go explore that different design path, and that’s a trade that you would give to an engineer and you’d say, Hey, go spend a week, assess the trade-off between using belt conveyance or pneumatic conveyance for some sort of material handling problem and then tell me back what do we feel like is the right total cost of ownership trade?

And it’ll just explore that. And so that’s an LLM who’s doing a lot of that work and importantly, you’re not just asking a chat GBT or something of that sort to go explore that and produce something which it’ll do and honestly, it’ll do in a pretty impressive way, but the way that we’ve built it is that it’s grounded both inside of the data for the project, it has all that in one place and then inside of the tools that we’ve set it because it knows how to use, how to down select actual vendors or how to read spec sheets that we fed it or how to use simulation software that we fed it in order to derive these answers.

Shayle Kann: You mentioned data centers, and I think you guys put that in as one of the categories you’re most interested in your announcement when you guys unveiled. Is that because we’re building a lot of data centers or is that because there’s something specific to data centers and data center construction and engineering that makes it especially attractive here or is there something else that you would describe as the perfect prototypical use case for this in the early days is X?

Alex Modon: So these projects have a handful of different reasons of why you would apply this technology. In the data center use case specifically, speed is really an important lever for them. And so you can take instead of the design portion taking, call it six to nine months of your critical path, we can massively collapse that period of time, and that’s really important for these data center projects to accelerate how quickly we can actually build them. The same piece though with the fact that if you right now budget six to nine months for your design portion, almost none of that, you’re going to start to figure out, well, how do we optimize that design or do some sort of value engineering to save costs or to design for long lead items or to design for constructability. So really strong value prop in these data center projects as we end up increasing the capacity that we have on our team though it’ll make sense to pick up basically many of these types of large industrial projects of which we’ve already pushed the technology to be able to demonstrate and it’ll end up being really applicable across all types of construction.

Shayle Kann: So if you can deliver more certainty upfront, then that presumably is the thing that unlocks a different kind of business model that hopefully solves the incentive problem. Is that just a fixed price contract with no change orders allowed or what does that look like?

Alex Modon: That’s exactly it. We literally put no change orders in our contracts,

Shayle Kann: So you wear the risk to make it explicit, you wear all the risk basically if there’s a cost overrun, you’re going to go negative on the project. And the premise here is that because EPCs notoriously don’t have huge margins, right? Construction firms are like high volume, low margin type businesses, and so I guess the thinking on your side has got to be because we are reducing the cost of everything along the way, we naturally have higher margins, which would allow us a little bit of a buffer if things do become a little more expensive than we expected. At least we’re not in the red. Do I have that concept right?

Alex Modon: RYeah. I mean we definitely will have a different margin profile than the industry, but it’s not that because even when you think about it, the engineering margin, it’s it’s pretty small because the spend of the engineering is actually really small relative to the larger construction scope of the project. The important part of what allows us to absorb that risk without the kind of risk that we go into the red, or at least in a risk adjusted way, is because we’ve been able to do so much design upfront and we’ve been able to not only remove all that extra risk by taking the definition, instead of doing that at 30%, we can take that definition all the way through a hundred percent. You just remove all this ambiguity of how much the thing should actually cost. So again, traditionally when someone gives a contract to go build a project, because they have such little core definition, they don’t know all the vendors that they’re going to buy from. They have you even mentioned, I think this example earlier of there’s a tariff risk By the time that you fund the project and you commit to a cost tariff can change in six more months. You need to finish the design in order to order the parts. That doesn’t exist in our world because we’ve been able to just very, very quickly remove all this risk before we actually commit to a price and that’s very unique.

Shayle Kann: Wait, how does that work? So it’s a good specific example. So I guess what you would do is issue the purchase order for all of the material before you commit to a price to the customer. How do you avoid the tariff?

Alex Modon: Yeah, exactly. It’s timing it all out. So just to compare this again to how it works today is you’d only when you’d say, Hey, we’re the EPC, we’re going to give you a performance guarantee or some sort of fixed firm price When you go to buy this or fund this project with a notice to proceed or final investment decision, at that point you literally don’t even know all your bulks, so all your commodity equipment, the steel that you need, the wire that you need, et cetera, we will know all of that at this point in time because we’re not 30% definition, we’re a hundred percent engineering definition, and because we have this entire equipment list at this point in time, we know either how to say, Hey, let’s purchase everything at the same day that the project gets funded. Let’s go either purchase everything or let’s design hedges from a cost perspective so that we’re not exposed to some sort of volatility or risk

Shayle Kann: That’s complex. I’m thinking of these big construction projects and you’re either on the day that you sign the contract, you’re either buying all of the steel just as a random specific example, or you’re hedging steel prices at the project by project level to make sure that you don’t overpay for steel. That’s what you need to do.

Alex Modon: Yeah. That’s what allows you to truly have a very different risk assessment for how these projects get built and that what gives you a ability to do a fixed firm and actually mean most of these fixed firms aren’t really like industry themselves. I mean, we’ve seen time and time again where it’s like a fixed firm doesn’t really mean a fixed firm because there’s inevitably some way that in the thousand page contract that you assigned with your EPC, you went out of scope and invalidated that price and hence the kind of change order triggering.

Shayle Kann: I guess the other thing that I wonder how you manage is subcontractors, right? It’s another area where change orders come from, not just the general contractor or the EPC having to make a change order, but also because some subcontractor made a change order. So do you have to flow this all? First of all, are you going to use subcontractors? You’re just going to do everything and have a ton of people on staff, and if you are going to use subcontractors, do you have to then flow this change in a structure down through all of them where they can’t issue any change orders to you either?

Alex Modon: Yeah, certainly long-term we will do everything in-house. We will vertically integrate as much as possible because that’s where you can fix the incentives all the way through. Yes, for these initial projects as we take, we are working friendly with the local GC or even the trades, even the actual folks that we will subcontract a lot of this work out to. For that it is making sure that we, prior to entering into a contract, you have kind of the same thing, where often those contracts are not as the level of definition that you have when you’re asking someone to actually give you a fixed price on what a scope of work is. Very hard. We don’t have that same problem. We take things way deeper through definition, and we have a much better understanding of what should this actually cost to go build. So yeah, there’s a handful of different ways that we kind of approach working with the actual subcontractors as we do this to hit our performance goals, but it is this kind of like a continuing loop of how do you remove more and more risk through design.

Shayle Kann: Alright, so wrap it up. You don’t have to give me exact numbers, but when should we expect to see the first COD? When should we expect to see the first project constructed by you guys?

Alex Modon: I love it. Yeah, we’ll hopefully see you next year, so hopefully by the end of next year. Yeah,

Shayle Kann: Fast is the rule. Alex, thank you so much for the time. Really appreciate it.

Alex Modon: I appreciate it. Thanks Shayle.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-11T092357.619.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:05:27.541472

Along with offshore wind, ACP’s membership includes companies that develop solar, battery and onshore wind projects.","Other wind industry officials had been far less optimistic. “I would say that many of us knew that if Trump won, we were dead on day one,” said one former industry executive.

Grumet did not answer questions about his April exchange with Brown, Ocean Winds’ CEO for North America. An ACP spokesperson said the group does not comment on internal deliberations.

Brown said in a statement that he always approaches ACP’s offshore wind leadership meetings with the goal of presenting Ocean Winds’ positions “directly and openly, with an aim to drive consensus and achieve, where possible, common industry goals.”

The White House says no one should have been shocked by Trump’s actions.

“President Trump has been extremely transparent: wind energy is the scam of the century,” spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

“Reversing the Green New Scam was a very popular promise President Trump made on the campaign trail to the American people, who were tired of the Left’s radical and expensive climate agenda,” she added. “President Trump issued very direct policy guidance on offshore wind on day one, which the administration has been working diligently to carry out.”

Trump denounces wind power just about every chance he gets, including during the White House’s July 4 picnic for military families, his address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, last month’s U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, and numerous posts on his social media network, Truth Social.

“Wind is the worst,” Trump said Tuesday night at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “That’s a scam. They ruin your valleys. They ruin your peaks. And [it’s] the most expensive energy.”

‘A destruction of the industry’

This portrait of the offshore wind industry’s year under Trump is based on interviews with more than a dozen offshore wind executives and lobbyists and an administration official.

During the Biden era, the idea of erecting turbines along the nation’s coasts symbolized a vision of greening the economy, easing the threat of climate change and creating a new generation of manufacturing jobs. But now, unraveling the industry has come to represent Trump’s push for a rapid ramp-up of fossil fuels, which would include opening wide stretches of the shoreline to oil and gas drilling.

Overnight, the United States’ appeal to wind developers worldwide has vanished.

“There is no one in the world right now that is looking to do a wind project in the United States,” one industry lobbyist told POLITICO.

“What you’re seeing,” remarked another executive, “is a destruction of the industry.”

Another executive, Siemens Energy CEO Christian Bruch, told POLITICO journalists in Berlin this fall: “The American offshore wind market currently does not exist.”

At the same time, recent months have revealed limits to Trump’s campaign to crush offshore wind.

In September, a federal judge overturned the Interior Department’s decision to halt construction of a nearly completed wind project south of New England. Unlike other lower court rulings on Trump’s use of tariffs and the deployment of the National Guard, the administration did not appeal the decision. And on Monday, a separate federal judge declared Trump’s permitting freeze unlawful, handing a major victory to Democratic states in the case that Brown had argued the wind industry should join.

Meanwhile, staffers at the White House and Interior Department are discussing a proposal that would allow five offshore wind projects under construction to reach completion, according to three people familiar with the administration’s thinking. They include the country’s largest project, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, which could generate enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes, and a pair of massive projects on either shore of Long Island that would collectively supply more than 1 million homes.

Yet even that approach would allow the administration to revoke permits for other projects approved by the Biden administration that have yet to start construction. Just last week, the administration asked a federal judge to send an already-issued permit for an offshore wind project near Massachusetts back for further review.

All three people stressed that Trump himself has yet to sign off on the idea, noting he could easily demand that all projects under construction be shut down.

Even so, the mere fact that the administration is discussing the idea internally underscores the complicated future facing offshore wind companies in the United States. The five wind farms under construction would rank among the largest renewable energy projects ever built in the United States — one of which, Coastal Virginia, has the vocal support of some key Republicans. If completed, the five projects would represent the culmination of a more than two-decade campaign to break into the American market.

Already, wind produced more than 10 percent of the nation’s electricity in 2024. Last year, wind, solar and batteries accounted for an estimated 93 percent of the new power added to the U.S. grid, according to a POLITICO review of federal data.

But it’s unclear if any additional offshore wind projects will ever be built, regardless of what Trump decides. Even if they are, the mere attempt to repeal their permits has shaken wind companies’ faith in the U.S. market. Some executives said their companies would be wary of investing in the U.S. in the future.

After Interior halted Empire Wind off the Long Island coast in April, its Norwegian developer Equinor estimated that the stoppage cost it $50 million a week. Similarly, the two companies behind the joint venture building Revolution Wind, a 65-turbine project south of New England, told a federal court that a monthlong stoppage issued in August cost their project $70 million.

Both orders were ultimately lifted, but the long-term damage in the eyes of many companies was done. Ørsted, the Danish offshore wind giant and one of the two companies building Revolution Wind, has said it intends to shift its focus to Europe and Asia after completing its two U.S. projects under construction. Miguel Stilwell d’Andrade, the CEO of the Portuguese-based EDP Renewables, said last month that his company’s American offshore wind projects were “in hibernation.” EDP and the French developer Engie are the two companies behind Ocean Winds.

Not even the prospect of Trump someday leaving office is brightening wind companies’ view of the U.S. market.

“It seems impossible right now, that in a world where you have four-year presidential windows, that you could get an offshore wind project from complete pause to a point where you can make an investment decision, where you can be confident that you’re not getting a stop-work order halfway through construction,” said the industry executive worried about the “destruction of the industry.”

Singled out

Offshore wind is hardly alone. The president has taken a wrecking ball to the entirety of Biden’s climate and energy agenda, signing a sweeping budget law that aggressively phases out clean energy tax credits, halting permits for high-profile solar projects in the West and imposing new regulatory burdens that onshore wind developers worry will derail other projects.

No industry has endured Trump’s wrath quite like offshore wind, however.

“I think what’s happening now is a reflection of one person’s very specific views about offshore wind,” said Liz Klein, a former Biden administration official who led offshore wind efforts as director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

Internal divisions within the renewable industry have hampered its ability to respond to Trump’s attacks — and the April spat between Ocean Winds’ Brown and the American Clean Power Association’s Grumet reflected the split, people who witnessed that exchange said.

Along with offshore wind, ACP’s membership includes companies that develop solar, battery and onshore wind projects. The group’s board feared that a legal battle over offshore wind could cost the broader industry support from moderate Republican lawmakers who could defend the clean energy tax credits in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

That support yielded mixed results. Moderate Republicans in the Senate helped defeat a plan by conservatives to impose an excise tax on renewable energy projects, but agreed to the Trump budget law’s rapid phase-out of the IRA tax credits.

Offshore wind companies were also divided over how to respond to Trump.

One developer, Ocean Winds, filed court paperwork supporting a lawsuit by 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia challenging the president’s permitting freeze. The company said it had spent $600 million developing its SouthCoast Wind project off Massachusetts and called the freeze part of the administration’s attempt “to dismantle the entire offshore wind industry.”

But most companies with projects under construction sought to avoid direct confrontation with Trump. Too much money had been invested, they reasoned, to risk the administration shutting down a project.

Even after Interior shut down Empire Wind, a 54-turbine project south of Long Island, Equinor chose to negotiate with the administration. The strategy reflected Equinor’s desire to protect its extensive oil and gas holdings on federal lands in the U.S., and its unique ownership structure. The company’s largest shareholder is the Norwegian government, meaning it can call on lobbying firepower few other firms can match.

Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg, a former secretary general of NATO, raised the stoppage with American officials when he visited the White House in April.

But most of all, Equinor had strong backing from New York state, which could give Trump something he desperately wanted: a pair of new natural gas pipelines.

Trump lifted the order in May after claiming to strike a deal with Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to permit two gas pipelines in her state. Hochul denied any such bargain but said the state would permit pipeline projects that met its regulations. The state approved a first project last month.

A trip with consequences

The decision to halt Empire Wind was one of the first signs that the wind policies of Trump’s second term would be dramatically different from those of his first. But the administration’s efforts reached new heights over the summer after Trump traveled to Scotland for a diplomatic summit with European leaders.

The trip included a stop at Aberdeenshire, the site of one of Trump’s Scottish golf courses. Nearly a dozen offshore wind turbines tower on the horizon, a visual reminder of the unsuccessful decade-long campaign Trump waged before he was president to prevent their construction.

“Windmills are a disgrace,” Trump told reporters during the trip. “They hurt everything they touch.”

When the president got home, a regulatory blitz followed.

Within a month, Interior issued regulations rescinding designated wind energy areas on the Outer Continental Shelf and announced its intention to pull back permits for three projects that had yet to start construction. The Commerce Department opened its tariff investigation into imported wind components. The Department of Transportation canceled $679 million in grants intended to aid the sector’s development. The Energy Department withdrew a conditional $716 million loan for offshore transmission development in New Jersey.

The flurry was capped off by Interior’s August decision to halt work on Revolution Wind.

“He got back from Scotland. It reminded him how much he hated these windmills and he asked why the hell they haven’t been shut down yet,” said one of the people familiar with the White House’s deliberations.

For all the conflict, the three people in the industry said they see a growing appreciation within the White House and Interior that it would be time consuming, bruising and potentially unsuccessful to fight projects that have started construction. Those disputes could detract from advancing the administration’s other priorities, such as promoting offshore oil and gas development and deep-sea mining.

Even if he lets a few wind farms go forward, the president could still claim a political victory by saying he has stopped more from being built, said the person familiar with the White House’s deliberations. But for Trump, a more visceral factor could prove more important.

“He really just hates wind,” the person said.

The details: A new consumer survey by the insights company EY reveals that half of global car buyers plan to choose internal combustion engines, a 13-point jump as demand for electric vehicles softens.

50% of global car buyers intend to purchase an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle in the next 24 months, an increase of 13 points from 2024.

Battery electric vehicle (BEV) preference has fallen to 14%, a drop of 10 percentage points, and hybrid preference has declined to 16%, down five percentage points.

51% of prospective EV buyers say their plans remain unchanged, but 36% are reconsidering or delaying purchases due to geopolitical developments.

Regionally, the percentage of consumers who indicated that they want to buy an ICE vehicle rose by 12 points in the Americas, 11 points in Europe, and 10 points in the Asia-Pacific (APAC), while BEV intent fell across all major markets—with range anxiety being the top consumer deterrent for purchasing an EV.

Why it matters: Stores that match ICE, hybrid, and BEV offerings to local price sensitivity, infrastructure, and policy, will be better positioned to keep turns and margins healthy as shopper interest shifts back toward traditional powertrains.

Between the lines: EY’s report comes amid mounting industry support for ICE vehicles across the globe.

President Trump announced last week that he will gut tighter U.S. emission standards that would have led to an expected fleetwide average of about 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031.

Trump’s move drew immediate support from Detroit automakers Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors, who have been raising concerns for months about the challenges to meet the standards.

Automakers in Europe are pushing the European Commission to ease its emissions standards on new vehicles—with the EU now indicating that it will fast-track its planned review of a 2035 internal combustion ban.

What they’re saying: “Consumers are weighing the realities of policy shifts, cost pressures and uneven charging infrastructure,” said Constantin M. Gall, EY Global Aerospace, Defense and Mobility Leader, per a press statement. “The long-term trend appears to be a shift away from a purely electric (‘E-only’) approach toward a more diversified future for vehicle powertrains, with different vehicle technologies serving different customer needs.”

Bottom line: A mixed powertrain future is here to stay.

The state cut 394 jobs, or 19% of full-time positions, at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection from 2010 to 2024, according to the Environmental Impact Project’s latest report, released Wednesday.

Florida also saw environmental spending cut by 7% during that same time frame.

“This has a huge impact on Florida’s ability to protect and preserve our state’s unique and iconic natural environment, not to mention preventing toxic pollution from impacting public health,” said Susannah Randolph, Sierra Club Florida chapter director, in response to the report. “Budgets are reflections of priorities. If protecting Florida’s environment and public health is a priority, it would be funded, not cut.”

The cuts reflect policy changes in the state under two Republican governors, Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis.

The report’s authors say 27 states made budget cuts to their environmental protection agencies. That is a worrisome trend, they argue, when the Trump administration wants to make deep cuts to the federal Environmental Protection Agency with the idea states can take over those oversight duties.

“Instead of fulfilling their responsibilities to protect residents, too many states like Florida are leaving a vacuum of leadership, which is leaving communities vulnerable to deadly pollution,” said Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resource Defense Council, in a statement released along with the report.

Florida has emphasized spending money on restoring the Everglades and opposing offshore drilling, but it has been criticized for cutting back on enforcement and inspections, rolling back regulations and de-emphasizing the impacts of climate change even as the state has been battered by severe storms that caused record flooding.

“Opposing offshore drilling and supporting funding for the Everglades are important but without protection of our rivers, springs, wildlife, and wild spaces, those efforts will ultimately be undermined,” Randolph said. “Everything is connected.”

The DEP did not provide a comment for this story.

In 2024, DeSantis signed a bill eliminating most references to climate change from state law, reversing 16 years of policy with new legislation that critics say also undermined efforts to develop alternative energy sources.

Around the same time, the state advised textbook authors that they would have to remove references to the phrase “climate change” or their books would be rejected for use in Florida’s public schools. They were also told to include citations to back up statements that “human activity” caused climate change and cut a “political statement” urging governments to take action to stop climate change.

Also, in August of that year, many Floridians raised alarm bells when DEP plans, leaked to the press, showed the agency was considering “The Great Outdoor initiative,” which called for large-scale commercial development — hotels, golf courses and pickleball courts — within several state parks. It was scuttled in the face of public outcry, and DeSantis signed a bill this year prohibiting golf courses and resorts in state parks.

“After last year’s massive statewide protests calling for protection of our state parks, it doesn’t take much to see that Florida voters of all walks of life want environmental protection prioritized,” Randolph said.

Roughly two-thirds of the states cut 3,725 jobs from 2010 to 2024, the report found. While Florida had the largest number of jobs eliminated, dropping DEP’s full-time workforce from 2,096 to 1,702, the highest percentage of cuts were made by North Carolina at 32%, Connecticut at 36%, Arizona at 25% and Louisiana at 24%.

Seven states steeply reduced their pollution control budgets — including Texas, with its rapidly growing oil and gas industry — when adjusted for inflation. Mississippi led with 71%, followed by South Dakota with 61% and Connecticut at 51%.

Not all the cuts broke neatly along political lines. Connecticut, New York and Illinois are strong Democrat enclaves that saw double-digit cuts in environmental protection budgets.

But seven of the 10 states with the largest percent cuts to their environmental agencies had Republican governors for most of those 15 years.

On the other hand, blue states saw huge increases in environmental protection funding and staffing. California grew its budget by more than 350% while its greenhouse gas emissions fell and its economic productivity grew, the report said. Colorado and Vermont each increased their environmental spending by more than 100%.

Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said enforcement of environmental regulations depend on robust state agencies “that have the resources they need to do their jobs.” The cuts documented by the study and more cuts at the federal level “will only put more Americans at risk.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TOS-L-wekiva-island-boat-tour-01.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-11 11:01:54.062824

Texas has become a major hub of the Bitcoin mining industry, and the state government has even purchased $5 million of Bitcoin.
However, as the industry has grown, so too have concerns among residents and state lawmakers over rising demand on the power grid.
On average, each of the 22 cryptocurrency mines consumed over 668,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year.
In Texas, Bitcoin mines can rake in millions by enrolling in ERCOT programs to cut their energy use when demand spikes.","A Straight Arrow News investigation found that in 2024, large cryptocurrency operations in Texas consumed more electricity mining virtual currencies such as Bitcoin than residential utility customers in the cities of San Antonio and El Paso combined. The footprint of crypto mines is expected to keep growing in the coming years.

As of mid-November, 22 cryptocurrency mining facilities had registered with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas. In 2024, those facilities combined to consume more than 14.7 million megawatt hours of electricity, according to public records obtained by SAN. That corresponds to about 3% of all electricity produced on the state’s power grid in 2024.

The cryptocurrency mines consumed enough electricity to power more than a million Texas homes for a year. Insiders from the Bitcoin industry told SAN it is misleading to compare their electricity consumption to Texas cities because cryptocurrency mines turn off when electricity prices are high. But not all electricity market analysts outside the cryptomining industry are convinced; some said Bitcoin is a factor in rising consumer prices.

Texas has become a major hub of the Bitcoin mining industry, and the state government has even purchased $5 million of Bitcoin. The energy-intensive process uses computers to guess a random string of numbers, which verifies a set of virtual currency transactions, known as a block. It’s a lucrative business: For each block of transactions a mining company correctly verifies, it earns a reward of 3.125 Bitcoin. However, as the industry has grown, so too have concerns among residents and state lawmakers over rising demand on the power grid.

How much electricity does Bitcoin mining use?

The U.S. Energy Information Administration tracks annual retail electricity sales by utility companies across the country.

In 2024, San Antonio’s city-owned utility CPS Energy sold over 11.1 million megawatt hours of electricity to 865,914 homes, according to the EIA data. El Paso Electric, which serves the city of El Paso and parts of southeast New Mexico, sold about 2.7 million megawatt hours of electricity to 312,576 residential customers.

SAN’s analysis found that the amount of electricity consumed by cryptocurrency mines is equal to residential utility customers in the city of San Antonio, the El Paso area and another mid-sized Texas city, such as Garland, where residents consumed over 908,000 megawatt hours of electricity in 2024.

On average, each of the 22 cryptocurrency mines consumed over 668,000 megawatt hours of electricity last year.

While megawatt hours measure how much electricity is consumed over time, megawatts show how much power a facility can consume in an instant. The cryptomining industry has increased how much power it can draw from the grid at once. In the next two years, it’s expected to rise another 20%.

In June 2024, a senior vice president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas told lawmakers that cryptocurrency mining could draw an estimated 2,600 megawatts of power from the grid. As of November 2025, the electric demand of cryptocurrency mines is 4,288 megawatts and is expected to surpass 5,300 megawatts by 2027.

Where is the data from?

The Texas legislature passed Senate Bill 1929 in 2023, requiring virtual currency mining operations with a capacity of 75 megawatts or more to file registration forms with the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUC). Following its passage, a SAN reporter was the first among several media organizations to request copies of the filings via the Texas Public Information Act.

The PUC denied the request, arguing that public disclosure of the size and location of cryptocurrency mines could be used by terrorists to attack critical infrastructure. But the Texas Attorney General’s office largely sided with the journalists, triggering a lawsuit between the PUC and the attorney general. Litigation is ongoing.

SAN filed another public records request seeking totals from all registered facilities, foregoing information on specific cryptocurrency mines or companies. That request yielded the electricity consumption data reported in this investigation.

The total capacity of cryptocurrency mines and their annual electricity consumption is likely somewhat higher than the available data, which only tracks facilities that can draw at least 75 megawatts from the grid.

While the PUC data includes 22 mines above 75 megawatts that have registered with the agency, a report from the Texas Observer found 60 cryptocurrency mines spread across 33 Texas counties.

As part of this investigation, SAN contacted several of the largest known cryptocurrency companies in the state, including Riot Platforms and MARA, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings. None responded to multiple requests for comment.

How does it impact the grid?

Daniel Batten, a Bitcoin investor and advisory board member for MARA, told SAN that without context, the comparison of Bitcoin mining consumption to various Texas cities is “highly misleading.”

“Bitcoin mining is by economic necessity a non-rival consumer of energy,” Batten said.

Cryptocurrency mining is “flexible” and can turn its energy consumption up or down depending on economic factors, given the price of electricity and the price of Bitcoin.

Through this flexible operation, Batten said cryptocurrency mines “not only help stabilize the grid, they also provide additional revenue for renewable energy operators, which has been shown to accelerate the green energy transition.”

Spencer Marr, co-founder and president at Sangha Renewables, a company launching a 20-megawatt Bitcoin mine that will consume excess solar power behind-the-meter at a facility near Odessa, said “Bitcoin mining operations tend to concentrate where there is an oversupply of power.”

Some studies have shown that cryptocurrency mining can incentivize renewable energy development, while others have demonstrated the potential for large flexible loads to help stabilize the grid. In Texas, Bitcoin mines can rake in millions by enrolling in ERCOT programs to cut their energy use when demand spikes.

Critics, however, view those programs, which pay cryptocurrency companies a premium to participate, as exploitative rather than beneficial. Very little real-world data exists to demonstrate the extent of voluntary cuts to power consumption outside of organized ERCOT demand response programs.

“As the Nobel-winning conservative economist Milton Friedman said, ‘There is no such thing as a free lunch.’ That applies to cryptocurrency miners on the ERCOT grid,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist and lecturer at the University of Houston. “Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans.”

Hirs told SAN that without Bitcoin on the grid, overall electricity demand would be lower, as would reliance on some of the power plants that currently operate day in and day out.

“Any cryptocurrency miners on ERCOT using electricity are market demand over and above that of regular Texans,” he said.

Daniel Cohan, a professor at Rice University who has researched energy policy, said the electricity consumption data shows crypto mines are “likely propping up wholesale prices and natural gas use on mild days.”

Cohan said more precise data would be needed to estimate the exact price impact for consumers.

While some Bitcoin companies like Sangha Renewables are co-located with solar power, others like MARA’s facility in Hood County are co-located with natural gas power plants.

In response to SAN’s findings, Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney for the Clean Energy Program at the nonprofit Earthjustice said, “Bitcoin mining companies are continuing to exploit the system for their profit.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Texas-Bitcoin-Mining-FI-v5.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:02:33.267836

The planned data center boom represents the latest attempt by the gas industry to find new uses for this vast resource.
Still, it’s not certain that all the planned data centers will come to fruition should the supply of data center services exceed demand, said Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council.","Twenty years after fracking began to boost natural gas production in western Pennsylvania, residents are bracing for another surge in output as gas-fired power plants prepare to meet a big jump in electricity demand. At least five new energy-hungry data centers are planned in the region, most of which will power themselves by producing electricity by burning natural gas on site. The burst in activity is prompting predictions, by power companies as well as their critics, of drilling hundreds or even thousands of new gas wells to fuel the centers’ power demands.

While the gas industry welcomes new users for western Pennsylvania’s abundant natural gas, critics fear that higher production will add to the industry’s pollution of air and drinking water and heighten risks to public health. And in places where these data centers draw power from the grid, ratepayers are concerned about sharing the higher costs stemming from increased demand and upgrading transmission lines to carry additional power.

“The reflexive response is always ‘drill more,’ so I think the likelihood is that you are going to see increases in drilling” as these projects move closer to reality, said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy and a former secretary of Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

The Homer City facility, built on the site of a former coal-burning power plant, will be the largest gas-fired plant in the U.S.

By far the biggest power plant planned for western Pennsylvania’s data center industry is in Indiana County’s Homer City, some 50 miles east of Pittsburgh. There, developers plan to convert the Homer City Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant that was shut down two years ago, to a seven-turbine gas-fired plant that would eventually produce 4.4 gigawatts of electricity — double the generation capacity of the former coal plant. (One gigawatt can power between 300,000 and 750,000 homes a year, according to industry and government estimates.) When fully operational it will be the largest gas-fired plant in the United States.

Designed to power multiple data centers on a 3,200-acre “energy campus,” the Homer City facility, which is scheduled to start operating in 2027, would generate all its own power rather than drawing on the grid, said a spokesperson for the developer, Homer City Redevelopment. Once its data center demand is met, it would feed electricity back into the grid, potentially meeting the needs of “thousands” of nearby homes, according to the spokesperson.

On November 18, Pennsylvania’s DEP issued the project an air-quality permit, prompting condemnation from air-quality advocates. The state government “has fallen in line across the aisle to support [the] rapid buildout of AI infrastructure, even though the new power plants being proposed to run data centers in Pennsylvania are almost universally plants that would burn methane from local fracking wells,” the Clean Air Council, an advocacy group, said in a statement.

Corey Hessen, chief executive of Homer City Generation, said the project will be in “full compliance” with state air-quality regulations. The permit allows the Homer City power plant to emit two kinds of particulate matter, which can cause heart and lung illnesses, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide, and sulfuric acid, in addition to carbon dioxide.

According to the Clean Air Council, the Homer City data center facility would produce 17 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, equivalent to burning 18 billion pounds of coal or 39 million barrels of oil, while its annual energy consumption would be equivalent to that used by 3.2 million homes.

In Upper Burrell Township, in Westmoreland County, TecFusions, a global data center operator, is planning a project on 1,395 acres, powered by up to 3 gigawatts of gas-fired power generated on site. “This approach ensures reliability, efficiency, and reduced dependency on increasingly costly utility power,” according to a company statement.

And in Springdale, in Allegheny County, a proposed 565,000-square-foot data center on the site of the former Cheswick coal-fired power plant would use 180 megawatts of electricity drawn from the grid. The project has drawn protests from ratepayers who fear it will lead to higher residential electric bills if more capacity is required to meet the new power demand, in addition to generating more air and water pollution from power plant operations and from increased fracking.

As fracking expands to meet data center power needs, “conditions will get worse for the people of western Pennsylvania,” says a researcher.

Such concerns are not new in western Pennsylvania. For the last two decades, environmental advocates and researchers have accused the natural gas industry of polluting the air, polluting water through leaks and spills of chemicals used in fracking, and causing illnesses including cancer, asthma, and birth defects. The harms of fracking have been documented in a “compendium” of some 2,300 peer-reviewed studies from around the world published by the nonprofits Physicians for Social Responsibility and Concerned Health Professionals of New York. The Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group, maintains that fracking for natural gas in Pennsylvania is safe, and that by replacing coal-fired generation it was responsible for a nearly 11 percent decline in the state’s carbon dioxide emissions between 2022 and 2023.

Such industry statements do not reassure Liz Pebley, a 68-year-old resident of Freeport Township, in southwest Pennsylvania. She is particularly concerned about water quality and quantity as more wells are fracked. In June of 2022, a leak of drilling fluids — called a frac-out — from a gas well contaminated her well water with high levels of methane and heavy metals, including arsenic and barium. The well was operated by EQT, which will be supplying the Homer City plant with gas. Pebley said her water was discolored and smelled foul. In 2023, the company supplied her with a 550-gallon “water buffalo,” a plastic tank that still sits outside her house and remains her sole source of clean water. John Stolz, a Duquesne University professor and longtime critic of the gas industry who studied the EQT frac-out, estimates that the water of 50 other people was similarly contaminated.

“Unconventional oil and gas development has led to the loss of water resources not just at the front end, with removal, but also contaminating aquifers to the point where communities have lost their potable water,” said Stolz. As fracking expands to meet data center power needs, he added, “conditions will get worse for the people of western Pennsylvania.”

Despite scientists’ and activists’ concerns, only one western Pennsylvania municipality has proposed an ordinance to protect itself from data centers and their demand for electricity. Union Township in Washington County, a heavily fracked area south of Pittsburgh, wants power companies to certify that the grid can meet data center demand while ensuring supplies to existing and future homes and businesses; it also wants water suppliers to certify they have the capacity to meet the demands of the proposed facility while maintaining “sufficient levels of service” to existing ratepayers. To encourage other townships to pass protective measures, the environmental group PennFuture has published a model ordinance that includes similar requirements for electrical capacity and water supply.

The planned data center boom represents the latest attempt by the gas industry to find new uses for this vast resource.

The largest grid operator in the country, PJM Interconnection, which serves Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic states, is struggling to keep up with data center expansion. In late November, PJM’s independent market monitor, a watchdog for the operator’s wholesale energy markets, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to prevent PJM from adding data centers to the grid unless existing customers can be reliably served.

The Marcellus Shale, which underlies about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, has been producing natural gas using hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling since 2004. Stolz estimates it still contains about 250 trillion cubic feet of gas. That’s about half of the 489 trillion cubic feet estimated in 2009 by former Penn State University professor Terry Engelder in landmark research that kick-started the state’s gas fracking industry. In 2024, the United States as a whole consumed about 33 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while exporting 7.7 trillion cubic feet.

The planned data center boom represents the latest attempt by the gas industry to find new uses for this vast resource. In recent years there had been a push to make southwest Pennsylvania a petrochemical and plastics hub that would be dependent on fracked gas. But only one such facility has been built and is operating — the Shell ethane cracker plant in the town of Monaca.

Matt Mehalik, executive director of the Breathe Collaborative, a nonprofit that advocates for clean air in the Pittsburgh region, said that a surge in gas production to fuel data centers threatens to reverse a recent improvement in regional air quality that has been helped by the retirement of most coal-fired power plants. “Our air quality, even though it’s on a positive trend at the moment, can be put back on a negative trend, and we can be out of attainment [with federal air quality standards] because of these choices that are being made about building gas-fired power plants,” he said.

Still, it’s not certain that all the planned data centers will come to fruition should the supply of data center services exceed demand, said Alex Bomstein, executive director of Clean Air Council. “There is a giant data-center bubble that we’re living through right now where an enormous number of projects don’t necessarily have customers,” he said. “We don’t know which ones are going to materialize and which are going to disappear into the ether.”

David Hess, a former DEP secretary who currently edits an environmental newsletter, believes other factors besides the boom in data centers will lead to an increase in gas production. He forecasts it will also be driven by an increase in U.S. liquefied natural gas exports being championed by the Trump administration and by the Northeast Supply Enhancement Project, a planned pipeline that would move the fuel from Pennsylvania to New Jersey and New York City.

“There is no doubt all three will drive more drilling and more gas infrastructure development in Pennsylvania,” Hess said, “with all its documented negative impacts on public health and the environment.”",https://yale-threesixty.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/CNX-Drilling_Getty-HEADER.jpg?w=1200&q=60&auto=format&fit=max&dm=1765399012&s=3f3f311a95c826f600993a1c7977c5c8,N,,2025-12-11 11:01:47.031574

The company is pivoting toward energy storage systems (ESS) and partnerships with other automakers, including Hyundai, Kia, and Volkswagen. , SK On and Ford have agreed to reduce their joint venture's capital by 4.9 trillion won to return funds to shareholders, signaling a financial restructuring aimed at optimizing balance sheets.

Operational Adjustments: Facility Repurposing and Supply Chain Reallocation

Operationally, the dissolution has led to a reassignment of BlueOval SK's three U.S. battery plants. SK On will assume full control of the Tennessee facility, which it plans to

, while Ford retains ownership of the two Kentucky plants. This division allows Ford to maintain a domestic battery supply chain while avoiding the complexities of SK On's LFP technology gap.

Ford's retained Kentucky facilities are being repositioned to serve a broader customer base.

, which began production in August 2025, is now exploring partnerships with energy storage firms and other automakers to utilize excess capacity. Meanwhile, Ford's in the Louisville Assembly Plant will focus on a midsize electric pickup, leveraging LFP batteries produced at a Michigan factory. This shift aligns with of a ""Model T moment"" in EV manufacturing, emphasizing affordability and scalability.

Strategic Repurposing: Energy Storage and New Partnerships

SK On's pivot to ESS is gaining momentum. The company has secured a 7.2 GWh battery storage supply deal with Flatiron Energy, with deliveries starting in late 2026. To meet this demand, SK On is repurposing EV battery production lines in Georgia and planning LFP production in South Korea. This move not only diversifies SK On's revenue streams but also positions it to

.

Ford, meanwhile, is leveraging its retained Kentucky facilities to strengthen its domestic supply chain. The company's Universal EV Platform and ""assembly tree"" production model aim to reduce costs by 20% in parts and 40% in workstations. By focusing on LFP batteries, Ford is addressing cost concerns while maintaining flexibility to adapt to market demands.

Conclusion: Lessons for Investors

The Ford-SK On dissolution highlights the volatility of the EV market and the importance of strategic agility. For Ford, the shift to ICE and LFP technology reflects a pragmatic approach to profitability amid uncertain demand. For SK On, the pivot to ESS and partnerships with other automakers demonstrates a commitment to long-term growth in a competitive landscape. Investors should monitor how these companies navigate regulatory shifts, supply chain disruptions, and evolving consumer preferences. The repurposing of BlueOval SK's facilities and the emergence of new partnerships underscore the need for flexibility in capital allocation and technological innovation.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1765454721004.jpg.png,N,,2025-12-11 12:05:02.265864

That gives Western automakers a challenging task: proving they can beat China’s best.","China has taken the lead on electric vehicles, leaving the collective West in its dust. Its EVs have better performance, charge quicker and are cheaper to buy than Western alternatives, which makes them very compelling buys. But the West isn’t asleep at the wheel. Companies like BMW, Mercedes, Polestar and others are now releasing a new wave of EVs that are a true match to the best the People’s Republic has to offer.

We could call these new models Gen 3, since they are part of the third wave of EVs from the modern era and they all have certain things in common. They ride on advanced 800-volt bespoke EV platforms and fit into the software-defined vehicle category, promising to improve over time through successive over-the-air updates.

Several EVs from this new wave are either here or just around the corner, and they should make 2026 a much better year for EV enthusiasts.

How We Got To Gen 3

Photo by: Andrei Nedelea

Electric vehicles have been around for well over a century, with their first golden age lasting from the late 1890s until around the 1920s, when they started to disappear. The modern wave of EVs began after the year 2000, and it was only around 2010 that automakers started to take them seriously and began pouring more money into their development.

Cars like the first Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive or the Ford Focus Electric can be considered Gen 1 EVs. They were mostly compliance vehicles that couldn’t travel far on a charge and even bespoke models like the Leaf or i3 were still compromised by their small batteries and slow charging.

The Gen 1 era lasted from 2010 until around 2018, when most automakers began making what we would define as Gen 2 EVs (cars like the BMW i4, the Mercedes EQE and EQS or the Ford Mustang Mach-E). These cars were far more usable thanks to their much larger batteries and faster charging, but they were still plagued by software issues and reflected legacy automakers’ inexperience with EVs.

During that era, Tesla offered the best EV experience by far, thanks in no small part to the existence of its expansive network of Supercharger stations, but also the cars themselves, which were superior to any EV rival for many years straight. The company's software-defined approach would eventually be copied by Western rivals, but it was Chinese automakers who took note first. This eventually ended up giving Chinese automakers the EV lead they have today, as they improved upon Tesla's formula and left the rest of the West behind.

So even though Western Gen 2 EVs were finally usable enough through their increased range and faster charging to compete with gas cars, they still had plenty of compromises that could potentially make buyers wary of switching to electric. Many Gen 2 EVs are still on sale today, but we’re also at the start of the third generation of EVs. Manufacturers are applying the hard-learned lessons of their first decade of EV production, launching products with better technology, more compelling designs and far more efficient powertrains. Gen 3 is when EVs finally seem like they have reached maturity.

The Gen 3 Recipe

Photo by: BMW

The recipe for what we would define as a “Gen 3” EV is simple. The first thing is that it needs to be built on a bespoke EV platform running at 800 volts or higher. This higher voltage has a whole suite of advantages, the biggest being higher power, quicker charging (the fastest-charging EVs all run at 800 volts or higher) and improved running efficiency.

Running at 800 volts also allows manufacturers to lower the amperage of the current running through the vehicle, reducing heat and allowing all of the wires and cables inside the system to be thinner, cheaper and lighter. Thermal management of larger components is easier, too, due to the decrease in electrical resistance.

The cost to build an 800-volt EV is higher than for a 400-volt EV, so buyers will have to pay more for one of these higher-voltage EVs. Cost is also the reason behind BYD’s decision not to bring its 800-volt EVs to Europe yet, although they are surely coming, given the increased competition from local players.

The other key pillar of a Gen 3 EV is that it has to be a software-defined vehicle or SDV. This means the mechanical side of things fades in importance behind the software that runs it. Software controls how the vehicle feels and drives and it can completely change how you perceive it without touching any of the hardware.

SDVs are seen as more future-proof since they can be kept up to date with over-the-air updates in a way that traditional cars can’t. One way to oversimplify things is to say that an SDV is like a smartphone on wheels. That’s not necessarily accurate, but it does paint a good picture of what these new cars are like and what we can expect from them.

Why China Pulled Ahead

Photo by: Andrei Nedelea

China makes some of the world’s most advanced EVs today and its automakers experienced much quicker progress than their Western counterparts. They offer superior performance—one Chinese EV has 3,000 horsepower and is the fastest around the Nurburgring—and are considerably more advanced when it comes to charging, with some exceeding the one megawatt mark.

They are also able to make these EVs considerably cheaper than Western automakers, so much so that they can still sell them at a competitive price in Europe even with tariffs piled on top. Part of the reason is that Chinese automakers received significant government subsidies. Bodies like the European Union consider this an unfair advantage, which is why they imposed different import tariffs on Chinese EVs depending on the amount of state aid they received.

But even with tariffs, brands like BYD, Geely, SAIC or Chery are doing very well in Europe, even if not all their offerings fit into the Gen 3 category. Most already offer such vehicles in China, but they determined that bringing these new or updated models into Europe isn’t worth it right now, since older-tech EVs are still competitive against local rivals.

But now that the Europeans have finally caught up, Chinese automakers aren't invincible, though (many have already called it quits), and they will have to bring their A-game to the continent to maintain its momentum.

The Contenders

Photo by: Mercedes-Benz

The BMW iX3 was probably the most notable new Western electric vehicle launch of 2025, the first in the new Neue Klasse series of models. It ticks all the Gen 3 boxes, and it puts the West in a very good position against China.

Not only is the iX3 an 800-volt software-defined EV, but it also retains BMW’s renowned driving engagement and performance, and it’s extremely efficient too, as our own Tim Levin found when he drove it recently. It’s also innovative. Its wrap-around panoramic display sits under the edge of the windshield, leaving it somewhere between a traditional screen and a head-up display. It makes sitting in one of these cars feel fresh and futuristic but without feeling gimmicky.

The iX3 takes full advantage of its 800-volt platform, too, with new motors and more power-dense batteries that make it one of Europe’s longest-range EVs. Next year, when BMW launches the i3 sedan, it should use its electrons even more efficiently, giving cars like the BYD Seal or the Zeekr 007 a real European competitor.

Mercedes-Benz also has a Gen 3 midsize electric crossover on the way, the new GLC EV, as well as a sedan version, the C-Class EV, on the way. Both are built on a new 800-volt platform with a focus on efficiency and quick charging, although they don’t have the same outright peak charging power as the BMW iX3 or the Zeekr 7X.

There’s also the smaller Mercedes CLA EV, which boasts a different 800-volt platform and excellent efficiency. It too is defined by its software and features an advanced Google-based infotainment system, complete with an AI assistant that you can almost have a conversation with. Its party trick, though, is its impressive range for a vehicle in its size and price bracket.

If you want the same platform as in the CLA but in a taller package with a more cavernous interior, you can choose the new GLB with EQ Technology instead. It has the same 320 kW charging and even with its bulkier body, it should be more efficient than older EVs of its size.

The refreshed Polestar 3 also ticks all the Gen 3 boxes. After just a year on sale, the Polestar 3 is getting a big upgrade for 2026, including a new 800-volt platform, an upgraded central computer, and 350 kW fast charging. If you want the same underpinnings but in a more traditional SUV shape, then you can get the Volvo EX90 instead, since it’s basically the same vehicle underneath but with less of a focus on looking and feeling sporty.

Still, these manufacturers are playing catch-up to Porsche and Hyundai-Kia, whose EVs have had 800 volts for years now. Porsche’s latest EV, the new Cayenne Electric, takes charging power up to 400 kW. It features a structural battery pack and even features optional wireless charging, bringing Porsche one step closer to producing a true global EV.

Lucid is still an EV tech leader with its vehicles running closer to 900 volts for years, too, offering remarkable charging speeds, efficiency and range figures. Unlike some manufacturers like Kia, whose latest EVs have switched from 800 to 400 volts, Lucid’s future midsize models will likely keep their higher-voltage platform and eke out more of its benefits.

Honda will also soon offer its own Gen 3 EVs in the form of the strange-looking 0 Series, as well as with the Acura RSX. They do not feature an 800-volt architecture, but this shouldn’t hinder them too much.

Some carmakers say they just don’t see the need to go any higher than 400 volts in the foreseeable future, and this includes startups like Rivian, which is working on two new, smaller and more affordable models, the R2 and R3. Both will likely stick to 400 volts.

Some Gen 3 EVs are still a couple years away, like the Scout Terra and Traveler, as well as a new line of Rivian-powered Volkswagen EVs that should arrive around 2027. Ford’s “skunkworks” electric truck is also firmly in Gen 3 territory, even if the new modular EV platform it will be built on doesn’t support 800 volts.

Basically, all Western carmakers have either just launched Gen 3 EVs or plan to do so in the next year or two.

Not A Victory Lap

However, the seemingly renewed commitment by Western automakers to make better EVs doesn’t automatically translate to success. These vehicles still need to be desirable enough for customers to justify the price premium they typically command, especially when compared to Chinese competitors and Tesla’s compact models, which remain strong value propositions with their 400-volt platform.

Next year is when this battle of EV manufacturers looks set to go down, and it could go either way. For instance, BYD is expected to begin EV production at its new factory in Hungary, which should allow it to avoid tariffs, meaning it could sell EVs in Europe at a lower price than it does today, when everything it offers in Europe is imported from China and is subject to import duties.

BYD’s ascent in Europe shows that buyers on the continent are willing to overlook their bias for a certain local car brand and its products if another model (Chinese or otherwise) offers a better deal and is cheaper than what the local manufacturers are selling. That gives Western automakers a challenging task: proving they can beat China’s best. Next year, we’ll see if they can pull it off.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAqE4o/s1/2025-mercedes-benz-cla-first-drive.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 08:58:38.211479

This significant battery metals investment reflects the company's confidence in sustained market demand while positioning for continued global expansion. The bond structure supports both project construction and working capital replenishment across the company's expanding global operations.

How Does Corporate Bond Financing Shape Battery Industry Consolidation?

The global battery manufacturing sector increasingly relies on sophisticated debt financing structures to fund massive capacity expansion projects across multiple continents. Corporate bond issuances provide manufacturers with fixed-cost capital access while maintaining equity control during periods of intensive infrastructure development.

The financing announcement coincided with favourable interest rate environments, as the US Federal Reserve implemented a quarter-point rate cut to 3.5-3.75% on December 10, 2025. Lower global interest rates typically benefit capital-intensive corporations accessing international debt markets for expansion funding.

Five-Year Bond Structure Analysis for Manufacturing Scale-Up

Five-year bond maturity provides battery manufacturers with strategic advantages for multi-phase facility construction timelines. This duration aligns with typical gigafactory development cycles, from initial site preparation through full production ramp-up periods.

Key Financial Metrics:

Bond Amount: $1.4 billion (10 billion yuan)

Maturity: Five-year structure

Purpose: Project construction and working capital

Market Context: 33.6% year-over-year growth in battery installations

Working capital allocation within bond proceeds enables manufacturers to maintain operational flexibility during facility ramp-up phases. Battery production requires substantial raw material inventory management, with lithium, nickel, and cobalt procurement representing significant upfront capital commitments.

Market Positioning Through Strategic Capital Deployment

Debt financing structures enable battery manufacturers to pursue aggressive expansion strategies without diluting existing shareholder equity positions. This approach proves particularly valuable when companies maintain strong market positions and seek to consolidate industry leadership.

CATL's dominant market position provides favourable conditions for debt financing strategies:

38% global market share during January-October 2025

,American Energy,2025-12-11 10:54:38+00:00,Nature,Ownership of power plants stranded by climate mitigation | Nature Sustainability,"Fofrich Navarro, Frances C, Steven J",,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01707-5,"Stranded coal assets in China and India are large primarily because these countries are operating relatively new power plants: in both countries, the capacity-averaged age of coal-burning power plants is <15 years (Fig.
Roughly 30% of CO2 emissions from coal plants are attributable to power plants owned by 10 companies (Fig.
Ownership of stranded gas-burning power plants is more evenly distributed, with 100 companies owning gas-fired generators that emit half the emissions from natural gas- and oil-burning power plants (Fig.
We omitted power plants from our calculations in the limited cases where the percentage of ownership was not listed within the data.
We quantify the concentration of company-level stranded assets using the HHI, calculated as the sum of the squared shares of stranded assets relative to the total stranded assets for each fuel type.","International climate goals to limit anthropogenic warming to 2 °C or less aim to avoid severe climate impacts on natural and human systems in the coming decades1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but such goals entail a rapid reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by transitioning away from fossil sources of energy and fossil-fuel-burning power plants in particular11,12. Policies aligned with international climate targets will effectively impose higher costs on emitting infrastructure13,14, leaving the owners of fossil-fuel-burning power plants to adapt and transition away from high-carbon-emitting technologies, absorb substantial financial losses or pass related costs on to consumers. However, the magnitude and distribution of company-level financial risks in the global power sector have not been systematically evaluated, even though understanding such risks is crucial for accurately anticipating broader economic implications and allowing companies, investors and policy-makers to plan for and manage projected financial losses15,16,17,18. In this study, we assess stranded power-plant assets at the company level and by region with the hope of informing financial investors and energy-related decision-makers.

Previous research has shown that achieving ambitious climate goals requires the early retirement of fossil-fuel-burning power plants2,11,19,20 in the absence of retrofitting these plants with carbon capture technology, resulting in substantial forgone revenues. Other studies have estimated potential economic losses across the power sector13,14,21,22,23 or quantified stranded power-plant assets on a national level14,24, but most have not quantified the financial exposure of individual companies. For instance, ref. 24 calculated the proportion of operating fossil-fired electricity-generating capacity that exceeds climate-compatible levels under a 2 °C scenario and estimated stranded assets based on unrecovered capital costs from premature decommissioning. Similarly, ref. 25 quantified stranded assets using overnight capital costs and the unfulfilled portion of the expected lifetime of a coal plant under a 1.5 °C pathway. Meanwhile, ref. 14 estimated stranded assets in oil and gas production as the net present value of foregone profits under climate policy scenarios and aggregated from the asset level to firms and countries. In contrast, we evaluate foregone operating income of existing fossil-fuel-burning generators under carbon pricing estimates associated with lower climate policy scenarios, aggregate these losses to the company and identify and name companies with the largest financial exposure. While financial institutions, investors and policy-makers are generally aware of the financial risks associated with climate policies26,27, the scale and distribution of economic exposure among companies with emission-intensive power-plant assets is not clear. Therefore, this study assesses the financial implications of carbon pricing on fossil-fuel-burning power plants and reports the potential economic losses incurred by individual companies.

An asset is stranded when changes in technology or policy sharply reduce its value. Here we estimate differences in operating income of 16,438 fossil-fired power generators assuming either no carbon price or carbon prices consistent with lower warming targets (1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, 2.2 °C and 2.6 °C) and aggregate these losses on a company and country level. To isolate the financial impact of carbon pricing on generator revenues, we hold electricity generation constant at historical levels across climate policy scenarios and allow generators to pass on 90% of the added carbon costs to the rate-paying consumers. Our default model uses a geographically uniform discount rate, consistent with the parameters widely used by models that generate the carbon prices listed in the shared socioeconomic pathways database28,29,30 (Supplementary Tables 1–4). Further details of our approach are described in Methods. It should be noted that, although our model represents climate mitigation policy in terms of carbon prices, such prices may reflect a multitude of specific policies that are more regionally scaled and not fully captured by our model. Thus, our results are not intended as financial projections for individual companies but rather as a relative indicator of which companies have the highest financial risks under climate policies aligned with international targets if governments do not implement compensatory policies for asset owners.

Figure 1 illustrates the net present value of the added operating costs and foregone operating income from existing fossil-fuel-burning power plants worldwide under carbon pricing scenarios consistent with limiting global mean temperature increases to around 2 °C, assuming each plant continues to operate under its historical conditions into the future. Under these scenarios, the total added costs to fossil fuel power-plant operators are US$18.9 trillion (US$16–21.7 trillion), US$5.4 trillion (US$4.6–6.1 trillion), US$3.7 trillion (US$3.2–4.2 trillion) and US$1.7 trillion (US$1.5–1.9 trillion) based on the median carbon price for each climate policy trajectory, respectively (Fig. 1). Coal-burning power-plant operators would incur 75% of the total costs under a 1.5 °C climate mitigation scenario (Fig. 1a). More than half these costs are concentrated among power-generating companies in China and a substantial share of the costs are borne by companies in India (9.6%), the USA (7.3%) and Indonesia (2.0%) (Fig. 1b). Added costs are highly concentrated amongst countries and companies: 10 companies would be responsible for 24.0% of the total, 90 other companies would bear 33.7%, with the remainder of these costs being divided among 4,851 companies (Fig. 1c). In the absence of strict regulation, power companies are likely to pass through a large share of carbon-related operating cost increases to rate payers, thereby reducing their own financial exposure. However, the portion of costs not passed through by the utility operator would ultimately be absorbed by the company as a loss to operating income (stranded assets). Consequently, the magnitude of financial losses to companies will not only depend on the stringency of climate policy, but also on the proportion of costs passed through to electricity rate payers and the discount rates used to value foregone revenues. We find that stranded assets total US$1.9 trillion, US$0.5 trillion, US$0.4 trillion and US$0.16 trillion under scenarios in which power-generating companies are permitted to pass through 90% of their increased operating costs associated with carbon prices consistent with 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 2.2 °C and 2.6 °C climate targets, respectively, while discount rates are held constant across nations (Fig. 1d). However, revenue losses to fossil power generators are highly sensitive to the share of costs passed on to rate payers, ranging from approximately US$0.9 trillion to US$2.8 trillion under pass-through assumptions of 95% to 85%, respectively, in the 1.5 °C scenario alone. By comparison, stranded assets increase by 25% to 60% when adopting lower and more geographically differentiated cost of capital estimates (Supplementary Table 5), as lower discount rates in many major economies raise the present value of foregone revenue (Supplementary Fig. 1). Although the absolute value of stranded assets increases under more ambitious climate scenarios and under lower-pass through or discount rates, the proportional concentration among power-generator operators (for example, fuel, region and ownership) of these assets remains relatively unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating that these financing assumptions strongly affect magnitude but not the relative distribution of risks. Not shown in the figures, a well-known metric of market concentration, the Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), indicates that ownership of stranded coal plants is substantially more concentrated (0.0142) than natural gas plants (0.0048; Methods).

Of the 100 companies that own the most stranded assets by value, the very largest are state-owned (denoted by an asterisk below) and the top 25 companies cumulatively hold upwards of US$770 billion in stranded assets and are responsible for emitting 4.0 GtCO2 per year—nearly 11% of global CO2 emissions in 2024. Among coal plants, these companies include China’s five largest power producers: Huaneng Group*, Datang Corporation*, Huadian Group*, China State Power Investment Corporation* and China Energy Investment*, which cumulatively account for US$79 to US$134 billion of coal assets stranded by the 2.0 °C scenario (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Beyond China, NTPC Limited* (owned by India’s Ministry of Power), Korea Electric Power* (South Korea), Perusahaan Listrik Negara* (Indonesia) and Adani Enterprises LTD (India) also hold around US$22 to US$33 billion in stranded coal-burning assets (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Stranded coal assets in China and India are large primarily because these countries are operating relatively new power plants: in both countries, the capacity-averaged age of coal-burning power plants is <15 years (Fig. 2b). The largest owners of stranded gas- and oil-burning plants include Egyptian Electric Holdings* (Egypt), Saudi Electricity* (Saudi Arabia), Nextera Energy (USA), Ministry of Electricity Iraq* (Iraq), Korea Electric Power (South Korea), Calpine (USA), CLP Group (China) and Engie S.A. (France; Fig. 2c). These companies operate large and/or young fleets of power plants (Fig. 2d).

The degree to which ownership of stranded fossil-fuel-burning power-plant assets is concentrated is shown in Fig. 3, which shows the share of fuel-specific emissions related to generators stranded under a carbon price consistent with a 2.0 °C scenario. Roughly 30% of CO2 emissions from coal plants are attributable to power plants owned by 10 companies (Fig. 3a,c) and more than half of CO2 emissions are from 50 companies. Ownership of stranded gas-burning power plants is more evenly distributed, with 100 companies owning gas-fired generators that emit half the emissions from natural gas- and oil-burning power plants (Fig. 3b,d). Some key assumptions underlying our engineering-based estimates of stranded assets include the operational capacity factor of individual fossil-fuel-burning power plants, carbon price trajectories, cost of capital estimates and pass-through rates. We test our results using lower and more granular cost of capital estimates (Supplementary Table 5) and observe an increase in stranded assets, but the relative patterns of stranding across firms, fuels and regions remain largely consistent (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6). Figure 4 illustrates how estimated stranded-asset values vary under different power-plant operating conditions and various carbon pricing scenarios. We find that higher carbon prices (more stringent climate policies), extending fossil-fuel-burning power-plant lifespans and increased capacity factors all raise the value of stranded assets, but the relative importance of these variables is somewhat different for fossil-fuel-burning power plants burning different fossil fuels (Fig. 4). Coal-burning plants are the most sensitive to carbon price as they generally release more CO2 per unit of electricity generated and natural gas power plants are more evenly sensitive to both carbon prices and capacity factor (Fig. 4a,b). Similar patterns are observed with respect to power-plant operational lifespans, where carbon prices have a more pronounced impact on the stranded-asset values of coal power generators compared with gas-fired plants (Fig. 4d,c). Despite modelling assumptions, we observe that the distribution of stranded-asset risks among regions and companies remains largely consistent and companies with the greatest risk of stranded assets are those that have invested in and deployed the most fossil-fuel-burning power-plant capacity most recently.

Uncertainties as to the timing and stringency of climate policies have encouraged continued investments in fossil-fuel-fired electricity generation, even as international climate goals (for example, limiting the increase of global mean temperature to around 2.0 °C) would entail the costly early retirement of a substantial portion of existing fossil infrastructure2,19,29,31. Here we develop an engineering-based estimate of stranded assets for the power sector and estimate the global total to be in the trillions of dollars over the next 40 years, more than half of which is owned by just 100 companies. Previous studies have estimated the economic impacts of stranded fossil fuel assets at national or global scales, reporting losses ranging from approximately US$500 billion to over US$4 trillion, depending on the stringency and timing of the implemented climate policy14,22,23,24,25,32. Our results are broadly consistent with these estimates, despite differences in methodological approach and the framing of stranded assets. Where previous studies assess stranded assets at the sector, country or financial system levels, our analysis identifies stranded assets at the company level and reveals that financial exposure is concentrated among a relatively few firms, particularly those with substantial investments in coal-fired power generation. While our estimates provide a benchmark for financial exposure under stringent climate policy, real-world asset stranding is likely to unfold in a more uneven environment, due to regional differences in policy, electricity market structures and financing conditions and thus may be more regionally differentiated than what is observed here. Still, our results may be useful for the growing number of investors and regulators interested in assessing policy-related transition risks18,33. In contrast to general statements about the potential costs of climate and energy policies, such as those made pursuant to the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures34, we have quantified the value of the assets of companies at risk of being stranded under different climate goals using publicly available information and transparent assumptions.

Under the most ambitious climate mitigation scenarios, we find stranded assets increase in companies whose power holdings have capacity-weighted average operational life of less than 20 years, most of which are owned and operated by China’s big five energy-generating companies—China Huaneng Group corporation*, China Datang Corporation*, China Huadian Corporation*, China Energy Investment* and China State Power Investment Corporation*. These state-owned enterprises are managed by the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) and have been at the forefront of China’s energy and economic growth in recent decades. Cumulatively, SASAC manages 331 GW and 49 GW of coal- and gas-fired capacity, respectively (around 28.1% of China’s total electricity-generating capacity) and together, the power plants owned by these companies produce roughly 15% of the committed emissions of the global power sector. Consequently, China’s state-owned power infrastructure presents a unique opportunity and challenge for global decarbonization efforts as state-owned enterprises are largely incentivized by public service mandates rather than typical economic frameworks and are therefore more insulated from broader market forces35,36. Thus, the economic structure of state-owned enterprises can ultimately hinder or propel green technology investment relative to private firms, but is largely dependent on the regulatory directives of the state. Still, additional costs to state-owned power-generating enterprises constitute a public policy problem for national governments. Depending on the public objectives of those entities, costs may not be borne entirely by the enterprise itself but might be redistributed more generally across the population. While there is some evidence suggesting that state-owned enterprises may be more inclined than private firms to adopt environmentally friendly policies, the degree to which governments pursue policies counter to their economic objectives is relatively unknown and warrants further investigation35,37, particularly given that the scale of potential financial losses can also create strong incentives to resist more stringent climate policy. Given its notable role as a global producer of consumer goods38, the sudden financial collapse of the power infrastructure overseen by SASAC could have extensive financial implications beyond China’s borders and thus merits special consideration. By comparison, in Western economies, corporate power-generating entities and public utilities have largely lowered annual CO2 emissions by heavily investing in natural gas-fired power generation39. However, the substitution of aging coal-fired power generators with newer gas-fired power infrastructure has not substantially reduced cumulative emissions and has instead increased the transition risks for power-generating firms in the USA39 and European Union.

While our findings offer valuable insights into the risks faced by specific companies, they are subject to several important caveats and limitations. First, our estimates of stranded assets are a result of financial conditions and policy trajectories that vary across countries and are likely to evolve over time, including climate policy (carbon pricing consistent with a specific warming target), cost of capital and the proportion of costs absorbed by individual companies. To the extent that the stringency of global climate policy is insufficient to meet lower warming targets, then our estimates will be correspondingly smaller. Similarly, our valuation of stranded assets is based on the assumption that fossil fuel power generators will continue to operate to the end of their working lives. While this assumption provides a useful upper bound for estimating stranded assets, it may overestimate operational persistence. In practice, there is considerable variation in power-plant lifespans due to regulatory design, maintenance requirements and economic conditions, which can lead to the early retirement of younger, more efficient generators or the extended operation of older plants40,41. Thus, to the extent that financial markets or asset owners already anticipate some tightening of climate policy over the lifetimes of assets or, conversely, reflect scepticism about the realization or stringency of climate policy, elements of this risk may already be priced into assets or appear on company balance sheets and thus be reflected in their current market valuation. Furthermore, substantial changes in fuel prices, evolving economic pressures or technological advancements may prompt earlier-than-expected retirements of fossil-fired-generating assets even in the absence of carbon pricing or climate-driven mandates. Therefore, given the complex and evolving factors driving stranded assets, our results should not be interpreted as forecasts for corporate revenues, investment returns, market capitalization or current stock valuation. Nor should our estimates be interpreted as unrealized capital that would automatically accrue to firms if more ambitious climate policy efforts were ultimately abandoned, as current company valuations already embed expectations about future profitability amid evolving macroeconomic conditions. Nonetheless, our results consistently show that the same companies hold the largest share of stranded assets across various climate mitigation policy trajectories and financing assumptions, indicating that these entities are most at risk of asset stranding.

It should also be noted that we assume companies will internalize some of the costs associated with carbon pricing, rather than transferring all additional expenses to their rate payers. In some cases, only a smaller portion of the carbon costs will be passed on to consumers, while in less competitive markets, all these costs can be passed through to rate payers42. The degree to which companies can pass costs on to consumers will depend on the development of carbon-free power generation, consumer demand response to increasing energy prices and regulatory processes that determine local electricity rates43,44. Our analysis attributes the added costs from carbon pricing as stranded-asset exposure to corporate owners, although we recognize that this does not fully capture the distribution of financial risk or liability. Utilities frequently use risk-sharing strategies, such as project-level non-recourse debt, leasing structures or regulatory cost of service frameworks, which shift financial exposure to lenders, lessors or consumers. However, these arrangements are often private and inconsistently disclosed, making them difficult to incorporate into asset-level modelling. Additionally, the timing at which carbon pricing is implemented also influences our results, as the financial risk of a company diminishes as its fossil-fired power fleet ages and increases as new carbon-emitting power plants come online. Consequently, the scale of stranded assets held by each corporate entity is likely to fluctuate over time. Although many countries, such as China and India, have nascent carbon pricing mechanisms, others, including the USA, lack such programmes at the national level.

Additionally, carbon policies that are more substantially geographically differentiated than the regional estimates used here, for instance, to reflect the differentiated responsibility of individual countries as opposed to economic regions, would produce different geographic distributions of stranded assets. Nonetheless, the carbon price schedules we adopt reflect cost-minimizing pathways for achieving more ambitious climate mitigation targets and the central pass-through rates used in this study are representative of those observed in more-established carbon markets within the electricity sector. If, instead, countries implement non-price instruments to achieve their emissions goals, the associated costs and potential for stranded assets will be correspondingly higher. Finally, our analysis is grounded in projections of power-plant revenues and costs based on historical electricity-generation returns. However, projected revenues and input costs are subject to change, with precise operational conditions, maintenance and fuel costs influenced by dynamic future conditions that are unknown and very difficult, if not impossible, to model. Yet changing costs and revenues will probably alter the operating schedules of future power generators.

We derived the corporate and state owners of 98% of individual operating fossil-electricity-generating plants from the global coal-plant tracker, global oil- and gas-plant tracker and global energy ownership tracker datasets obtained from the global energy monitor database. We omitted power plants from our calculations in the limited cases where the percentage of ownership was not listed within the data. We obtained technology-specific estimates of power-plant operating costs from the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III (IPCC WGIII) and future carbon prices consistent with lower warming scenarios (1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, 2.2 °C and 2.6 °C scenarios) are obtained from the shared socioeconomic pathways database28,29,30. All monetary values are expressed in constant US$(2005), which is consistent with the carbon pricing estimates listed in the shared socioeconomic pathways database. While this approach ensures comparability across countries and time, it does not capture the potential impact of exchange rate fluctuations on historical or projected costs.

To quantify future profits, we project the expected generating income and costs of each power plant (i) individually over the anticipated operational life of the plant and assign profits to their respective parent company.

$$\mathrm{Generator}\,{\mathrm{profits}}_{{it}}={G}_{{it}}{\mathrm{EP}}_{{it}}-{G}_{{it}}{\mathrm{FC}}_{f}{\vartheta }_{i}-{{\rm{O}}\& {\rm{M}}}_{{it}}-{\mathrm{IC}}_{{it}}$$

In our study, generator profits are defined as the operating income earned from electricity generation over a period (t), calculated as power-plant revenue minus the cost of production. Income from production is determined by multiplying the annual electricity generation of each plant (G) with the regional price of electricity (EP) and subtracting the generating costs. Generating costs are calculated by multiplying annual electricity generation (G), global average fuel costs (FC) and a fuel-to-electricity conversion term (ϑ), in addition to the global operations and maintenance costs (O&M), as well as the investment costs (IC). Global average, technology-specific power-plant operational costs are obtained from the IPCC WGIII report49, while regionally distinct electricity prices are obtained from GCAM v.7 and although more granular data could improve accuracy in specific contexts, our approach allows for consistency and comparability across countries. In line with the IPCC approach, we include capital investment costs in our estimates. Although typically considered sunk and not expected to influence operational decisions, these costs reflect ongoing financial obligations that may persist for debt-financed infrastructure. We adopt a geographically uniform discount rate of 10%, consistent with the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates for a high-risk market50,51,52, to reflect investor expectations under a riskier operating environment associated with climate policy and given the absence of a globally comprehensive cost of capital dataset. However, to test the sensitivity of our results against more heterogeneous financing conditions, we use lower regional- and country-level discount rates to reflect lower perceived investment risks and financing costs. Country-level cost of capital values are taken from ref. 53, which reports estimates for about 100 countries. These values are aggregated according to the regional classifications used in the carbon pricing data, with regional averages assigned to countries that have missing values. Additionally, as individual power plants age, the operational and maintenance costs typically increase such that these costs are not well covered by the generated revenues, resulting in their closure historically around 30 years for natural gas and 40 years12,54,55,56,57 for coal-fired power-generating infrastructure. Therefore, we allow for existing power infrastructure to retire in line with their historical norms, except for cases where a projected retirement date is explicitly listed in the power-plant data.

To quantify the impacts of climate mitigation policy on fossil-fired power-plant profits, we first calculate the net present value of these generating assets (i) on the basis of the operating income for each generator. We allow firms to retire these plants following historical conditions and do not explore the ramifications of the financial liabilities this may cause. Additionally, to avoid abrupt retirements of power-generating assets, we gradually raise the annual carbon price on an annual basis in line with the carbon pricing used by IPCC climate projection models, which use the shared socioeconomic framework30 (Supplementary Tables 1–4).

$${{\rm{NPV}}}_{i}=\displaystyle \mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{{\rm{LT}}}\frac{{\rm{Generator}}\,{\rm{profits}}}{{(1+r)}^{t}}$$

We translate future climate trajectories (1.5 °C through 2.6 °C) into stranded assets by incorporating regionally specific carbon price paths used by integrated assessment models for climate mitigation scenarios58. Carbon prices translate directly into increased input costs for fossil fuel plants, diminishing future profit projections. Therefore, we modify power-generator profits by including the additional accrued costs of electricity generation.

$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Modified}\,\mathrm{generator}\,\mathrm{profits}}_{it}\\ ={G}_{it}{\mathrm{EP}}_{it}-{G}_{it}{\mathrm{FC}}_{f}{\vartheta }_{i}-{G}_{it}{\mathrm{ECP}}_{t}(1-\mathrm{PTR})-{{\rm{O}}\& {\rm{M}}}_{it}-{\mathrm{IC}}_{it}\end{array}$$

Where E is the total annual emissions for each plant, PTR is the uniform pass-through rates and CP is the regionally based carbon pricing at the time (t), which achieves the climate emission scenario. Since most countries lack established carbon markets, there is limited empirical evidence available to determine national-level carbon price pass-through rates. Under conditions of perfect competition and full market efficiency, carbon costs would almost certainly be fully passed through to electricity prices, resulting in a 100% pass-through rate and no direct cost burden to fossil fuel generators59. In practice, however, observed pass-through rates vary across markets because of various factors such as market structure, regulatory interventions, the availability of alternative generation capacity and uncertainty in emission cost projections60,61. As a result, we adopt a range of 85% to 95% pass-through rates based on values reported in the existing literature42,62,63. Annual emissions are calculated for each individual unit from equations that vary slightly based on their fuel type. We obtain the emission equations from the Global Energy Monitor and IEA estimates.

$${{\rm{Annual}}\,{{\rm{CO}}}_{2}\,{\rm{emissions}}}_{{\rm{Coal}}}={G}_{{it}}\times {{\rm{HR}}}_{i}\times {{\rm{EF}}}_{i}\times C$$

$${{\rm{Annual}}\,{{\rm{CO}}}_{2}}\,{\rm{emissions}}_{{\rm{Gas}}}={G}_{{it}}\times {{\rm{LCEF}}}_{i}$$

Where HR is the technology-specific heat rate, EF denotes the emission factor of coal plants and LCEF represents the life-cycle emissions factor associated with natural-gas power plants. In our study, we define stranded assets as the difference in future asset income with and without the implementation of a climate policy that limits warming:

$${{\rm{Stranded}}\,{\rm{assets}}}_{i}=\displaystyle \mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{{\rm{LT}}}\frac{{{\rm{GP}}}_{i}-\widehat{{{\rm{GP}}}_{i}}}{{(1+r)}^{t}}=\displaystyle \mathop{\sum }\limits_{t=0}^{{\rm{LT}}}\frac{{G}_{{it}}{{\rm{ECP}}}_{t}(1-{\rm{PTR}})}{{(1+r)}^{t}}$$

We aggregate unit-level monetary income over the operational lifetime of the power generator and assign these losses to their parent company (corporate or state-enterprise owners) and select the top 100 companies by stranded-asset holdings. To investigate the national economic risk from stranded fossil-fired capacity, we quantify and assign the monetary value of these losses within the borders of each nation. We quantify the concentration of company-level stranded assets using the HHI, calculated as the sum of the squared shares of stranded assets relative to the total stranded assets for each fuel type. The HHI reflects the degree of concentration, with higher values indicating that a greater proportion of stranded assets is concentrated among fewer companies. Our analysis of stranded assets relies on publicly available data used by integrated assessment models for carbon prices28,29,30, which are commonly used in climate change forecasts and by the broader scientific community and historical average power-plant operating conditions for each individual unit. Nonetheless, we recognize that the value of stranded assets is determined by the carbon pricing amount and is also influenced by the use of power generators. Thus, we test the sensitivity of our results by varying the carbon price trajectory incrementally per year until the maximum price of US$0 to US$1,000 per ton is reached and fluctuating the capacity factor from 20% to 90%. We report the implications of these variations on global fossil-fired power-generator stranded assets in our sensitivity analyses. In a separate sensitivity test, we use historical capacity-factor estimates and instead vary the power-generator operating life and report these results. We subsequently repeat our sensitivity test, but instead of gradually increasing carbon prices over time, we apply the maximum carbon prices immediately and uniformly for the entire duration of the lifespans of the power infrastructures and show its effects on stranded-asset values. Overall, our approach enables us to assess the potential economic impacts of stranded fossil-fired power-generation assets, providing valuable insights into the financial risks faced by corporate entities and the challenges associated with transitioning to a low-carbon energy system.

'No question' - Cape Cod Times,Heather McCarron,,,,,https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2025/12/11/u-s-district-court-cape-cod-massachusetts-judge-patti-saris-offshore-wind-maura-healey/87687775007/,"A federal judge ruled against the Trump Administration's pause on wind energy projects, calling the enforcement of the pause ""arbitrary and capricious.""
Offshore wind is the answer,” he said.
“We need offshore wind to meet demand, create jobs and lower costs,"" Healey said in Dec. 9 email.
President Trump’s decision to halt offshore wind projects ""reflected a commitment to responsible ocean management,"" he said.
“After nine months on pause, there’s no question that offshore wind projects have taken a hit in time and money,” she said.","A federal judge ruled against the Trump Administration's pause on wind energy projects, calling the enforcement of the pause ""arbitrary and capricious.""

The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by 17 states, including Massachusetts, which argued the pause delayed economic benefits and clean energy delivery.

Some fishing industry representatives expressed disappointment, though, stating the original pause was a commitment to responsible ocean management.

A federal judge has pushed back on the Trump Administration's pause on wind energy projects carried out by federal agencies, raising new questions for offshore plans near Cape Cod — a ruling that some welcome, but disappointed others.

The finding, released from the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Dec. 8, does not cancel President Trump’s original executive memorandum calling for a pause on wind approvals, but it does call for ending federal agencies’ enforcement of his directives.

The Sierra Club Massachusetts is among those applauding the court’s finding. In May, the organization joined nine other environmental groups in a filing arguing that the administration’s “wind directive” was arbitrary and not based in science, lacked a clear purpose and timeline, and jeopardized climate goals and public health.

In a Dec, 9 statement, Sierra Club Massachusetts Chapter Director Vick Mohanka called the ruling “a pivotal win in our movement to ensure Massachusetts has access to affordable, clean energy harnessed right off our coast by local union workers.”

“Our communities need rate relief and an escape route off the rollercoaster of gas price spikes reflected on our monthly utility bills. Offshore wind is the answer,” he said. “As Sierra Club, we will continue doing our part in championing our state’s projects across the finish line so they may soon deliver reliable energy that keeps the lights on and bills low.”

A status hearing is scheduled for Dec. 15 to clarify some lingering questions about the decision, according to the Conservation Law Foundation. Since the administration can appeal, the effects of the finding will not be immediate and could ultimately change.

Gov. Maura Healey also welcomed the judge's ruling.

“We need offshore wind to meet demand, create jobs and lower costs,"" Healey said in Dec. 9 email. “I’m grateful to AG Campbell and her team for their work to defend this crucial energy source, protecting jobs and economic activity across the country and here in Massachusetts.""

'Deeply disappointing'

Others who have raised concerns about accelerated permitting, inadequate review and potential harm of wind development are disappointed.

Among them is New England Fishermen's Stewardship Association President Aaron Williams.

“As a fisherman who has witnessed the effects of offshore wind on our ocean and the risks it poses to coastal communities and fishermen, (the) ruling is deeply disappointing,"" he said in a Dec. 9 statement.

President Trump’s decision to halt offshore wind projects ""reflected a commitment to responsible ocean management,"" he said. ""Overturning that decision is a step backward in defending our oceans and the working waterfront.""

""AT NEFSA, we remain dedicated to preventing the industrialization of our fishing grounds and urge that this ruling be reconsidered. Our ocean and the people who depend on it deserve protection, not policies that prioritize corporate interest over sustainability,"" Williams said.

An executive memorandum from Jan. 20

The finding stems from the executive memorandum Trump issued on Jan. 20 ordering federal agencies to pause all new permitting, leasing and approvals for wind energy projects while reviewing the government’s decision making on such projects. Federal agencies, including the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, acted on that memo by halting the approval process for projects both onshore and offshore, and calling back already approved permits for review.

Led by the state of New York and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, 17 states — including Massachusetts — filed a lawsuit in May, arguing that the pause has delayed economic benefits, reduced tax revenue, and slowed delivery of essential renewable energy.

The lawsuit highlighted specific projects, including SouthCoast Wind planned south of Martha’s Vineyard, that the order delayed. Prior to the executive memo, Massachusetts also had multiple offshore wind projects in the lineup, including Avangrid’s New England Wind 1 and 2 (formerly Park City Wind and Commonwealth Wind), whose permits the Trump administration has sought to revoke.

Craigville Beach and Dowses Beach in Barnstable are both proposed for cable landing sites for the New England Wind projects, and Falmouth has been eyed as a landing destination for SouthCoast's second phase.

Ruling: 'Arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law'

In her ruling U. S. District Court Judge Patti Saris said the agencies’ actions were “arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,” and called for the pause to be canceled entirely. The court found that the state and ACE NY were harmed because the pause delayed projects, increased costs, and prevented communities from getting more clean energy as scheduled.

According to the ruling, the states “have each satisfied” the requirement to show they were directly affected and that undoing the pause would fix those problems. The court’s authority to step in comes from both federal law and the Constitution, the ruling stated.

When the court finds a government action unlawful, it can cancel it completely, the ruling stated. Also, if it stands, the ruling would restore the ability for wind energy projects to move forward and find that the administration’s action violated the law.

'Important turning point'

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, on Dec. 9 said the ruling “is an important turning point” for wind energy developers and those who support it.

“After nine months on pause, there’s no question that offshore wind projects have taken a hit in time and money,” she said.

While recognizing that the ruling “doesn’t compel the federal government to restart permitting tomorrow, it does vindicate the sector and give developers the confidence to keep planning for a resurgence,” she said.

If that weren’t bad enough, U.S. automakers are also contending with wild swings in federal policy.
But today the largest maker of lithium-ion batteries for cars is CATL, a Chinese company founded in 2011.
They have to largely depend on private capital, especially after Congress cut or eliminated programs designed to foster electric vehicle manufacturing.
Some analysts say it’s already too late for U.S. automakers to beat China.","In 2021, after Apple gave up on its secretive plans to build a driverless electric car, Doug Field left the technology company to embark on a mission impossible meant to save the American auto industry.

He rejoined Ford Motor, where he had started his career decades earlier, with the grand ambition of designing electric vehicles that would allow the century-old company to compete with Chinese carmakers, whose vehicles are hugely popular with consumers and breaking global sales records.

Mr. Field knew the old ways of Detroit wouldn’t do. Time was short, and to jolt the storied automaker into action he created an automotive start-up of sorts — a secretive lab near Los Angeles, with a satellite office in the heart of Silicon Valley, that he called a “skunk works.”

He recruited engineers and designers from electric vehicle makers like Tesla, Rivian and Lucid and from start-ups working on batteries, electronics and software, and promised them the kind of creative freedom that tech workers take for granted.

The auto industry is undergoing change the likes of which it hasn’t seen since the early 1900s, when Henry Ford’s Model T and moving assembly line transformed the economy and how people got around. The ubiquitous horse-drawn buggy was consigned to museums, while countless other businesses became obsolete.

Ford and other established carmakers are now staring down that kind of obsolescence, particularly as Chinese companies like BYD and Geely race forward, producing 60 percent of all electric vehicles worldwide.

The best hope is to leapfrog the Chinese by producing better batteries, more efficient electric motors and other breakthroughs and then doing it again and again. And the best hope for making those things happen are people like Mr. Field, who are trying to teach Detroit to be as innovative as Silicon Valley.

“I knew it would be a completely different challenge than anything I’d done before,” he said, “which was to try and change the course of a large organization.”

Nobody knows how this contest will play out, but there are already signs that the Western automakers are falling even further behind. Many of their most innovative and affordable battery-powered models are still years away. Mr. Field’s first vehicle isn’t expected to even go on sale until 2027.

Mr. Field, who has also worked at Tesla and Segway, is fully aware that teams like his have the fate of an entire industry in their hands. More than four million Americans work at car and parts factories, dealerships and repair shops.

President Trump is determined to turn back the clock on electric cars, even dropping strict fuel efficiency standards that favored them. But as most of the world pivots decisively away from the combustion engine, car executives see no choice but to stay the course.

‘Room to Run’

One thing going for the underdog Western automakers is that there is plenty of room to improve how electric cars are made, and there is also no shortage of ambitious entrepreneurs wanting to make a go of it.

One Boston area start-up, AM Batteries, is among several companies working on machinery that can reduce the cost of battery manufacturing. The equipment made by the start-up forms layers of lithium, nickel and other materials into battery cells using a dry powder instead of the wet slurry used in most battery factories today.

The technology eliminates the need for a long drying process, does not generate toxic chemicals, and shortens the assembly line, saving time and money. And, if it can be put to use on a large scale, the company’s approach will make batteries — the most expensive part of an electric car — more affordable.

“What keeps me awake at night is knowing that engineers in China and Japan are doing the same thing,” said Lie Shi, AM’s chief executive.

AM, whose investors include the venture capital arms of Toyota and Porsche, is among dozens of young companies looking for ways to make electric vehicles cheaper and more practical.

Daqus Energy in Woburn, Mass., is trying to make batteries from plentiful organic materials rather than costly metals like lithium, nickel and cobalt. Estes Energy Solutions in San Francisco is developing a way to package battery cells that makes them lighter.

Niron Magnetics in Minnesota is working with Stellantis, the maker of Jeep and other brands, on substitutes for the rare earth metals required for electric motors, so that automakers are not dependent on supplies from China. There are many other examples.

“There is a lot of room to run with these technologies,” said Brian Potter, a structural engineer who recently wrote the book “The Origins of Efficiency.”

As innovative as start-ups are, ultimately the onus will be on Ford and other established carmakers, which are used to incremental change, to overhaul the way they work. Mr. Field’s California team has developed a medium-size pickup assembled in a way that illustrates the kind of innovation that may be the U.S. auto industry’s best hope.

The front and rear sections of the pickup will be cast from molten aluminum in giant machines rather than being welded and glued together from hundreds of pieces, the way most cars are made today.

The method allows Ford to install instrument panels and other interior parts before the large sections are fitted together around a battery. Assembly line workers don’t need to lean awkwardly into car interiors as is the case in most car factories today.

Assembly will be so much more efficient and inexpensive that when the pickup goes on sale it will cost $30,000, Ford said, not much more than the smaller gasoline-powered Ford Maverick.

The stakes are enormous — and not just for Ford.

“Any car company that doesn’t adapt,” said Joachim Post, a senior executive at BMW, “will have trouble surviving.”

Move Fast or Get Run Over

While Chinese cars are effectively barred from the United States by high tariffs and other restrictions, Ford dealers in places like Bangkok, London and Mexico City are already battling Chinese carmakers that offer high-quality vehicles at low prices, Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said in a recent interview in Detroit. If Ford and other U.S. automakers can’t defend their turf, they risk becoming niche manufacturers of big gas guzzlers confined to the United States.

“I have 10,000 dealers around the world. Only 2,800 are in the U.S.,” Mr. Farley said. “So you do the math.”

In Thailand, for example, the Ford Everest gasoline sport-utility vehicle seats seven and starts at 1.2 million baht, or $37,700. An electric BYD M6 can seat six and costs $26,000.

“It’s the biggest battle of my career,” Mr. Farley said.

Mr. Farley’s uneasiness is reflected across the auto industry. Electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, account for about 10 percent of new car sales in the United States, but in Europe they account for almost 30 percent and in China more than 50 percent.

If that weren’t bad enough, U.S. automakers are also contending with wild swings in federal policy. Mr. Trump, who dismisses climate science, has reversed auto and energy policies dating from as far back as the administration of George W. Bush.

Innovative technologies could be the salvation of the U.S. auto industry, but only if they are manufactured here. Historically, that has not always been the case. The lithium-ion battery was developed largely in U.S., British and Japanese university and corporate labs. But today the largest maker of lithium-ion batteries for cars is CATL, a Chinese company founded in 2011.

Start-ups in the United States have a built-in disadvantage. The Chinese government provides long-lasting financial and other support to automakers and battery companies as part of a national drive to become a global player.

“The government is completely in bed with the local brands,” Mr. Farley of Ford said.

Innovative firms in the United States do get help from the government but it can be fleeting because priorities often change in Washington. They have to largely depend on private capital, especially after Congress cut or eliminated programs designed to foster electric vehicle manufacturing.

Western companies need to move quickly. They can take as long as seven years to develop a completely new vehicle and set up an assembly line to build it. Chinese manufacturers can get a new model to showrooms in half that time and sometimes even less.

To speed up development of its newest electric vehicle, a sport-utility vehicle called the iX3, top BMW executives visited engineers and designers at their offices every four weeks rather than requiring those employees to troop to headquarters in Munich for approvals.

Teams were encouraged to ignore traditional barriers between corporate divisions. Experts in foam technology who had designed car seats were recruited to find the best kind of foam to insulate batteries so the new model would be fire and crash resistant.

BMW engineers are particularly proud of a panoramic digital display that stretches across the bottom of the car’s windshield, providing driving directions and other information without requiring drivers to take their eyes off the road.

The company plans to begin selling the iX3 in the United States in 2026 for around $60,000. The car will travel 400 miles on a full charge and can be topped off at a fast charger in just 21 minutes.

But in a demonstration of how hard it is to stay a step ahead of China, Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones and cars in Beijing, has begun selling a car with a panoramic display similar to BMW’s. And some new BYD cars can be refueled in less than 10 minutes at ultrafast chargers the company has begun building in China.

The designers and engineers know that “you both have this job to make something efficient that’s incredibly attractive,” said Mr. Field, who credits his parents for giving him an appreciation for engineering and aesthetics. His father was a chemical engineer and his mother was an artist and musician.

Mr. Field, who lived in Texas, Indiana, Canada and Connecticut while growing up, stuck close to his father’s career path and studied mechanical engineering at Purdue. He later earned master’s degrees in engineering and business at M.I.T.

While Ford took an unusual step in isolating this team far from its home base, other automakers like Mercedes-Benz, G.M. and Honda have also instructed employees to come up with what the industry calls a “clean sheet design” — one that is not encumbered by previous models or ways of doing things.

There are other problems for U.S. automakers in particular. Big vehicles with internal combustion engines like Ford’s F-150 pickup are very profitable because they don’t cost a lot more to manufacture than smaller cars. But people are willing to pay more for a big truck or S.U.V. because they feel like they are getting more for their money.

The same logic does not apply to electric vehicles, where batteries account for a large share of the cost. Making an electric vehicle becomes more expensive with size because of the need for bigger, costlier batteries.

Some analysts say it’s already too late for U.S. automakers to beat China. Instead, they should take the “if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” approach and form partnerships with Chinese manufacturers to get access to their technology, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm that invests in transportation.

“If I were leading any of the carmakers right now I would focus on partnering with the Chinese,” Ms. Natarajan said.

Dan Cook, the chief executive of Lyten, a San Jose, Calif., battery maker, said he had faith in the creativity and willingness to take risks that has so often put the United States at the forefront of new technologies like computers and microchips.

Lyten is developing batteries made primarily of lithium and sulfur, which is extremely cheap and readily available in the United States. If the company can mass produce it, the result would be cheaper and lighter batteries not dependent on materials from China.

“Silicon Valley is here because of the freedom to innovate,” said Mr. Cook, who started his career at G.M., “and the freedom to think and make mistakes.”

Mr. Field’s task now, he said, is to meld Ford’s century of manufacturing experience with this kind of inventiveness. As the vehicle moves closer to production, he has been allowing more people to cross the skunk works’ moat. The team now has a satellite office in Dearborn, Mich., Ford’s hometown.

“Getting a large company to be able to still produce high volume and high quality, and be able to innovate,” he said, “that would be a force to be reckoned with.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/12/multimedia/00auto-innovation-02-vbmz/00auto-innovation-02-vbmz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 05:58:45.816702

The winning bids generated $279.4 million at an average of $1.5 million each, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversaw the sale for the rights to explore and exploit oil and gas reserves under the Gulf’s sea floor. That compares with an $842,817 average in March 2023, the last time rights were leased in the Gulf.

Thirty companies submitted 219 bids for tracts off the coasts from Texas to Alabama.

But the lion’s share of bids were clustered 120 to 140 miles south of Morgan City and Houma in waters that are about 265 feet deep.

Chevron USA Inc. and BP Exploration made the most bids overall, mostly in this area. Both companies already have existing leases in the region.

“It’s a great day for American energy independence,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, said Wednesday. “We saw a strong interest in today’s lease sale, and I’m proud that millions of dollars from this sale will go directly to Louisiana’s coastal restoration and hurricane protection efforts.”

Louisiana received about $156 million in 2024 from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. The state should receive more revenues this year under GoMESA, in which the federal government shares a portion of its revenues from energy production with states bordering the federal waters. Scalise recently got the cap increased for the participating states.

“The new law finally increases the amount of revenue sharing dollars Louisiana is eligible to receive from offshore lease sales, like the one held today, that will result in millions in new funding for our state’s vital coastal restoration efforts,” Kristi Trail, executive director of the Pontchartrain Conservancy, based in New Orleans, said in a statement.

“That only 1.3% of the acreage was leased suggests companies are being selective, likely prioritizing the most attractive deep water blocks and existing infrastructure tie-backs - rather than speculating widely,” Michael Hecht, head of Greater New Orleans Inc., an economic development organization, said in a text.

“While it would be too early to forecast employment numbers and economic impact, since leases are the first step in exploration and development, what is clear is that this will put some of the world’s most experienced energy professionals back to work in a meaningful way. Louisiana is a major onshore base for Gulf operations, so more leasing translates into more demand for offshore services, fabrication, vessels, logistics, heliports, engineers, and skilled trades,"" he added.

The governor’s office reports that 15% of the state’s total employment — 306,750 jobs — is supported by the energy sector. That work generates about $25.5 billion in annual statewide earnings.

“These lease sales put Louisiana to work and puts our state at the forefront of furthering America’s energy dominance,” said Tommy Faucheux, President of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. “We are creating jobs, strengthening energy security, and delivering vital funding to restore Louisiana’s coastline.”

Wednesday’s Big Beautiful Gulf 1 lease sale was the first of 30 scheduled to take place over the next decade.

Erik Milito, president of National Ocean Industries Association, a Washington-based trade group for oilfield services industry, said energy producers need a regular cadence of lease sales to plan properly.

It’s currently being used at Musk’s xAI’s Colossus data center in Memphis, Tennessee.
Reeves said pairing batteries with data centers is an area that’s still under development but growing in popularity.
Enjeti said there’s already some commercial supercapacitors available to smooth the load data centers are consuming to train language-learning models.
Doing so could likely get the data center faster interconnection, Bonahoom said.","With data center developers in Texas and most other states now commonly deploying fossil fuel generators as backup power sources, a nascent industry from the renewable side of power generation—battery storage—has started elbowing its way into the fast-growing sector.

A new report by Oxford-based Aurora Energy Research detailed how adding battery storage to a site could improve data centers’ power quality, provide flexibility and reduce transmission congestion, while offering an opportunity to reduce emissions.

Battery storage already works as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS), or a bridge from grid power to backup power, as most generators take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to ramp up, said Lizzie Bonahoom, an Aurora Energy Research associate.

There’s a long history of batteries being efficient and cost effective in UPS applications, said Jeff Reeves, a vice president of Battery Council International, a leading industry trade group in North America.

But there’s been a seismic shift in how data centers and digital infrastructure operate, Reeves said. It’s made battery companies reexamine how they do things to ensure they’re brought into the future, Reeves said.

“Everybody’s really racing to figure it out,” Reeves said. “AI is having a moment and everyone wants to make sure that they’re there for it.”

Some data center facilities being built in Texas have planned to co-locate their sites with battery storage. Of Google’s three new data centers across the state, totaling a $40 billion investment, one in Haskell County will be paired with a new solar and battery storage plant.

Elon Musk’s company Tesla rolled out its own battery marketed for industrial facilities like data centers called the Megapack. It’s currently being used at Musk’s xAI’s Colossus data center in Memphis, Tennessee.

The Megapack is said to be used to help smooth workloads to meet utility and generator requirements, improve the data center’s ability to stay online during voltage disturbances, offer flexible interconnection and emissions-free back up power.

Making the work more steady helps stop the quick spikes in electricity use that happen when training artificial intelligence. These spikes look like large swings on a power chart and present challenges for both the data center and the grid to handle. The oscillations often go beyond what’s recommended for the backup generators and can damage the equipment while also causing problems with the power grid’s stability.

Whether data centers can “ride through” voltage or frequency disturbances on Texas’ electric grid is already a concern for Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) officials. Most data centers are designed to disconnect from the grid during a disturbance to avoid data corruption or loss and switch to backup power.

Batteries can react right away when power use suddenly changes, the Aurora report said, functioning as a fast-acting ancillary service that keeps electricity steady and prevents big swings in demand.

Reeves said pairing batteries with data centers is an area that’s still under development but growing in popularity.

“They’re kind of like shock absorbers and load stabilization,” Reeves said about batteries in power-smoothing uses.

Prasad Enjeti, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M University, said there are other technological options for load smoothing that are available now at scale. One being supercapacitors—a relative of batteries in their ability for a super-quick surge of power but with worse energy storage. Enjeti said there’s already some commercial supercapacitors available to smooth the load data centers are consuming to train language-learning models. It also could be solved on the software side, Enjeti said.

“There are many solutions,” Enjeti said. “I think they have to get their act together to come up with the right approach to minimize the cost.”

Tesla reports that its Megapack can make power use much more steady, cutting big ups and downs by more than 70 percent, so new data centers can use power systems already in place and get connected faster.

The battery can act in lieu of a transmission upgrade, Bonahoom said, preventing congestion— power lines being overloaded from demand. Doing so could likely get the data center faster interconnection, Bonahoom said.

“Time is of the essence,” Bonahoom said. “The value of getting a quicker interconnection is so high” because of the race to develop the most capable AI system.

Dallas-based Aligned Data Centers announced in October that a data center it is developing in Oregon will come online years earlier than would have been possible with traditional utility updates by securing a 31-megawatt battery from Calibrant, a company that provides on-site energy systems.

The on-site battery addresses siting and capacity bottlenecks and can give power back when the grid needs help, according to Aligned. It’s also designed to discharge during peak grid demand and ensure the “five-nines” of reliability—reliable power 99.999 percent of the time—data centers are seeking, the company stated.

Battery storage has quickly altered the Texas grid in recent years. Texas added nearly 1,500 megawatts of battery storage to the grid’s summer rated, peak demand capacities in 2023. That figure almost tripled to 4,374 megawatts added in 2024.

But given the scale of data center projects, the cost of batteries for how few hours they can run when compared to diesel generators, could make them prohibitively expensive, Bonahoom said.

Diesel generators for 2028 deployment cost companies on average about $1,159 per kilowatt and can run one or two weeks. By contrast, lithium-iron phosphate batteries cost nearly double, at $2,371 per kilowatt, and max out around 20 hours of run time, according to Aurora.

While there are investments in new technologies and battery chemistries to improve long duration storage, such as flow batteries—rechargeable batteries where energy is stored in liquid in external tanks, instead of inside solid battery cells—it’s still early, Reeves said. Some prospective clients are considering the batteries as a way to move away from relying solely on fossil fuels, or search for bridge solutions that can run for a few hours.

“Unless there are stringent congestion or flexibility requirements from the grid system operators and a clear outlook of what compensation would look like for batteries, the adoption of storage at data centers will depend on how well they can pitch themselves,” Bonahoom said. “That’s TBD.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2155016300-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:02:17.219090

Then Trump Shifted Guidance.,"Chris Bowling, shoshana.gordon@propublica.org",,,,,https://www.propublica.org/article/omaha-nebraska-lead-superfund-epa-trump,"If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and city of Omaha soil tests found.
But in October, it changed the lead guidance.
Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site.
When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold.
She had imagined growing fruit trees in her backyard until she discovered lead levels high enough to potentially clean up under the Biden guidelines.","The county health worker scanned the Omaha, Nebraska, home with an X-ray gun, searching for the poison.

It was 2022, and doctors had recently found high levels of lead in the blood of Crystalyn Prine’s 2-year-old son, prompting the Health Department to investigate. The worker said it didn’t seem to come from the walls, where any lead would be buried under layers of smooth paint. The lead assessor swabbed the floors for dust but didn’t find answers as to how Prine’s son had been exposed.

A danger did lurk outside, the worker told her. For more than a century, a smelter and other factories had spewed lead-laced smoke across the city’s east side, leading the federal government to declare a huge swath of Omaha a Superfund site and to dig up and replace nearly 14,000 yards — including about a third of the east side’s residential properties — since 1999.

Prine looked up the soil tests for her home online and discovered her yard contained potentially harmful levels of lead. But when she called the city, officials told her that her home didn’t qualify for government-funded cleanup under the standard in place from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Prine didn’t want to move out of the home that had been in her husband’s family for generations. So she followed the county’s advice to keep her five kids safe. They washed their hands frequently and took off their shoes when they came inside.

Then, Prine heard some news at the clinic where she worked as a nurse that gave her hope: In January 2024, the EPA under President Joe Biden lowered the lead levels that could trigger cleanup. Her home was above the new threshold.

That didn’t automatically mean her yard would be cleaned up, local officials told her, but last year, the EPA began to study the possibility of cleaning up tens of thousands of more yards in Omaha, according to emails and other records obtained by Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica. The agency was also discussing with local officials whether to expand the cleanup area to other parts of Omaha and its surrounding suburbs.

Then, this October, the Trump administration rolled back the Biden administration’s guidance. In doing so, it tripled the amount of lead that had to be in the soil to warrant a potential cleanup, meaning that Prine and other families might again be out of luck.

Prine’s son Jack, now 5, struggles to speak. He talks less than his 2-year-old brother and stumbles over five-word sentences.

“You would think that if lead is this impactful on a small child, that you would definitely want to be fixing it,” she said. “What do you do as a parent? I don’t want to keep my kid from playing outside. He loves playing outside, and I should be able to do that in my own yard.”

Scientists have long agreed about the dangers of lead. The toxic metal can get into kids’ brains and nervous systems, causing IQ loss and developmental delays. Experts say the Trump administration’s guidance runs counter to decades of research: In the 26 years since the government began to clean up east Omaha — the largest residential lead Superfund site in the country — scientists have found harm at ever lower levels of exposure.

Yet what gets cleaned up is often not just a matter of science but also money and government priorities, according to experts who have studied the Superfund program.

Prine’s block illustrates how widespread Omaha’s lead problem is and how many people who might have benefited from the Biden guidance may no longer get relief. Of the 11 homes on her block, four were cleaned up by the EPA. Six others tested below the original cleanup standard but above the levels in the Biden guidance and were never remediated.

Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica are embarking on a yearlong project about Omaha’s lead legacy, including testing soil to find out how effective the cleanup has been. If you live in or near the affected area, you can sign up for free lead testing of your soil.

Despite the changing guidance, Omaha still follows a cleanup standard set in 2009: Properties qualify for cleanup if parts of the yard have more than 400 parts per million of lead in the soil — the equivalent of a marble in a 10-pound bucket of dirt. The Biden administration lowered the guidance for so-called removal management levels to 200 parts per million.

The Trump administration has said its new guidance, which raised them to 600 parts per million, would speed cleanups by providing clearer direction and streamlining investigations of contaminated sites. But environmental advocates said it only accelerates project completion by cleaning up fewer properties.

The EPA disputed that. “Protecting communities from lead exposure at contaminated sites is EPA’s statutory responsibility and a top priority for the Trump EPA,” the agency said in a statement. “The criticism that our Residential Soil Lead Directive will result in EPA doing less is false.”

The new guidance doesn’t necessarily scrap the hopes of Omaha homeowners or the conversations that were happening around the Biden recommendations. That’s because the Trump administration continues to allow EPA managers to study properties with lower levels of lead, depending on how widespread the contamination is and how likely people are to be harmed. What actually gets cleaned up is decided by local EPA officials, who can set remediation levels higher or lower based on the circumstances of specific sites.

Regional EPA spokesperson Kellen Ashford said the agency is continuing to assess the Omaha site and will meet with local and state leaders to “chart a path forward with how the updated residential lead directive may apply.”

Gabriel Filippelli, executive director of Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, has studied lead and Superfund sites for decades and said he is doubtful the EPA will spend the money to clean up more yards in Omaha. The EPA doesn’t act if “you don’t have local people raising alarm bells,” he said.

Yet in Omaha, many are unaware of the debate — or even the presence of lead in their yards. Most of the cleanup happened more than a decade ago. As years passed, new people moved in, and younger residents never learned about the site. Others who did know assumed the lead problem was solved. The dustup around lead has mostly settled even if much of the toxic metal in the city’s dirt never left.

“Mass Poison”

When Prine moved into Omaha’s Field Club neighborhood in 2018, she loved the Queen Anne and Victorian-style homes that lined shady boulevards and how her neighbors decorated heavily for Halloween and Christmas.

While she had visited the home previously to see her husband’s family, Prine had no idea her neighborhood was in the middle of a massive environmental cleanup.

“The first time I heard about it was when my son had an elevated blood-lead level,” she said.

From 1870 to 1997, the American Smelting and Refining Company sat on the Missouri River in downtown Omaha, melting and refining so much lead to make batteries, cover cables and enrich gasoline that it was once the largest operation in the country, according to a 1949 newspaper article.

By the 1970s, researchers had proven lead was poisoning American children. Doctors in Omaha noticed kids with elevated blood-lead levels and published findings connecting the toxic metal in their bodies to the smoke pouring out of ASARCO and other polluters.

In the late 1990s, when city leaders wanted to demolish ASARCO and redevelop the site into a riverfront park, they had to figure out how to clean up Omaha’s lead legacy. They turned to the EPA, which declared a 27-square-mile swath of east Omaha a Superfund site, a federal designation that would allow the agency to clean up the contamination and try to hold the polluters responsible to pay for it.

The agency estimated the smelter, along with other polluters, had spewed about 400 million pounds of lead dust over an area, where 125,000 people, including 14,000 young children, lived.

The EPA won $246 million in settlements from ASARCO and others to fund the cleanup.

By 2015, most of the yards that tested above 400 parts per million had their soil replaced, and the EPA handed the remaining work to the city. The old smelter site was redeveloped into a science museum with a playground outside.

The project seemed like a success. The number of kids testing high for lead has dropped dramatically since the 1990s, though similar patterns exist nationwide and fewer than half the kids in the site are tested annually, according to data from the Health Department in Douglas County, where Omaha is located.

But evidence had already been emerging that the cleanup levels the EPA had set in Omaha “may not protect children,” which the agency acknowledged in 2019, during the first Trump administration. Managers wrote in a site review that “increasing evidence supports a lower blood-lead level of concern” than the 1994 health guidance that informed the cleanup plan.

Lead, even in incredibly small amounts, can build up in the brains, bones or organs of children as well as adults, said Bruce Lanphear, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who has studied lead for decades.

“Lead represents the largest mass poison in human history,” he said.

After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered its blood-lead level standard, the EPA’s Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation began working on new lead cleanup guidance for the EPA regions in 2012, said James Woolford, director of the office from 2006 to 2020. The EPA took a “cautious, studied” approach to how much lead in dirt is acceptable.

“Zero was obviously the preference. But what could you do given what’s in the environment?” he asked. “And so we were kind of stuck there.”

Then, in 2024, Biden stepped in.

If regional EPA officials applied the administration’s guidance to the Omaha site, over 13,000 more properties in Omaha could have qualified, a Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica analysis of EPA and city of Omaha soil tests found.

The number could have been even higher, records show. Nearly 27,000 properties, including those that never received cleanup and those that received partial cleanup, would have been eligible for further evaluation, EPA manager Preston Law wrote to a state environmental official in March 2024.

The EPA had also been discussing with city and state officials whether to expand the cleanup area: A map that an EPA contractor created with a computer model to simulate the smelter’s plume shows that it likely stretched 23 miles north to south across five counties in Nebraska and Iowa.

But cleaning up all the properties to the Biden levels could cost more than $800 million, the then-interim director of the Nebraska Department of Energy and Environment, Thaddeus Fineran, wrote to the EPA’s administrator in May 2024.

If cleanup costs exceeded the funds set aside from Omaha’s settlements, the EPA would have to dip into the federal Superfund trust fund, which generally requires a 10% match from the state, said Ashford, the EPA spokesperson.

That could mean a contribution of $80 million or more from Nebraska, which is already facing a $471 million budget deficit. In the letter, Fineran wrote that the state would “reserve the right to challenge the Updated Lead Soil Guidance and any actions taken in furtherance thereof.”

The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy, and Environment, as the agency is now called, declined an interview, referring questions to the EPA.

Researchers and decision-makers are likely taking a cautious approach toward what they agree to clean up in Omaha, Woolford said. Given its size, it could carry weight elsewhere.

“It will set the baseline for sites across the country,” he said.

“Hollow” Claims

The Trump administration may upend any plans to expand the cleanup.

In March, the EPA announced what it called the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” By July, about 1 in 5 employees who worked for the EPA when Trump took office were gone. The administration proposed slashing the EPA’s budget in half.

The administration promised to prioritize Superfund cleanups. But in October, it changed the lead guidance. As a result, more people will be at risk of absorbing damaging amounts of lead into their bodies, said Tom Neltner, national director for the advocacy organization Unleaded Kids.

“It signals that the claims that lead is a priority for them are hollow,” he said.

The Trump administration said Biden’s approach had “inconsistencies and inefficiencies” that led to “analysis paralysis” and slowed projects down.

“Children can’t wait years for us to put a shovel in the dirt to clean up the areas where they live and play,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

Under the guidance, the EPA could issue a lower standard for the Omaha site. But Robert Weinstock, director of Northwestern University’s Environmental Advocacy Center, said that’s unlikely unless the state sets a lower state standard than the EPA.

Trump’s guidance has some advantages in being more clear, said Filippelli of Indiana University. The Biden guidance seemed overly ambitious: Filippelli and other researchers estimated 1 in 4 American homes could have qualified for cleanup with an estimated cost of $290 billion to $1.2 trillion.

While Omaha could be the litmus test for how low the Trump EPA is willing to set cleanup standards, the new guidelines don’t inspire confidence that the administration will do more to clean up old sites where work is nearly finished.

“I imagine the inertia would be just to say, ‘Oh, we’re done with Omaha,’” he said.

The city has received no timeline from the EPA, said Steve Zivny, program manager of Omaha’s Lead Information Office. He’s guessing money will play a big part in the decision over whether to clean up at a lower lead level, though. About $90 million of the Omaha Superfund settlement remains.

“If the data is there and the science is there and the money’s there, I think we would expect it to be lowered,” Zivny said. “But there’s just so many factors that are not really in our control.”

If cleanup levels aren’t lowered in Omaha, advocates will have more work to do, said Kiley Petersmith, an assistant professor at Nebraska Methodist College who until recently oversaw a statewide blood-lead testing program.

“I think we’re just gonna have to rally together to do more to prevent it from getting from our environment into our kids,” she said.

A Buried Issue

Despite the cleanup efforts, Omahans are still exposed at higher rates compared with the national average, said Dr. Egg Qin, an epidemiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who has studied the Superfund site. Yet the city seems to be moving on, he said.

“Somebody needs to take the responsibility,” Qin said, “to make sure the community knows lead poisoning still exists significantly in Omaha.”

About 40% of the 398 people who have already signed up to have their soil tested by Flatwater Free Press and ProPublica said they did not feel knowledgeable about the history of lead contamination in Omaha.

That may in part be due to disclosure rules. When a person sells a home, state and federal law requires them to share any knowledge about lead hazards. The EPA’s original cleanup plan from 2009 says that should include providing buyers with soil test results.

But in most cases, there can be very little disclosure, said Tim Reeder, a real estate agent who works in the Superfund site. Omaha’s association of real estate agents provides a map of the Superfund site to give to buyers, along with some basic information, if the home is within the boundaries.

City and local health officials spread the word about lead through neighborhood meetings, local TV interviews and billboards. But most people don’t take it seriously until someone they know tests high, Petersmith said.

“Unfortunately, once it affects them personally, like if their child or grandchild or cousin has lead exposure, then it’s too late,” she said.

When Omaha pediatrician Katie MacKrell moved into a house in the Dundee neighborhood, she thought her kids were fine to play in the yard. Her son sucked his thumb. Her daughter dropped her pacifier and put it back in.

When their kids both tested high for lead, MacKrell and her husband went to work fixing lead paint issues in the house. When it came to the yard, her property tested for lead levels above the Biden guidance but didn’t qualify under the original cleanup threshold. And without government help, it could cost the couple more than $10,000 to pay for the remediation themselves.

The lead also caught Vanessa Ballard, a high school teacher and mom of two young boys, by surprise. She had imagined growing fruit trees in her backyard until she discovered lead levels high enough to potentially clean up under the Biden guidelines. Now, no one goes in the backyard. Her oldest son splashes in soapy water after making tracks for his Hot Wheels cars in the dirt, and she mixes droplets of iron with the kids’ juice every night to help their bodies repel lead.

“I have no hand in the cause of this, but I have all the responsibility in the prevention of it harming me and my family,” she said.

Prine will never know whether lead stunted Jack’s speech development, but she worries about it every day.

Starting kindergarten helped. But her son is still behind other kids. Prine said she tries to put on a brave face, to believe one day he’ll catch up. If he doesn’t, it’s hard not to suspect the culprit could be in her soil.

It seemed the government, at least for a short while, agreed. Now she, and so many others in Omaha, don’t know when, if ever, to expect a solution.

“Why does it take so long, when they say it’s not safe, to then come in and say, ‘We’re gonna take this seriously?’” Prine asked. “‘That we’re gonna help these kids and protect them?’”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251116-Gratz-NE-Lead14.jpg?resize=2000,1332",N,,2025-12-11 05:58:32.239629

The plan suggests creating a discount rate for low-income customers and banning utility shutoffs during summer heat.

Proposed regulatory changes include giving the state oversight in utility mergers and capping utility profit rates.

A recent poll indicates 87% of Indiana voters are concerned about increasing energy costs.

Indiana utility customer advocacy groups this week released a slate of ambitious reforms they say would promote affordability for struggling residential and small-business ratepayers.

The document calls for policies benefiting low-income customers, like discounts and a summertime shutoff ban, along with changes to state oversight and regulations.

“Hoosier families are stretched thin, and they need relief now from monopoly utilities who’ve pushed policies for years that led to this crisis,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, a clean environment and energy group.

“This plan gives state leaders a clear, practical path to lower bills that will protect Hoosiers most in need and build a more affordable, reliable energy future for every community in our state,” she said.

About 87% of Hoosiers were at least “somewhat” concerned about rising energy costs — with 59% “very” concerned — in a Bellwether Research poll conducted for Indiana Conservation Voters.

The survey of 800 registered voters statewide was performed Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1, over call and text, and carried an error margin of plus or minus 3.5%.

Robertson’s organization was joined by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility ratepayer watchdog.

“For too long, Hoosiers have been footing the bill for decisions they didn’t make and policies they didn’t ask for,” said Kerwin Olson, the coalition’s executive director.

“Indiana’s regulatory system should be built to protect consumers, but that goal can only be achieved if lawmakers give regulators the tools and authority it needs,” Olson said. “The solutions have been ready for years. The need is now incredibly urgent, and we hope lawmakers will do their part.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s largest electric and natural gas utilities, said the industry is “listening closely to customers, stakeholders, policymakers, and state leaders” as regular legislative work approaches.

“We recognize that many policy proposals will be considered this legislative session, and we share the concern for how the current landscape is affecting the people we serve,” association President Danielle McGrath said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “We remain committed to keeping energy reliable and affordable for our customers.”

She noted utilities already have some options for cash-strapped consumers.

“Beyond providing power, the industry plays a critical role in supporting our customers and communities. We offer a range of assistance and affordability tools that help manage costs and consumption, such as bill payment assistance, notifications and alerts, and flexible payment options,” McGrath said.

She added that Indiana’s residential energy prices are below the U.S. average and rank the lowest in the Earth North Central region — Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio — according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The plan, however, indicated residents are still hard-hit.

“Hoosiers are paying some of the highest energy bills in the Midwest,” it read. “… Families, seniors, renters, small business owners — everyone is feeling the pain.”

White paper’s suggestions

Recommendations in the “Help Hoosiers Now Ratepayer Relief Plan” are ordered by “how quickly they will affect Hoosiers,” according to the document.

It centers on a pair of policies targeting low-income households.

Under the first, lawmakers would establish a discount rate for each of the state’s investor-owned utility companies, applicable to ratepayers who qualify as low-income. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission would set the rate, which the plan suggests could be based on a 3% or 4% income burden threshold. The concept is similar to the 30% of income standard often used for housing affordability.

The second would prohibit shutoffs during high summer temperatures for participants in Indiana’s low-income home energy assistance program. State law already bans shutoffs for such households during the winter, from Dec. 1 through March 15, according to the plan.

The organizations also aim to shake up the regulatory space. They recommended reforming IURC’s jurisdiction in mergers or acquisitions involving utilities or their parent firms.

BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is close to purchasing AES Indiana, one of the “big five” investor-owned electric utility companies. Despite the potentially major implications, the state has no say, Axios Indianapolis reported.

Under other suggestions, lawmakers would require IURC to cap utility profit rates at the cost of capital and ban the commission from letting utilities include “political influence campaigns” in customer bills.

That would include activities related to lobbying, charitable giving, trade association expenses, litigation, investor relations and more. Utilities would file annual reports related to those activities, and the IURC would make them public.

Another proposal includes repealing or reducing cost trackers. Utilities can currently use them to adjust rates for certain expenses and recover those costs from customers on an ongoing basis.

Shrinking or getting rid of some trackers would “provide more stability in monthly bills and require utilities to go through the rate case process to pass along these costs,” the plan reads.

Other recommendations are longer-term endeavors.

That includes a revival of distributed energy generation policies, review of the state’s approach to controversial data centers and a requirement that big industrial energy-users participate in utility-led energy efficiency programs. They’d also help pay for the initiatives.

The plan additionally envisions a legislative confirmation process for IURC commissioners. The five members are appointed by the governor without lawmakers’ involvement.

And it delves into a contentious debate over utility-scale infrastructure siting. Indiana doesn’t have standards statewide, so it’s up to each of the 92 counties. Previous legislative attempts have failed amid pushback from local officials and residents.","https://www.courierpress.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/PEVC/87699309007-energybill-1646831272.jpg?crop=703,395,x0,y0&width=703&height=395&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 08:58:33.779361

The government agency purged basic facts about global warming from its website last week — including references to how human activity releases planet-heating carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The EPA’s page explaining the causes of climate change now focuses on how “natural processes,” like variations in Earth’s orbit and in solar activity, influence the climate.

“Human causes are not even on the list, which is simply misinformation. It’s false,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources. “And moreover, it’s clearly deliberate, because a week ago, that page correctly reflected the scientific understanding of climate change.”

At least 80 pages related to climate change vanished from the EPA’s site in early December. It’s one of the most far-reaching removals of climate change information from government websites since President Donald Trump took office in January. “Up till now, we really had not seen hardly any changes on EPA pages,” said Gretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites with the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative.

While important resources have already disappeared from other government sites — including the National Climate Assessments, a series of congressionally mandated climate reports translated for public consumption — many of the previous changes were language swaps, replacing “climate change” with more innocuous phrases like “future conditions” or “extreme weather.” The EPA’s most recent overhaul represents a more radical rejection of mainstream science.

“Yes, there’s been climate information coming down, but so far it hasn’t actually necessarily been the nuts-and-bolts climate science information,” Swain said. “This is pretty fundamental physical science.” The resources on the EPA’s site were used by teachers, businesses, and local and tribal governments, as well as the public, since they translated the jargon-filled language of scientific reports into something more useful and accessible.

For example, the agency deleted a resource explaining the signals of a warming world — everything from rising temperatures and melting ice sheets to the damage toll on wildlife and human health — with more than 100 charts and maps. Also gone is a website quantifying the physical and economic risks. The effect is to isolate climate change from the issues that affect people’s lives, Gehrke said: “It’s specifically targeting the information about why we should care.”

In response to questions about why the EPA’s climate change resources were removed, the agency said it was upholding “gold-standard science.”

“Unlike the previous administration, the Trump EPA is focused on protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback, not left-wing political agendas,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement. “As such, this agency no longer takes marching orders from the climate cult.”

Swain said the changes could be a way for the EPA to bring its public-facing information in line with the proposal to reverse the agency’s own “endangerment finding,” the scientific basis that allows the EPA to regulate carbon emissions. The agency is expected to finalize the repeal soon, in what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has promised to be “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

The changes to the EPA’s site are reminiscent of a report the Department of Energy released this summer, written by a group of five climate contrarians, arguing that climate change wasn’t as bad as mainstream scientists say. It can give people the impression that there’s a “debate” that climate change is a serious problem, when in fact there’s not, Swain said. If anything, the last several years suggest that the consequences of the warming that’s already arrived are worse than many scientists expected.

Official government websites used to be a source of unbiased information, but as federal agencies have altered them to align with the Trump administration’s talking points, some are becoming unreliable. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently changed its stance on the relationship between vaccines and autism, with a new page saying that a link between the two can’t be ruled out — horrifying current staffers, who said their employer was spreading misinformation. Most information on government sites remains trustworthy, though. The National Weather Service, for instance, is still putting out accurate weather reports.

“Until very recently, despite all of the damage that has been done to trust in government institutions over the last several years, I would say that the government websites, agency websites, still were among the most trusted sources,” Gehrke said. “And I do worry that that is really slipping away very quickly.”

The result is that the public is left to navigate a landscape where some government agencies are sharing credible facts, while others are generating misinformation. At the same time, quality, unbiased information just isn’t as easy to access as it used to be. Search results increasingly turn up AI-generated slop, while social media algorithms serve up posts targeted to individual preferences, giving people an off-kilter picture of reality.

“Siloed information is really tearing apart society,” Gehrke said. “People are making logical choices and logical analyses based on the information they have, but they are working with completely different sets of information. And that is a real problem.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EPA-sign-behind-tree.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-11 05:58:38.069918

Some critics of the governor, however, say that such reasoning is shortsighted in the face of the existential threat of climate change. Environmental activists and some officials in her own party have accused Ms. Hochul of abandoning the state’s climate law for politically expedient reasons; the governor faces a re-election bid next year.

“We’re in a moment where it’s incredibly important for New York State to lead on energy affordability and climate,” said Liz Moran, a New York policy advocate for Earthjustice, an environmental nonprofit. “Unfortunately over the past year, we’ve seen the governor run toward the opposite direction.”

While some business leaders support the governor’s push to use more natural gas and nuclear energy to supply the state’s grid, critics say that her focus on affordability has shaped several policy decisions that have undermined the state’s climate goals.

Some of Ms. Hochul’s moves in the past year have alarmed climate activists and like-minded Democratic leaders. She has embraced energy-hungry tech ventures, including a bitcoin mining operation in the Finger Lakes region. State officials recently agreed to a settlement, after years of litigation, to extend the life of the gas plant that powers the facility. She also backed a plan for an offshore natural gas pipeline near New York City that had previously been rejected three times because of environmental concerns.

Ms. Hochul’s administration delayed the implementation of an all-electric buildings law passed in 2023 that would have banned gas power in a wide swath of new construction. And the governor has not taken full advantage of a 2023 law that enables the state to develop publicly owned renewable-energy projects, though Ms. Hochul was among those who cheered a judge’s decision this week to strike down President Trump’s halt on wind projects on federal property.

Perhaps the loudest complaints, however, are tied to the 2019 climate law. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the ambitious legislation calls for New York to get 70 percent of its electricity from renewable sources like wind, solar and hydropower by 2030 and to shift entirely to carbon-free power a decade later.

But the state is at least six years late in meeting its first target of a 40 percent decrease in planet-warming pollution by 2030. And full implementation of the law is not possible without its accompanying regulations, which the state is two years late in putting into effect. The sticking point is the centerpiece of the law, called cap and invest, which would charge polluters for exceeding emissions limits and use those proceeds to invest in renewable projects and energy-efficiency initiatives.

In the spring, several environmental groups, including Earthjustice, sued the state, arguing that it was in violation of the climate law. By October, a judge agreed, ordering officials to publish the missing regulations by early February. The governor has appealed, saying she needs more time to review and possibly amend the rules.

Ms. Hochul’s delay is similar to her approach to the rollout of congestion pricing in 2024, when she temporarily paused the tolling program to consider the financial burden on New Yorkers, said Michael B. Gerrard, an environmental law professor at Columbia.

Requiring fossil fuel companies to pay fees through a cap and invest program, Mr. Gerrard said, could lead to an increase in some consumer prices, like the cost of electricity. In New York, where power rates are already 50 percent higher than the national average, natural gas remains the largest source of fuel for electricity.

In a poll this year, most New Yorkers surveyed said they believed that keeping energy costs low was more important than decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

State Senator Liz Krueger said that the cap and invest program would help accomplish both those aims. Her office cited one report that said households making under $200,000 a year would benefit from the policies subsidized by the program.

New York is still a leader on clean energy, Mr. Lovett of the governor’s office said. The state has exceeded its goals for the generation of solar energy, and supported two key private projects: a major offshore wind farm near Long Island and a transmission line that will deliver hydropower from Canada to New York City next year, he said. Ms. Hochul also announced a $1 billion investment fund earmarked for various renewable projects, including emissions reduction, over the next five years.

Critics of Ms. Hochul’s climate agenda have said they would also like to see the climate law back on track. The law’s cap and invest program has the potential to raise $5 billion a year or more, said Justin Flagg, the director of communications and environmental policy for Ms. Krueger.

And some of the business ventures backed by the governor are the same ones stoking the growing demand for energy.

Ms. Hochul wants to make the state a hub for tech companies, which can be energy-intensive. Currently in development is a $100 billion memory chip facility in Central New York that is projected to gobble up enough electricity to power nearly 1.5 million homes. Supporters of the project point out that as many as 50,000 jobs could be created.

New York’s business ambitions and emissions reduction goals are working at cross purposes, said Zilvinas Silenas, president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, an Albany think tank. “They are a train wreck in slow motion.”

The state faces an increase of up to 24 percent in annual electricity demand by 2040, according to the most recent draft of its energy plan. Aware of the mounting needs, Ms. Hochul has endorsed an “all-of-the-above” approach to energy instead of a singular focus on renewables. This, she has said, should help keep utility bills low.

Some experts say that these solutions, however, are time-consuming to build and expensive. Nuclear plants take years to construct and cost billions of dollars, and utility customers often end up footing the bill for gas infrastructure.

This month, Ms. Hochul has an opportunity to curb gas costs by amending a law that requires utilities to provide automatic gas hookups to new customers. Getting rid of the rule could result in about $581 million of savings on bills every year, according to a new analysis.

The governor is reviewing the legislation, Mr. Lovett said.

Ms. Krueger called the repeal of the rule, as well as programs like cap and invest, “critical affordability measures that we can’t afford to delay.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/11/multimedia/11met-climate-hochul-01-gfcw/11met-climate-hochul-01-gfcw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 07:59:02.080765

As energy demand is set to double in the coming years, this infrastructure programme is strengthening the UK’s capability in critical industries to power the UKs future.

Sumitomo Electric’s involvement marks a major milestone with the return of high-voltage direct current cable manufacturing to the UK for the first time in more than 20 years. The company’s £350 million investment at the Port of Nigg in Scotland will create around 150 skilled jobs, bolster local supply chains, and re-establish long-term industrial capability on British shores.

Alongside these national benefits, National Grid is committed to ensuring local communities also benefit from economic uplift. By working closely with Chambers of Commerce across Kent, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk, the company will help grow regional supply chains and look to expand skills opportunities across the south and east of England.

Together, these national and regional partnerships underline National Grid’s commitment to strengthening UK supply chains, supporting home-grown manufacturing, and investing in the skilled workforce needed to deliver a cleaner, more secure, home-grown energy future.

While the announcement of contract award for Sumitomo Electric, and Siemens Energy marks a positive step forward for the Sea Link project, it does not influence the ongoing development consent application. The application is currently under review by the Planning Inspectorate, ensuring that all aspects of the project are carefully considered.

Carl Trowell, President of Strategic Infrastructure at National Grid, said:

The Great Grid Upgrade is more than an energy programme, it is one of the UK’s biggest engines of economic growth. By investing in skills, securing our supply chain, and working with world-class partners like Siemens Energy and Sumitomo Electric, we are supporting tens of thousands of high-quality jobs and the manufacturing capability the UK needs for the long term.

The £1billion Energy Engineered in the UK (EEUK) programme will mobilise public and private investment to unlock critical supply chains and create thousands of skilled jobs.

As part of this programme, GBE is opening its £300 million GBE Supply Chain Fund: Offshore Wind & Networks, designed to tackle urgent bottlenecks in key components such as blades, turbines, transmission cables and converter stations.

This investment will build manufacturing capacity and ensure that the UK remains at the forefront of offshore wind deployment and electricity network innovation.

The fund is a key part of the UK Government's modern Industrial Strategy which sets out a ten-year plan to boost investment, create good skilled jobs and make Britain the best place to do business.

GBE will work alongside partners including the National Wealth Fund, Scottish National Infrastructure Bank, and The Crown Estate to unlock financing for large-scale manufacturing projects.

To cement the UK’s position as a global leader in deepwater offshore wind, GBE is also establishing a Deepwater Wind Commercialisation Programme in partnership with FLOWEX, bringing together industry leaders to unlock the industrial opportunity from the next frontier of offshore wind deployment.

With strong public backing and collaboration across government and industry, Energy Engineered in the UK will deliver:

High-value manufacturing capacity in the UK

Skilled, well-paid jobs for communities across the country

A resilient supply chain for future low-carbon technologies

Great British Energy CEO, Dan McGrail, said: ""Great British Energy is investing in British industry, we are helping to create jobs, driving innovation, and ensuring clean energy infrastructure is built here in the UK.

“This programme is about more than funding; it will help overcome the current challenges and ensure the benefits of a world-class supply chain are felt in communities across the country.”

Energy Minister, Michael Shanks, said: “We want our clean energy future to be built here in Britain as part of our modern Industrial Strategy.

“This fund will boost our manufacturing capabilities for offshore wind – supporting jobs and growth in communities across the country.”

Great British Energy Director of Supply Chains, Rob Gilbert, said: “Energy, Engineered in the UK, is a national initiative to drive down technology costs, crowd in private finance, and use our unique role between the public and private sector to support structured market interventions.

“This programme will help the UK energy sector to learn collectively, scale deliberately, and compete globally – not just on cost, but on homegrown, long-term capability. This will create jobs, economic growth, and energy security for all areas of the UK.”

Meanwhile, communities in Aberdeen and the North-east are to benefit from new funding to support renewable energy projects.

The support comes through a combination of Scottish Government and Great British Energy funding, the Community and Renewable Energy Scheme's (CARES) Community Energy Generation Growth Fund will provide grants for equipment, installation and feasibility work.

The Scottish government has received an additional £5.5million from Great British Energy, and has so far allocated £1.8million to 23 projects across the country.

Among those, Robert Gordon University is to receive £23,600 for the decarbonisation of its sports hall.

King's Church in Aberdeen will also receive £102,334 for a solar PV project.

A total of £20,000 is being made available to Birse Community Trust in Banchory, which is carrying out a hydro power feasibility study.

This year, the Community Energy Generation Growth Fund has made a total of 71 funding offers - totalling more than £7.3million - to community energy projects across the country.

Speaking ahead of the CARES conference, Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: ""Community-led energy projects are at the heart of Scotland's journey to net zero. By empowering local groups to generate their own clean energy with local solutions, we are not only cutting emissions but also reducing costs and creating resilient communities. These projects show what can be achieved when people come together with a shared vision for a sustainable future.

“This funding is giving communities the tools and confidence to take control of their own energy needs, keep money circulating locally, and build a fairer, greener economy.

“Scotland's transition to net zero must be inclusive and fair, and community energy is a vital part of ensuring that everyone benefits from the opportunities of a clean energy future.""

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

The BrightDrop vans reportedly are 2024 models, sold to Amazon in 2023, even before the brand was folded into the larger Chevrolet umbrella.

Production paused

In April of this year, GM temporarily paused production of the vans at its CAMI assembly plant in Ontario, laying off 500 workers. Past October, GM announced it was discontinuing BrightDrop entirely – ending the e-LCV only four years after its debut.

Justifying the decision, GM said BrightDrop suffered from weak demand for commercial electric vans in North America, changes in incentive structures (including the end of U.S. EV tax credits), and underutilization of production capacity.

From Amazon’s side, the test appears exploratory, a chance to regularly test various vehicle options, rather than a full-scale shift away from Rivian, which by mid-2025 had delivered about 20,000 of the 100,000 e-LCVs it was contracted in 2019 to deliver by 2030. This constitutes the bulk of Amazon electric delivery vehicles, which number around 35,000 worldwide.

Real-world deployment

The visibility of BrightDrop vans in cities such as Seattle, where Amazon delivery drivers have been spotted using them, indicates real-world deployment for the pilot.

However, the discontinuation of the model also holds a cautionary tale for the e-LCV sector. BrightDrop’s failure – despite backing by GM and interest from Amazon – shows that the transition to electric delivery vans remains extremely challenging in the U.S., given current market and regulatory conditions.

Despite the discontinuation of BrightDrop, and the less than optimal regulatory environment, GM is partnering with Hyundai to develop a new e-LCV for the U.S. market, slated for launch in 2028. This is an indication that GM is merely recalibrating, not ending, its e-LCV ambitions.

So perhaps e-LCVs in the U.S. are not dead yet. To succeed, however, the segment needs better timing, clear incentives, and more compelling value propositions to fleet operators.

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

Speaking in Paris before the deal was unveiled, he described the region as a clear example of how cheaper Chinese vehicles were reshaping the global automotive landscape.

Central to the agreement is the development of two small electric models for Ford, built using Renault technology. The first vehicle, which will be manufactured at a Renault factory in northern France, is scheduled to reach European customers in 2028. Jim says these cars would be smaller than any electric models Ford is planning for the US and would address a missing segment in the company’s European range.

Alongside passenger cars, the two groups will jointly engineer vans sold under both brands across Europe. Farley said the combined scale of the partnership could create a formidable force in the light commercial vehicle market, making it far harder for new Chinese entrants to gain ground.

While Chinese van brands have yet to make a major impact in Europe, he noted that competition with Chinese manufacturers is already intense in emerging markets. Renault chief executive François Provost said Chinese companies were expected to arrive in Europe in greater numbers and that delaying collaboration would be a strategic mistake.

Analysts see the partnership as mutually beneficial. In a research note, Oddo-BHF analyst Michael Foundoukidis says the deal would help Renault spread its fixed costs and improve factory utilisation, while allowing Ford to enter the affordable EV segment via a “capital-light” route. He added that alliances of this kind were becoming essential for traditional carmakers facing structurally lower-cost Chinese competitors.

The agreement emerged after Renault executives visited Ford’s headquarters in Detroit earlier this year. Both sides stressed that cooperation would remain limited to specific projects and that there were no plans for a merger.

Ford’s European presence has weakened in recent years, with its passenger car market share falling from just over 6% in 2019 to about 3.3% during the first ten months of this year. As part of a wider overhaul, the company has reduced its workforce and closed its Saarlouis plant in Germany.

The US manufacturer is also under financial strain as it invests simultaneously in conventional engines and expensive electric technology, particularly following the withdrawal of EV incentives by President Donald Trump’s administration.

By adopting Renault’s electric platforms and combining them with its own design language, Ford hopes to compete more effectively in Europe against established players and against Chinese brands. Ford already uses Volkswagen platforms for two European electric models and collaborates with the German group on vans, with Jim Farley saying the new Renault partnership would sit alongside that relationship.

Renault, meanwhile, stands to gain greater production scale. As Europe’s smallest mainstream carmaker, it does not sell vehicles in China or the United States, the world’s largest automotive markets. Partnering with Ford increases factory output and helps reduce the heavy costs associated with developing new electric vehicles.

The French group is actively expanding its network of alliances. From 2026, it plans to build vehicles in Brazil using platforms supplied by China’s Geely, and it is in talks with other manufacturers, including Chery, over further joint ventures.

François Provost says Renault’s long-term goal was to prove that electric cars could be produced in Europe at globally competitive costs, matching Chinese efficiency while retaining European manufacturing.",https://dealerfloor.co.za/assets/gallery/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/25FordRenau1.jpg?mtime=1765362188,N,,2025-12-11 02:59:50.660209

Ohio’s General Assembly voted in June to reduce funding for the state’s H2Ohio program by more than $100 million

The program was founded in 2019 by Gov. Mike DeWine, after toxic algal blooms threatened Toledo's water supply. The goal of H2Ohio is to improve and protect the state’s freshwater resources through a network of organizations across the state.

Those organizations include the Ohio Department of Agriculture, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and Ohio Department Natural Resources.

""That includes the ag industry and includes private septic systems. It includes municipality septic systems, industrial discharge and then working on our best filters that are out there and those are those natural wetlands,"" said Brian Baldridge, director of the Ohio Department of Agriculture.

Ohio's farms are included in the conversation because a major part of that program is helping farmers by giving them money to help reduce their runoff from crop fertilization.

Baldridge said farmer participation has been linked to a decrease in algae blooms due to a reduction in phosphorus runoff from fertilizer.

""The 2023 data, we know the projected and modeling decrease reduction in phosphorus was about 232,000 pounds. And then we take that in 2024, that number continues to grow because of the increase in acres we have participating,"" he said. ""In 2024 that takes our projected reduction in phosphorous to about 420,000 pounds.""

Joy Mullinex, executive director of the Ohio Lake Erie Commission, who helps coordinate the H2Ohio program, said these numbers seem to be backed by the U.S. EPA who did research into reductions of phosphorus since 2008.

""They have seen an 8% to 10% reduction in phosphorus going into Lake Erie. So their work doesn't indicate exactly what it is that has led to that reduction but without a doubt the agricultural BMPs and wetlands efforts are part of that equation as well"" she said.

Baldridge said multiple members of the ag commodity community advocated for the program. The General Assembly, however, still voted to reduce H2Ohio’s budget from $270 million to just shy of $165 million.

But Baldridge said this is still a better number than earlier versions of the budget which would have cut funding to $150 million.

""Being a past legislator, I've lived through those processes a few times and it's different chambers, different conversations, different levels of support,"" he said. ""But first off I have to say, the state legislature has been tremendously supportive of the H2Ohio program.""

As part of this year's funding cut, the Ohio Department of Agriculture’s budget was reduced by 11%, pushing them to decrease payments made to farmers in the program.

Despite these cuts, Baldridge said they are still in a good spot.

“The challenge becomes as we envision the growth in the future,"" he said. ""So you take an 11% decrease on this budget cycle and we still have high goals to continue to pull in and engage more producers.”

Beyond the ag sector, other state programs have had to shift operations to meet this reduced budget. Mullinex said certain types of work have been scaled back or eliminated to get ""the best bang for their buck.""

""We scaled back a little bit on some of the acid mine drainage work being funded through H2Ohio,"" she said. ""Some of the data collection on sentinel species in the rivers, we have done some muscle monitoring, so some of that work has been scaled back. Some of river coastline restoration work, preservation work, will be scaled back.""

With other programs taking a backseat, Mullinex said she believes they can still make a lasting impact on Ohio's water quality over time.

The program is also looking for other funding sources including the Ohio EPA who have utilized federal EPA funds through the state revolving loan fund.

""One [other] great federal investment has been the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,"" Mullinex said. ""It has received somewhere between $360 million and $400 million from Congress for several years and so, they've been a great collaborator and partner.""

Going forward, Mullinex said they are grateful for the public's patience as they sort through the details of a new funding cycle for H2Ohio.

""While we are seeing progress and it is fantastic, just know that it took us many years to get to the situation where we have harmful algal blooms recurring out on the lake and it will take a few more years before we will have results out in the lake where you can see a reduced algal bloom size,"" she said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8b4549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe1%2Ffb%2F08a462f2425eafc0c9ff07214e66%2F52907215562-de47195db5-o.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 03:58:10.446150

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) today announced the release of proposed regulations to strengthen the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to achieve affordable and effective reductions in pollutants contributing to extreme heat, damaging flooding, and other harmful climate impacts. The regulatory updates follow a multi-state comprehensive stakeholder program review that ensures access to sufficient RGGI emissions reduction allowances to meet expected energy demand and bolsters price protection for consumers.

“As New York and other states encounter rollbacks on the federal level when it comes to climate action, our commitment and partnership through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is advancing energy affordability and reliability, while reducing pollution,” DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “The proposed updates to RGGI are a strong example of how states can work together with an eye towards affordability to achieve emissions reductions that will improve air quality, protect our environment, invest in clean energy, and create healthier communities.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “NYSERDA continues to support the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and furthering efforts to reduce harmful emissions while ensuring price stability and affordability. In a time when New York and other states are facing federal headwinds, these proposed updates demonstrate a collective solidarity among states to continue to take action to ensure the health and well-being of our neighborhoods and communities in New York and beyond.”

In the face of federal rollbacks, DEC and NYSERDA’s proposals confirm New York’s commitment to energy affordability, climate resilience, and public health protection. RGGI continues to perform better than expected when the bipartisan program first launched more than 15 years ago. Emissions of carbon dioxide from the power sector in New York State reduced by more than 50 percent from 2005 levels and the energy transition is made more affordable statewide, with auction proceeds totaling more than $3 billion to date.

The funds support investments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification that ultimately provide savings to utility ratepayers. Net savings to participating ratepayers are expected to reach nearly $12 billion over the lifetime of the investments, providing a nearly 6-to-1 benefit based on investments of approximately $2 billion to date. In addition, an independent analysis(link is external) found all RGGI states also realized $5.7 billion in public health benefits over its first six years alone (2009-2014), including fewer premature deaths, heart attacks, and respiratory illnesses thanks to cleaner air, and added 48,000 job-years. Additional investments are expected as RGGI continues.

DEC’s proposed RGGI updates would reduce the regional emissions cap to approximately 69.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2027, then decline 89 percent relative to the 2024 cap through 2037. This would result in carbon dioxide emissions decreasing by approximately 10 percent annually through 2033, followed by 3 percent annually until 2037. The updated cap trajectory, which would result in a regional cap reduction of more than 60 million tons of carbon dioxide to approximately nine million tons in 2037 and subsequent years, was determined through consensus among participating states following consideration of stakeholder feedback and technical modeling and analysis.

DEC and NYSERDA, in its role as the administrator of auctions and the investment of auction proceeds, also proposed draft regulations to increase the size of the Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) and establish a second tier of CCR allowances to ensure availability of RGGI allowances to meet grid reliability needs, ensure affordability, and protect against cost volatility. In addition, the joint proposal would remove the Emissions Containment Reserve from RGGI design and increase the minimum reserve price to also help protect against price volatility in the RGGI market.

Updates to NYSERDA’s auction rule must be approved by NYSERDA’s Board. On November 17, 2025, the Board passed a resolution to approve publication of the proposed changes.

The proposed regulations and proposed auction rule are available on DEC’s website. Public comments will be accepted through February 17, 2026. DEC and NYSERDA will hold two virtual public hearings on February 9, 2026, at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.

Following the public comment period, DEC and NYSERDA will work expeditiously to respond to public comments and anticipate adoption of a final regulation next year, in advance of 2027 when the updated emissions cap is slated to go into effect.

In July, the states participating in RGGI, including New York, announced the finalized program updates(link is external) to strengthen the regional emissions cap. The updated program review secures progress through the tightened cap while providing additional flexibility if extra price protection is needed. The next program review is expected to begin no later than 2028.

On Monday, December 1, DEC also announced final regulations for Part 253 establishing a Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The rule will protect against anticipated federal rollbacks and improve New York’s understanding of sources of greenhouse gas emissions, more effectively monitor the State’s progress toward pollution reduction goals, and support the production of the annual GHG Emissions Report.

It’s about how we live our lives. It’s about the natural world and other species. The warming of the Earth is affecting everything — the cost of your coffee, chocolate and jeans. … It’s just everything.”

Before The New York Times, Layton spent 23 years as a reporter and editor at The Washington Post. During the pandemic, she was recruited by the Times to serve as deputy editor of the climate desk, and this year she was promoted to climate editor. She spoke with E&P about a 2025 reporting series, “50 States: 50 Fixes.”

“We wanted to show that there are people across the country, in red states and blue states, regardless of politics, who do care about the environment and are trying to make a change and to improve things,” she said.

Climate reporters Cara Buckley and Catrin Einhorn were the two primary journalists assigned to “50 States: 50 Fixes.” Visual Editor Claire O’Neill, Photo Editors Matt McCann and Elijah Walker and other newsroom staff were also integral.

“We wanted to make sure that we had a really good reflection of the country. … And we wanted to make sure that whatever it was we were spotlighting was a real solution, a real fix,” the editor explained.

One installment takes readers to Arizona, to a car-free community; in Connecticut, shucked oyster shells are now being recycled and used to rebuild oyster habitats in Long Island Sound. In Louisiana, rain gardens are mitigating flooding. From each state comes a solution. None of them will single-handedly change the trajectory of climate change, Layton stipulates, but they are examples of practical ways people are making small yet still impactful changes to better their communities.

They created a landing page.

“Conventional wisdom at The New York Times is that landing pages, they used to be really popular, and then they sort of fell out of favor,” Layton said. “But we decided that we were going to do a landing page, because we wanted to have a place where readers who are engaged in the series want to spend time. … It turns out we were right, and the landing page is really popular,” Layton explained.

The stories are visually compelling, with photography and video complements.

“We started getting responses from readers, which was really the most heartening part of this project. We included a call-out in many of the stories, inviting people to write in and tell us what’s happening in their neighborhood and community. To date, we have more than 3,000 messages. And we’re getting fan mail and comments … verbal bouquets from readers, thanking us and asking us for more. It means we have struck a chord. People are responding to these stories,” said Layton.

They also learned that their audience values real-world, practical and locally focused news on climate and the environment. “It’s not all about polar bears at the North Pole. It is about the drought your farm is facing. It’s about the flood that destroyed your neighborhood, and about the wildfires that raged through L.A., which everybody was so shocked by. The impacts of climate change are felt everywhere. There's really no escaping from it. We’re talking about summers where heat waves are really punishing. We’re talking about downpours that dump an extraordinary amount of water in your community. These things aren’t distant. You can feel them. You can see them, wherever you are in this country and elsewhere. … It is at your doorstep.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/editorandpublisher/original/20251203-150003-976-TOP.png.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 05:59:23.493166

According to the study, the half-RIN option still allows imports to be used but makes domestic feedstocks, including soybean oil, more competitive.
The EPA’s pending volume rule already projects record biomass-based diesel use, which would support domestic crushing and soybean oil utilization.
Soybean oil used in biofuels would drop 2.4 billion pounds in 2026 and 3.3 billion pounds in 2027.
Soybean oil used in biofuels would still fall by 600 million pounds in 2026 and 200 million pounds in 2027.","WASHINGTON, DC, US — A new economic analysis weighing the impact of a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal regarding biofuels Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits showed it would support healthy demand for US soybeans, according to the American Soybean Association (ASA).

The EPA is considering assigning 50% of the RIN credits to imported biofuels and biofuels made from imported feedstocks compared to domestic, which the study indicated would support soybean markets while protecting flexibility in biomass-based diesel sourcing, the ASA said.

The study, funded by the United Soybean Board and conducted by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services (WAEES), evaluated feedstock demand, farmer income and commodity pricing under different final decisions for the EPA’s proposed 2026–2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes.

The half-RIN proposal ensures that imported feedstocks remain available for biofuel producers but reduces policy incentives to substitute foreign oils for US soybean oil, the ASA said.

According to the study, the half-RIN option still allows imports to be used but makes domestic feedstocks, including soybean oil, more competitive. The EPA’s pending volume rule already projects record biomass-based diesel use, which would support domestic crushing and soybean oil utilization.

Researchers modeled three scenarios and found that the half-RIN approach delivers the greatest economic benefit to US soybean farmers across every major metric evaluated, the ASA noted. Removing the 50% credit reduction, even if the EPA later adjusts blending volumes, would reduce the value of US soybeans, lower demand for domestic soybean oil, and increase reliance on imported used cooking oil and tallow as biofuel feedstocks.

If the RVO is finalized without the half RIN:

Soy cash receipts would fall $2.1 billion for the 2026-27 crop and $2 billion for 2027-28.

The value of soybean oil and meal would decline $4.8 billion in 2026-27 and $6 billion in 2027-28.

Soybean oil used in biofuels would drop 2.4 billion pounds in 2026 and 3.3 billion pounds in 2027.

Foreign imports of tallow and used cooking oil would increase by 2.3 billion pounds in 2026 and 2.4 billion pounds in 2027, displacing domestic soybean demand.

Even if the EPA attempts a compromise:

A scenario where the EPA raises 2026–27 biofuel volume obligations to offset removal of the half RIN still reduces soy farmer income by $800 million in 2026-27 and $500 million in 2027-28.

Soybean oil used in biofuels would still fall by 600 million pounds in 2026 and 200 million pounds in 2027.

Imports of used cooking oil and tallow would still surge, increasing by 2.8 billion pounds in 2026 and 3.1 billion pounds in 2027.

“Soybean farmers support strong biomass-based diesel markets,” said Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA and a Kentucky farmer. “This study confirms that when policy values domestic feedstocks, rural communities benefit. The half RIN proposal still gives biofuel producers flexibility, but it keeps American soybeans competitive and keeps more value here at home.”

The full report, Implications for Biofuels and Feedstock Demand of the Granting of Full or Half RIN Credits on Imports, is available from the ASA upon request.",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2024/03/26/soy_biofuels_biodiesel_JJ-GOUIN---STOCK.ADOBE.COM_e.jpg?height=635&t=1711463060&width=1200,N,,2025-12-11 03:58:14.292709

Even some of BMW's 2026 model year cars won't be able to charge at a Supercharging station until next year.
As of this week, most BMW EVs will finally have access to Tesla's Supercharging network.
BMW confirmed to InsideEVs that these models—the 2026 BMW i5 and 2026 BMW iX—will not receive Supercharging access until ""Q1 2025"", which ends on March 31.
BMW has already committed to going NACS-native on future models starting with the 2026 BMW i5 M60.","BMW owners officially get Tesla Supercharger access this week.

Not all BMW EVs will be able to use the charging network, though.

Even some of BMW's 2026 model year cars won't be able to charge at a Supercharging station until next year.

BMW was determined to bring Tesla Supercharger access to owners by the end of 2025, after initially promising to deliver it by ""early 2025."" By golly, it finally happened with just days to spare. As of this week, most BMW EVs will finally have access to Tesla's Supercharging network.

Access to Tesla's network was supposed to happen in early 2025, however, BMW announced that it would be delaying the adoption late last year. Better late than never, though, as access is finally going live.

A friendly reminder that all of the BMW EVs on the road today still use CCS ports for DC Fast Charging, meaning that they will have to use an adapter to use a NACS-equipped Tesla charger—at least until the Germans make the switch to a native NACS port.

Nearly every modern EV wearing a roundel (the i4, i5, i7 and iX) support Supercharging access today with an asterisk. Current 2025 model year cars should have no problem,. But older model years and newer model years have an asterisk attached to compatibility. Likewise, not all models support Plug-and-Charge, either.

BMW recommends the Lectron charging adapter, a $174.99 adapter with a ""BMW approved interlock design."" Lectron notes that there are some 2026 models that will need an update (slated to arrive in Spring 2026) before they can use the Supercharging network.

BMW confirmed to InsideEVs that these models—the 2026 BMW i5 and 2026 BMW iX—will not receive Supercharging access until ""Q1 2025"", which ends on March 31. The later access for newer cars seems to have already confused owners in BMW's YouTube video comment section. BMW does note that it will have an official branded charger coming out next year during the second quarter, presumably after this update.

BMW i3 owners also receive no love here. There's no indication that owners of the quirky city car will ever get access to Superchargers, which is not entirely surprising given the age of the car. It's not much of a road tripper either way.

The good news is that adapters are just a temporary solution. BMW has already committed to going NACS-native on future models starting with the 2026 BMW i5 M60.

It's still a big moment for the Bavarian brand. Tesla Supercharging access has been almost a right of passage for manufacturers, and the fact that BMW has finally taken the leap should make owners feel a bit less charging anxiety while traveling this holiday season.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/NGMbjM/s1/bmw-tesla-supercharger-access.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 23:57:44.931271

— Heather Thompson, CEO of ITDP

NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES, December 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As the United Nations inaugurates its first Decade of Sustainable Transport (2026–2035) this December, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) is urging national and local governments, development banks, and private sector partners to turn the implementation framework into a decade of concrete, strategic action. The coming years represent a historic opportunity to redefine how the world can and will move: away from car-dependent systems centered on harmful fossil fuels towards more electric, efficient, and well-funded public transport networks.

The UN Decade of Sustainable Transport can, and must, be more than a slogan and a campaign. It needs to be an urgent call to align global ambition and partnerships with dedicated resources that ensure more governments, cities, and communities are engaged and equipped to build the clean, efficient, and inclusive mobility systems they deserve. For ITDP, that means turning vision into policy, policy into implementation, and implementation into scale.

The transport sector remains one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of carbon emissions, while also being among the most vulnerable to fluctuating fuel prices. In many countries, transportation costs are driving inflation, constraining public budgets, and limiting access to opportunities for millions of people. Drawing on ITDP's experience working in some of the most populous regions around the world, we know that we need decisive, urgent investments and political commitments to move the needle on the climate, the economy, and the well-being of all urban communities.

Central to ITDP’s call is the urgent need to scale up electric public transport as a cornerstone of every country’s energy security and economic resilience strategies. Transitioning mass public transport, especially bus fleets, to electric vehicles and infrastructure can be transformative for global cities. When supported by clean and reliable energy grids, this shift will dramatically reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, lower costs, and protect individuals and economies from volatile energy markets.

ITDP emphasizes that making such progress over the next decade will require strong coordination across governments and sectors. National Finance and Transport Ministries especially must work together to align their budgets, subsidies, and policies with long-term sustainability targets. Collecting more data and evidence on the economic and health benefits of sustainable transport will also be key to helping finance leaders make informed, strategic decisions. As most public transport systems remain chronically underfunded, developing financing mechanisms and structuring more public-private partnerships to support them are crucial on the road to 2035.

The necessary technical, financial, and policy solutions and evidence already exist to support electric mobility. In fact, electrifying public transport represents a vital new engine for economic and social growth. Better public transport services mean increased access to services, education, and job opportunities for more people, as well as significant cost savings for household budgets. On a broader level, further investments in charging infrastructure, battery production, and electric vehicle manufacturing create jobs, stimulate local industries, and attract international investment. For governments struggling with debt or fuel subsidies, redirecting funds toward sustainable transport can ease fiscal pressure and help meet climate and energy targets.

The benefits for air quality and public health are also significant, and many cities urgently need them. The impacts of tailpipe and non-tailpipe emissions from gasoline-burning vehicles are demonstrably linked to higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in cities. Transport electrification can significantly improve air quality, directly benefiting users and communities living near high-emitting transit hubs. What’s more, a lack of accessible public transport options also has significant implications for road safety, often forcing people to choose more dangerous journeys while increasing their vulnerability to vehicle collisions and air pollution. Reshaping urban transport would not only save economies billions of dollars in avoided healthcare costs but ultimately save numerous lives.

The UN Decade of Sustainable Transport needs to be an urgent call to align global ambition and partnerships with dedicated resources to encourage more governments and cities to build clean, inclusive transport systems for all communities. Again, this means stakeholders must focus on turning vision into tangible policies and resources that can be implemented and scaled globally.

“This UN Decade cannot just be another opportunity for meaningless declarations,” says Heather Thompson, CEO of ITDP. “We have the technology, expertise, and proven solutions to make transport systems better, more reliable, and more equitable. What is missing is the political will and the financial investments to make it happen. Policies, technologies, and resources are there; what is needed is for those in power to act. It is now up to our global institutions and national decision-makers to ensure that we see real action over the next decade.”

Regenerative agriculture is an approach to farming and ranching that goes beyond sustainability, aiming to improve soil, water, and air quality; boost biodiversity; produce nutrient-dense food; and even help mitigate the climate emergency by storing carbon. Its practices include agroforestry, conservation buffers, cover cropping, holistically managed grazing, limiting pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, and no-till farming.

US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced the pilot alongside Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the controversial man behind the MAHA movement. She said that ""we will deliver this support through existing programs our farmers already know and already trust.""

Angela Huffman, president and co-founder of the group Farm Action, a longtime advocate of regenerative farming, welcomed the pilot, noting that ""done right, this investment will help farmers lower their input costs, break free from the export-driven commodity overproduction treadmill, and move toward healthier, more resilient, and more profitable farming systems.""

Stephanie Feldstein, population and sustainability director at the Center for Biological Diversity, was far more critical of the initiative, warning that ""farmers trying to do the right thing for our environment need all the support they can get, but without clear standards, this ill-defined pilot program isn't enough.""

""Regenerative agriculture needs to be more than just buzzwords Big Ag uses to greenwash business as usual,"" said Feldstein. ""While the Trump administration promises money for sustainable practices, it continues to cut conservation staff, support the pesticide industry, roll back environmental laws, and play trade war games that hurt farmers and our food system.""

As Spectrum News reported Wednesday:

The USDA regenerative agriculture pilot program flows from a Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in September that included more than 120 initiatives to address chronic childhood disease. One of the report's key focus areas was to remove harmful chemicals from the food supply.

On Wednesday, Kennedy said the report promised farmers an ""off ramp"" to transition away from chemical fertilizers ""to a model that emphasizes soil health, and with soil health comes nutrient density... and a transition to a much healthier America for our children.""

When the second MAHA report was released in September, some environmental and public health advocates blasted the commission for echoing ""the pesticide industry's talking points,"" while Alexandra Dunn, CEO of the trade group CropLife America, celebrated that ""we were heard"" by the Trump administration.

The administration has also come under fire for constantly serving the fossil fuel industry; installing an ex-lobbyist, Kyle Kunkler, in a key role at the Environmental Protection Agency and nominating another, Douglas Troutman, for an EPA post; embracing herbicides including atrazine and dicamba as well as ""forver chemical"" pesticides; and urging the US Supreme Court to shield Bayer, which bought Monsanto, from lawsuits alleging that glyphosate-based Roundup causes cancer.

As Sarah Starman, senior food and agriculture campaigner at Friends of the Earth, highlighted Wednesday, the Trump administration has also been criticized for cutting billions of dollars in funding previously allocated to promoting regenerative agriculture and firing staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

The pilot, Starman said, ""is a step in the right direction, and we applaud the intent. But it will only be effective if USDA reverses the past year of massive cuts to on-the-ground conservation staff. Regenerative agriculture requires whole-farm, science-based planning, and right now the agency lacks the army of specialists needed to help farmers design and implement those plans.""

""In addition, phasing out harmful agrochemicals—the synthetic pesticides and fertilizers that harm human health and degrade soil health—must be at the center of any regenerative program,"" she stressed. ""The new initiative's incentives for integrated pest management fall far short of what is needed to help farmers get off the pesticide treadmill and spur a transition to a truly regenerative food system.""

""The initiative must be updated to include specific, measurable incentives for deep reductions in agrochemical use if it is to deliver truly healthy, resilient soils and promote human health,"" she added. ""Finally, going forward, all major farm subsidies should carry strong conservation compliance requirements so that every public dollar supporting agriculture also supports soil health, water quality, and climate resilience on every acre.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62304735&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C419%2C0%2C419,N,,2025-12-11 00:57:38.243497

“Is this the new normal?”

I was sitting across from Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, on the main stage of the 2025 DealBook Summit last week when I popped that question.

I wasn’t asking about market volatility or artificial intelligence hype cycles. Rather, I was asking whether we have quietly crossed into an era in which virtually every strategically important decision — on trade, technology, energy, even entertainment — now routes through one address: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and, more precisely, through the instincts of one man. The context was the machinations around the potential takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery. But as the day played out, it was clear we could have been discussing almost any major business decision.

“Andrew, there is no new normal,” Mr. Bessent insisted, batting away the suggestion.

But what clearly unfolded across nearly a dozen conversations with leading business and political leaders is that the United States is operating in a very different environment — a new economic order in which the federal government is no longer just a referee, a regulator, or even a customer. It is now the senior partner, the lead investor and the ultimate arbiter.

In a conversation with Larry Fink of BlackRock and Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, it became clear that the development of the crypto industry will be heavily reliant on the White House’s support. “Tokenization is inevitable” Mr. Fink said, suggesting it is “the next generation for markets” — but only with the permission of the administration.

Mr. Armstrong added that “2025, we’ll look back at this as when crypto went from gray market to a well-lit establishment.” But part of his argument is for Congress to pass a second piece of crypto legislation, the CLARITY Act, which would make it harder for future regulators to crack down on the industry.

The General Motors’ C.E.O., Mary Barra, explained that her company’s strategy has shifted along with White House priorities: As President Trump removed the E.V. tax credits, she is now dialing back on her expectations to sell more electric vehicles. She worked with the Mr. Trump to loosen emissions standards, after working with the Biden Administration to support them. And, of course, tariffs are rewriting the rules of where and how the company manufactures its vehicles.

Silicon Valley has proved particularly adept at adjusting to the Washington-driven business cycle. Palantir has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, in part, because it is one of the most favored companies of the Trump administration. And Alex Karp, Palantir’s co-founder and C.E.O., didn’t bother with the usual corporate diplomacy. He leaned into the new reality with almost religious fervor: “We don’t need belief — we need to be useful,” he said, framing his company not just as a software vendor, but as the digital arm of Western dominance.

One of the few leaders who seemed willing to acknowledge the risks of this new architecture was Dario Amodei, the C.E.O. of Anthropic. While others appeared to be jockeying for favor with the White House, he issued a warning about the prospect of irrational exuberance in tech investments.

“Some players are YOLO-ing,” he said, describing the reckless capital expenditure in A.I. infrastructure without naming a company in particular. (Most in the audience guessed he was referring to OpenAI, his former employer and biggest rival.) “They are pulling the risk dial too far.”

He added about regulation, or lack thereof: “I am concerned that there are some who see this technology as analogous to previous technological revolutions — as being like the internet, as being like telecommunications — where, yes, there are some issues, but the market will figure it out, which I think was maybe a more reasonable view in these previous technological revolutions. I think those who are closest to A.I. don’t feel this way.”

The Trump Effect extends to the geopolitical realm. Both Taiwan President Lai Ching-te and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered answers at times that seemed calibrated to genuflect to the White House. Mr. Lai said Taiwan’s relationship with the United States was “rock solid” despite the administration being noncommittal, at least publicly, about whether it would defend Tawian against an invasion from China.

In my final interviews of the day, I spoke with two political figures with very different perspectives on the current political moment. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has become perhaps the most outspoken critic of the president and is viewed as a front-runner among Democrats to seek the White House in 2028. While Erika Kirk, the widow of Charlie Kirk and the new C.E.O. of Turning Point, is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump and his approach.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/11/multimedia/11sp-dealbook-sorkin-SUB/11sp-dealbook-sorkin-SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 21:58:24.051965

“It’s a significant shift in operational requirements, and it represents an opportunity to create a more resilient and cost-effective grid,” Vegas said.
Wind power and natural gas trailed far behind solar and storage additions, adding more than 860 megawatts and 520 megawatts, respectively.
The state added more than three gigawatts of solar power in the third quarter, making it the second-largest quarter for solar additions, according to a joint report by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).
Solar and storage capacity are limited during the most critical periods during winter, such as early in the morning before sunrise or in the evening just after sunset.","Battery storage facilities and solar farms powered virtually all capacity growth in Texas’ electric grid throughout 2025, as the home of the nation’s oil and gas industry created almost twice as much new solar power as California.

More than 5,200 megawatts, or approximately 10,500 megawatt hours, of new battery storage made up the largest share of the more than 11,000 megawatts of new capacity, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), operator of Texas’ electric grid. Solar power accounted for the second-largest capacity addition, with more than 4,500 megawatts installed.

Pablo Vegas, ERCOT’s president and CEO, said during a board of directors meeting Tuesday that the new solar power represented “high” growth in intermittent power, while he characterized the new battery storage as “very rapid growth” of short-duration power supply.

“It’s a significant shift in operational requirements, and it represents an opportunity to create a more resilient and cost-effective grid,” Vegas said.

Wind power and natural gas trailed far behind solar and storage additions, adding more than 860 megawatts and 520 megawatts, respectively.

Vegas said the market continues to see low numbers of natural gas connections to the grid, despite the state’s $10 billion loan and grant fund to build more natural gas power plants. But he said there are “significant improvements” in interest among developers exploring natural gas connections to the grid.

Texas is leading the country in new solar capacity. The state added more than three gigawatts of solar power in the third quarter, making it the second-largest quarter for solar additions, according to a joint report by Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The U.S. solar industry installed 11.7 gigawatts of capacity nationally during the third quarter, a 20 percent increase from the same period last year.

Over the first nine months of 2025, Texas installed 7.4 gigawatts of solar, almost double the capacity of California’s newest additions. This comes despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to roll back renewable energy development in the U.S.

“This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA president and CEO.

The meaningful additions of solar and battery storage have positioned Texas’ grid to handle summer demand peaks well, with large amounts of solar generating electricity during the day and batteries helping the grid transition into the evening, Vegas said.

But winter continues to represent a higher risk period for ERCOT, Vegas said. Solar and storage capacity are limited during the most critical periods during winter, such as early in the morning before sunrise or in the evening just after sunset. But even then, the chance of rotating outages during the riskiest morning hours is around 1 percent, according to ERCOT reports.

That’s better than last year, when ERCOT predicted a 7 percent chance of rotating blackouts during last winter’s peak hours.

But ensuring the grid stays balanced during the winter months remains a concern, as ERCOT tries to innovate quickly to accommodate the growing variety of energy resources and to accommodate large energy users, like data centers and crypto mines, seeking to connect to the grid.

Vegas said both the state and ERCOT have worked hard since Winter Storm Uri, when blackouts across the state left many Texans without power or heating for days and at least 246 people died, to regain public trust that the state’s grid will hold up in Texas’ extreme weather.

ERCOT’s models show that if Texas experienced a winter storm like it did in February 2021 and demand exceeded record levels, the risk of rotating outages would increase 54 percent.

The forecast accounts for the state’s growth in recent years, projects that if Texas were to be hit by similar weather conditions to the 2021 storm, power demand would exceed 97 gigawatts. That’s far more than the current demand record of 85.5 gigawatts set during a scorching summer heat wave in 2023.

But the likelihood that demand will reach more than 97 gigawatts is less than one percent, according to the report.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2155016308-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 21:00:08.375515

But if we survive the century more or less intact, I think it may be because of another invention, this one about seven decades in the rear-view mirror.

It was an early spring day in 1954 when a trio of researchers, who had been working on power sources for remote telephones, announced the first practical photovoltaic cell, a silicon-based device that managed to convert about six percent of the sunlight that fell on it into usable energy. That was enough for the “Bell Solar Battery” to power a tiny toy Ferris wheel and a small radio transmitter—and in the process to shift the world.

The New York Times that day featured stories about a new US effort to “end the war in Indo-China,” and 28 places to eat along the brand-new New York Thruway, ranging from “snack bars to swanky cafes.” The United States announced that the Iraqi government would receive “military help,” bringing to “29 the number of countries receiving aid under the United States mutual defense assistance program,” and a minister gave a farewell sermon to his downtown congregation, warning that too many Americans felt as if they were “live pawns in a chess game over which they have no control.” Philco advertised its 1954 line of air-conditioners, available at Wanamakers (“mount flush with window sill!”); and the newly crowned Mrs. America, a “tall St. Louis blonde” named Mrs. Madison Jennings who possessed “a 35-inch bust, a 25-inch waist, and 36-inch hips,” insisted in her victory statement that “I’m still a housewife,” and “to prove it headed for the kitchen of the Mrs. America cottage in Daytona Beach to prepare lunch for her husband and son.”

And there, on the bottom of page one (right next to a story about the expansion of the polio vaccination campaign beginning the next day), there was an account of the Bell Labs press conference, under the headline “Vast Power of the Sun is Tapped by Battery Using Sand Ingredient” (New York Times 1954). The new device, the Times reported, was a “simple-looking apparatus made of strips of silicon, a principal ingredient of common sand. It may mark the beginning of a new era, leading eventually to the realization of one of mankind’s most cherished dreams—the harvesting of the almost limitless power of the sun for the uses of civilization.” The sun, the article noted, “pours out daily more than a quadrillion kilowatt hours of energy, greater than the energy contained in all the reserves of coal, oil, natural gas and uranium in the earth’s crust.”

Although the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is, for many, practically synonymous with nuclear risks, the magazine has always been preoccupied by the biggest challenges and opportunities facing humankind—including rapidly expanding energy demands and the search for novel energy solutions. In 1951, the magazine published an impassioned article on the “Future Uses of Solar Energy” by Maria Telkes, a Hungarian-American physicist who worked on the Solar Energy Conversion Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was “an enthusiast of solar energy possibilities,” as her short Bulletin biography described her (Telkes 1951).

In her article, Telkes addressed solar naysayers and skeptics: “Conservative engineers treat this subject with near derision, pointing to the fuel reserves in oil, natural gas, and coal. On the basis of use at the present rate and of use at a progressively greater rate, the estimated fuel reserves of the United States should last for 100 to 1,000 years. A goal definitely more remote than a life-span is of secondary interest to most people, in particular to many engineers, who prefer to engage in the pursuit of tangible results, achievable within a short time. However, technological changes that may occur during a century may be vividly imagined by comparing the technology of 1851 with that of today.”

Anticipating its revolutionary potential, Telkes compared the nascent sector of solar energy to the automobile and airplane—both one-time impossibilities that became transformative technologies. She urged more investment in research and technology development, concluding, “Sunlight will be used as a source of energy sooner or later anyway. Why wait?”

At first, of course, the solar cell was mostly a novelty—nowhere near as important as the nuclear power which was starting to spread across the world on the promise that it would soon be too cheap to meter. It was used for satellites, and eventually for trinkets like calculators and wristwatches—but it wasn’t until the early 1970s that the first house with solar panels was built in the United States, an experimental dwelling on the campus of the University of Delaware. The oil embargoes of that decade caused some to think that solar’s day had come: Jimmy Carter, in his final proposed budget, put aside money for research to ensure that solar would provide 20 percent of America’s energy by the year 2000. But Ronald Reagan was having none of it—he even pulled down the panels Carter had put on top of the White House.

All the while, though, the engineers kept slowly improving the technology. A key moment came late in the century, when the German Green party used its leverage in the country’s parliament to introduce a “feed-in tariff” to pay Germans a generous price for solar power they produced on their rooftops. That (expensive) mandate provided the demand that eventually led to the Chinese learning to mass-produce panels, and from that point on the fall in the cost of power from the sun has been fairly steady. Earlier this decade we passed one of those truly important milestones, as the cost of power from the sun slipped below the cost of burning coal and gas and oil. We now live on a planet where the cheapest way to produce energy is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. And that is truly epochal: It allows us to imagine that humans might, after about a million years, give up the habit of setting things on fire.

Combustion made us who we are, but it also of course is now endangering our hold on civilization. The byproducts of fire—especially carbon dioxide—have kicked off the single biggest change in our planet in the history of our species. So far, at least, it hasn’t been the dramatic mushroom clouds of nuclear explosions that changed our world; it’s been the explosions of billions of pistons in billions of cylinders, the firing of furnaces in homes and factories, the carbon pouring from the smokestacks of power plants in volumes that dwarf the volcanoes that were, for countless eons, the source of most carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We know now the danger of that combustion: the jet stream, the Gulf Stream, and the other large systems of our planet are now in violent flux. By every measure (temperature, humidity, insurance premiums) we are changing the planet even faster than during the five great perturbations of the geological past.

But this broken relationship with the Earth can—irony of ironies—be healed at least in part by a new relationship with our local star. Because, thanks to the solar cell, it is now prepared to offer us (alongside warmth, light, and photosynthesis) all the power we could ever use. The explosive growth of solar power (and wind power, which after all is just another face of the sun’s energy) in the last three years is the first chance to actually scale something that might slow down the rise of the planet’s temperature. It took us from 1954 to 2022 to get the first terawatt of solar power installed on our planet; the second terawatt took us two years; the third is coming online just about now. In May alone, China was installing a gigawatt—the rough equivalent of a coal-fired power plant—every eight hours. And its carbon emissions were finally starting to plateau and even fall. In California, where we’ve clearly reached a tipping point of some kind over the last two years, the state is able to supply more electricity than it uses from renewable sources most days: the world’s fourth-largest economy is using 40 percent less natural gas to generate electricity this year than it did two years ago, which is the kind of number that could actually knock something substantial off the eventual temperature of the planet.

What was once a battle over technological feasibility and cost is now almost entirely one of ideological politics. The Trump administration, guided by its fossil fuel donors, has realized the threat that solar power poses to the profits of the hydrocarbon cartel, and is doing everything within its power to shut it down. That will cause tragic delay, but it will also mean that America is no longer the decisive player in this story: We’re absenting ourselves from global leadership on climate and energy, and ceding that position to China. This may have the paradoxical effect of speeding clean energy adoption in the rest of the world, which after all accounts for more than 85 percent of carbon emissions. China’s trading networks may turn out to be the path on which clean energy spreads: Already, in Asia and Africa, we’re seeing extremely rapid adoption not just of solar panels but of technologies like electric vehicles that make full use of that new flood of power.

Though markets will do much to spread this inexpensive power, there’s no guarantee that this will happen in time—the speed of solar deployment is matched only by the speed of spreading climate damage. But it is definitely the first scalable answer to global warming, the first thing that’s given us a chance of limiting the damage. And so we must push for it with all our might.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has long championed solar power and other renewable energy sources for the sake of humanity and the planet (the Telkes article is just one example of many). In the face of political resistance and potent disinformation, it must continue to match its dire warnings with optimism grounded in facts.

The sweetest irony, of course, is that ultimately this is the twentieth-century’s nuclear revolution made real. Because the biggest reactor in our neck of the woods is the sun, firing prodigious amounts of energy our direction as it endlessly converts hydrogen to helium. The middle of the twentieth century still turns out to be the crucial moment—just not quite in the way we once imagined.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/L_Solar-farm-Minnesota.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-11 03:58:05.820533

ExecutiveSummary

The clean-energy transition won’t be achieved by turbines on hilltops or electric-vehicle (EV) rollouts alone. It will be achieved when clean electricity turns up as lower bills and fewer hassles for people. That depends on how the system evolves, and particularly how it integrates artificial intelligence. This technology could help create a system in which market design, data integration and regulation enable cheaper, clean power to flow easily to homes and businesses – but if these layers continue to operate in siloes, they will remain trapped in inefficiency.

Rethinking markets, modernising regulation and building digital infrastructure that centres the consumer aren’t ribbon-cutting projects, but the government’s success or otherwise in doing so will determine whether the transition feels easy and affordable or clunky and costly.

Public support for climate leadership rests on that difference. Ipsos polling from 2024 shows backing for climate action remains strong, especially for practical, money-saving measures like improving home efficiency.[_] But support is more cautious than it once was, shaped by high bills and cost-of-living pressures, with many people expecting the transition to bring short-term costs. This creates a fragile consent environment in which people will only back green growth when government can show how bills stay predictable, when processes are simple, and when benefits are visible in homes and communities.

AI can do this by making the system work for people. It can turn data into action so households and businesses automatically use the cheapest, cleanest power available, without needing to track energy tariffs or timings themselves.

Today, too often, the opposite happens. Consumers bear the costs of a system that fails to use clean power when it’s available, losing out not only in the form of constraint payments to clean-energy generators when there isn’t enough grid capacity for their power, but also in higher network charges and the wider costs of relying on more expensive generation. This year in Britain, more than £346 million has been spent on wind curtailment because the grid couldn’t absorb excess generation,[_] with costs expected to reach £8 billion by 2030 if nothing changes.[_] Electrification will add further pressure as demand for EVs and heat pumps grows, driving more reinforcement and higher costs unless demand is managed more smartly.

AI can change this equation. Used responsibly – with clear consent, transparency and control[_] – AI can make systems efficient in a way that people can feel. It can forecast supply and demand, balance generation and storage in real time, and coordinate how power is used across homes, fleets and factories so that cheaper renewables are not wasted. It can also automate the back-end processes – verification, settlement and data exchange – that turn those efficiencies into visible savings on bills. The result is not a new layer of technology for people to manage, but a smarter system that quietly lowers costs and improves reliability. Done well, it turns a system that informs people when power is cheaper into one that automatically makes it cheaper.

That change is already starting to take shape. For businesses, startups like Q Energy offer AI-optimised “smart battery” tariffs that guarantee around 10 to 25 per cent savings on electricity bills when paired with on-site storage.[_] For households, similar efforts are emerging via smart EV-charging and flexible tariffs.[_] Together they show what is possible when automation and market design work in sync by using system intelligence to create consumer simplicity.

The government should work across four key pillars to make this future real: Markets, Regulation, Data and Consumers. The first three create the conditions for change; the fourth, delivering for households and businesses, is where people feel the benefits.

The UK already has much of what is needed: strong renewable resources, millions of smart meters, functioning markets, global leadership in AI and a public sector willing to lead. It is focus and follow-through that are missing. To unlock AI’s full potential, government must lean harder on its own delivery system, using energy regulator Ofgem, the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ), the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (DSIT), and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to drive regulatory and market innovation, not just oversight. That means modernising market design, regulation and data infrastructure so AI can quietly coordinate supply, demand and flexibility in the background, and aligning energy and digital policy so efficiency and flexibility become the default design principle of the system. Done right, the UK can lead globally in showing how AI makes clean energy not just possible but practical – turning climate ambition into lower bills, smoother operations and a transition people want to back.

Chapter 1

HowAICanBringCostsDown

In the UK today, the power system is in transition, but much of its design still assumes a world of central power stations, one-way power flows and predictable demand. That legacy is colliding with something very different: a diffuse, fast-growing network of wind and solar as well as millions of assets at the edge – EVs, heat pumps, home batteries, rooftop PV – and a blurring of supply and demand as households can flex or even sell electricity back to the grid. More variability means far more coordination, with millions of timing-sensitive decisions across networks and markets. Delays in that coordination help drive higher costs. In 2024, the UK curtailed about 8.3 terawatt-hours (TWh) of wind, costing consumers between £390 million and 400 million,[_] and in 2024–25 the system operator spent about £2.7 billion balancing the grid, with constraints taking a large share.[_]

Markets and networks have not yet caught up with that shift. Many rules still reward the volume of energy generated more than when and how power is delivered. Information flows are also episodic rather than continuous, data sit in silos, and tariffs generally don’t reflect real-time cost or carbon – a legacy of the dispatchable era that makes less sense in a renewables-rich system. Flexibility – using demand, storage and distributed generation to adjust when power is consumed or supplied – can absorb cheaper renewables and relieve local stress,[_] but the infrastructure to deploy it quickly and reward it through predictable price signals and simple, auditable settlement between generators, suppliers and consumers is incomplete.

This points to a critical bottleneck: coordination friction, or the drag from fragmented data, inconsistent signals, and slow, patchy verification across markets and networks. This kind of friction blunts the use of flexibility, delays settlement and leaves operators working with partial visibility. The net effect is that flexibility goes under-used, curtailment lingers and savings reach people unevenly.

AI can help change this. It can act as the automation and optimisation layer for decarbonisation – not a replacement for infrastructure, but the intelligence that makes existing assets work harder and smarter, helping turn variability into value. While delivering cheaper electricity requires significant changes, as laid out in our recent paper Cheaper Power 2030, Net Zero 2050, AI has an important role in enabling that delivery. When used as an automation and optimisation tool by operators, suppliers, aggregators and even households (through smart devices and services), AI can:

Forecast and shift: anticipate supply, demand and constraints, then move flexible load and storage into cheaper, greener hours. This reduces curtailment, balancing costs and bill volatility.

Automate and verify: match homes, businesses and fleets to the right energy tariffs and services, and verify shifted kilowatt-hours automatically so credits arrive on time and without friction.

Target investment: use predictive modelling to defer or right-size reinforcement and accelerate connections, bringing clean generation onto the grid faster and reducing the costs passed to consumers.

Reduce soft costs and risk: automate applications (for grid connections, market participation and scheme enrolment among others), performance and compliance reporting, and dispute resolution; build reliable performance evidence so the risk level investors price in is lower, pushing costs down for everyone.

Maintain high reliability: apply predictive maintenance and faster fault detection to head off outages and reduce operational spend.

This marks a shift from using data to surface insights to using data to drive action. Intelligence becomes not just descriptive but operational, turning flexibility into an automatic function of the system.

With AI acting as an enabling coordination layer, a different future is possible. Smart energy tariffs become the default; appliances and cars auto-schedule when they draw power to optimise for price and availability of renewables; personal or business AI “energy agents” quietly optimise when and how power is used, drawing on live prices and grid signals to lower costs automatically; bills fall as use shifts to cheaper, greener hours without constant attention. Behind the scenes on the grid, millions of behind-the-meter devices respond automatically to system signals; models anticipate local stress and trigger demand response instead of relying on more expensive network upgrades or higher-cost power plants; and aggregated flexibility smooths peaks and absorbs oversupply. System costs fall, and with the right policy settings in place, savings can flow through to bills.

For the wider system, the logic also shifts. Markets begin to reward outcomes. Rather than being driven by fixed participation rules and administrative requirements, markets are geared towards how much demand was shifted, how quickly faults were spotted, how efficiently flexibility was used. While these outcomes already matter today, they are often hard to see or reward consistently. With better data and automation, they can become the primary basis for value. And government’s role tilts away from funding hardware on a project-by-project basis and towards building the market and digital conditions for coordination – in other words, trusted data access, standard application programming interfaces (APIs), continuous settlement and clear regulatory pathways for AI-enabled services to scale safely.

Put simply, today’s system is reactive, centralised and costly; an AI-enabled system is proactive, distributed and cost-efficient. In that future, the routine pieces – meters, data pipes, tariffs and regulation – form the backbone that enables clean power to be delivered more reliably and cheaply, sharing the savings fairly. AI doesn’t replace pylons or politics; it makes the system work for people.

Chapter 2

HowGovernmentPolicyMustChange

The government cannot manage this transition with yesterday’s methods. The role of policy is not to pick winners technology by technology, but to create the conditions for AI to stitch them together into services that work for people. If the data, digital infrastructure, regulatory frameworks and market signals are aligned, AI can help make low-carbon living the default. To get there, government must rethink the market, regulatory, data and digital foundations so clean, consumer-facing services can flourish.

Rethinking Markets

If AI is to lower energy bills for households and businesses, electricity markets must be rewired so efficiency can flow through the system. This requires redefining incentives.

Today, savings that could be unlocked in any one layer of the energy system – for example, in distribution – are unable to reach the end consumer because wholesale, balancing and retail markets remain tied to old cost structures. Optimisation of how the system is run should be a design principle of market rules, not an incidental outcome, so reductions in system costs show up in bills. To help make this happen, DESNZ, supported by His Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) and DSIT, should set a joint strategic steer requiring Ofgem and NESO to embed flexibility, digitalisation and AI-enabled coordination.

Recommendation: Set a joint strategic steer across DESNZ, HMT and DSIT directing Ofgem and NESO to embed flexibility, digitalisation and AI-enabled coordination as core design objectives of market reform.

Delivering this shift in market design is crucial to unlocking the full potential of AI in the system. Without markets that reward timing and flexibility, the technologies able to provide it cannot scale. But the value flexibility could deliver if made central to market design is hard to capture because it is still treated as an add-on rather than a core market function. The UK has made progress (for example by piloting local flexibility and publishing a clean-flexibility roadmap[_]) but now needs to scale. NESO should lead work through the Electricity Market Reform programme to align the rules that determine who can take part in flexibility services and how their actions are measured, ensuring that those shifting demand or generation face coherent incentives, prices reflect real-time system value, and actions rewarded in one layer of the energy system are recognised across the rest. Designed this way, AI can help lower the cost of each unit of energy and those savings can reach consumers.

Recommendation: Align market layers so system savings flow through to consumers, with NESO leading work under the Electricity Market Reform programme to integrate flexibility participation and performance rules.

Markets should also reward measurable reductions in system cost, not just availability. When AI shifts demand or generation at the right moment, that value should be recognised automatically and settled transparently. To make that possible the UK needs shorter trading windows, open and interoperable data interfaces and updated market codes such as the Balancing and Settlement Code (BSC) and Retail Energy Code (REC), alongside distribution system operator (DSO) rulebooks. Ofgem’s ongoing work on Market-Wide Half-Hourly Settlement (MHHS) should be extended to ensure interoperability of data and verification standards, giving market participants a common foundation for automation and continuous settlement. These are not technical niceties but the machinery that makes efficiency measurable, tradable and visible on bills.

Recommendation: Extend Market-Wide Half-Hourly Settlement to include shared interoperability and verification standards, ensuring that automation and continuous settlement operate on a common foundation.

Running the power system itself also has to change. Instead of occasional, manual adjustments, the system should operate through a smarter process that uses real-time data to balance the grid continuously at the lowest cost. That means valuing actual performance, publishing simple measures of efficiency and acting on them. One useful metric is skip rates: how often a cheaper balancing action is passed over. Reporting this routinely would expose avoidable costs and build confidence that dispatch is genuinely merit-based.

At the local level, flexibility must be part of normal operations, rather than a patchwork of pilots. DSOs should be able to trigger and verify flexibility automatically when grid conditions demand it, using consistent contracts and measurement standards so participation is interoperable. Early initiatives like Megawatt Dispatch and the Local Constraint Market show what is possible. DESNZ and DSIT should ensure that the digital-spine initiative and related work through the Energy Networks Association converge into a single, interoperable interface for flexibility and constraint data, with Ofgem embedding its use in market and network codes and DSOs responsible for implementation. That would let AI optimise across local and national networks in real time, reduce duplication and curtailment, and lower network costs – benefits that should flow through to bills.

Settlement and retail also need to keep pace with automation. Half-hourly settlement is a milestone, not the endpoint; AI often acts within minutes. Government should complete MHHS as a foundation, then test sub-half-hour or event-based settlement where it clearly reduces costs, such as balancing or constraint management. The aim is not “five minutes everywhere”, but pricing and settlement that are timely enough for automation, accurate enough for investment and simple enough for consumers to see the benefit.

Finally, reform should be tested in the real world. A National AI Energy Sandbox, led by Ofgem, NESO and DESNZ, could trial new rules safely – allowing supervised AI participation with clear guardrails on transparency, auditability and consumer consent – and scale what works. Building on Ofgem’s existing Energy Regulation Sandbox it would allow supervised AI participation across wholesale, balancing, flexibility and retail markets under clear guardrails for transparency, auditability and consumer consent, enabling system-level testing of market design changes and scaling what works.

Recommendation: Establish a National AI Energy Sandbox led by Ofgem, NESO and DESNZ to test new market and regulatory rules safely, under clear guardrails for transparency, auditability and consumer consent.

Taken together, these are not tweaks. Without clear flexibility products, orchestration has nowhere to sell; without faster settlement, revenue certainty is lost; and without interoperable data and aligned incentives, efficiency gains get stuck. Put these foundations in place and the UK can build a system that learns, adapts and lowers bills in real time.

Modernising Regulation

If redesigning markets helps the system learn how to assign value, modernising regulation determines whether AI can actually deliver those savings to people. The shift is from prescriptive, process-based rules to outcomes-based, data-driven oversight. That transition has begun, but at a pace too slow for the change now needed. Regulation must evolve quickly enough to match the technology it governs. Instead of dictating how flexibility or AI services must operate, regulation should focus on whether they deliver the right outcomes. Ofgem should codify the targets of comfort, fairness, reliability and bill savings and publish a consistent measurement-and-verification framework so providers – whether human-run or AI-enabled – can prove results in a standardised, auditable way.[_]

Recommendation: Shift regulation from process-based oversight to outcomes-based assurance, directing Ofgem to judge success by comfort, fairness, reliability and verified savings rather than compliance with static rules.

Recommendation: Codify a single measurement and verification framework so suppliers, aggregators and AI-enabled platforms can prove performance consistently and transparently.

Ofgem is moving in this direction – from household and industrial demand to system-operator services – framing objectives around fairness, flexibility and reliability, and running an innovation sandbox (as mentioned above). Progress, however, remains cautious and fragmented. Much of the rulebook still reflects fixed tariffs and manual operations, which creates friction for AI – sometimes explicitly through conditions written for the UK’s legacy system, and sometimes inadvertently where it is unclear how rules apply to automation at speed and scale.

This is why the sandbox should become a standing, graduated pathway. With clear guardrails (such as explicit consent, comfort floors and overrides, audit trails and routes to redress) pilots can run safely at pace and reveal where rules genuinely need to change. Ofgem could adopt a “progressive licensing” model, where pilots that meet defined outcome tests automatically scale without restarting approvals. The sandbox should become a standing, always-open pathway, allowing projects that meet baseline guardrails – consent, transparency, reliability, data protection – to proceed under time-limited derogations. Used this way, the sandbox becomes a discovery engine for reform, not simply a venue for temporary exceptions. To give this staying power, Ofgem should embed the sandbox as a permanent regulatory function with dedicated resourcing and annual public reporting on learnings adopted into code or licence changes.

Recommendation: Create a standing regulatory sandbox with a progressive licensing pathway, allowing projects that meet consent, transparency and reliability guardrails to scale safely without restarting approvals.

As AI takes on more operational decisions – from forecasting and scheduling to automated dispatch – regulators will need a practical mechanism for certifying and supervising algorithmic participation. Building on Ofgem’s AI regulation laboratory, or “Reg Lab”, certification could focus on transparency, auditability, cyber-security and human oversight, ensuring that automation remains accountable without stifling innovation. DESNZ and DSIT should back the Reg Lab as the central coordination point for testing and assurance, linking it to national work on AI safety and governance so energy remains aligned with wider cross-government standards.

Recommendation: Strengthen Ofgem’s AI Reg Lab as the central coordination point for testing and certifying algorithmic participation, supported by DESNZ and DSIT.

Delivering this requires coordination. Ofgem should codify outcomes, set standards and formalise the pathway from pilot to business as usual. This should include clear timelines, tiered licensing and standing sandboxes for suppliers and aggregators, DSOs and NESO as flexibility buyers, and tech platforms coordinating EVs, heat pumps and storage. Market operators and the organisations that manage the rulebooks governing energy markets and networks should provide AI-ready test environments and be given a mandate to innovate, testing small rule changes under Ofgem oversight. To maintain coherence, DESNZ should convene a cross-regulator energy and data innovation forum bringing together Ofgem, DSIT and the ICO to align policy on AI governance, data standards and consumer protection. This coordination across government is crucial to ensure the regulatory system keeps pace with technology.

Recommendation: Convene an energy and data innovation forum bringing together Ofgem, DESNZ, DSIT and the Information Commissioner’s Office to align policy on AI governance, data standards and consumer protection.

The risk is not only that regulation lags; without deliberate design it can quietly stifle AI-enabled savings through inertia. The fix is to embrace experimentation, regulate based on outcomes, and treat discovery as part of the job, so AI can turn variability into value and make clean power cheaper and easier for people to adopt.

Building Data and Digital Infrastructure

AI can only optimise what it can see and control. To move from insight to action, government must treat data not as a reporting mechanism but as operational infrastructure through which AI can act on real-world conditions. When operational data are slow, patchy or locked away – and when the digital tools that put data to use are treated as short-term experiments – automation stalls.

While the UK already has millions of smart meters and connected devices emitting useful signals, the system still treats data and digital infrastructure as supporting acts rather than core to the system. The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology has estimated that digitalisation-enabled flexibility could cut costs by up to £10 billion a year by 2050[_] – savings that depend on these coordination tools being built, maintained and governed as part of the system’s fabric.

There is broad consensus on what needs to change. As TBI’s Cheaper Power 2030, Net Zero 2050 argues, a smart, open energy-data environment with clear standards, trusted access and timely release is now a prerequisite for cheaper power. The next step is to move from insight to action. Today, data can show where flexibility would help, but the UK needs an AI-ready system that lets data trigger change automatically – shifting load, adjusting prices and coordinating devices the moment clean power is abundant. To make that possible, digital tools can’t sit alongside the system; they must become part of its operational core.

Regulators are beginning to take digital tools and those that allow flexibility more seriously. While RIIO-ED2’s DSO incentives[_] push networks to improve visibility of their systems, coordinate flexibility and use digital tools to manage local constraints, digital infrastructure still isn’t treated as being on par with physical reinforcement. Delivery remains uneven, with variable hosting-capacity maps, fragmented consumer-data access, scarce synthetic datasets for testing, and many coordination platforms or APIs relying on time-limited innovation pots rather than stable, regulated support. DESNZ, supported by DSIT and HMT, should now embed digital delivery into core network-planning and funding frameworks, making investment in data and software eligible under the same business-case rules as physical upgrades.

Becoming AI-ready means creating a data and digital backbone that is planned and funded with the same predictability as the physical grid. That means treating energy data as a first-order system asset that is specified, governed and published to shared standards. Priority operational data sets should use common schemas and identifiers, with NESO, DSOs and suppliers releasing them on consistent timetables and in machine-readable formats so optimisation services can operate seamlessly across regions. DESNZ and DSIT should use Ofgem’s forthcoming data and digitalisation strategy as the vehicle for this – setting mandatory publication standards and aligning incentives across DSOs to deliver them. A single, consent-managed route for household and small- and medium-sized enterprise data would give customers control and confidence, while high-fidelity synthetic data sets – artificial data sets that replicate the patterns of real energy data without revealing any individual customer information – could fill gaps where privacy or commercial limits prevent full release.

Recommendation: Treat energy data as core national infrastructure, embedding mandatory publication standards for priority data sets within Ofgem’s forthcoming data and digitalisation strategy.

Alongside trusted data, the UK needs a stable digital operating layer. Platforms that turn data into action – forecasting hubs, constraint and needs services, verification tools and asset registries – should have clear stewardship, predictable funding and open interfaces. Investment decisions should weigh digital solutions as seriously as physical upgrades, recognising where software can defer, right-size or better target network upgrades. DESNZ and DSIT should formalise and fund a long-term digital-infrastructure plan, building on the digital-spine prototypes, to turn current digital pilots into a nationally scaled backbone with enduring governance and investment. Public procurement can help standardise expectations by requiring interoperable, API-ready systems across the public estate.

Recommendation: Integrate investment in digital coordination tools into network funding frameworks, ensuring that software and data platforms are eligible under the same business-case rules as physical reinforcement.

Recommendation: Develop and fund a long-term digital infrastructure plan to turn pilot initiatives such as the “digital spine” into a nationally scaled, enduring backbone with clear stewardship and accountability.

Finally, an AI-ready power system needs a coordinated environment in which new digital and market tools can be tested safely before they go live. A national framework – linking representative data sets, standard APIs and simulated market and network rules – would let operators, suppliers and innovators trial tariff designs, congestion management and verification methods against realistic system conditions. Ofgem and DSIT could co-sponsor this test environment under the existing innovation sandbox and digital-spine initiatives, giving innovators a stable space to validate tools before market entry. This structure would give regulators confidence to scale what works without fragmenting innovation across one-off pilots.

Recommendation: Create a national test environment for AI-enabled energy systems, linking representative data sets, shared APIs and simulated market and network conditions so new tools can be validated before deployment.

Together, these steps would give the UK a coherent data and digital foundation – trusted, accessible and governed with the same discipline as its physical assets. That is what will allow AI to help cut curtailment and balancing costs, optimise for precise flexibility and bring visible savings to people’s bills.

Putting Households and Businesses at the Centre

The goal of these system reforms is not just efficiency, but visible, reliable savings for households and businesses so that AI can turn cleaner energy into lower bills automatically. However, today, many people who could participate in a cleaner, cheaper system don’t. The path from “interested” to “enrolled and saving” is splintered across grant portals, installer quotes, supplier switches and device set-up; people fall out long before they stand to save. Even when they do enrol, value can be uncertain. For example, because verification and settlement are slow or inconsistent, credits may arrive late or vary month to month. And in a large share of buildings the incentives don’t line up, as the decision-maker isn’t necessarily the bill-payer so viable upgrades can stall. The effect is that participation remains confined to early adopters and flexibility goes under-used.

AI can remove much of this friction – but only if policy clears the bottlenecks that stop it doing so. With consent and the right interfaces, AI can bring every step in the journey into one place, use meter and building data to size and configure solutions accurately, enrol the right tariff automatically, and verify delivered actions against half-hourly data so credits land predictably. This vision could soon include every household or business having a AI “energy agent” that quietly manages power on their behalf. With consent and clear safeguards, that digital assistant could learn a home’s routines, draw on live prices and grid signals, and decide when to charge, heat or store energy to keep costs low. The aim is to move from asking households to act on energy data to building systems that act for them automatically, safely and visibly.

That future is already starting to appear in early pilots and platforms. For example, the Open Energy initiative of Icebreaker One, a non-profit working to expand interoperable data-sharing, has piloted consent-managed frameworks that allow consumers to grant trusted access to their energy data across suppliers and services – an essential step towards a “single front door” for participation. Octopus Energy’s “Zero Bills” homes are bundling solar, batteries, heat pumps, tariffs and finance into one package, with optimisation handled in the background so the household experiences simplicity rather than complexity. And companies like Kaluza are beginning to automate verification by linking household-device data to suppliers, so flexibility actions are scheduled and settled directly on bills, making savings visible without extra admin.

The government’s role is to make these kinds of flows possible and reliable by setting the frameworks and standards that enable choice at scale. DESNZ and Ofgem should jointly design a consumer-participation framework that brings together existing schemes – from energy efficiency and smart tariffs to flexibility services – under a single set of interoperable data and measurement standards. That means establishing a common process for upgrades and enrolment, so accredited providers can manage eligibility, finance, installation and tariff selection end-to-end with consumer permission, not mandating a single route but making participation simple and consistent. Ofgem can underpin this through new licence conditions requiring suppliers and aggregators to support data portability and event-based settlement where relevant.

Recommendation: Design a joint consumer-participation framework led by DESNZ and Ofgem to bring energy-efficiency schemes, smart tariffs and flexibility services under one simple, interoperable set of standards.

It also means agreeing shared, event-based measurement rules and service levels for settlement, so when AI verifies a shifted kilowatt-hour, bill credits land quickly and consistently. Ofgem’s Market-Wide Half-Hourly Settlement reforms provide a starting point; these could evolve into a cross-industry service standard for credit verification and timing. It means making participation portable, so when a customer moves or switches supplier, their enrolment and entitlements follow the meter or registered asset automatically. DESNZ could coordinate this through the Smart Energy Code and retail-market review processes, aligning flexibility participation with existing consumer-protection frameworks.

Recommendation: Set common data and measurement rules so verified savings are credited automatically and on time, using half-hourly data as the baseline for event-based settlement.

And it means building trust and access. This can be done through approaches like licensing intermediaries with clear duties to act in the consumer’s interest, creating standard frameworks for landlord–tenant pass-through and requiring interoperability across devices so accredited services can coordinate them seamlessly. This should be done in partnership with DSIT and the ICO, ensuring that consent, privacy and data governance are handled consistently across energy and digital regulation.

Recommendation: Make participation portable across suppliers and addresses, ensuring that enrolment and entitlements move with the meter or registered asset when customers switch.

Do this, and AI can turn today’s fragmented, manual process into a simple service: configuration done once, optimisation happening quietly in the background, savings credited promptly, and participation that survives supplier and address changes. That is how consumer engagement scales, flexibility deepens and the system’s savings show up where people feel them – making clean energy the convenient, low-cost default.

Conclusion

If the past decade has been about proving that clean technologies work. The next is about making them add up for people – in a way that they can see on their bill. AI is the quiet tool that can do that – seeing across the system, coordinating in real time, and turning variability into value so clean power shows up as lower, steadier bills and fewer hassles. But that can only happen if the government lays the groundwork now with markets that reward timing and flexibility, regulation that assesses based on outcomes at the meter and on the bill, and data and digital infrastructure that are core to the system, rather than pilots. It will take the government leaning on Ofgem and NESO to move faster on flexibility and settlement reform, and joining up energy and digital policy so the rules, data and infrastructure work as one system. Do this and the UK can lead not just on climate ambition or AI research in isolation, but on using AI to deliver climate outcomes that people notice, value and support – at home and at work.",https://media.ffycdn.net/eu/tony-blair-institute-for-global-change/4bVfmAtDEBVrYZHFjR7M.jpg?&width=1200&format=webp,N,,2025-12-10 19:58:47.151163

Accounting for 65 percent of the emissions reductions needed to meet national commitments, the sector presents both substantial transition risks and major investment opportunities. Yet, clean-energy investment in SEA remains insufficient to align with national and global climate goals.

This report provides a technical reference to support financial institutions (FIs) in conducting robust transition assessments of power sector companies in SEA. Moving beyond headline climate targets and capital allocation figures, transition assessments need to integrate operational and contextual realities through three core analytical pillars:

Transition footprint mapping — Identifying a company’s current emissions-intensive activities and assets to locate areas of risk and opportunity

Investment alignment — Evaluating whether the company’s investment pipeline aligns with its stated targets as well as sector and regional pathways

Dependency mapping — Assessing how market dynamics, technology developments, and policy environments influence what is possible and on what timeline

By offering analytical methods, regional data, and regional benchmarks, this guide reduces the burden on FIs to perform this asset-level analysis from scratch. Building on this analysis, FIs can apply similar approaches to individual companies, empowering them to answer questions such as:

What is this company’s current asset base? Does it have coal-powered assets that could conflict with national coal-phaseout objectives? From there, an FI can work with the company on early coal retirement strategies.

What does the company’s project pipeline look like? Is the company on track to meet its climate targets and align with local policy objectives? Assessing alignment-to-policy pathways can inform risk management and determine if the company will be well positioned to take advantage of changing policy environments.

What barriers to transitioning does the company face? Is it dependent on new grid infrastructure (e.g., transmission or storage), favorable policies, or other enabling factors? Identifying mitigating measures for these dependencies can reduce risk and present new investment opportunities.

This report aggregates asset-level data from Global Energy Monitor, an open-source data provider, to address these questions at the regional and national level, but this and other data sources can likewise be used for asset-level analysis of individual companies.

That new law—the Texas Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA)—was signed earlier this year, takes effect next month on January 1, 2026, and creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for the development and deployment of artificial intelligence that imposes meaningful duties on both government agencies and private entities. With TRAIGA’s effective date rapidly approaching, companies must understand their new compliance obligations.

This article primarily focuses on TRAIGA’s effect on companies, starting with a short summary of TRAIGA’s key obligations and regulations and identifying potential actions you might consider taking before January 1. It then provides a more detailed discussion of the same provisions (including TRAIGA’s key obligations, potential penalties for violations, and regulatory sandbox and safe harbor provisions), and then ends with key takeaways and a look toward the future.

Summary of key points to know about TRAIGA

TRAIGA establishes new artificial intelligence (AI) governance rules for companies operating in Texas and preempts any local AI regulations.

TRAIGA’s definition of AI systems is broad—it includes more than just generative AI systems (for example, chatbots)—and therefore will likely apply to a large segment of companies operating in Texas.

Under TRAIGA, government agencies have a duty to disclose to consumers that they will be interacting with an AI system (but they are not required to obtain affirmative consent from the consumer to continue the interaction).

TRAIGA also creates a duty for healthcare providers to disclose to patients that AI will be used in relation to the patient’s service or treatment.

TRAIGA does not create a private cause of action to remedy violations; instead, TRAIGA is enforceable by the Texas Attorney General and can result in civil penalties ranging from US$10,000 to US$200,000 per violation (which can accrue on a continuing, daily basis).

TRAIGA creates a regulatory sandbox for companies to develop and test AI systems without the need to obtain licenses or other regulatory authorization in exchange for sharing information with the State.

And separate from its regulatory sandbox, TRAIGA also provides a liability safe harbor for companies that discover potential TRAIGA violations through their own efforts.

Summary of what you should consider doing before January 1, 2026

Implement and maintain written AI policies that clearly express your company’s intent, purpose and aim for developing or deploying AI systems and guide your company’s use of the same.

Establish an internal review process that seeks internal and external feedback from employees, developers, users and other stakeholders regarding your company’s development and deployment of AI.

Create internal processes that will track relevant information from your AI systems (including inputs and outputs), test your AI systems and perform internal reviews on the same.

Decide whether to participate in TRAIGA’s regulatory sandbox program.

Identify potential TRAIGA violations.

TRAIGA applies broadly

TRAIGA applies to anyone who promotes, advertises or conducts business in Texas, produces a product or service used by Texas residents, or develops or deploys an artificial intelligence system in Texas. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 551.002(1)-(3). A ""deployer"" of AI means a person who deploys an artificial intelligence system for use in Texas, while a “developer"" means a person who develops an artificial intelligence system that is offered, sold, leased, given or otherwise provided in Texas. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.001(1)-(2).

Further, TRAIGA defines AI systems as “any machine-based system that, for any explicit or implicit objective, infers from the inputs the system receives how to generate outputs, including content, decisions, predictions or recommendations, that can influence physical or virtual environments.” Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 551.001(1).

This definition covers more than just the generative AI systems and the related AI companies that dominate the news; it also includes predictive and conversational AI, and likely even systems that wouldn’t necessarily be given the tag of “AI” by technology industry experts or the everyday user. At a practical level, this definition likely includes virtual assistants, grammar check functions, recommendation algorithms, autonomous driving, facial recognition systems, business automation and similar systems.

Given the breadth of this definition, TRAIGA’s requirements are therefore applicable to more than just “AI” companies or companies that use generative AI tools. Additionally, given the proliferation of AI systems—particularly narrow AI that is built for specific tasks—even companies that might not have to ensure compliance with TRAIGA on January 1 may be subject to it in the near future.

TRAIGA requires government agencies to disclose when consumers interact with AI systems

The TRAIGA requirement that will be the most noticeable to consumers is also its most general; if a governmental agency has an artificial intelligence system that is intended to interact with consumers, at all, that governmental agency is required to disclose that fact to the consumer “before or at the time of the interaction,” even if it would be obvious to the consumer that they are interacting with an AI system. See Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.051(b)-(c). Under TRAIGA, this obligation extends to every governmental agency with the few exceptions of hospital districts and institutions of higher education. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.001(1)-(2).

Because TRAIGA’s definition of AI is so broad to begin with, and because AI systems are proliferating, AI use cases are multiplying, and the cost of AI continues to decline, in the near future this duty will likely apply to almost every interaction between a governmental agency and a consumer, and therefore almost every governmental agency will need to draft and implement an AI disclosure for its consumers. These disclosures must be clear, conspicuous, written in plain English and free of “dark patterns” that could undermine user autonomy. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.051(d).

A “dark pattern” is a user interface designed or manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision making or choice, and includes any practice the Federal Trade Commission refers to as a dark pattern. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 541.001(10). Put another way, a dark pattern is a user interface designed to manipulate or mislead a user into doing something they might not otherwise have done.

A governmental agency must draft and implement their AI disclosure in a way that does not do that; the disclosure should not attempt to coax or cajole the consumer into continuing to interact with the AI system after the disclosure when the consumer might otherwise choose not to, and it should not obscure or hide that an interaction with an AI system is about to occur or what the interaction is. However, TRAIGA does not require obtaining the consumer’s consent to interact with the AI system; the governmental agency must simply make a clear, conspicuous disclosure that an interaction is with an AI system.

TRAIGA also requires companies providing healthcare services to make a disclosure to patients

Along with its governmental agency AI disclosure requirement, TRAIGA also imposes a slightly different disclosure requirement on providers of healthcare services (services defined as “related to human health or to the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a human disease or impairment provided by an individual licensed, registered, or certified under applicable state or federal law to provide those services”). While TRAIGA’s current general disclosure requirement is directed at government agencies, this second disclosure requirement will affect private entities that fall under the statute’s definition of providers of healthcare services. Providers meeting that definition are required to disclose to a patient (or their representative) that an AI system is being used “in relation to the healthcare service or treatment.” Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.051(a)-(f).

Relevantly, TRAIGA requires providers to disclose when an AI system “is” actually used in relation to a patient’s treatment. It may therefore be insufficient for a provider to simply make a disclosure to every patient at the beginning of every service that an AI system “may” be used in relation to their future treatment. But while that may impose a higher burden on providers, the statute’s legislative history indicates that it may be sufficient for the provider’s “disclosure to be provided . . . as part of any waivers or forms signed by a patient at the start of the service.” See Tex. B. An., H.B. 149 (2025).

TRAIGA does, however, allow providers additional time to make this disclosure; unlike the governmental agency disclosure, which must be made “before or at the time of interaction,” providers of healthcare services are only required to provide the disclosure on “the date” the treatment is provided, which allows the possibility for the disclosure to be made shortly after treatment is provided as well. Further, TRAIGA also carves out emergencies from this requirement, allowing providers to instead make the disclosure “as soon as reasonably possible” in case of emergency treatment.

As above, with the proliferation of AI—even and especially in backend systems and other systems “used in relation to treatment” (for example, to identify potential abnormalities in imaging)—most, if not all, healthcare providers will eventually need to make a TRAIGA disclosure to patients.

TRAIGA prohibits discrimination by AI systems

TRAIGA also prohibits companies that (1) promote, advertise or conduct business in Texas, (2) serve Texas residents and (3) AI developers/deployers in Texas from intentionally developing or deploying an AI system that unlawfully discriminates against a protected class or infringes on any right guaranteed under the United States Constitution, Texas Constitution, or state or federal law. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §§ 552.002; 552.056(b).

Crucially, liability under TRAIGA is contingent on whether a party intended to discriminate; evidence of “disparate impact” is not enough to demonstrate such an intent. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.056(c). In other words, if an AI system ends up having a negative effect on a protected group, that fact alone does not constitute a violation of TRAIGA (although it could be used as evidence of a violation).

At first glance, this section may not seem to apply to the average company acting in good faith. But it is still worth considering because TRAIGA puts a continuing burden on companies developing and deploying AI systems. The requirement that a violation of this section be intentional might shield the average company from liability, but TRAIGA’s breadth—and TRAIGA’s instruction that it should be read broadly to accomplish its goal—should give companies pause and invite them to consider implementing policies and procedures to ensure that any discrimination caused by their development or deployment of AI (whether intentional or unintentional) is quickly identified. At the same time, companies should also consider devising a plan to respond to any discovered discrimination so that it can be quickly cured.

Like TRAIGA’s disclosure requirement, this section applies to almost any company developing or deploying AI systems; TRAIGA only recognizes limited exceptions for (1) insurers (subject to applicable statutes regulating unfair discrimination, unfair methods of competition, or unfair or deceptive acts or practices related to the business of insurance) and (2) federally insured financial institutions that comply with applicable banking laws and regulations. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.056(d)-(e).

TRAIGA prohibits AI systems that incite or encourage harm

TRAIGA also prohibits developing or deploying AI systems that manipulate behavior to incite self-harm, harm to others or criminal activity. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.052. As above, the Act is broadly construed to effectuate its purpose of facilitating the responsible development and use of AI systems and protecting individuals. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 551.003. Accordingly, companies should consider that “harm” under this section may be interpreted liberally, particularly since “harm” is a separate sub-section from criminal activity, which could indicate that it includes harm in the civil context. In other words, TRAIGA’s prohibition on “harm” could be quite broad and apply to many different “harmful” outcomes (for example, monetary harm).

Like TRAIGA’s prohibition on discrimination, TRAIGA’s prohibition of inciting or encouraging harm is limited by intentionality. How to define a company’s “aim” for the development or deployment of an AI system is still up for debate, and the manner of the development or deployment will also be subject to scrutiny. Accordingly, companies should protect themselves from potential liability under this section by drafting clear policies and procedures establishing the manner and aim of the development and deployment of their AI systems and creating internal controls that ensure that AI use does not stray from those guidelines.

TRAIGA’s enforcement, opportunity to cure and penalties

TRAIGA does not open the door to private lawsuits; the public may lodge complaints against alleged violators through a forthcoming web portal, but only the Texas Attorney General may enforce TRAIGA. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §§ 552.101-552.102. However, the lack of a private right of action does not mean litigation risks under TRAIGA should be ignored or downplayed.

A potential violator cannot be immediately sued under TRAIGA; it must first receive a notice of violation from the Texas Attorney General. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.104(a). Upon receiving that notice, the party has 60 days to cure the alleged violations, explain how the violation was cured and identify any changes made to internal policies to prevent further violations. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.104(b). If the party does cure, it may avoid further prosecution and penalties.

If the potential violator fails to cure the alleged violation after the 60 days though, they may be liable for the following civil penalties:

US$10,000-US$12,000 for each TRAIGA violation the court determines to be curable

US$10,000-US$12,000 for each breach of a statement made during the 60-day cure period regarding how the violation was addressed and what changes were implemented to prevent future violations

US$80,000-US$200,000 for each uncurable TRAIGA violation

US$2,000-US$40,000 for each day a TRAIGA violation continues

Companies should be aware of two significant concerns arising from these penalty provisions.

First, given the complexity of AI systems, 60 days may be insufficient time to “cure” a violation of TRAIGA, particularly because a “cure” might mean that the party must substantially modify an AI system, particularly in a situation where the party is not the developer of the system. If this 60-day window is not sufficient time to alter an AI system’s programming or functionality, then a notice of violation will effectively function as a cease and desist order.

Second, TRAIGA currently does not provide clear guidance distinguishing “curable” violations from “uncurable” violations. Because AI systems are code and algorithms, a party may attempt to suggest that, given sufficient resources and time, any part of an AI system could be changed (and thus any problems “cured”), which would render the TRAIGA’s distinction of “uncurable” violations a nullity. But courts are unlikely to read that sub-section as superfluous. At this time, without the benefit of applicable TRAIGA precedent, it is unclear whether the inclusion of “uncurable” violations is an attempt to distinguish between the severity of violations, the time needed to cure or some other factor. What qualifies as an “uncurable” violation will thus be developed by experts, the courts and the resulting common law Companies should watch that space closely as precedent is established and evolves.

TRAIGA establishes a regulatory sandbox opportunity

TRAIGA is not just about duties and penalties; it also provides a potentially valuable opportunity for companies developing or deploying AI systems in the form of a state-approved protected regulatory environment. Companies can participate in that regulatory sandbox for up to 36 months, with limited extensions available for good cause. To be admitted, companies must apply and include the following in their applications:

A detailed description their AI system

Their intended AI use cases

A benefit assessment covering consumer, privacy and public safety implications

A risk mitigation plan

Evidence of compliance with federal AI laws

Participants admitted to the sandbox must then submit quarterly reports detailing system performance metrics, risk mitigation updates and stakeholder feedback.

In exchange for applying and being admitted to the sandbox, participants are permitted to research, test and train AI systems without the need to obtain traditional licenses or regulatory authorizations. However, there are two important caveats related to the sandbox that companies should consider.

First, companies should be aware that annual reports will be issued to the government summarizing the program’s activity, which will include information from and about participants. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 553.103. The reporting agency is required to safeguard participating companies’ intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive information when doing so, but companies should be aware that information relating to participants will still be sent to the government in some form. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 553.102(c).

Second, TRAIGA's core duties and prohibitions still apply to participants within the sandbox; participating in the program does not alter a company’s obligations or potential culpability for violations. Companies should therefore carefully weigh the benefits of regulatory flexibility against the administrative burden of applications and quarterly reporting, particularly given the three-year participation limit.

TRAIGA creates a safe harbor for companies that self-identify violations

Finally, TRAIGA also provides a liability safe harbor for companies, including those that do not participate in its sandbox program. That safe harbor protects, among other things, companies that discover and cure potential TRAIGA violations through:

Feedback from developers, deployers or other stakeholders

Testing procedures like red-teaming or adversarial testing

Following state agency guidelines

Internal review processes, provided the company complies with nationally recognized AI risk management frameworks (such as NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework)

If a company discovers a potential violation in one of these ways, they cannot be found liable. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.105(e). Further, a company cannot be found liable if someone else uses the company’s AI system in a way that violates TRAIGA. Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 552.105(e)(1). Additionally, the statute does not currently require the company to cure the violation within a set period to benefit from the safe harbor. TRAIGA’s safe harbor provision therefore incentivizes companies to implement their own protective measures and reporting mechanisms to ensure TRAIGA compliance.

TRAIGA establishes a CID process to investigate potential violations

Companies should also be aware that, if the Texas Attorney General receives a complaint through TRAIGA’s online reporting mechanism, TRAIGA allows the Texas Attorney General to issue (without also requiring it to issue a notice of violation) a civil investigative demand to determine if a violation has occurred. That civil investigative demand can require a company to provide, among other things:

AI system descriptions, including intended use, purpose and training data

Input data details, outputs, performance metrics and known limitations

Post-deployment monitoring and user safeguard measures

A company that develops or deploys AI must therefore be prepared to provide that information. By creating the processes and standards that will ensure that information is readily available—and making sure that information exists and is continually tracked—companies will likely get the added benefit of preventing TRAIGA violations in the first place, therefore reducing the likelihood of receiving a civil investigative demand and, if one is received, reducing the cost of compliance.

Looking ahead: Key takeaways and practical steps for companies

The passage of TRAIGA reflects Texas’s commitment to promoting AI innovation while safeguarding consumer rights. The law rewards proactive compliance efforts, following established risk management frameworks and responding promptly to potential violations. It also heavily penalizes intentional discrimination, manipulation toward harmful activities and evasion of disclosure duties. Since the proposed federal moratorium on state-level AI regulation did not pass, TRAIGA will be the law of the land for companies operating in Texas for the foreseeable future.

TRAIGA’s January 1, 2026 effective date is rapidly approaching. Companies should determine whether TRAIGA applies to their systems and work toward building the necessary policy compliance infrastructure by drafting policies, implementing technical controls and establishing audit trails. Early preparation will be essential for smooth compliance.

Even if TRAIGA does not apply to your company right now, Utah has already implemented an AI governance law, California’s and Colorado’s versions of AI governance laws go into effect in 2026 and other states will likely follow Texas’s lead. At the same time, the usage and expansion of AI systems will only continue. Sooner or later, companies with multi-state or national operations will be subject to AI governance regulations. So even if TRAIGA does not impose obligations on your company on January 1, it might be beneficial to begin implementing policies and procedures that align with its objectives now so as to avoid conflicts and problems in the future.

The proposed project, which Xcel says will improve Colorado's electric grid, has sparked fierce opposition from locals who say there's no benefit to their county.

Dozens of residents packed the Kiowa Fairgrounds Tuesday night to plead their case to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC), asking officials to move the pathway farther east away from people's homes.

""The citizens of rural Elbert County matter,"" one resident told the commission during the hearing.

Xcel is already attempting to acquire private land for the project through eminent domain.

Long-time resident Bill Vogel said he wanted to sell his land for retirement but felt pressured to give in to the utility company.

""We signed not by choice, but I really didn't want to go to court over it,"" Vogel said.

However, other residents like Jessica Heaton are prepared for a lengthy legal battle.

""We've all wracked up a lot of attorneys fees, and other fees associated with it, and that will be our cost to bear and all we did was own property where Xcel wanted to put their lines,"" Heaton said.

The hearing follows Elbert County commissioners' unanimous vote in June to deny the permits Xcel needs to start the project.

The federal government research organization that has been devoted for half a century to renewable energy development has had the word “renewable” stripped from its name.

The Trump administration, which broadly opposes renewable energy projects, changed the name of the Colorado-based National Renewable Energy Laboratory to “National Laboratory of the Rockies.”

The U.S. Department of Energy announced the name change on Monday, effective immediately.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” Assistant Secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson said in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand. The National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts.”

NREL has a prominent presence in Alaska. The agency in 2020 joined into a partnership with the Cold Climate Housing Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The UAF facility is one of four NREL centers; two campuses are in Colorado and there is an office in Washington, D.C.

Jud Virden, the laboratory’s director, said the new name “embraces a broader applied energy mission entrusted to us by the Department of Energy to deliver a more affordable and secure energy future for all,” according to the statement.

However, the name change is a troubling sign to one Alaska organization involved in projects promoting renewable energy and energy affordability.

“Removing ‘Renewable’ and ‘Energy’ from NREL’s name raises concerns. Renewables are key to affordable, secure energy and deliver long-term economic benefits, especially for rural communities,” Bridget Shaughnessy Smith, communications director for the Alaska Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said by email.

“While it’s not yet clear if this name change signals a broad mission shift, any refocus cannot come at the expense of renewable energy or by prioritizing already well-funded fossil fuel industries. Remote microgrid communities in Alaska are working with NREL to innovate toward affordable, reliable energy, and this name change must not disrupt that critical work,” Shaughnessy Smith continued.

NREL’s history started in 1974, when the organization was established as the Solar Energy Research Institute. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush elevated it to national lab status and changed the name to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

The Cold Climate Housing Research Center was established in 1999 with a mission of improving housing and building conditions in Alaska’s extreme climate. The center has focused on renewable energy, along with energy efficiency, structural integrity for buildings on permafrost, indoor air quality and designs that are sustainable in the far north. The center headquarters is the world’s farthest-north building with a platinum rating, the highest possible, bestowed by the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.

The NREL-Cold Climate Housing Research Center partnership has participated in numerous recent energy and environmental innovations, including the development of non-plastic housing insulation made from a fungi-wood pulp blend.

The NREL name change adds to a list of government agencies and geographic sites changed by the Trump administration this year to align with the president’s agenda.

On the day he was inaugurated for his second term, President Trump issued an executive order directing that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed “Gulf of America” and that Denali, North America’s tallest peak, revert to its previous federal name, Mount McKinley.

The Denali name comes from the traditional name for the Alaska peak used by the Koyukon people, the region’s Indigenous residents. The name, which translates to “the high one,” has been the official state of Alaska name since the 1970s. The McKinley name, for former president and Ohioan William McKinley, has been widely panned in Alaska, and state lawmakers passed a resolution asking for the Denali name to be restored for federal government use.

In September, Trump issued an executive order directing that the U.S Department of Defense be renamed “Department of War.” That resurrected a department name that was dropped in 1947.

The Environmental Protection Agency has fined seven waste and recycling facilities in Massachusetts a combined $170,000 for illegally discharging industrial waste into U.S. waters, including two facilities owned by E.L. Harvey & Sons, Inc. in New Bedford.

The regional waste company’s New Bedford garage and waste transfer station were found to have dumped contaminated stormwater into the city’s waterways over the course of two years between February 2022 and March 2024. E.L. Harvey’s “Zero Waste” facility in Rochester was also cited for contamination over that same period.

E.L. Harvey received a $86,000 fine for violating the Clean Water Act, which requires individuals to seek out a permit before dispensing any industrial byproducts into U.S. waters. The EPA also fined Trojan Recycling, Inc., Nauset Disposal Holdings, Inc., and Arrowhead Environmental Partners, LLC between $38,000 and $20,000 for similar violations at facilities in Brockton, Plymouth, South Yarmouth, and Ayer.

The EPA did not specify how much contaminated water the violating companies had dispensed into Massachusetts waterways. E.L. Harvey did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

This is the second fine the New Bedford waste transfer station has received in three months. In September, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection fined E.L. Harvey $29,980 for failing to prevent a rodent infestation at its Shawmut Avenue waste transfer station. In May, the waste transfer station experienced a fire that released rats into the surrounding neighborhood, including a nearby playground.

During an inspection after the fire, MassDEP found “hundreds” of rats at the waste transfer facility.

The incident occurred as the New Bedford Board of Health considered a proposal for a new waste transfer station, this time proposed by South Coast Renewables, LLC, at the New Bedford Business Park this fall. Residents speaking out against the proposal pointed to the E.L. Harvey facility as a warning sign that companies could not reliably prevent fires or rodent infestations at waste handling facilities.

The Board of Health voted to deny the proposal in mid-September, but South Coast Renewables appealed the decision six weeks later.

Mayor Jon Mitchell thanked MassDEP at the time for holding E.L. Harvey accountable.

New Bedford Public Information Officer Jonathan Darling said in a phone call Wednesday that the city’s wastewater treatment plant reports any unusually high levels of contamination to the federal government to help enforce the Clean Water Act.

""One of the central themes in the stakeholder calls this year was policy uncertainty,"" said Greg Upton, executive director of the center, during a webinar about its Gulf Coast Energy Outlook, which focuses on Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. He cited the Republican Party's ""unprecedented"" repeal of renewable energy tax credits before a previous law's expiration and the Trump administration's unilateral levy of tariffs on international trade partners. ""So, one of the discussions happening is, are we going to start seeing, when new administrations come in, this back and forth?"" Upton said. ""And how does that impact investments that persist a long time?"" However, the region's crude oil and natural gas production are likely to continue growing, while ""decarbonization initiatives, supported by federal subsidies ... offer both opportunities and risks for regional energy manufacturers, especially as global demand for lower-emission products grows,"" the center said in its GCEO report. ""Additionally, electricity's increasing share of energy use and industrial expansion in the Gulf Coast are anticipated to sustain the region's competitive edge,"" the LSU center said. As an example of policy shifts, US Representative Garrett Graves, a Louisiana Republican, said during the webinar, ""We've gone from an Obama administration energy policy to a Trump administration energy policy to a Biden administration energy policy and back to a second Trump administration."" Upton cited the Biden administration's pause of new offshore oil and gas leasing in 2021 and subsequent cancelations of certain lease auctions, but the Trump administration subsequently advanced such plans, and a Gulf Coast oil and gas lease auction is scheduled for Dec. 10. TRUMP ACTIONS 'UNPRECEDENTED' Also, the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act advanced renewable energy tax credits and incentivized offshore wind projects, while the Trump administration froze new and existing federal approvals of offshore wind projects. The Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act canceled certain renewable energy tax credits prematurely, Upton said, which was ""really unprecedented."" LSU's GCEO report assumes current policy persists, but considers how such uncertainty might affect investments, Upton said. Regarding trade issues, Upton said. ""Right now, of course, we're waiting for the Supreme Court decision to see, well, does the executive branch have the authority to put in these tariffs without the action of Congress?"" In the short term, multinational corporations seek ways to avoid tariffs by shifting production toward consumption locations, but in the longer term, the uncertainty can affect where capital is deployed. SLOWER GROWTH FORESEEN So, the latest GCEO foresees growth that is not as optimistic as in previous projections. For example, Gulf Coast gas production in 2022 was forecast to exceed 60 Bcf/d in 2026, which is now projected to be delayed until 2028. After a first-quarter 2025 decline in gross domestic product, growth has resumed at a ""robust"" pace, Upton said, citing the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. ""So, for our outlook, we're going to assume again that the economic outlook is strong,"" he said. ""And so we can see this translating into world final energy consumption."" In contrast with robust global energy demand growth, the US Energy Information Administration has seen flat total energy demand across the nation since the end of the 2008-09 recession, in terms of Btus, but the Gulf Coast's share is trending upward, said Andrew Owens, an LSU CES research fellow. ""Looking at industrial sales, again, over the time frame, 30-plus years, sales are flat, but that doesn't tell the full story,"" Owens said. ""If you look at a depiction of the Gulf Coast share, you see significant growth from around 16 to 17% 15 years ago to closer to 25% today."" Industrial energy sales have grown in states such as Louisiana and Texas with strong natural gas and energy infrastructure, Owens said. DATA CENTERS AT ISSUE ""There is an emerging story, though, and that is data centers,"" Owens said. ""Over the last two years with the emergence of artificial intelligence hyperscale cloud operations, you have seen massive new data centers being proposed and constructed."" Such individual data center projects have grown from 50 to 100 MW to gigawatt-scale efforts, Owens said. In Louisiana, for example, ""the Meta Hyperion data center campus in Richland Parish in the northern part of the state that is being constructed is a 4 million-plus square feet facility and requires more than 2,000 megawatts of power,"" Owens said. ""That's unprecedented. And, at least according to the Louisiana Economic Development Agency, there are some additional hyperscale data center facilities that are being considered for Louisiana."" Graves, the Louisiana House representative, cited projections of ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" invested in ""these data centers located in places that have abundant energy, that have the ability to put electricity in places where you can maintain reliability and price affordability, which means that Louisiana is going to be an attractive source."" The Trump administration made AI ""a high priority looking at this sort of like a cold war between the United States and China and that there will not be a second place,"" Graves said. SHIFTING GENERATION STACK Another factor affecting the Gulf Coast Energy Outlook is the changing generation mix, Owens said, with coal's share falling from more than half of US power supply in the late 20th century to about 15% today. In contrast, carbon-free nuclear, hydro, wind and solar's supply has grown to supply almost 40% of US power. S&P Global Market Intelligence's power plant database shows the combined generation fleet in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas to top 423 GW of nameplate capacity by 2030 from about 390.1 GW in 2024. This would be led by almost 167.6 GW of gas-fired generation, 76.8 GW of wind and 64.4 GW of solar. Based on current retirement plans, the region's coal capacity is expected to fall to about 29.9 GW from more than 33.1 GW. — Markham Watson, markham.watson@spglobal.com-- Edited by Richard Rubin, newsdesk@spglobal.com--Platts Electricity Alert--",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 22:58:03.750647

Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says.
Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.
While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.
North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.","Fewer inspections, weaker enforcement and less oversight: Deep cuts to state budgets and at the Environmental Protection Agency are preventing regulators from fully protecting the public from pollution, according to a report released today by the Environmental Integrity Project.

The financial crisis at these agencies is occurring amid the expansion of the fossil fuel, plastics and petrochemical industries, said EIP Executive Director Jen Duggan.

When states have fewer resources, Duggan said, “those protections, those rights that every American has under our environmental laws, are not being realized.”

President Trump’s budget proposal would decimate 2026 spending at the EPA by 55 percent, or $4.2 billion, according to the report. House Republicans are recommending cutting it by a quarter, while the Senate Appropriations Committee voted for a reduction of just 5 percent.

If enacted, these reductions would exacerbate the EPA’s financial plight. Over the last 15 years, the agency’s budget has been slashed by 40 percent, Duggan said, and its workforce by 18 percent. Since Trump began his second term, more than 3,000 EPA workers have retired or have been terminated as part of the administration’s gutting of the agency.

The upshot of these cuts is that states have to pick up the slack, which is central to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s vision for the agency. In March, on the day he announced “the biggest deregulatory action in history,” Zeldin said he intended to “give power back to the states.”

However, the Trump administration has proposed eliminating most EPA grants to the states, undercutting their agencies’ ability to wield that power.

Texas lawmakers have cut by a third the budget for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality over the last decade, accounting for inflation, the EIP report says. The agency has also struggled to retain employees; 30 percent of its workforce has less than two years of experience, and half have less than five years.

Kathryn Guerra worked for nearly four years at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where she helped small businesses and local governments comply with regulations. Most recently, Guerra worked in the EPA Region 6 office overseeing environmental justice efforts, which the Trump administration eliminated this year.

She’s now the TCEQ campaign director for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group.

The funding cuts to TCEQ described in the report “render the agency largely ineffective,” Guerra said, “and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness.”

According to TCEQ’s biennial report to the Texas legislature, it takes an average of 351 days to process one enforcement case. The agency’s most recent enforcement report shows a backlog of 1,400 enforcement cases, Guerra said.

“Ultimately it means communities don’t get relief from the environmental harms those polluters are causing,” she said.

States with the deepest budget cuts to environmental agencies from 2010–2024, according to the report, are:

Mississippi—71 percent

South Dakota—61 percent

Alabama—49 percent

Texas—33 percent

Montana—32 percent

North Carolina is among the states whose budgets have contracted in the past 15 years. While the EIP report said the state Department of Environmental Quality’s budget had declined 32 percent from 2010-2014, an agency restructuring in 2015 makes quantifying the depth of the reductions difficult.

“These cuts have real impacts on the people of our state,” said Drew Ball, director of Southeast Campaigns for the Natural Resources Defense Council, on a press call about the report.

Ball also serves as a Buncombe County Commissioner in an area wrecked by Hurricane Helene in 2024.

“When a family in eastern North Carolina notices their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain, there are fewer staff who can investigate,” he went on. “There are fewer inspectors available to respond when hurricanes send flood waters through low lying areas, mixing industrial pollution, animal waste and storm water, the staff responsible for tracking and responding to those threats are being asked to do far more with far less.”

During the 2008 recession, North Carolina lawmakers cut DEQ’s budget, part of a statewide belt-tightening. However, the Republican-led legislature has not fully restored those reductions in more economically robust times and during an era of increased population growth.

From 2020 to 2024, census data show the state’s population has grown by more than 5 percent. But over the same period, when accounting for inflation, DEQ’s budget decreased.

In 2019, the DEQ budget was $97.4 million, according to state documents, equivalent to $123.7 million today.

The 2023 DEQ budget totalled $108.7 million, or $115.8 million in today’s money. That’s a 6 percent decrease compared with four years earlier.

Some of the agency’s functions rely on permitting fees. In at least one instance, a healthier environment has resulted in unexpected financial consequences. As state and federal regulations have made the air cleaner, Title V facilities, the largest air pollution sources, have decreased their emissions, according to a 2023 DEQ report to the legislature.

This has translated to a drop in “billable tons”—54 percent over a decade—that generate a portion of the agency’s revenue. Yet the state’s 300 Title V facilities still must be inspected and their permits renewed, even as the number of staff has decreased by 19 percent.

In 2024, the legislature increased the permit fee to help close the gap.

North Carolina had the largest staffing cuts at environmental agencies from 2010 to 2024, according to the report, though the same caveat related to the 2015 restructuring applies.

States with the next largest staffing cuts, 2010-2024, are:

Connecticut—26 percent

Arizona—25 percent

Louisiana—24 percent

Missouri and Kansas—20 percent

Adding to the budgetary crisis, it’s also been difficult for North Carolina DEQ to retain or hire employees. At its peak three years ago, the agency had vacancy rates that exceeded 20 percent. DEQ officials said at the time that agency wages, whose boundaries are set by the legislature, can’t compete with the private sector.

“Many families today live with waste in roadside ditches, wells that are too contaminated to drink from and constant fear about what the next storm will carry into their yards,” Ball said. “Yet the very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden, with shrinking staff, shrinking budgets and shrinking political support, and now the federal government is proposing the deepest cuts to EPA in 40 years. That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2232052324.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:50.832905

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), Sullivan introduced the original Save Our Seas 2.0 Act in 2020.
“Clean water and a healthy ocean support every family in the country and every sector of the economy,"" said Representative Bonamici.
They deliver cleaner recycling operations, safer drinking water systems, stronger wastewater treatment, and faster trash removal.","The U.S. Senate has passed legislation reauthorizing marine debris cleanup programs originally passed in the 2020 Save Our Seas 2.0 Act for another five years.

“Alaska has more coastline than the Lower 48 states combined, which means our state feels a disproportionate impact of the global marine debris crisis,” U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan said in a release. “These programs, last authorized by our Save Our Seas 2.0 Act, have helped our coastal communities clean up the debris that washes up onto our vast shoreline, provided access to clean drinking water, and supported the health and livelihoods of Alaskans, including our fishermen.

Along with U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island), Sullivan introduced the original Save Our Seas 2.0 Act in 2020. The law instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) initiative, a competitive grant program that provides funding to states, Tribes, and local governments to implement the National Recycling Strategy. Funding can be used to improve recycling infrastructure, reduce contamination in the recycled materials stream, establish or improve markets for recycled commodities, and similar efforts.

SWIFR has provided more than USD 100 million (EUR 87 million) in grants to date, although demand has already far outstripped available funding. According to the EPA, the agency received 452 applications during the first rounds of the grant process. If all of them had been approved, the program would have provided USD 950.3 million (EUR 817.4 million).

“In the first round of grants from one of our Save Our Seas 2.0 programs, every eligible state and territory requested funding,” Whitehouse said in a release. “It is a clear demonstration of the enormous demand from both red states and blue states to address dangerous plastic pollution, and I’m pleased that the Senate has come together to reauthorize these programs. Together, we can protect our clean water and tackle the scourge of plastic waste washing up on shores from coast to coast.”

The Save Our Seas 2.0 Act only authorized the programs for five years, however, necessitating the reauthorization bill.

In addition to SWIFR, the recently passed bill reauthorizes the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Grant Programs and the Trash Free Waters programs, the latter of which provides funding to prevent, remove, and research marine debris.

“Clean water and a healthy ocean support every family in the country and every sector of the economy,"" said Representative Bonamici. ""Extending these successful EPA programs will strengthen the recycling and water systems that stop plastic at its source and support projects that clear debris that damages our shores. These tools work. They deliver cleaner recycling operations, safer drinking water systems, stronger wastewater treatment, and faster trash removal. I'm glad that the Senate advanced our bipartisan bill and look forward to its swift passage in the House to keep families and the environment healthy.”

Though the legislation was passed by the full Senate with unanimous consent, it still needs to be passed by the House and forwarded to U.S. President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

“I want to thank all my Senate colleagues for working to protect our coastal communities, ecosystems and economies, and I urge my House colleagues to join us in renewing these critically important programs before the end of the year,” Sullivan said.",https://s3.divcom.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/7a1cf471866223af2243ea3cd8b2698b.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 00:57:42.651601

This move aims to deliver a fresh lineup of electric and multi-energy vehicles while strengthening its commercial vehicle backbone. The announcement signals the Detroit automaker’s commitment to Europe but underscores the fierce pressures shaping the industry’s transition.

The partnership with Renault forms a core tactical plank. The companies will jointly develop two Ford-branded electric passenger vehicles using Renault’s Ampere platform, slated for launch in 2028. Ford will control design and driving dynamics to ensure a distinct character. A separate letter of intent explores the joint development of light commercial vehicles, seeking crucial scale in a competitive segment. ""We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product,"" said Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe. ""These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.""

This industrial cooperation complements the company's drive to defend its leadership in commercial vehicles through the Ford Pro division. The unit is expanding beyond hardware into a full ecosystem of software and services, using data to maximize vehicle uptime for business customers. The strategy leverages existing partnerships, such as the successful Ford Otosan joint venture, to optimize its industrial footprint across the continent.

Alongside these business moves, Ford issued a stark call for European policymakers to recalibrate regulations. The company argues that current CO2 targets outpace actual electric vehicle adoption, creating an unsustainable strain. With EVs holding just 16.1 percent of the market against a 25 percent requirement for 2025, Ford advocates for a more pragmatic timeline and continued hybrid options. President and CEO Jim Farley framed the European challenge broadly: ""As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry. How we compete here - how we innovate, partner, and invest - will write the playbook for the next generation.""

Ford specifically urged aligning targets with market reality, extending consumer incentives, and protecting small businesses dependent on commercial vehicles from what it views as punitive targets.

This move aims to deliver a fresh lineup of electric and multi-energy vehicles while strengthening its commercial vehicle backbone. The announcement signals the Detroit automaker’s commitment to Europe but underscores the fierce pressures shaping the industry’s transition.

The partnership with Renault forms a core tactical plank. The companies will jointly develop two Ford-branded electric passenger vehicles using Renault’s Ampere platform, slated for launch in 2028. Ford will control design and driving dynamics to ensure a distinct character. A separate letter of intent explores the joint development of light commercial vehicles, seeking crucial scale in a competitive segment. ""We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product,"" said Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe. ""These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.""

This industrial cooperation complements the company's drive to defend its leadership in commercial vehicles through the Ford Pro division. The unit is expanding beyond hardware into a full ecosystem of software and services, using data to maximize vehicle uptime for business customers. The strategy leverages existing partnerships, such as the successful Ford Otosan joint venture, to optimize its industrial footprint across the continent.

Alongside these business moves, Ford issued a stark call for European policymakers to recalibrate regulations. The company argues that current CO2 targets outpace actual electric vehicle adoption, creating an unsustainable strain. With EVs holding just 16.1 percent of the market against a 25 percent requirement for 2025, Ford advocates for a more pragmatic timeline and continued hybrid options. President and CEO Jim Farley framed the European challenge broadly: ""As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry. How we compete here - how we innovate, partner, and invest - will write the playbook for the next generation.""

Ford specifically urged aligning targets with market reality, extending consumer incentives, and protecting small businesses dependent on commercial vehicles from what it views as punitive targets. The automaker’s European path now clearly runs through collaboration, product distinctiveness, and a direct appeal for a more feasible regulatory environment.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2022-Ford-E-Transit-electric-work-van-debut-004.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 02:59:55.882942

Will Congress keep them?,"Evan Saulino, Laura Packard",,,,,https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/12/10/aca-tax-credits-helped-more-oregonians-find-coverage-will-congress-keep-them/,"Every Oregon member of Congress must vote to extend these health care tax credits without delay.
If the health care tax credits are terminated, researchers estimate 8,800 Americans will die every year as a result.
If Congress ends the ACA tax credits, more than 35,000 Oregonians will lose all financial assistance for health insurance starting next month.
This will worsen health care access and result in unprecedented price hikes for health care in rural areas.
Extending the ACA tax credits two or three years will save lives, stabilize health care costs, and support local economies.","This year, more than 97% of Oregonians had health insurance. Getting to this level of coverage took years of steady effort and happened because our state treats health coverage as essential for keeping people healthy, for helping families avoid medical debt and for holding down costs for everyone.

For tens of thousands of small business owners, older Oregonians not yet eligible for Medicare, and working families, health insurance has been affordable because of Affordable Care Act tax credits.

This week, Congress will vote on whether to continue these ACA tax credits or let them die, putting years of hard-won progress at risk of unraveling overnight.

If Congress terminates the healthcare tax credits, 4.8 million Americans will lose their coverage immediately, and insurance premiums could more than double for 20 million others. Some families will see their annual costs rise by more than $8,000.

Every Oregon member of Congress must vote to extend these health care tax credits without delay.

The stakes could not be more clear. If the health care tax credits are terminated, researchers estimate 8,800 Americans will die every year as a result. Put another way: this holiday season, Congress will decide if 24 American sons, daughters and parents live or die for each of the 365 days in 2026 and years beyond.

We in medicine who provide health care will be the first to see the results of Congressional action or inaction. Health care needs don’t go away if people don’t have insurance coverage — people just come to us for help when they’re sicker. Then, treatment is more intensive, more expensive and too often too late.

The financial implications are stark as well. If Congress terminates the tax credits, everyone —not just those who get credits now — will pay much more for their health care in the New Year and beyond. Oregon families are already struggling with rising prices for housing, groceries and childcare.

The last thing we can afford is higher health care costs because Congress chose to terminate assistance that has kept health insurance within reach.This year there are more than 139,000 Oregonians in the ACA insurance marketplace including almost 31,000 in rural Oregon.

If Congress ends the ACA tax credits, more than 35,000 Oregonians will lose all financial assistance for health insurance starting next month. This comes on the heels of projections that 210,000 Oregonians will lose health insurance as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid in the budget bill passed in July.

The resulting loss of funding for health care, together with related downstream financial effects, will cause state economic production to fall by about $40.7 billion. State and local tax revenues are projected to drop by $2.5 billion. Oregon is expected to lose about 2,400 jobs, not just in health care but across our economy.

The impacts will be felt all over our state, but rural Oregonians will be hit hardest. In rural communities already facing hospital closures, workforce shortages, and fragile local economies, an influx of uninsured patients will drive up unpaid care costs and push some rural hospitals past the breaking point. This will worsen health care access and result in unprecedented price hikes for health care in rural areas.

Health care providers are not immune from the unaffordability of health insurance. For example, a small clinic in northeast Oregon that provides comprehensive health care services is seeing their 2026 group health insurance premiums increase nearly 30% — up from $1,000 per employee per month to $1,300 per employee per month. This is unsustainable. In an environment where all costs are increasing, reimbursements for providing care are stagnant, and fewer people will be insured, these increases threaten the clinic’s ability to retain staff, maintain services, and fulfill their mission to provide comprehensive care to the community.

Oregonians must hold our Congressional delegation accountable for protecting constituents. Extending the ACA tax credits two or three years will save lives, stabilize health care costs, and support local economies.

In the longer term, health care does need deeper reform. There must be a better, more sustainable way. Oregon should continue to be a laboratory of health policy innovation, and we are hopeful that Oregon’s Universal Health Plan Governance Board can help our state find a better path towards a more effective, stable system for the future.

But today, the decision before Congress is simple: protect families and communities by extending the healthcare tax credits that keep millions insured.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/health-insurance-Getty.jpeg,N,,2025-12-10 18:00:57.283398

Developers of the controversial Guajolote Ranch Subdivision in northwest Bexar County have withdrawn their application for a Public Improvement District and have pivoted to another plan.

Florida-based Lennar Homes withdrew the application for the PID, only to file for a Municipal Utility District, or MUD, for the development, this time through the city of San Antonio.

Randy Neumann is with The Scenic Loop - Helotes Creek Alliance, a group that opposes the project.

“And what it does is allows them to basically become their own little city. They can do bonding, they can levy taxes. They have a fairly broad swath of powers,"" he told TPR.

Neumann says the MUDs in Texas have typically increased taxes for residents.

“But what has happened as a result of these MUDs is that taxes actually go up two to three times what they are in the city because the costs of delivering economies of scale are just not there. “

The city’s planning department will brief city council members Dec. 17 on the MUD petition, during a council work session.

A MUD is established by petition to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).

San Antonio must formally consent through resolution or ordinance before it can be created, as Guajolote Ranch is located in the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction.

“Typically, if the city says no, the TCEQ will not override that. They do have an alternative. They can go to the state legislature, but that means creating a bill and waiting for the legislature to meet, which won't happen until 2027,"" Neumann said.

Lennar would use the tax dollars to fund a water treatment plant, which would dump as much as one million gallons of treated wastewater into Helotes Creek per day, which opposition groups say could affect the quality of the Edwards Aquifer.

Reuters reported that Tesla is having trouble righting the ship amid a ""sales skid"" as competitors release new, improved EVs, frequently at lower price points than Tesla.
In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that Tesla sales declined 48.5% compared to the same month last year, per Reuters.
""The problem for Elon Musk is not just his own cars and the Chinese carmakers.

The Elon Musk-led company is experiencing increased sales pressure in the world's biggest car markets.

What's happening?

Reuters reported that Tesla is having trouble righting the ship amid a ""sales skid"" as competitors release new, improved EVs, frequently at lower price points than Tesla.

Despite Tesla's record-breaking third quarter — fueled by Americans taking advantage of federal EV tax credits before they expired Sept. 30 — Visible Alpha estimated the company's global vehicle deliveries to drop 7% this year after a 1% decline in 2024.

The situation appears to be most dire in Europe, where more than a dozen EV models sell for $30,000 or less. In October, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that Tesla sales declined 48.5% compared to the same month last year, per Reuters. In China, deliveries hit a three-year low, while sales dipped 8.4%. In the U.S., that drop hit 24%.

""The problem for Elon Musk is not just his own cars and the Chinese carmakers. The problem for Elon Musk is also that the Europeans have caught up,"" Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of University of Duisburg-Essen think tank CAR, told Reuters.

Why is this important?

While Tesla pioneered the modern EV industry, it can struggle to move its offerings in price-sensitive markets. Ultimately, having a variety of EVs available at more accessible price points is a win for consumers on multiple levels.

Charging an EV is shockingly less expensive than filling up at the gas pump, especially if you power up at home. Qmerit offers free, instant quotes for Level 2 chargers. Over their lifecycles, EVs also account for significantly less air pollution associated with billions in health costs.

However, if Tesla's roller-coaster year stretches into 2026 and beyond, consumer confidence in EVs could take a hit, slowing adoption rates. Musk has gone all in on robotics and artificial intelligence as the future of the company — in fact, as Reuters reported, his $1 trillion pay package doesn't require a major uptick in sales for him to unlock a multibillion-dollar reward.

Yet early returns haven't exactly been inspiring. A history of delayed or broken promises, Robotaxi safety concerns, and a talent exodus — not only at Tesla but also at Musk's xAI — have made many wary of Musk's ability to deliver as planned, though shareholders were confident enough in his leadership to approve his unprecedented pay package.

What's being done about this?

Tesla released more affordable, stripped-down variants of the Model Y and 3 to bolster sales. While powering up at home is cheaper than relying on public charging stations, its Supercharger network remains top-of-the-class, with its vast network helping EV drivers on long road trips.

Reuters also suggested that Tesla ""could benefit as several legacy automakers dial back EV models and factory investments,"" including General Motors, Honda, and Ford.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tesla-cars.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:00:45.066884

EPA, the court reviewed a 2023 EPA action that relied on two components: excluding two wildfire-influenced ozone days from Detroit’s design value calculation and redesignating the area to attainment. Judges agreed with EPA’s technical assessment of the June 2022 Canadian wildfire smoke event, finding the agency relied on a clear set of meteorological indicators, satellite data, and chemical signatures that supported a causal link to elevated ozone levels.

The outcome shifted, however, when the court examined Detroit’s redesignation. Because the region was bumped from Marginal to Moderate status after missing its attainment deadline, Michigan was required to implement Moderately classified ozone controls—most notably RACT for VOC and NOₓ sources—before EPA could approve attainment. Those obligations were still outstanding in May 2023. The court concluded that EPA cannot disregard statutory requirements based on the timing of a state’s request and vacated the redesignation.

Infrastructure Consequences With Immediate Reach

Restoring Detroit’s Moderate classification has direct implications for infrastructure planning across the region. Several high-value projects—including highway corridor modernization, logistics hub expansions, EV-supply-chain facilities, and bridge upgrades—depend on conformity analyses tied to ozone status. Remaining in Moderate classification shifts the burden back toward stricter review.

Transportation conformity.

IIJA-funded projects involving added capacity must now demonstrate compliance with SIP budgets that remain constrained without a RACT-backed emissions foundation. This may lengthen modeling timelines or require additional mitigation strategies before approvals move forward.

Industrial development.

Manufacturing expansions—particularly automotive and battery-related operations—must now undergo more detailed permitting for NOₓ and VOC emissions. RACT requirements will influence technology choices, operational strategies, and deployment schedules.

Construction-phase emissions.

Major projects generate temporary emissions from diesel fleets and detour traffic. Under Moderate status, contractors and public agencies will need clearer plans for idle reduction, equipment upgrades, or temporary offsets that prevent exceedances during peak construction seasons.

A National Signal for Ozone Governance

The decision also marks another indication that courts, post-Loper Bright, are reading the Clean Air Act more strictly. EPA’s historical flexibility around redesignations—particularly in regions trying to secure quicker permitting environments—may face more challenges. Other states that used early redesignation requests to soften the impact of bump-ups may now need to revisit whether all statutory control measures were in place.

What This Means as 2026 Approaches

Michigan must now develop and submit a complete RACT SIP and demonstrate implementation before EPA revisits Detroit’s attainment status. Until then, the regulatory environment across the region will remain more demanding for transportation agencies, industrial operators, and developers planning long-term infrastructure investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251209-184038-da7-Detroit%20City%20Street%20during%20the%20day.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 22:57:59.775516

New research from consulting company EY shows that car buyers across the globe are changing their minds on wanting EV over combustion. They're also saying that EV buyers are adjusting their purchase plans as governments shift course on electric vehicles.

Half Of Buyers Will Go Combustion In The Next Two Years

According to EY's Mobility Consumer Index, half of car buyers around the world plan to buy a combustion-powered vehicle in the next two years. That's up 13 points from the same study done a year ago, and most of those changes are coming from buyers who had been looking at EVs.

The study found that electric vehicle preference has dropped 10 points to just 14%. Hybrid buyer preference has also fallen, but only slightly. Down five points to 16%.

This sentiment isn't limited to the US, though it was highest there. Consumer intent to buy combustion over electric was up 12 points in the Americas, versus 11 points in Europe and 10 points in the Asia-Pacific region.

Of those shoppers who are still considering electric, more than a third are reconsidering their next purchase. EY said that 36% said that geopolitical developments are behind reconsidering or delaying those EV shopping trips.

Shifting Policy Makes Buyers Wary

The reasons are clear: Massive, recent policy shifts, including the US removing its EV tax incentives as well as the EU's moves to back down on its own mandates. Automakers, too, are reducing the number of options for customers. And having multiple automakers that never delivered on electric promises also likely puts a damper on buyers.

""Consumers are weighing the realities of policy shifts, cost pressures and uneven charging infrastructure. The long-term trend appears to be a shift away from a purely electric (‘E-only’) approach toward a more diversified future for vehicle powertrains, with different vehicle technologies serving different customer needs,"" said EY Global Aerospace, Defense and Mobility Leader Constantin M. Gall.

Buyer concerns over the vehicles themselves haven't gone away either. 29% told EY that range anxiety remains a top concern. 28% are worried about charging infrastructure, and 28% were worried about battery replacement costs.

Range remains a serious factor even as more and more ultra-long-range EVs hit the market. Battery replacement costs stick around on the list of worries, though data continues to show EV packs lasting longer than expected.

The research also found that buyers aren't really buying into autonomous driving capabilities, either. Only 26% of consumers said they felt comfortable with Level 3 or higher. 60% said they were comfortable with lower levels of automation in their own vehicles, with worries about accident risk, tech failure, and high cost all involved.

To little surprise, customers are less happy with dealers than ever before. 41% of buyers said they preferred to complete their purchase in person, down from 61% last year. EV buyers still prefer in-person sales, though, because they want guidance on charging and other tech features.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-engin-akyurt.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-10 17:00:45.863630

The report, titled “State of Decline: Cuts to State Environmental Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA,” examines impacts of the Trump administration’s planned downsizing of the Environmental Protection Agency.

With cuts to the EPA, the federal government plans to shift certain tasks to the state level. But states may not have the capacity to shoulder additional responsibility for environmental oversight, the EIP found in its report.

Almost two thirds of states – 31 – cut jobs at their environmental agencies from 2010 through 2024, leading to the elimination of 3,725 positions, according to the document.

North Carolina is one of the fastest growing states in the country and home to a large and expanding manufacturing and farming sector, Jen Duggan, executive director of the EIP, said.

Despite this, North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality has lost nearly a third of its staff since 2010, the steepest decline of any state in the country at 32%. This translates to 394 eliminated jobs in pollution control and other environmental programs, according to the EIP.

Connecticut (26%), Arizona (25%), and Louisiana (24%) are next on the list in terms of percentage cuts.

“The effectiveness of our nation’s environmental laws relies on a well-resourced EPA working in partnership with capable state agencies,” Duggan said. “When states have the necessary authority, expertise and commitment, the EPA can delegate many responsibilities to them, but this shared system only works when both levels of government are adequately supported.”

The cuts are harmful to the state, said Drew Ball, Southeast campaigns director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Reduced staffing leads to weaker enforcement, which in turn results in dangerous conditions for North Carolinians.

Ball described stories of a family in eastern North Carolina noticing their tap water turning cloudy after a heavy rain and a neighborhood near Wilmington smelling ammonia from a poultry operation. Because of the decrease in staff, state inspectors could not immediately investigate, leading to public health concerns.

“The very agency responsible for protecting these families is facing a growing burden,” Ball said. “That’s a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin.”

In addition to federal cuts that have already occurred, there could be more in the upcoming months. Congress is expected to vote on the EPA’s budget for fiscal year 2026 in January.

Earlier this year, the White House said President Donald Trump wants the EPA to cut 65% of its spending, POLITICO previously reported.

The agency put out a statement in response saying the president and EPA administrator Zeldin are working towards creating a more efficient and effective federal government.

“Compared to 2024, the total amount spent year over year at EPA will deliver significant efficiencies to American taxpayers by cutting wasteful grants, reassessing the agency’s real estate footprint, and delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure,” the statement read.

Ball compared the situation to dismantling the fire department when a house is already burning.

“North Carolina cannot keep its people safe if the agencies meant to protect them are left to wither, and the federal government cannot expect states to do more while it simultaneously knocks their legs out from under them,” he said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mining-along-nolichucky-river_photo-leosharp1765401907.jpg?h=0e628010&itok=VEAfC9NP,N,,2025-12-10 17:01:10.624575

Tear-drinking moths caught on camera sipping moose tears

Author contact: Laurence A. Clarfeld (laurence.clarfeld@uvm.edu)

Researchers in Vermont have captured the first known evidence of a moth or butterfly drinking the tears of a wild moose. While tear-feeding (or “lachryphagy”) on birds, reptiles and livestock has been widely observed in tropical regions, this behavior is extremely rare outside the tropics with only one other known sighting occurring in Arkansas, USA. On June 19, 2024, trails cameras in the Green Mountain National Forest recorded a sequence of images showing moths visiting a bull moose’s eyes. These images came from a larger Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department survey comprising over 247,000 moose photos across New England. Tear-drinking is thought to provide moths and butterflies with essential minerals, especially sodium in temperate regions, while tropical species often seek proteins. Although this behavior offers a unique source of minerals for moths, the authors suggest that it could pose health risks for moose, potentially spreading eye infections or adding to the stress of existing parasites, such as winter ticks.

Masquerade behavior documented in deep-sea squid for the first time

Author contact: Alejandra Mejía-Saenz (alejandra.mejia-saenz@uhi.ac.uk)

Scientists exploring the deep seafloor in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, an area targeted for seabed mining in the central Pacific, have recorded a never-before-seen behavior in a deep-sea squid. At 4,100 meters below the surface, an underwater robot spotted a whiplash squid buried upside-down in the mud, with only its tentacles and siphon exposed. Squid are not known to burrow, and this burying position has never been documented in deep-sea cephalopods (the group that includes squids and octopuses). The researchers postulate that the squid may have been camouflaging itself to look like common seafloor structures such as sponge stalks or worm tubes. This disguise could help it avoid predators or attract small crustaceans that gather around these structures, making it either a defensive tactic or a clever way to hunt. Because deep-sea squids are so rarely seen, this ability to self-disguise may explain why they are often missed and why their diversity may be underestimated. The finding underscores how little we know about abyssal ecosystems and why studying them is essential as mining and climate pressures increase.

Recent peat growth transforming Alaskan ecosystems

Author contact: Alexis R. Stansfield (alexisstans98@gmail.com)

Sphagnum moss has been present on Alaska’s North Slope for thousands of years, but scientists have discovered that the dense peat patches of these mosses that now dot the region’s tundra are younger than expected, with most having formed within the past 150 to 200 years. To investigate their origins, researchers sampled peat cores from nine sites spanning a 300-kilometer stretch of Alaska’s North Slope and radiocarbon-dated the layers to see when Sphagnum moss took hold. They found that the patches of Sphagnum peat largely established after the late 1800s, with the fastest expansion unfolding since the 1960s. These surprisingly recent origins align with a period of regional warming. As temperatures rise and growing seasons lengthen, Sphagnum moss gains a strong ecological advantage, allowing Sphagnum peat patches to expand. The shift is transforming microbial communities and is likely increasing the carbon storage potential of the landscape, and the authors assert that understanding how and why these peat patches form is crucial for predicting future tundra changes and their impact on carbon cycling in the Arctic.

Trade-offs for protected areas and sustainable development goals

Author contact: Aline Gaglia Alves (alinegaglia@gmail.com)

Protected areas (PAs), such as national parks and marine reserves, cover more than 52 million square kilometers worldwide and are intended to protect nature while supporting human well-being. However, their effects on local economies and communities can be mixed, sometimes limiting jobs or restricting access to traditional lands. A global review of 33 studies found that PAs generally benefit environmental, social and economic outcomes, particularly for marine ecosystems, but that they can sometimes conflict with economic growth. For example, some protected areas were linked to reductions in jobs and industrial development, highlighting a mismatch between conservation goals and local economic opportunities. Notably, positive social outcomes often occurred even when economic impacts were negative, emphasizing the need to balance multiple objectives. The effectiveness of PAs depends heavily on local management and community involvement. Most research focuses on environmental outcomes, leaving social and economic effects less understood. Experts recommend more integrated, context-specific studies that include multiple stakeholders to ensure protected areas support sustainable development across all dimensions.

A scalable strategy to regrow coral reefs

Author contact: Christopher Doropoulos (christopher.doropoulos@csiro.au)

Coral reef recovery depends on young corals successfully settling and growing, but on many degraded reefs too few coral larvae are finding spots to attach and thrive—making natural recovery unlikely without help. Efforts to boost coral numbers by releasing larvae over large areas have shown limited success, in part because the larvae are difficult to distribute effectively at scale. A new study on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef introduces a promising solution. Researchers developed a “larval seedbox,” a modular device that slowly releases coral larvae into the surrounding water, allowing natural currents to disperse them. Over the course of the study, five seedboxes delivered 14 million larvae across two hectares of severely bleached reef. Within 48 hours, more than 85% of monitored points around the seedboxes had newly settled corals, at densities up to 56 times higher than background levels and within the range known to support reef recovery. Although long-term outcomes remain to be measured, this method offers a scalable, field-ready approach to accelerating coral reef restoration.

Early classroom lessons shape treatment of Indigenous communities

Author contact: Ryan E. Emanuel (ryan.emanuel@duke.edu)

A new study highlights major educational gaps among environmental professionals regarding Indigenous peoples, and shows how those gaps can impact real-world decisions. The paper reports on discussions with 19 environmental professionals working in North Carolina state agencies. Participants described growing up with stereotypes, fragmented lessons or near-total omissions of Indigenous histories and cultures. Many said their K-12 curriculum treated Native peoples as figures of the distant past, portrayed mainly through trauma or reduced to classroom crafts and caricatures. The authors note that when agency staff lack accurate knowledge, they are less likely to meaningfully engage Tribal nations, especially those without full federal recognition (and that are thereby not always covered by consultation laws). For example, the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline was planned without consultation with any affected North Carolina Tribes despite its disproportionate impacts: approximately 25% of the state's Indigenous population lived along the pipeline route. Addressing these gaps in education is essential for environmental justice, the authors conclude, because decision-making that overlooks Indigenous presence and expertise will continue to reinforce past harms and undermine efforts to protect land, water and culturally significant places.

Then Came the Trump Administration’s Wind Energy Memorandum Designed to Halt Development of Wind Power in the U.S.

On his first day in office, President Trump issued an executive memorandum, “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.” 90 Fed. Reg. 8363 (Jan. 20, 2025) (herein the “Wind Memo” or the “Wind Order” or the “Wind Directive”).

Among other things, the Wind Memo directed federal agencies to suspend issuing all new permits, leases, and other authorizations related to the development and operation of both onshore and offshore wind energy projects. In compliance with the Wind Memo, several federal agencies ordered an immediate pause in the issuance of all wind energy authorizations.1

Federal Agencies Acted Immediately to Halt Wind Energy Projects.

Federal agencies wasted no time implementing the Wind Memo to indefinitely halt wind-energy approvals. For example, on January 20, 2025, the same day the Wind Memo was issued, Acting Secretary of the Interior Walter Cruickshank issued an order that suspended delegations of authority to “Department Bureaus and Offices” to “issue any onshore or offshore renewable energy authorization, including but not limited to a lease, amendment to a lease, right of way, amendment to a right of way, contract, or any other agreement required to allow for renewable energy development.”2

Other agencies issued a variety of orders to implement the Wind Memo including:

A representative of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration informed an offshore-wind developer that its Marine Mammal Protection Act incidental-take authorization was subject to the Wind Directive’s pause;

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service temporarily ceasing issuance of permits to wind facilities until further notice;

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) postponed virtual public meetings on its draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement for Potential Mitigation of Future Development of Wind Lease Areas Offshore California;

The U.S. Department of the Interior and BOEM acted to temporarily halt offshore wind leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The agencies’ memorandum paused new or renewed approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for offshore wind projects pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. As a result, the February virtual public meetings on BOEM’s Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for the proposed Vineyard MidAtlantic Project were cancelled;

On February 5, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers paused permitting for 168 renewable energy projects. The Corps lifted the halt a few days later – but not for wind projects;

On February 28, EPA Region 2 filed a motion requesting that the Environmental Appeals Board remand the Clean Air Act permit for Atlantic Shores Offshore-Wind Project 1 back to the Region for reevaluation. The motion cited the Wind Directive as its basis; and

On April 16, the Interior Secretary issued a memorandum instructing BOEM to order that the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York indefinitely “cease all construction activities.”

Seventeen States and an Industry Alliance Sued to Overturn the Wind Memo.

On May 5, 2025, 17 states3 and the District of Columbia, sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., challenging the Wind Memo. Later, an industry group, the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, intervened. The complaint asked the court to declare that each of the agencies’ actions to adopt and implement the Wind Memo are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; that the actions are not in accordance with law or are in excess of statutory right in violation of the APA; and that the actions are otherwise ultra vires.

The plaintiffs sought vacutur of the Wind Memo and asked the court to preliminarily and permanently “enjoin the agencies from implementing or otherwise giving effect to any action that halts or otherwise impedes wind-energy development.”

Failure to Offer Any Explanation, Other than the Wind Memo, for Their Actions.

After concluding that both the state and industry plaintiffs had “standing” to pursue their claims, and that the agencies’ actions were “final’ for purposes of appeal under the APA, the district court readily embraced one of the fundamental challenges by plaintiffs that focused on (1) the failure of the agencies to offer any explanation for the delays and disruptions to wind-energy permitting and development, other than referencing the Wind Memo, and (2) that the agencies failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the “sharp reversal of federal policy or decisions regarding wind-energy development.”

In ruling against the administration, the court stated:

Here, the administrative record consists of only two documents: the Wind Memo and the Interior Department’s written order suspending the issuance of renewable energy authorizations pursuant to the Wind Memo. . . . The Agency Defendants have certified that these two documents constitute the entirety of the “evidence considered, directly or indirectly, by [the Agency] Defendants for the alleged decision” to “temporarily cease issuing new approvals and other authorizations” pursuant to the Wind Memo. . . .

Although the Interior Department’s written order stated that it would expire in sixty days and purported only to bind divisions of the Interior Department, all Agency Defendants acknowledge that they will continue to carry out the Wind Order at least until the completion of the Comprehensive Assessment.

And further:

This scant administrative record makes clear, and the Agency Defendants do not meaningfully dispute, that the Agency Defendants have not “reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the[ir] decision” to implement the Wind Order. . . .

Indeed, the Agency Defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the President’s direction to do so.States Have Designed Their Energy Policies to Rely on the Development of Wind Energy Projects.

Count V of the plaintiffs’ complaint makes claims for violations of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) and alleges that:

Paragraph 432. The Wind Directive and Defendants DOI, Burgum, BOEM, and Cruickshank’s (the DOI defendants) adoption of its categorical and indefinite halt on permitting of wind-energy projects is immediately adversely affecting the States’ legal interest in the “expeditious and orderly development,” 43 U.S.C. § 1332(3), of wind energy on the Outer Continental Shelf;

Paragraph 433. The states have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in wind-energy development and even more in transmission upgrades needed to bring wind-energy resources onto the electricity grid. This investment has spurred the wind-energy industry to spend billions on infrastructure, jobs training programs, and supply-chain development;

Paragraph 434. The states have relied on wind energy as a reliable, affordable source of electricity that helps meet rising demand; and

Paragraph 435. The states also rely on wind energy to help meet their goals, often required by state law, to decarbonize their electricity grids and mitigate greenhouse-gas emissions. These decarbonization efforts are designed to mitigate the impacts of climate change, which are harming and will continue to harm the wellbeing and stability of the States’ communities and economies.

The court agreed and stated:

Agency defendants were obligated, at minimum, to “assess whether there were reliance interests, determine whether they were significant, and weigh any such interests against competing policy concerns.” . . . They did not do so, let alone provide the “more detailed justification” required upon determining that serious reliance interests exist.

. . .

Accordingly, the Court finds that the Wind Order is arbitrary and capricious. The Wind Order therefore must be set aside.

And finally:

For the foregoing reasons, plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment . . . are ALLOWED and the agency defendants’ motion for summary judgment . . . is DENIED. The Wind Order is declared unlawful, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and is VACATED in its entirety.

This decision may not be surprising given opposition from congressional Republicans and industry lobbyists to Direct File. But it is a bewildering choice, particularly given low- and middle-income taxpayers’ concerns around affordability, to end a popular government-provided program that saves people money by allowing them to file their taxes for free. Moreover, there is good reason to be skeptical of the Administration’s plan to rely on commercial tax preparation companies to provide free filing options, as it is likely, and not surprising, that these firms’ for-profit motives will overshadow their commitment to helping taxpayers file for free.

The Direct File program showed that the government can effectively use technology to save tax filers time and money. The Inflation Reduction Act required the IRS to commission an independent study[3] on the feasibility of the government creating a free tax filing program. Based on the study’s results, the IRS developed and rolled out a pilot version in 2024, followed by an expanded version for 2025, with plans to continue expanding in later years.

The IRS rolled out Direct File gradually to ensure a high level of quality at each stage. The 2024 pilot[4] covered taxpayers with a limited range of income sources (income from wages and salaries, Social Security, and less than $1,500 of interest), and while participants could claim the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit, the tool did not include those who itemize deductions. The IRS widened the scope of the program in 2025: the number of participating states doubled from 12 to 25, and taxpayers could include other income sources (including additional retirement income, unemployment, and unlimited interest income) and tax credits (such as premium tax credits).

Customer satisfaction with the new program was high, with 94 percent[5] of Direct File users in 2025 describing their experience as “excellent” or “above average.” The Government Accountability Office (GAO) deemed the Direct File pilot a success[6] and recommended that the IRS expand the tool to taxpayers in all states. The Taxpayer Advocate Service declared that Direct File allowed taxpayers to “easily file accurate tax returns fast[7],” and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration recommended[8] continued expansions and improvements.

Despite Direct File’s broad popularity among users, a Trump Treasury Department report[9] offered a contorted rationale for the decision to end the program. The report said that only 15 percent of taxpayers would choose Direct File, but this is misleading because:

48 percent would prefer to keep filing as they do now — but only “if it were free;” and

37 percent would prefer a “return free” option in which the IRS would pre-populate a taxpayer’s return and essentially prepare the return — effectively seeking an expanded version of Direct File with features that only the IRS could provide (and which the Trump Administration would obviously oppose).

Instead of Direct File, the Treasury report signaled plans to reinvigorate the “Free File” program, where commercial tax preparation companies agree to offer limited services to certain tax filers for free. This program was widely criticized for misleading tax filers, so that they ended up paying to file their returns, despite being eligible to file for free. ProPublica exposed these efforts[10] — which included, for example, using special coding language to hide free products from search engine results — and the Federal Trade Commission subsequently took action[11] against Intuit, the parent company of TurboTax, for engaging in deceptive advertising practices.

A recent comment[12] from the CEO of H&R Block to Wall Street analysts highlights the clear problem of relying on profit-seeking businesses to offer their products for free:

“I think what we're getting better and better at is both understanding the cohorts of consumers that are likely free forever versus those predisposed to become paying over time, which requires us to get better and better at reaching them individually.”

In short, for-profit tax prep companies will continue to prioritize profits by driving people toward paid products while downplaying the needs of taxpayers who are likely to remain “free forever” — such as households with low and moderate incomes and those who file relatively simple returns. These are the very people Direct File, or any other taxpayer-focused free filing program, would serve.

Supporters of Direct File, return-free filing, and other taxpayer services that government can and should provide in the 21st century must not give up, and they should play the long game. This means scrutinizing how the industry responds during the upcoming filing season, working with states to continue to develop creative and easy-to-use free filing systems, and encouraging federal policymakers to push for a future return of the Direct File program.",https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/thumbnails/image/istock_000005855720_large.jpg?itok=xXa7ndfO,N,,2025-12-10 17:00:53.703619

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (the “O3B”) provided significant changes to the renewable energy sector reshaping the policy and investment landscape. However, the changes in the O3B offer an opportunity for those in the geothermal sector to combine early-stage deductions (in line with those available to oil and gas drilling operations) with long-term income streams and tax credit eligibility.

Geothermal power has a combination of the attributes investors appreciate most in clean energy: dispatchable baseload generation, long asset lives, and monetizable tax benefits. By organizing a fund to invest in a geothermal project, sponsors can offer investors exposure to multiple sources of value, including (i) allocations of intangible drilling and development costs (“IDCs”), (ii) clean electricity tax credits under sections 48E (the “ITC”) or 45Y (“PTC”), (iii) ongoing operating income from sales of electricity, and (iv) cash proceeds from the sale (transfer) of credits to third parties.

IDCs: Immediate Deductions for Early-Stage Drilling Expenditures

Generally, capital expenditures, e.g., improvements, new buildings, etc., must be capitalized and are not currently deductible for taxpayers.[1] However, an exception in the Code[2] allows a taxpayer that holds a working or operating interest in a geothermal well to elect to expense IDCs (rather than capitalize them).[3] IDCs generally include non‑salvageable, pre‑production costs such as labor, fuel, repairs, hauling, supplies, and similar items that are “incident to and necessary for the drilling of wells and preparation of wells,” and the election is made by deducting them on the first return in which such costs are incurred.[4]

Choosing Between §48E (ITC) and §45Y (PTC)

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) introduced technology‑neutral credits that apply to geothermal electricity facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024:

§ 48E (ITC) provides a credit equal to an applicable percentage of qualified investment (basis) in a qualified facility. The base rate is 6%, but a 30% rate applies when prevailing wage and apprenticeship (“PWA”) requirements are satisfied or for certain small/early‑construction cases; adders for domestic content and energy community can increase the credit further.

§ 45Y (PTC) provides a per‑kWh credit for electricity produced and sold from a qualified facility. The base credit rate is 0.3¢/kWh, and a 1.5¢/kWh rate applies if PWA requirements are met; the credit is available for 10 years from the placed‑in‑service date.

Note, however, that taxpayers are disallowed from claiming both the investment credit and the production credit for the same facility.[5] Accordingly, sponsors must carefully consider the potential options in order to select the most valuable approach.

Monetizing Credits: Transferability and Direct Pay

For taxable investors, the IRA added a section to the Code that allows an eligible taxpayer (including partnerships) to transfer credits to an unrelated buyer for cash.[6] Consideration must be paid in cash, but the payment is neither (i) taxable income for the seller or (ii) a deductible payment for the purchaser.[7] For partnerships and S corporations, credit sale proceeds are treated as tax‑exempt income for basis purposes and are allocated according to partners’ (or shareholders’) pro rata portion of the underlying credit.[8]

Tax‑exempt and governmental entities may utilize “elective pay” (often referred to as “direct pay”) for credits allowed under sections 45Y and 48E.[9] This election permits the tax-exempt entity to receive a refund equal to the credit amount after a required pre‑filing registration.[10]

Operating Income: Revenue from Power Sales

Unlike intermittent renewables, geothermal plants can deliver a steady baseload output, enabling long‑term power purchase agreements (“PPAs”) and predictable revenues. When paired with tax credit monetization and IDC expensing, these cash flows support competitive, or superior, return profiles in an investment fund.

Example Financial Illustration: ITC vs. PTC for a Geothermal Project

Important: The numbers below are illustrative to compare mechanics and use synthetic assumptions which omit depreciation/basis adjustments (including any ITC basis reduction), financing costs, inflation adjustments to the PTC, and tax‑rate effects from IDC deductions. Actual outcomes depend on specific facts and current guidance.

Assume the Following:

Nameplate capacity: 20 MW (AC); capacity factor: 90% → 157.68 million kWh/year.

Capital expenditure (capex): $120 million; IDCs assumed at 35% of capex (IDC expensing election available to working‑interest holders.)

PPA price: $60/MWh (illustrative).

PWA requirements are met and credits may be transferred at 92¢ per $1 of credit.

Results

Annual electricity: 157,680,000 kWh.

Annual operating revenue (at $60/MWh): $9,460,800.

IDC amount (35%): $42,000,000 (potential year‑one deduction to working‑interest investors via fund allocation).

Scenario A – Claim §48E ITC and Transfer the Credit

ITC face value (30% of $120M): $36,000,000.

Cash from credit sale at 92%: $3,120,000

Scenario B – Claim §45Y PTC and Transfer Annual Credits

PTC face value per year (1.5¢ × 157.68M kWh): $2,365,200.

PTC face value over 10 years: $23,652,000.

Cash from credit sale at 92%: $2,175,984/year ($21,759,840 over 10 years).

Nelson Mullins Observation: In this example, a 30% ITC (transferred) delivers more near‑term cash than the 10‑year stream of PTCs. Projects with lower capex per MWh or higher output may tilt toward the PTC, while capital‑intensive developments often favor the ITC. Adders (domestic content, energy community) can improve either option’s economics.

If you’re a prospective EV customer in Europe, or if you follow developments in the EV sector, this partnership should result in EVs with Ford’s familiar design language and driving character, but at a more affordable price point (due to Renault’s cost-effective EV platform). For everyday drivers who don’t want to spend a fortune on a fancy electric vehicle, these models could offer the practicality and affordability they need.

The Ford-Renault partnerships could also benefit small businesses and fleet operators, as the automakers may work on electric vans. For our readers in the United States, this alliance shows how quickly the EV landscape is changing and how major auto players have to rely on collaborations rather than competition to survive in specific markets. Whether the partnerships pan out the way the automakers plan them to be is something that will unfold in 2028.

As and when the companies successfully co-develop and release the first few vehicles, they could expand the partnership to more models and deepen technology sharing.

“CP2 is a strategically important project to global energy supply and security,” Chris Ashton, Worley CEO, said in a July statement.","Federal regulators have advanced the $28-billion CP2 LNG project in Cameron Parish, La., completing a court-mandated environmental review and authorizing construction of a key compressor station, as developer Venture Global begins work on one of the largest liquefied natural gas export terminals ever built on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's early-December determination approved construction of the Moss Lake Compressor Station—an essential component of the CP Express pipeline—after the agency found that the company had satisfied all outstanding pre-construction conditions.

The authorization caps a year of intensified environmental scrutiny triggered by a federal court ruling that reshaped how the independent commission evaluates cumulative air impacts for major LNG facilities.

Court Forces Deeper Air-Quality Review

CP2’s permitting trajectory shifted after the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., in its Healthy Gulf decision, faulted the commission's cumulative air-quality analysis in separate LNG litigation last year. Although that case did not involve CP2, the ruling prompted it to reopen and expand its environmental review for both the terminal and the 85-mile CP Express pipeline.

FERC issued a Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in February and a Final Supplemental EIS in May. The updated analysis incorporates revised stack parameters, refined dispersion modeling and updated background concentrations for nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and other operational emissions across the industrial corridor surrounding the Calcasieu Ship Channel.

The commission also reassessed environmental-justice conditions along the CP Express route through Jasper and Newton counties in Texas.

In a formal comment letter this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said the supplemental analysis addressed the court’s direction and provided “a more complete cumulative-impact evaluation.”

With those findings in hand, FERC reaffirmed that with required mitigation, the project’s emissions would not produce significant effects, clearing the way for final authorizations under the Natural Gas Act.

Opposition surfaced throughout the federal review. Environmental groups, industrial energy consumers and advocacy organizations filed protests with the US Energy Dept. and comments in FERC’s docket, citing cumulative emissions, environmental justice impacts and broader market concerns.

The two agencies acknowledged those objections, with Energy concluding the exports remain in the public interest and FERC stating that its enhanced modeling resolved the air-quality issues highlighted by the court.

Mobilization Accelerates at Terminal Site

With the supplemental review complete and the Moss Lake authorization issued, Venture Global now holds the approvals needed to advance broader field activity. Earlier Notices to Proceed enabled limited preparatory work, but the company disclosed in June that it had begun full mobilization on the 1,150-acre site following completion of the supplemental review.

Route map shows the CP Express pipeline connecting Texas supply points to Venture Global’s CP2 LNG terminal in Cameron Parish, La., including the authorized Moss Lake Compressor Station.

Construction activity has accelerated. FERC’s biweekly construction compliance report for Nov. 8–21 shows contractors expanding clearing and grading, establishing additional laydown areas, improving site access and installing erosion-control measures across active work zones.

Inspectors documented proper buffering of protected resources and reported no unresolved environmental noncompliance during the period.

Venture Global’s third-quarter construction update adds further detail, reporting more than 3,500 workers on site as of Oct. 31 and noting that soil stabilization is 88% complete, LNG tank construction has reached 28% and engineering is 99.5% finished.

The company also stated that permanent plant equipment is 98% procured and that all CP Express pipeline materials have been delivered. Eight of the project’s 26 modular liquefaction trains are complete, with fabrication continuing off-site.

Venture Global declined ENR’s request for an interview for additional information.

The Moss Lake Compressor Station will connect multiple interstate transmission lines to the terminal. CP Express will supply feed gas consistent with CP2’s planned 28-million-ton-per-year output using a 36-train modular liquefaction system.

Modular EPC Strategy Drives Off-site Progress

Venture Global’s “design one, build many” execution model—developed through its earlier Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines LNG projects—remains central to CP2’s delivery strategy. Major process modules and equipment packages are already in fabrication yards, enabling parallel advancement of off-site manufacturing and on-site civil work.

Australia-based engineer-contractor Worley received full notice to proceed this summer under a reimbursable EPC contract covering CP2’s initial phase. Two of its U.S. offices are leading engineering and construction planning.

Worley had previously been executing early work under limited-notice authorizations and reported recently increasing its field presence as site development scales up.

“CP2 is a strategically important project to global energy supply and security,” Chris Ashton, Worley CEO, said in a July statement. He added that the project’s modular execution model positions CP2 among the most advanced LNG developments now under construction in the U.S.

Venture Global said in its Q3 corporate results update that it has invested $8.2 billion in CP2 to date, including $1.1 billion in Phase II activities as engineering and procurement progress.

Energy issued its final export authorization for CP2 on Oct. 21 to non-Free Trade Agreement countries, approving shipments of about 1,446 billion cu ft of domestically produced LNG per year through 2050. The agency’s 73-page order (5264-A) relies on updated market modeling and the department’s long-standing use of categorical exclusion B5.7 to satisfy environmental-review obligations under NEPA.

The order responds to extensive protests and comments from environmental organizations, industrial energy consumers and advocacy groups.

DOE concluded that expanded LNG exports remain in the public interest. The approval followed Venture Global’s July financial close for CP2’s initial phase, supported by about $15 billion in commitments.

Local and National Implications Ahead

Venture Global estimates that CP2 will support more than 7,500 construction jobs at peak and employ about 400 permanent workers once operational. The company projects more than $4 billion in local property tax payments over the facility’s lifespan, making it one of the largest anticipated revenue sources for Cameron Parish.

For regulators, CP2 serves as an early indicator of how the federal permitting landscape is shifting. FERC’s updated cumulative-air-impact methodology, developed in response to the appeals court ruling, is expected to influence future LNG and pipeline evaluations.

Two trade agreements recently negotiated by the Trump administration contain novel and coercive provisions with little precedent in US trade policy or the global trade system.

The agreements, concluded with Cambodia and Malaysia in October, demonstrate that bilateral dealmaking has emerged alongside tariffs as a key tool in US efforts to rewrite the rules of global trade and deter economic integration with China.

To date, Southeast Asian countries with ties to both US and Chinese clean energy markets have sought to avoid choosing between Washington and Beijing, but this hedging strategy may have an expiration date as US officials seek greater control over regional trade policy.

In a recent commentary, the authors observed that volatility in US-China trade relations has been a major factor in the structure of cross-border clean energy supply chains, drawing particular attention to the Trump administration’s assertive use of tariffs. Alongside these tariffs, the United States has pursued ad hoc “deals” with a range of trade partners over the past six months that in both form and substance bear little resemblance to conventional free trade agreements (FTAs).

This post analyzes two recent examples involving Cambodia and Malaysia. Titled “Agreements on Reciprocal Trade” (ARTs), the deals include unorthodox and coercive provisions that force difficult tradeoffs on countries with links to both US and Chinese clean energy markets. How these provisions will work in practice remains to be seen, but their goals are clear: to constrain China’s economic footprint in Southeast Asia and delineate mutually exclusive US and Chinese spheres of influence in global trade.

By inserting these terms in the ARTs, the Trump administration is acknowledging the limits of steep US tariffs on Southeast Asian clean energy goods, which have reduced US exposure to Chinese-linked supply chains but not hindered Southeast Asian countries’ economic integration with China. But while the ARTs may contribute to US national security goals, their more immediate impact will be to cause economic fragmentation that risks slowing the clean energy transition in both the United States and Southeast Asia.

Caught in the Middle

Cambodia and Malaysia, like most Southeast Asian countries, have strong ties to both the Chinese and US economies. China and the United States have been, respectively, Malaysia’s first- and third-largest trading partner for over a decade. China is also Cambodia’s largest trading partner, followed closely by the United States; together, the two countries presently account for around half of Cambodia’s foreign trade. Last year, the United States was the second-largest recipient of Malaysian exports (after Singapore), and the largest destination for Cambodian goods by a wide margin.

Cambodia and Malaysia have received billions in Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the clean energy sector, and are part of two regional trade initiatives that include China: the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area. Cambodia also has a bilateral FTA with China. These economic linkages have enabled both Cambodia and Malaysia to build competitive solar manufacturing industries and decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

As recently as 2023, both Cambodia and Malaysia sold billions in solar products to the United States, but export volumes have contracted sharply after both the Biden and Trump administrations imposed extremely high tariffs. In the last year alone, Cambodian solar exports dropped an astonishing 99.9 percent, from $2.4 billion in 2023 to $6 million in the first nine months of 2025.

Unusual Conditions

Like other governments that have struck trade deals with the Trump administration, Cambodia and Malaysia were brought to the negotiating table by US tariffs. On April 2, the administration announced economy-wide “liberation day” tariffs of 49 percent and 24 percent on Cambodian and Malaysian goods, respectively, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In July, the White House reduced the “liberation day” tariffs on both countries to 19 percent.

The Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs were concluded in late October during President Trump’s trip to Asia. The ARTs do not alter the economy-wide 19 percent tariff, but rather exempt thousands of individual goods. These exemptions span multiple sectors, but do not include clean energy technologies.

Alongside this tariff relief, the two ARTs contain provisions designed to give Washington extraordinary leverage over Cambodia’s and Malaysia’s trade policies. The Malaysia ART authorizes the United States to terminate the agreement—and by extension rescind the tariff exemptions it provides—if Malaysia “enters into a new bilateral free trade agreement . . . with a country that jeopardizes essential U.S. interests.” The Cambodia ART contains a similar provision for FTAs that pose “a material threat to [US] economic or national security.”

Such “poison pill” clauses are unprecedented in the modern trade system, with one exception: a mechanism in the US-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) negotiated during the first Trump administration that allows a party to terminate the agreement if another party signs an FTA with a “non-market country.” But the ART poison pills differ from this mechanism in two key respects. First, the USMCA provision applies to all parties, whereas the ARTs restrain Cambodia and Malaysia but not the United States. Second, the USMCA provides a clear and objective definition of “non-market economy,” whereas the ARTs apply vague and subjective standards relating to US “interests” and “security” as criteria for termination.

The poison pills are not the only novel feature of the ARTs. The Malaysia ART stipulates that if the United States imposes a “trade restriction . . . that it considers relevant to protecting the national or economic security of the United States,” Malaysia must adopt a comparable trade restriction upon Washington’s request. In other words, the ART requires Malaysia to delegate aspects of its trade policy to the United States under circumstances defined unilaterally by US officials. The Cambodia ART contains a similar requirement but with a caveat: Cambodia cannot be asked to comply in a way that “infringes” on its “sovereign interests.”

Dueling Visions of Trade Architecture

The practical impacts of the ARTs’ coercive elements remain to be seen. It would be premature to conclude that Cambodia and Malaysia have made a definitive pivot towards economic alignment with the United States. In agreeing to the ARTs, both countries have secured immediate tariff relief in exchange for vague political commitments. Given the reasonable probability that the US Supreme Court will void the “liberation day” tariffs in the coming months, the ARTs may ultimately amount to little more than a gesture of goodwill on the part of Cambodian and Malaysian leaders.

But the ARTs should not be dismissed as paper tigers. Even if the “liberation day” tariffs are struck down, the administration may seek to negotiate comparable arrangements using other tariff authorities. In the meantime, uncertainty surrounding the operation and longevity of the deals means that firms participating in clean energy supply chains in both Cambodia and Malaysia may now face heightened political risk premiums to ensure compliance with US expectations regarding transshipment, supply chain integrity, and investment screenings.

Beyond these practical considerations, the ARTs signal an unraveling of the norm, foundational to the modern global trade system, that bilateral trade deals should be additive rather than exclusionary. Under WTO rules, an arrangement that improves market access between one set of countries cannot require increased market barriers on nonparticipating countries; yet this is precisely what the ARTs require of Cambodia and Malaysia. Furthermore, other than the USMCA, no FTA negotiated since the end of World War II has placed unilateral restraints on parties from pursuing separate market access arrangements.[1] By accepting these provisions, Cambodia and Malaysia have become accomplices in Washington’s campaign to replace the existing rules-based system with a fragmented patchwork of conditional economic alignments—or, in the words of the US National Security Strategy released this month, to “ensure that allied economies do not become subordinate to any competing power.”

The vision of trade embodied in the ARTs stands in sharp contrast to recent statements by Chinese senior officials deploring the proliferation of trade barriers in the global economy and calling for a more open trade system to accelerate the green energy transition by increasing access to Chinese clean energy technologies. This rhetoric has accompanied a renewed push from Beijing to enhance its already broad network of trade and investment partnerships, including a “version 3.0” of the ASEAN-China FTA signed only a few days before President Trump’s visit to Cambodia and Malaysia.

The Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs and the upgraded ASEAN-China FTA present two dueling versions of trade cooperation: one organized around exclusionary reciprocity and the other around open networks that reinforce Chinese export dominance. That Cambodian and Malaysian officials could agree to their respective ARTs and the ASEAN-China FTA in the span of a week is a striking illustration of the reluctance of third countries to choose between the US and Chinese approaches. But the coercive character of the ARTs signal that such hedging may have an expiration date.

Implications for Other Regional Actors

The Trump administration concluded deals with Thailand and Vietnam during the same trip that produced the Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs, and Indonesia announced a provisional trade agreement with the United States back in July. These three deals did not include poison pills like those in the Cambodia and Malaysia ARTs. But this does not necessarily signal that the ARTs are one-offs and other Southeast Asian countries can expect more favorable trade terms with the United States.

The Trump administration has reportedly been strongly pressuring Indonesia to accept a poison pill in the final version of the deal struck this summer, a demand Jakarta has rebuffed on grounds of “economic sovereignty.” There has also been speculation that US officials are seeking to impose coercive terms on Hanoi, which would entail amending the deal agreed to in October.

Given the Trump administration’s longstanding interest to “rebalance” global trade relationships, it is conceivable that this bilateral arm twisting will intensify and expand beyond the Southeast Asian region. Such tactics may result in more deals like the ARTs, but they are just as likely to drive US partners to seek closer economic ties with China, particularly if Beijing succeeds in presenting itself as a reliable and cooperative alternative to US global leadership on economic matters.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image_Beyond-Tariffs_-Coercive-US-Trade-Deals-and-Southeast-Asias-Clean-Energy-Future.png,N,,2025-12-10 17:00:29.089736

Protecting internal independence of the NRC staff and the ACRS, along with external transparency, remains critical.
Conclusion NRC independence may be a misnomer.","In a February executive order, the Trump administration asserted that “so-called ‘independent regulatory agencies,’” exercise too much executive power without accountability to the President. According to the EO, these agencies, including the Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC), Federal Communications Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency, among many others, would have to submit all regulatory decisions to the White House prior to their finalization.

A set of nuclear-related executive orders issued in May included one ordering the reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The order sent ripples through Washington that are still being felt, including amongst the nuclear advocacy community that has been working, for years, to reform the NRC and modernize nuclear regulations to enable growth for the industry. What the order means for the NRC, its independence from political offices, and for progress in the fight for regulatory modernization is still up in the air.

In June, the White House abruptly dismissed Commissioner Christopher Hanson, a Democratic appointee whose term ran through 2029. The dismissal was followed by a controversial statement attributed to the DOGE lead at the NRC that he expected the agency to “rubberstamp” reactor designs already approved by the Department of Energy. Members of Congress and former NRC Commissioners and staff reacted to the statement, warning that it risks politicizing safety oversight.

Together, these developments have sparked a renewed national debate over the independence of the NRC and what it means for a technically-oriented mission-driven regulator whose credibility underpins public trust and international confidence in nuclear power.

However, most partisans in this debate don’t understand the nature of the NRC’s independence, or its statutory history.

It is true that the NRC must remain a regulator that has the authority and capacity to take necessary actions to achieve its statutory mandate, and is independent of, and not influenced by, the nuclear industry. But, when it comes to the NRC’s independence from other parts of the federal government—a factor in the NRC’s capacity to fulfill its statutory obligation—the reality is more complex. In short, the NRC has never been fully independent from other parts of government; instead, it is built on layers of independence and oversight.

The Independence Needed to Fulfill Statutory Objectives

The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to have authority over atomic material and technologies, including energy, industrial, and medical uses, and for research and development. A Commission structure was used to ensure a range of input from members with technical expertise could make judgements on licensing decisions and be independent of industry influence.

The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (ERA) abolished the AEC and established the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take over licensing and regulatory authority from the AEC. The NRC was created to “promote well-balanced and closely supervised regulation of the burgeoning nuclear power industry” separate from the development and promotion activities of the newly created Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). The final version of the ERA calls the NRC an “independent regulatory commission” and the ERDA an “independent executive agency.” The ERDA was later rolled into the Department of Energy.

Congress, through the AEA, gives authority to the Commission to set policy and regulations directly. Specifically, the Commission has authority to determine what requirements it deems are appropriate and necessary to obtain an operating license, and to take actions to achieve its statutory mandate. Critically, only the Commissioners can issue reactor licenses, not the NRC staff, nor the President, or any other political or bureaucratic leader. And, if a reactor meets the stated requirements, the Commission does not have the authority to withhold a license.

The mission of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is to provide adequate protection for the health and safety of the public, common defense and security, and protect the environment, while maximizing the contribution of nuclear technology to the general welfare. This provides the policy priorities for the NRC; it must always enable nuclear technologies, while also requiring the rigor and protections necessary.

In the case brief for Siegel v. Atomic Energy Commission (1968), Judge Carl McGowan of the U.S. Court of Appeals identified the commission’s independence as key to the NRC’s success, writing that Congress enacted “a regulatory scheme which is virtually unique in the degree to which broad responsibility is reposed in the administering agency, free of close prescription in its charter as to how it shall proceed in achieving the statutory objectives.”

That level of independence is very important to avoid incentives or pressures to approve a technology or application that does not meet the mission of the agency. Those incentives could exist in a case where there was pressure to complete a project, but safety evaluations either were not completed or determined that the project should not be completed. That is the independence that is critical to maintain to avoid outside parties—whether a presidential administration, industry groups, or congressional offices—from undercutting the work of the NRC to benefit society and enable nuclear technology.

But the NRC Has Never Been Completely Independent

Presidential administrations and Congress have always had political influence over the Commission. Because commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has never been fully independent from politics. Congress understood this when the Commission was originally created and required that no more than three commissioners could be from any one political party, in order to “maintain political balance” while also setting staggered five-year terms to create regulatory stability.

Appointments have been used to implement higher-level political goals in the past. Commissioners have been appointed with the intent to make regulations stricter, scale them back, provide balance, stop progress on spent fuel storage at Yucca Mountain, or expand regulations in response to the incident at Fukushima Daiichi. While serving their term, some commissioners stay at arms-length from elected officials, others stay very engaged with Congress and the Administration.

The Commission also needs to have budgets approved by the President through the Office of Management and Budget and, more recently, rules approved by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The President also has the authority in the AEA to remove Commissioners for cause, defined as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. This is an oversight backstop to prevent Commissioners who are not doing their job from staying in that role. But, the backstop has been rarely used, even when the Commission has not been efficient in fulfilling its duties.

Since Congress passed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act in 2019, mandating regulatory reform, the Commission has taken an average of 270 days to vote on policies and rulemakings submitted by staff, despite internal procedures that set the standard of completing votes in 18-60 days. In that span, only 20% of votes were completed on time. Despite this, no Administration sought to remove Commissioners that were neglecting their duties.

Separately, in 2011 four Commissioners sent an unprecedented letter to President Obama’s Chief of Staff, raising significant concerns about former Chairman Jaczko’s abuse and intimidation of NRC staff and the ACRS into following orders. Congressional Democrats maintained support for him, complimenting him as “the best chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in its history,” Congressional Republicans issued a report that suggested Jaczko withheld information from other Commissioners and suggested that votes could be seen as a lack of support for the Obama administration—a parallel to current concerns. Instead of removing him as the Chair or unseating him as a Commissioner, President Obama’s Chief of Staff directed the Commission to seek third-party help, and quietly pressured Jaczko to resign on his own accord, letting the problem linger for seven more months.

However, a change of administration and political dynamics could impact the stability of the Commission. The NRC operates significantly less effectively when there are only three commissioners. An example is the waiting time for a vote increased during mid-2016 to mid-2018 when only three commissioners were on the commission. This is in part because a vote from at least three commissioners is required to act, and one commissioner could withhold their vote (i.e., a “pocket veto”) to avoid action. Pocket vetoes are often used by a single commissioner from a party to block progress for political reasons, and they are becoming more common. A President not nominating replacement Commissioners to avoid a pocket veto situation, or the Senate delaying or blocking nominations to perpetuate gridlock at the NRC is also a political decision.

Congress also has influence through oversight activities. In the past, members of Congress have guided the composition of the Commission and issues such as spent fuel management. Congress can, and has, passed legislation to direct actions at the NRC, or rescind policies of the Commission. For example, Congress forced the NRC to revoke its policy regarding how to regulate risks that are considered to be below regulatory concern.

Concerns of Presidential influence over the NRC are no more or less concerning than Congressional pressure on the Commission. But, this has always been the case and is by design. There need to be checks and balances, and these checks exist at a higher level than the technical work of implementing the NRC’s mission that ensures safety and environmental protection.

Independence and Backstops Within the NRC

While much of the debate over NRC independence has been in relation to the commission’s independence from Presidential administrations and Congress, there are multiple layers of independence within the agency itself that remain crucial for the NRC to fulfill its statutory obligations. Effectively, the NRC operates through three relatively independent structures: the Commission itself, the NRC staff, and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS), which is a safeguard that checks the technical detail of all licensing decisions.

The NRC staff conducts the safety and environmental evaluations largely independent of the Commission with technical detail and rigor. Depending on the licensing activity, evaluations may be published for public comment or be open to intervention by third parties. Once complete, reports that detail whether the application satisfies the letter of the regulations are sent to the Commission along with the staff’s recommendation.

The Commission then independently reviews the reports, staff recommendations, input from the ACRS, and public comments. The Commission is required to hold a hearing on the licensing actions with the staff and applicant, and ultimately, the Commission has to decide whether to issue the license.

The Commissioners can still put pressure on the staff by overriding the staff recommendations, changing agency policies, or avoiding votes on certain matters for extended periods of time if they do not agree with the staff or options provided by the staff. For example, a 2017 proposed rule on cyber security was ignored for years and finally withdrawn in 2025. The final emergency preparedness rule for advanced reactors waited for the Commission to vote for more than 18 months, and only moved forward with urging from external groups.

There are further protections to ensure staff can make independent recommendations. The AEA clearly defines protections for whistleblowers. For less severe problems, staff can use the differing professional opinion (DPO) system to force a review of safety concerns. The DPO process has been inefficient and can be improved, but it still serves a purpose.

The ACRS functions as an independent Federal Advisory Committee Act committee. The AEA requires the ACRS committee to review all licensing actions and provide an independent recommendation to the Commission. The ACRS operates through public meetings, and the recommendations are publicly available. Its mandate is to advise the Commission on the safety and reliability of reactor designs, license applications, and proposed NRC regulations and guidance. By law, the committee must be composed of recognized experts in engineering, risk assessment, materials science, and related disciplines. The ACRS must review and report on all reactor construction permit applications, operating licenses, license renewals, and significant amendments for civilian nuclear reactors.

Through this structure, the AEA intended the ACRS to function as a standing, technically-focused safeguard that operates separately from NRC staff to ensure an independent technical check on regulatory decisions.

Transparency provides another check on the actions of the agency. Public engagement and acceptance is critical to the NRC’s mission to enable the use of nuclear technology. A perceived loss of independent decisions in favor of political mandates will quickly erode public trust. Acknowledging this, the recent executive order mandated that NRC reforms must also “maintain the United States' leading reputation for nuclear safety.”

NRC independence must mean more than simply Commissioner independence from undue federal or industry influence. The AEA established layers of independence within the agency that serve to maintain efficient and effective operation. Protecting internal independence of the NRC staff and the ACRS, along with external transparency, remains critical.

Conclusion

NRC independence may be a misnomer. While the Commission has remained independent from the nuclear industry, it has always been at least partially dependent on the politics of the moment—and by design. The AEA and the ERA established the NRC and its predecessor with clear checks and balances from top to bottom, while accepting that shifting presidential administrations and congressional leadership ultimately will play a role in who is on the Commission and what is prioritized.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/articles/understanding-the-nrc-independence-debate/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/First-Commission.jpg?mtime=1765388983,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:37.422374

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

This highlights how vulnerable it can be to invest in a single stock. However, investors in EV-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) might take this event as an opportunity to revisit their portfolios, considering that Tesla held 41% of the U.S. EV market as of the third quarter of 2025 (as per data provided by Clean Technica).

This should help an investor to make an informed decision regarding his or her asset allocation in EV-focused ETFs.

Tesla’s Downgrade & Shifting Dominance

Morgan Stanley’s analysts, in addition to downgrading Tesla’s rating, also slashed the company’s delivery forecasts through 2040. Notably, the firm expects Tesla’s delivery volume to decline 10.5% in 2026 and projects an 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040.

This trimmed delivery forecast seems to be the result of Tesla’s eroding dominance in EV market lately. For instance, in China, the world's largest EV market, Tesla's share shrank significantly in late 2025 due to fierce competition from local brands like BYD and Xiaomi.

However, the analysts at Morgan Stanley mentioned that Tesla is ""uniquely positioned to be a leader"" in the humanoid robot market, thanks to its existing manufacturing abilities and technological advantage. To this end, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk has publicly stated that he believes the company’s values to eventually be dominated by its AI and robotics initiatives, specifically the Optimus humanoid robot, rather than its EV business. This reflects the company’s strategic decision to reduce focus on EVs and increase investments in AI, robotics and robotaxis.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/zacks.com/49b19d5f77c2e6fb2ac483c58199d712,N,,2025-12-10 19:58:42.413999

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses EBITDA, EBITDA as a percent of revenue as supplemental non-GAAP measures of performance. The Company uses Free Cash Flow as a supplement non-GAAP liquidity measure. We define the measures as the following:

EBITDA is net (loss) income excluding depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes

EBITDA as a percent of revenue is EBITDA for the measurement period divided by revenue for the same period.

Free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less the impact of purchases of equipment and improvements.

EBITDA and EBITDA as a percent of revenue are non-GAAP measures of performance and are used by management to conduct and evaluate its business during its review of operating results for the periods presented. Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP liquidity measure, is used by management to assess our ability to generate cash from our business operations and plan for future operating and capital actions.

Management and the Company's Board utilize these non-GAAP measures to make decisions about the use of the Company's resources, analyze performance between periods, develop internal projections and measure management performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's ongoing operating and financial results and understanding how such results compare with the Company's historical performance.

EBITDA, EBITDA as a percent of revenue, and free cash flow are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and when analyzing our performance and liquidity investors should (i) evaluate adjustments in our reconciliation to the nearest GAAP financial measures and (ii) use non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as an alternative to, measures of our operating results, as defined under GAAP.

Multiple active sites and strong US enrollment continue to support Q3 2026 timing for topline data readout

Clinical trial sites in Canada and the United Kingdom have received regulatory clearance to enroll

All patients who have completed HERO trial to date have successfully enrolled and remain in the Open Label Extension trial

SAN DIEGO, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc. (Aardvark) (Nasdaq: AARD), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics to activate innate homeostatic pathways for the treatment of metabolic diseases, announced that the first patient has been dosed in Australia in its Phase 3 HERO pivotal clinical trial assessing ARD-101 for the treatment of hyperphagia in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Additionally, regulatory clearance for enrollment by clinical trial sites in Canada and the United Kingdom has also been received. Based on strong enrollment in the US and continued progress in advancing the clinical trial internationally, the clinical trial continues to track towards a topline data readout in Q3 2026.

“We have seen very strong interest in the HERO trial within the patient community, which has been driving enrollment in the United States and in our newly opened Australia sites,” said Tien Lee, M.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Aardvark. “In addition, all patients who have completed the 12-week clinical trial to date have enrolled in the Open Label Extension trial, which is an encouraging indicator of patient interest and engagement.”

US trial sites are actively enrolling, and sites in Australia started enrolling in November. Enrollment is expected to initiate shortly in Canada and the UK, where regulatory clearance has been received. At this time, Aardvark anticipates that it will not need to activate previously planned sites in the EU to fully enroll the HERO trial and meet its anticipated timeline for topline data readout in Q3 2026.

“It’s important to note that significant unmet needs continue to persist in the PWS community, and many families are eager for a therapy that could ameliorate the relentless hunger that is a hallmark of PWS,” added Manasi Jaiman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Aardvark.

About the HERO Trial

The Hunger Elimination or Reduction Objective (HERO) trial ( NCT06828861 ) is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing ARD-101 for the treatment of hyperphagia in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Aardvark plans to enroll 90 patients in this clinical trial across the US, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The primary endpoint is change in the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) score from baseline to Week 12. Secondary outcome measures include change in Caregiver Global Impression of Severity (CaGI-S) for hyperphagia in PWS patients and change in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score for hyperphagia in PWS patients. Topline data is expected in the third quarter of 2026.

About ARD-101

ARD-101 is a gut-restricted small molecule agonist of select taste receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed on the luminal side of the intestine. As a potent bitter taste receptor pan-agonist, ARD-101 stimulates enteroendocrine cells of the digestive tract to release multiple gut-peptide hormones, including GLP-1 and the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which activates gut-brain neurologic signaling to mediate hunger. ARD-101 has demonstrated an ability to reduce hunger when used alone or in combination with currently available GLP-1 therapies. The FDA has granted ARD-101 both Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for PWS.

ARD-101 is being evaluated in the Phase 3 HERO trial for hyperphagia associated with PWS.

About Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc.

Aardvark is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics designed to suppress hunger for the treatment of Prader-Willi Syndrome and metabolic diseases. Hunger, which is the discomfort from not having eaten recently, is a distinct neural signaling pathway separate from appetite, the reward-seeking desire for food. Our programs explore therapeutic applications in hunger-associated indications and potential complementary uses with anti-appetite therapies. Our lead compound, oral ARD-101, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of hyperphagia associated with PWS, a rare disease characterized by insatiable hunger. Aardvark is also developing ARD-201, a planned fixed-dose combination of ARD-101 with a DPP-4 inhibitor, through two separate Phase 2 trials with a goal of addressing some of the limitations of currently marketed GLP-1 therapies for obesity and obesity-related conditions.

Preclinical data demonstrate BBO-10203 blocks RAS-mediated activation of PI3Kα, strongly inhibits pAKT signaling in tumor cells without inducing hyperglycemia, and shows robust anti-tumor activity both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care therapies in mutant or wild-type PIK3CA breast cancer models

BBOT will also present a trial in progress poster on BREAKER-101, a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating BBO-10203 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer with initial Phase 1 data expected in the first half of 2026

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. (“BBOT”) (Nasdaq: BBOT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on RAS-pathway malignancies, today announced late-breaking preclinical data on BBO-10203, a first-in-class covalent small molecule RAS:PI3Kα breaker that selectively and specifically blocks the physical interaction between RAS and PI3Kα resulting in the inhibition of RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors without inducing hyperglycemia. The data is being presented today at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). BBOT will also present a trial in progress poster on the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer on Friday, December 12.

“PIK3CA mutations are common, particularly in HR+/HER2- and HER2+ advanced breast cancer,” said Andreas Varkaris, MD, PhD, Attending Physician and Investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital and an investigator in the BREAKER-101 study. “Historically, we have treated these patients with successive generations of PI3K inhibitors, which have their limitations. We now look forward to a new generation of inhibitors, such as BBO-10203, that can more selectively target the mutant enzyme without affecting normal cells, potentially enabling us to treat more patients. Importantly, by improving selectivity and tolerability, these next-generation agents may also allow for combinations with other targeted therapies, something that was challenging in the past due to toxicity.”

“Although PI3Kα inhibitors have provided an important treatment option for HR+/HER2- and HER2+ breast cancer with PI3Kα mutations, their use is often limited by dose-dependent hyperglycemia and reduced treatment duration,” said Pedro Beltran, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of BBOT. “Our preclinical work shows that BBO-10203 offers a differentiated mechanism by disrupting the RAS–PI3Kα interaction rather than inhibiting PI3Kα’s kinase activity. Because RAS-dependent activation drives tumor growth but not glucose regulation, this approach enables broad pathway inhibition without the risk of hyperglycemia. BBO-10203 also shows strong monotherapy and combination activity, underscoring its potential to extend treatment responses alongside standard-of-care therapies.”

Late Breaking Preclinical Data Highlights

Preclinical findings demonstrate BBO-10203 covalently binds PI3Kα on cysteine 242 in the RAS binding domain, which prevents the interaction of PI3Kα and RAS.

Oral administration of BBO-10203 resulted in robust PK, dose- and time-dependent inhibition of pAKT, and efficacy.

BBO-10203 did not induce hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia in an oral glucose tolerance test.

BBO-10203 showed activity alone and in combination with fulvestrant or ribociclib in ER+ HER2- breast cancer models with either a PIK3CA helical or kinase domain mutations.

Similar efficacy was observed with BBO-10203 or STX-478 (LY4064809), a PIK3CA mutant-selective inhibitor, in an ER+ HER2- breast cancer model with a PIK3CA kinase domain mutation.

BBO-10203 also showed activity alone and in combination with ribociclib in an ER+ HER2- breast cancer model with wild-type PIK3CA.

Trial in Progress Poster

BREAKER-101 (NCT06625775) is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1a/1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of BBO-10203 as monotherapy and in combination with trastuzumab, fulvestrant ± ribociclib, or FOLFOX + bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer. The study includes a dose escalation phase as well as an expansion phase. Key endpoints include safety and tolerability, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetics. Intracranial activity of BBO-10203 will also be evaluated as an exploratory endpoint. The study is currently enrolling patients in the United States and Australia, and initial Phase 1 clinical data are expected in the first half of 2026.

A copy of the posters titled “BBO-10203, a first-in-class breaker of the RAS:PI3Kα interaction, inhibits tumor growth alone and in combination with fulvestrant or ribociclib in breast cancer models without inducing hyperglycemia” and “BREAKER-101: a phase 1a/1b open-label study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of BBO-10203 in patients with advanced solid tumors” will be available on the “ Publications ” page of the BBOT website following the conference.

About BBO-10203

BBO-10203 is an orally bioavailable small molecule with a novel mechanism of action designed to inhibit the physical interaction between RAS and PI3Kα, inhibiting RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors. BBO-10203 binds directly and covalently to the RAS-binding domain of PI3Kα, preventing its activation by KRAS, HRAS and NRAS, reducing downstream signaling and tumor growth. It is a protein-protein inhibitor and not a kinase inhibitor, enabling inhibition of RAS-driven PI3Kα-AKT signaling in tumors without the risk of hyperglycemia. Importantly, BBO-10203’s ability to block RAS activation of PI3Kα is agnostic to the mutational status of either RAS or PI3Kα . In addition to a potentially differentiated safety profile, BBO-10203 could be combined with direct KRAS inhibitors, such as BBO-8520 and BBO-11818, or drugs that target HER2 or ER receptors. BBO-10203 is being evaluated in the Phase 1 BREAKER-101 trial (NCT06625775) for patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HR+/HER2- breast cancer, KRAS mutant colorectal cancer, and KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer. Initial Phase 1 clinical data are expected in the first half of 2026.

Study met its primary endpoint demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment, with no drug-related severe or serious adverse events and no increase in GI issues when used with existing approved treatments

Study met its secondary endpoints and demonstrated improvement in biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting a resolution of fibrosis and repair of the alveolar basement membrane

GRI-0621 demonstrated increases in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment

39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects treated with placebo experiencing a decline in FVC at 12 weeks

LA JOLLA, CA, Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GRI Bio, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRI) (“GRI Bio” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company advancing an innovative pipeline of immune cell modulators for the treatment of inflammatory, fibrotic and autoimmune diseases, today announced positive topline data from the Phase 2a GRI-0621-IPF-02 clinical trial evaluating GRI-0621 for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (“IPF”). The study met its primary endpoint and secondary endpoints demonstrating that GRI-0621 was well tolerated over a 12-week treatment period, consistent with earlier studies evaluating over 1,700 subjects treated for up to a year. Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism.

“Treatment of patients with IPF in the GRI-0621 Phase 2a trial was observed to be safe and well tolerated through the completion of the 12-week study,” said Toby Maher, MD, PhD, Professor of Clinical Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, USC Los Angeles. “Secondary endpoints related to the effect of GRI-0621 on biomarkers associated with disease progression provided evidence that GRI-0621 maintains a net anti-fibrotic effect compared to standard of care. Lastly, FVC improved in patients treated with GRI-0621, with more patients experiencing an increase at 12 weeks than with standard of care. We look forward to watching the clinical advancement of GRI-0621 as a potential treatment for patients with IPF.”

Study Met Its Primary Endpoint, Demonstrating a Safety Profile Differentiated From Existing Treatment Options

No safety or tolerability concerns were observed in the subjects enrolled at 12 weeks of treatment, with dry skin, dry lips, muscle and joint pain as the most common adverse events reported. There were no increases in cough (0% in the GRI-0621-treated arm compared to 25% in the placebo arm) or gastrointestinal disorders reported in the GRI-0621 arm compared to the placebo arm (diarrhea reported in 13% versus 33%, respectively). 80% of the subjects enrolled were taking background pirfenidone or nintedanib.

Study Met Secondary Endpoints Suggestive of Disease-Modifying Activity, Reversing Fibrosis and Inducing a Lung Repair Mechanism

Subjects treated with GRI-0621 also displayed improvements in serum biomarkers of collagen turnover, suggesting fibrosis resolution and induction of an alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism. PRO-C6, a biomarker of type VI collagen synthesis, was observed to decrease from baseline (-3%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and increase (+12%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C6M, a biomarker of type VI collagen degradation, was observed to increase from baseline (+6%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-3%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. The type VI collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrogenic (+10%; continued worsening of fibrosis) in placebo-treated subjects to fibrolytic (-7%; resolution of fibrosis), suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing resolution of fibrosis in treated subjects compared to continued worsening of fibrosis in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care.

Destruction of the alveolar basement membrane is a hallmark of IPF, and type IV collagen synthesis, and repair of the basement membrane, is a crucial step in lung tissue repair. PRO-C4, a biomarker of type IV collagen synthesis, was observed to increase from baseline (+9%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects and decrease (-2%) in subjects treated with placebo and standard of care. C4Ma3, a biomarker of type IV collagen degradation, was observed to decrease in GRI-0621 treated subjects compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard of care (10% vs 24%, respectively). The type IV collagen remodeling rate shifted from fibrolytic (-16%; continued destruction of the basement membrane) in placebo-treated subjects to neutral (0%) in GRI-0621 treated subjects, suggestive of GRI-0621 inducing a lung tissue repair mechanism and repair of the alveolar basement membrane compared to placebo-treated subjects.

Interestingly, the alveolar basement membrane repair mechanism is supported by differential gene expression data of AT1 cell re-epithelialization of the basement membrane. GRI-0621 was observed to significantly reduce DLK1 (-6.46 LogFC; FDR 0.0003), a gene involved in lung epithelial AT2 cell fate plasticity and regeneration of alveolar AT1 cells (Sawhney, et al. (2025) Nat Commun 16 , 8924; Li, et al. (2025) Resp Res 26 188), another critical step in alveolar basement membrane repair, compared to subjects treated with placebo and standard.

Reductions in neutrophil and macrophage activity (immune cell biomarkers upregulated in IPF and associated with disease progression) and downregulation of genes associated with fibrosis, disease progression and mortality were also observed in patients treated with GRI-0621 compared to placebo-treated subjects.

“The positive Phase 2a results represent an important milestone for our IPF program and a compelling early signal of GRI-0621’s disease-modifying potential. IPF remains one of the most devastating respiratory diseases, with limited treatment options and a significant need for therapies that can do more than slow decline and address the underlying biology of the disease,” commented Marc Hertz, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of GRI Bio. “In addition to a favorable safety and tolerability profile, GRI-0621 demonstrated meaningful improvement in biomarkers suggesting fibrosis resolution and repair of the alveolar basement membrane. These results reinforce our belief in GRI-0621’s differentiated mechanism and support its potential to go beyond slowing disease progression by directly impacting core drivers of IPF. With this mechanistic proof-of-biology in hand, we are well-positioned to advance toward the next stage of development. We believe GRI-0621 could represent a truly meaningful advance in the IPF treatment landscape, with the potential to create significant value for patients and shareholders alike.”

Study Met Exploratory Endpoints Demonstrating Increased Forced Vital Capacity, With Twice as Many Subjects Observed to Have No Decline in FVC Compared to Standard of Care at 12 Weeks

Placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in FVC increased by 99 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and a 139 ml increase in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care. Spirometry is subject to large visit-to-visit variability and is dependent on the individual’s effort, often resulting in data outliers. To minimize the impact of outliers in the dataset, a post hoc data analysis was performed excluding the datapoints with the largest gain or loss in FVC over 12 weeks from both arms. The results of this analysis demonstrated an increase in placebo-adjusted change from baseline in FVC of 54 ml in the GRI-0621-treated arm and an increase of 81 ml in the subset taking both GRI-0621 and standard of care. Overall, 39% of GRI-0621 treated subjects experienced an increase in FVC at 12 weeks compared to 80% of subjects who experienced a decline in FVC at 12 weeks in the placebo-treated arm.

The Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, multinational, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, 2-arm study enrolled 35 subjects with IPF who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio for GRI-0621 4.5mg or a placebo. GRI-0621 dose of 4.5mg was compared with a dose of placebo following once daily oral administration for 12 weeks. Concurrently, a sub-study examined the number and activity of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (“BAL”) fluid in 8 subjects (across various centers). The primary endpoint for the Phase 2a study was safety and tolerability of oral GRI-0621 as assessed by clinical labs, vital signs and adverse events after 12 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were baseline changes in serum biomarkers collected at week 6 and week 12; an assessment of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GRI-0621 at the week 12 visit of treatment (steady state); and a determination of the pharmacodynamic activity of oral GRI-0621 as measured by inhibition of immune cell activation in blood after 6 weeks and 12 weeks, and from BAL fluid after 12 weeks of treatment in the sub-study. Additional exploratory endpoints for the study included assessment of the effect of GRI-0621 on pulmonary function at baseline and after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment and flow cytometry and differential gene expression at various time points. These results show that GRI-0621’s receptor selectivity is consistent with the toxicity profile observed in earlier studies evaluating oral tazarotene in over 1,700 patients treated for up to 52 weeks.

CLAYTON, Mo., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Perimeter Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: PRM) (“Perimeter,” “Perimeter Solutions,” or the “Company”), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Medical Manufacturing Technologies LLC (“MMT”) from Arcline Investment Management for approximately $685 million in cash, including certain tax benefits.

MMT is a leading provider of highly engineered machinery and associated aftermarket consumables, parts, and services for the manufacturing of minimally invasive medical devices. Nearly all MMT’s revenue is generated from proprietary products and approximately half of its revenue is derived from the aftermarket. MMT is expected to generate approximately $140 million of revenue and $50 million of Adjusted EBITDA on a full-year basis in 2025.

Haitham Khouri, Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, “MMT is an excellent fit with our operating strategy. MMT serves a recurring and growing aftermarket, where it reliably provides highly engineered proprietary parts and consumables that are critical to zero-defect customer workflows and stringent regulatory standards. MMT has a strong track-record of organic and M&A driven growth, both of which we expect to continue.”

Mr. Khouri continued, “We expect MMT to fit seamlessly into our decentralized operating structure, and we believe that the Company is a particularly strong fit with our Operational Value Driver focused operating strategy”.

Perimeter expects to fund the acquisition through $500 million of new secured debt financing and $185 million of cash on hand.

Perimeter Solutions’ Chief Financial Officer Kyle Sable said, “MMT matches our focus on businesses in secularly growing markets with strong free cash flow, high returns on tangible capital, and durable earnings power. As a result of the transaction, we expect to have net leverage profile of approximately 2.7 times net debt to combined Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months ended September 30, 2025, which we believe will be well supported by the cash generation capability of our combined business.”

The acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Nixon Peabody and Greenberg Traurig provided legal counsel to Perimeter.

Conference Call and Webcast

Perimeter Solutions management will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, December 11, 2025 to discuss the transaction. The conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 407-9764 (toll-free) or (201) 689-8551 (toll).

Forward-looking Information

This press release may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “seek,” “believe,” “project,” “estimate,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “likely,” “may,” “should,” “will,” and similar references to future periods. Specific forward-looking statements in this press release include statements regarding the Company’s expectations and beliefs regarding (i) the acquisition of MMT, including the anticipated benefits, closing and funding, (ii) MMT’s full-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, (iii) our ability to continue MMT’s track record of growth and (iv) our leverage profile.

Any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond the Company’s control) and assumptions. Although Perimeter believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect the Company’s actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, including the risk factors described from time to time by us in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including, but not limited to, the ability to receive the required regulatory approvals and satisfy other customary closing conditions in order to close the acquisition; the ultimate timing, outcome and results of integrating the operations of MMT and Perimeter; the ability of the combined company to realize anticipated benefits, including the expected leverage profile following completion of the acquisition, in the timeframe expected or at all; changes in capital markets and the ability of the combined company to finance operations in the manner expected; the effects of commodity prices; risks related to the demand for MMT and Perimeters services; and the other factors included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Stockholders, potential investors and other readers should consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's estimates and assumptions with respect to financial performance and future events, and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently difficult to predict.

Any forward-looking statement made by Perimeter in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Perimeter undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

MMT Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which reflects the Company's internal estimate based on the quality of earnings report received by the Company. MMT Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before income taxes, plus net interest expense and other financing expenses, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-recurring, unusual or non-operational items. These items primarily include restructuring and integration costs, transaction expenses, and implementation and one-time consulting costs. The Company has not provided a GAAP reconciliation of MMT’s expected adjusted EBITDA, which is a forward-looking statement, in this press release as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, reconciling items. Accordingly, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP equivalents is not available without unreasonable effort. However, it is important to note that material changes to reconciling items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results. MMT Adjusted EBITDA reflects the acquisitions consummated by MMT during the last twelve month period ended September 30, 2025, as if such acquisition occurred as of October 1, 2024.

Forward-Looking Statements

Matters discussed in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward-looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.

The Partnership desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is including this cautionary statement in connection with this safe harbor legislation. The words “believe,” “anticipate,” “intends,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “expect,” “pending” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not intended to give any assurance as to future results and should not be relied upon.

The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions and estimates, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, examination by the Partnership’s management of historical operating trends, data contained in its records and other data available from third parties. Although the Partnership believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond the Partnership’s control, the Partnership cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections.

In addition to these important factors, other important factors that, in the Partnership’s view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed, expressed or implied, in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the strength of world economies and currency fluctuations, general market conditions, including fluctuations in charter rates, ownership days, and vessel values, changes in supply of and demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping capacity, changes in the Partnership’s operating expenses, including bunker prices, drydocking and insurance costs, the market for the Partnership’s vessels, the early termination of Partnership’s charters and the Partnership’s inability to replace assets and/or long-term contracts, the availability of financing and refinancing, changes in governmental laws, rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, economic, regulatory, political and governmental conditions that affect the shipping and the LNG industry, potential liability from pending or future litigation, and potential costs due to environmental damage and vessel collisions, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents, political events, or international hostilities, geopolitical events including ongoing conflicts and hostilities in the Middle East and other regions throughout the world and the global response to such conflicts and hostilities, changes in tariffs, trade barriers, including recently imposed tariffs by the U.S. and the effects of retaliatory tariffs and countermeasures from affected countries, the effect of applicable sanctions and embargos; vessel breakdowns, instances of off-hires, the length and severity of epidemics and pandemics, the impact of public health threats and outbreaks of other highly communicable diseases, the amount of cash available for distribution, and other important factors, including those the Partnership describes from time to time in the reports it files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Please see the Partnership’s filings with the SEC for a more complete discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties. The information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof. The Partnership undertakes no obligation, and specifically declines any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable laws. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Partnership to predict all of these factors which may adversely affect its results. Further, the Partnership cannot assess the effect of each such factor on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to be materially different from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one of more forward-looking statements are updated, no inference should be drawn that additional updates will be made with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

Transaction Expected to be Accretive to Revenue and Earnings

Expands Product Offerings in the Utility and Industrial Sectors

Expands Revenue in Brazil and Positions for Growth in Latin America

AMSC to Hold Conference Call on December 11, 2025 at 9am.

AYER, Mass., Dec. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMSC (NASDAQ: AMSC), a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power resiliency solutions that orchestrate the rhythm and harmony of power on the grid™ and protect and expand the capability of our Navy’s fleet, today announced that it has acquired Comtrafo Indústria de Transformadores Elétricos S.A (Comtrafo), a privately held company based in Brazil that manufactures and supplies high-performance utility-scale power and distribution transformers.

At closing, AMSC purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of Comtrafo for R$300 million (Brazilian Real), approximately US$55 million, in cash and issued 2,417,142 restricted shares of AMSC common stock with a value of approximately US$78 million. AMSC also purchased real property including two factories with over 100 acres of land for approximately R$155.6 million, approximately US$29 million, in cash. As part of the transaction, in the future the selling stockholders may earn an additional earnout in cash upon the achievement of specified earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization objectives during the three years following the closing.

AMSC believes that the acquisition of Comtrafo directly aligns with the company’s strategic priorities to accelerate profitable growth, broaden its product offerings, and expand market reach and share. Comtrafo has a history of profitable revenue. We believe Comtrafo appears positioned to deliver revenue of approximately US$55 million in calendar year 2025, which is now nearly complete. Normalized gross margins on this revenue are expected to be commensurate with recently demonstrated AMSC levels of 30% and normalized operating margins are expected to be about 20%.

Looking ahead into calendar year 2026, Comtrafo has approximately US$85 million in total backlog with about US$55 million falling in the 12-month backlog. By leveraging Comtrafo’s trusted leadership position in the transformer market for utility and industrial applications, AMSC expects to expand its grid business offerings and enhance the value delivered to customers.

“Comtrafo is a leader in Brazil’s critical power infrastructure market for power and distribution transformers,” said Daniel P. McGahn, Chairman, President and CEO of AMSC. “The addition of Comtrafo to AMSC’s grid solutions is expected to accelerate further profitability and expand our offerings of proprietary products to meet growing utility and industrial demand across the full power platform, from power generation to transmission, distribution, and industrial end-use. Comtrafo operates in an estimated US$1.5 billion annual market in Brazil, where the local government has outlined significant planned investment exceeding US$20 billion in the country’s electricity grid. We are very excited about the business prospects in this large market and throughout Latin America.”

For more information about this transaction, please refer to AMSC’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.

The continued funding of such contracts may remain subject to annual legislative appropriation, which, if not approved, could reduce our revenue and lower or eliminate our profit; Changes in U.S. government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and overall business; Our business and operations may be materially adversely impacted in the event of a failure or security breach of our or any critical third parties' IT Systems or Confidential Information; Failure to comply with evolving data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data, may adversely impact our business and financial results; Our success is dependent upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so could significantly damage our business and prospects; We may acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies, which may require us to incur substantial costs for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits; A significant portion of our Wind segment revenues are derived from a single customer. If this customer’s business is negatively affected, it could adversely impact our business; Our success in addressing the wind energy market is dependent on the manufacturers that license our designs; Many of our revenue opportunities are dependent upon subcontractors and other business collaborators; Problems with product quality or product performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses and may damage our market reputation and prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share; Many of our customers outside of the United States may be either directly or indirectly related to governmental entities, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws outside the United States; We have had limited success marketing and selling our superconductor products and system-level solutions, and our failure to more broadly market and sell our products and solutions could lower our revenue and cash flow; We or third parties on whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters, including events resulting from climate change, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us or our value chain from such events; Uncertainty surrounding our prospects and financial condition may have an adverse effect on our customer and supplier relationships; Pandemics, epidemics, or other public health crises may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations; Adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results; Our international operations are subject to risks that we do not face in the United States, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results; Our products face competition, which could limit our ability to acquire or retain customers; We have operations in, and depend on sales in, emerging markets, including India, and global conditions could negatively affect our operating results or limit our ability to expand our operations outside of these markets. Changes in India’s political, social, regulatory and economic environment may affect our financial performance; Industry consolidation could result in more powerful competitors and fewer customers; Our success could depend upon the commercial adoption of the REG system, which is currently limited, and a widespread commercial market for our REG products may not develop; Increasing focus and scrutiny on environmental sustainability and social initiatives could adversely impact our business and financial results; Growth of the wind energy market depends largely on the availability and size of government subsidies, economic incentives and legislative programs designed to support the growth of wind energy; Lower prices for other energy sources may reduce the demand for wind energy development, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our Wind business; We may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information; Our patents may not provide meaningful or long-term protection for our technology, which could result in us losing some or all of our market position; Third parties have or may acquire patents that cover the materials, processes and technologies we use or may use in the future to manufacture our Amperium products, and our success depends on our ability to license such patents or other proprietary rights; There are a number of technological challenges that must be successfully addressed before our superconductor products can gain widespread commercial acceptance, and our inability to address such technological challenges could adversely affect our ability to acquire customers for our products; Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, market price and volume fluctuations, which may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit and could lead to costly litigation against us that could divert our management’s attention; Unfavorable results of legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and the other important factors discussed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in Part 1. Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, and our other reports filed with the SEC.

The Stoney Creek Watershed Flood Mitigation Pilot Project is a constructed stormwater wetland basin, planted with native vegetation, on Wayne Community College’s (WCC) campus. The $1.6 million nature-based project provides flood reduction in the Stoney Creek Watershed, specifically addressing flooding along Wayne Memorial Drive.

DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson, State Rep. John Bell, WCC President Patricia Pfeiffer and other local officials spoke at the ribbon cutting ceremony today at WCC.

“Because flooding is becoming more frequent and intense throughout our state, strengthening communities’ flood resiliency is an urgent priority,” said DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson. “This nature-based project will reduce flooding for residents and businesses, provide valuable wildlife habitat, and connect with the college’s greenway system. We greatly appreciate Representative John Bell’s strong leadership on resilience issues in the General Assembly, which made this project possible.”

“This project is a good example of how DEQ is using funds the General Assembly appropriated to make communities safer and more resilient,” said State Rep. John Bell, who represents much of Wayne County and Goldsboro. “Residents of the county will benefit from less flooding, safer roads and more reliable access to emergency services.”

“The Stoney Creek flood-mitigation project is an investment in the future of our campus and our community,” said Wayne Community College President Pfeiffer. “By reducing the impact of recurring flooding, we are safeguarding the impact on our environment and potential harm to life. This project reflects our commitment to being a responsible community partner and investing in long-term solutions that benefit everyone who lives, works and studies in Wayne County.""

The project’s engineered wetland located along Reedy Creek, a tributary to Stoney Creek, captures runoff from the campus. Water held within this stormwater wetland basin slows the discharge of water to Reedy Creek, reducing water volume and peak flows to adjacent streams. Vegetation planted in the basin stabilizes the soil, improves downstream water quality by absorbing excess pollutants like nitrogen, and creates habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife.

The project is the first demonstration site under the DMS Natural Infrastructure Flood Mitigation Program (NIFMP), which the NC General Assembly established in 2020. The program uses natural infrastructure, or projects that restore natural landscapes or emulate natural ecological processes, to reduce flooding in small, targeted watersheds. Projects can include building wetlands, restoring streams and other nature-based solutions that help store water and reduce flooding.

Lessons learned from the pilot will aid in planning for larger solutions statewide and integrate into the department’s Flood Resiliency Blueprint program to enhance community flood resilience. Nature-based solutions, such as this Stoney Creek project, are one of many resilience actions that local communities can use from the Blueprint Program.

DEQ is developing another project in the watershed that will retrofit a pond to retain water and intercept stormwater runoff before discharging into Stoney Creek. The project will decrease peak stormwater discharge, add protection to properties downstream, improve water quality and provide additional ecological benefits. DEQ is also vetting additional natural infrastructure flood reduction projects in the watershed for 2026 and 2027.",https://files.nc.gov/deq/FAVICON.png?VersionId=xRBsyAOxtvx0Q9TLN3ETIaKdsjhl2HsC,N,,2025-12-10 17:01:07.137152

That’s why the bipartisan Standardized Permitting and Expediting Development Act, also known as the SPEED Act, matters.
Congress can either deliver durable permitting reform or continue outsourcing America’s future to Moscow and Beijing.
Or pass meaningful reform, unleash American energy, workers and technology and prove we still fight for us.
The SPEED Act isn’t just another bill.","With all the talk of incredible energy demand projections for the next few years, it’s easy to brush them off as hype. In fact, it’s hard to keep up. Every time we hear a new projection, it’s higher than the last. Just last week, Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said we’re going to need 100 GW of new firm generation capacity within five years due to growing demands from AI and data centers.

How much power is that? Roughly enough to run 72 million American homes. According to the Census Bureau, there are about 148 million homes in the United States. To put it simply, we’ll need to generate enough new electricity in the next five years to power half of all U.S. homes. That herculean task will require laying thousands of miles of new gas pipelines, building transmission lines and substations, and constructing new generation facilities across the country.

And we shouldn’t kid ourselves, if we don’t get it done, somebody else will. Probably China. To the winner go the spoils, and if the AI boom lives up to the hype, that winner could dominate the 21st century both economically and militarily.

Right now, it takes longer to permit an energy project in America than it does to build one, thanks to overlapping reviews and endless litigation that bog down every step of the process. We’ve already ceded ground to competitors like China and Russia. They’re building and exporting energy infrastructure while we’re tied up in paperwork and waiting on signatures.

The National Environmental Policy Act, passed more than 50 years ago, was meant to protect the environment. But decades of red tape have turned it into a political weapon. What was once a decision-making tool is now used to stall projects until investors walk away.

That dysfunction translates directly into lost paychecks, idled rigs and higher costs for American energy. Energy service companies, the backbone of U.S. production, sit idle while projects die on the vine.

Some in Washington call this a necessary tradeoff for environmental protection. But that’s a false choice. In reality, modernizing permitting helps the environment. Stalled liquefied natural gas projects push allies toward higher-emitting Russian alternatives while safer technology sits waiting for approval.

That’s why the bipartisan Standardized Permitting and Expediting Development Act, also known as the SPEED Act, matters. This bipartisan bill, introduced by House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), is currently the most viable permitting reform vehicle to move this Congress.

The Trump administration made real progress streamlining reviews, and DOE Secretary Wright has pushed reforms that put outcome over process. But there’s only so much the executive branch can do alone. The SPEED Act builds on that foundation, locking reforms into law and giving investors the certainty they need to move projects forward. That stability drives jobs, lowers costs and keeps America competitive.

For the energy services sector, which supports more than 650,000 jobs nationwide, the stakes could not be higher. While our companies don’t own pipelines or LNG terminals, instead, we supply the people and expertise that keep them running. When permitting slows, everything else does too. Every month lost to red tape is a month American workers are benched and foreign competitors gain ground.

Congress can either deliver durable permitting reform or continue outsourcing America’s future to Moscow and Beijing. Passing the SPEED Act before the end of the year would prove Republicans and Democrats can still come together to solve a problem that directly affects our economy, our energy security and our standing in the world.

Critics claim reform “weakens protections.” That’s false. The SPEED Act keeps environmental standards intact and ensures reviews remain transparent and timely. Agencies still conduct reviews. Communities still have input. But endless lawsuits and bureaucratic delays can no longer be weaponized to kill projects simply because they’re energy-related.

America was built by people who knew how to get difficult things done. We put men on the moon with computers as powerful as today’s wristwatches. We became the world’s leading energy producer through innovation and grit.

The choice before Congress is simple. Stick with the status quo: paralysis by paperwork, idled workers and ceded ground to our adversaries. Or pass meaningful reform, unleash American energy, workers and technology and prove we still fight for us. We can still do what others think is impossible.

The SPEED Act isn’t just another bill. It’s a test of whether Washington can deliver results instead of excuses. Congress should move quickly. Our workers are ready. Our industry’s ready.

He wants to quadruple the U.S.’s nuclear power by 2050.

And Trump isn’t the only president who has lauded the power of nuclear energy; former President Joe Biden also thought it could be a solution to some of the country’s energy problems.

As electricity demand rises, politicians are reconsidering a power source long plagued by high costs and lengthy construction timelines. How big a role will nuclear play in the country’s future energy mix?

Katy Huff, associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, was the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy from 2022 to 2024.

“ If you work backwards from net-zero goals by 2050, for example, then you need an incredible amount of nuclear energy,” Huff said. “It rivals the fastest rate that we’ve ever produced new nuclear power plants in this country.”

5 questions with Katy Huff

We’ve only seen two new nuclear reactors come online in the past decade, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia in 2023. Those reactors were seven years late and $17 billion over budget. Why is it so difficult to build this stuff?

“ Delays and cost overruns are often because each nuclear power plant build is treated as a first-of-a-kind project. You know, imagine trying to build a commercial airplane when every single part has to be custom-designed and approved by the regulator for the first time. That’s really slow and expensive until you get to a place where you no longer have to approve those parts and design approaches and construction processes.

“But ideally, if you can build more of them on a quick pace shortly after the first few, then you should see some lessons learned. But new reactor designs are also being proposed as well, and they’ll face those first-of-a-kind risks for the first few units.”

One promising technology that we’ve been hearing about for years is something called a small modular reactor. They’re smaller than these typical nuclear plants and, in theory, they’re cheaper and easier to get the permitting for.

How likely are those at this point to play a big role in the future energy mix?

“ I think because those capital costs are going to be lower per unit because they’re a little bit more flexible in terms of deployment in fleets. The hope is that we’ll also get to that nth-of-a-kind quicker if each unit is smaller, but per megawatt hour generated, they probably will be slightly more expensive than the bigger units, which get economies of scale.

“How realistic is it that they’re being built? Well, some of them are being built right now.”

The Biden administration was looking to nuclear power to fulfill some of its climate priorities, but Trump is interested for different reasons. He’s promising $80 billion to build nuclear reactors.

His energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on CNBC last month that early projects will receive government subsidies. How does that sound to you?

“ Because of the enormous capital investment required to build a big, complex, precise machine, government support has played a key role in unlocking private investment, especially through the loan programs office.

“But just as important are those committed customers, whether it’s companies like Dow Chemical or chip manufacturers or data centers. That early demand also helps to reduce risk and build those first few reactors, after which we hope the costs will come down rapidly.”

What is a reasonable timeline for a nuclear revival like this? If we’re talking about meeting electricity demand that’s rising rapidly right now, is a nuclear build-out too slow to be of much help?

“ I think that is a real concern. In order to meet that moment, you’re going to have to build nuclear power plants on time and on budget, even if those budgets are fairly high initially.

“And some of those schedules will take a decade to get a reactor online from start of construction to connection to the grid. Though there is certainly a hope that some smaller reactors might get from construction to grid connection quicker, time will tell, and we’ll have to see whether the U.S. engineering and construction companies involved in these projects are ready for that challenge.”

Have we figured out a solution to the safety problem? Is there still an issue of what to do with nuclear waste?

“ First, it’s important to know that over the last 60, 70 years of commercial nuclear energy in the us, our spent nuclear fuel has never harmed anyone. And while there’s ongoing work in the Department of Energy about where to store it long term, that fuel is currently safely stored at reactor sites right now.

“Reactors themselves have historically been extremely safe in the United States. Even the Three Mile Island accident, which is the worst in our history, killed no one.

“And we have real hopes that some of the passive safety features of this current generation of proposed and existing new construction will be even safer. But it requires strong regulation, and I hope to see that that continues.”

Next week’s list: Next week, the NAM-backed SPEED Act goes to a vote, while other key legislation is moving closer to that point.
Meanwhile, manufacturers are also urging the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Environment Subcommittee to advance key legislation to reform the Clean Air Act.
From modernizing the New Source Review and National Ambient Air Quality Standards programs to improving how the Environmental Protection Agency deals with wildfires and international emissions, the solutions offered by these bills are integral to comprehensive permitting reform.
Why it matters: Eighty percent of manufacturers say the length and complexity of the permitting process is harmful to increasing investment.","“In the spirit of the holiday season, we are calling for legislative action during this year-end work window to deliver a gift of a new, workable permitting system that will fuel America’s manufacturers,” NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a statement this morning.

“Over the next 12 days, the House is primed to tackle comprehensive permitting reform, which will boost American competitiveness and unlock greater investments in manufacturing in America.”

This week’s list: This week, manufacturers are urging House members to vote “yes” on the PERMIT Act and several other crucial pieces of legislation.

The PERMIT Act adopts the NAM’s key recommendations for modernizing the Clean Water Act—reforms that increase certainty for permittees, clarify the scope of the CWA and address bottlenecks that have delayed job-creating projects.

Manufacturers are also calling on legislators to advance the Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act, the ePermit Act and the Electric Supply Chain Act—all of which are critical to achieving manufacturers’ vision of energy and AI dominance.

Next week’s list: Next week, the NAM-backed SPEED Act goes to a vote, while other key legislation is moving closer to that point.

The SPEED Act is a cornerstone of “Manufacturing’s Roadmap to AI and Energy Dominance,” the NAM’s blueprint for securing America’s energy and AI leadership. By appropriately shortening environmental review timelines, limiting regulatory and legal uncertainty, expanding categorial exclusions, preventing duplicative reviews and reinforcing recent Supreme Court precedent on the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act, the SPEED Act will accelerate projects essential to meeting rising power demand and lowering energy costs.

Meanwhile, manufacturers are also urging the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Environment Subcommittee to advance key legislation to reform the Clean Air Act. From modernizing the New Source Review and National Ambient Air Quality Standards programs to improving how the Environmental Protection Agency deals with wildfires and international emissions, the solutions offered by these bills are integral to comprehensive permitting reform.

Why it matters: Eighty percent of manufacturers say the length and complexity of the permitting process is harmful to increasing investment.

Eighty-seven percent say they would expand operations, hire more workers or increase wages and benefits if permitting were streamlined, and 68% of manufacturers with permittable projects say they could expand more quickly with a modernized federal permitting system.

The bottom line: “Manufacturers urge policymakers to seize the moment—pass the PERMIT Act and companion bills this week and the SPEED Act next week—and make it easier and more cost-efficient for manufacturers to get shovels in the ground on job-creating projects,” said Timmons.

Checking it twice: “To turn this holiday package into real progress for the country, the Senate must take up the mantle in the new year and advance comprehensive permitting reforms that will empower manufacturers across the country to compete, invest and grow,” Timmons added.",https://nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0ee9d52a-1f54-4388-ab4f-5159bf091be5.png,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:02.155656

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is proposing to revise the 2022 fuel economy standards and then raise them between 0.25% and 0.5% annually through 2031.
Reducing the fuel economy requirements is estimated to increase fuel consumption by around 100 billion gallons through 2050.
Earlier this year, Trump signed legislation that ended fuel economy penalties for automakers, and NHTSA said they faced no fines dating back to the 2022 model year.
As IER’s Tom Pyle has argued, “President Trump and the Republicans in Congress must push to completely eliminate fuel economy standards once and for all.","President Donald Trump proposed slashing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards that former President Joe Biden finalized last year, in a move that automakers were looking for and which allows consumers to choose the best type of vehicle that fits their needs. Biden’s fuel economy standards were designed to incentivize more electric vehicle (EV) purchases, making it difficult for gasoline cars to meet the onerous standards. With the change, automakers will no longer be forced to sell EVs at a loss and raise prices on gasoline vehicles to make up the difference. Trump has taken other steps to allow consumers the ability to choose the right vehicle for them, including rescinding EV tax credits and rejecting California’s request for a waiver from federal law to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles after 2035.

According to Reuters, the new recommended standard would significantly reduce the fuel economy requirements from model years 2022 to 2031, requiring 34.5 miles per gallon on average by 2031, down from 50.4 miles per gallon. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is proposing to revise the 2022 fuel economy standards and then raise them between 0.25% and 0.5% annually through 2031. In 2022, the Biden administration increased fuel efficiency by 8% annually for model years 2024-2025 and 10% for 2026. U.S. dealers and others said the new standards are more in line with the vehicles customers want to buy rather than the more costly vehicles automakers have been pushed to produce due to regulations.

The change is expected to reduce average vehicle costs by $930 and save Americans $109 billion over five years. In October, Kelley Blue Book indicated the average price of a new car in the United States topped $50,000 for the first time, up 3.6% year-over-year. Signed into law in 1975, the CAFE standards regulate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. Reducing the fuel economy requirements is estimated to increase fuel consumption by around 100 billion gallons through 2050.

As reported by Reuters, automakers are expected to save $35 billion through 2031, including $8.7 billion for GM and more than $5 billion for Ford and Stellantis. Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company would invest more in affordable vehicles. “Today is a victory for common sense and affordability… We believe that people should be able to make a choice.” According to GM CEO Mary Barra, before Congress blocked California’s zero-emission vehicle rules in June, the auto sector was facing requirements in some states that 35% of new vehicles sold in 2026 must be electric. “We were going to have to start shutting down plants because we weren’t going to be able to build and sell those vehicles,” Barra said. She, however, reaffirmed the carmaker’s commitment to electric vehicles.

Reuters adds that the proposal is also seeking to make changes to the credit trading program, including the elimination of credit trading among automakers in 2028, and ending some credits for fuel-saving features. According to NHTSA, credit trading was a “windfall for EV-exclusive manufacturers that sell credits to other non-EV manufacturers.” Ending credit trading could hurt EV manufacturers such as Tesla and Rivian, which have sold credits to companies that make gas-powered vehicles and cannot meet the standards. Earlier this year, Trump signed legislation that ended fuel economy penalties for automakers, and NHTSA said they faced no fines dating back to the 2022 model year. The increase in vehicle emissions from NHTSA’s proposal in 2035 would be the equivalent of annual emissions from 7.7 million vehicles over the Biden proposal.

Trump’s Prior Actions

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed financial penalties for automakers that do not meet fuel efficiency requirements and ended the EV tax credit on September 30. Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since then. In November, electric vehicles accounted for 5.3% of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales — less than half the record high in September. Ford’s November unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49% compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59%. The president also signed a law to block California from enforcing a ban on new gas-powered car sales — a waiver that the state received under the Biden administration that allowed it to set its own rule and that other states could follow.

Analysis

Under the Obama and Biden administrations, CAFE transformed from a fuel efficiency measure to a de facto EV mandate, requiring automakers to replace their profitable, affordable vehicles with EVs. The Trump administration’s changes will help bring it back in line with its original intent; however, CAFE’s vehicle market distortions will continue to burden consumers and automakers with higher prices and fewer options until it is fully repealed. As IER’s Tom Pyle has argued, “President Trump and the Republicans in Congress must push to completely eliminate fuel economy standards once and for all. It’s time to repeal CAFE and let the market determine the future of the automobile industry.”",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-at-9.46.13-AM-1024x635.png,N,,2025-12-10 15:00:55.818427

The vehicles co-developed by Ford and Renault will be built at Ampere’s ElectriCity plant in the north of France.
""This partnership shows the strength of our partnership know-how and competitiveness in Europe,"" Renault CEO François Provost said in a statement.

They'll explore joint development and manufacturing of Ford- and Renault-branded commercial vehicles.","Ford Motor Co. will develop two passenger electric vehicles for Europe with French rival Renault SA, and the two automakers will explore collaboration on light commercial vehicles.

The companies announced the partnership on Tuesday after the European Commission delayed a meeting scheduled this week to advance an automotive package that could weaken a 2035 ban on new carbon dioxide-emitting vehicles. Ford and other legacy automakers say the regulation is unfeasible, calling for policy in alignment with consumer demand that extends the life of hybrids.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford, said in a statement. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

The Ford-Renault partnership is a sign of the challenges with EVs. Low volumes as consumers hesitate over range anxiety, access to charging infrastructure and slow charging speeds can render EVs unprofitable or unaffordable. Sharing Renault's Ampere smart EV platform for two Ford-branded models that will arrive starting in early 2028 helps to create scale needed for profitability. Ford declined to disclose expected pricing.

EVs represent 16% of European new-car sales, below the 25% of new vehicle registrations required to meet Europe’s 2025 CO2 targets. The Dearborn automaker called for a ""realistic and reliable 10-year planning horizon"" that allows consumers to drive hybrids for longer instead of forcing a change they aren't ready to make.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose — whether that’s fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” Jim Baumbick, the new president of Ford Europe, said in a statement. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Added Farley in a Monday op-ed in the Financial Times: ""Setting unrealistic regulations only to adjust them at the end of each year when consumers do not show up is a recipe for turmoil.""

The tension centers around environmental concerns and fears over competition from the Chinese, who already are producing low-cost EVs and have the capacity to produce every new vehicle sold in Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced relaxed fuel economy standards through 2031.

Ford argues that with manufacturers investing hundreds of billions of dollars into EVs, governments must match that commitment with consistent purchase incentives on which several nations have pulled back and a charging infrastructure that extends beyond urban areas.

The vehicles co-developed by Ford and Renault will be built at Ampere’s ElectriCity plant in the north of France. Ampere is an EV and software subsidiary of Renault that it had planned to spin off, but the company changed those plans last year.

""This partnership shows the strength of our partnership know-how and competitiveness in Europe,"" Renault CEO François Provost said in a statement. ""In the long term, combining our strengths with Ford will make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market.""

The Blue Oval said it'll lead the design and driving dynamics of the vehicles to ensure they are distinctly Ford. The vehicles are the start of a new generation of multi-energy vehicles in Europe from the company. A news release notes its Valencia plant in Spain will play a role in those product plans.

Ford and Renault also have also signed a letter of intent for a European light commercial vehicle collaboration. They'll explore joint development and manufacturing of Ford- and Renault-branded commercial vehicles.

Ford also called aggressive CO2 regulations in Europe on commercial vehicles an ""economic tax on the backbone of Europe,"" citing that 8% of vans are electric. The company suggested it unfairly penalizes small- and medium-sized businesses.

Ford in 2024 said it was cutting 4,000 jobs in Europe by the end of 2027 mostly in Germany and the United Kingdom. The move was made to focus on its Ford Pro commercial business that represents most of its revenues there, reduce costs, and respond to underperforming EV sales.

""To be clear, the industry is not asking for a bailout,"" Farley wrote in the op-ed. ""We are not asking for protectionism to shield inefficiency. At Ford, we will continue to do the hard work of restructuring. We have closed legacy facilities, reduced our workforce and slimmed down costs to become more agile.""

Renault isn't Ford's first European partnership. Ford Otosan is its joint venture with Koç Holding that builds commercial vans in Turkey. The Blue Oval also collaborates with Volkswagen AG on commercial and passenger vehicles.

With 80% of the world’s offshore wind potential located in deeper waters, floating offshore wind will be critical to delivering the UK’s future energy needs.","25 years ago this week, the UK switched on its very first offshore wind farm off the coast of Blyth in north-east England.

It was a very different world back then: Google was only two years old, Vladimir Putin had just taken office in the Kremlin, and Pembrokeshire-born David Gray was finding global fame with his hit single 'Babylon'. Wikipedia was just around the corner, and the iPhone was still a glint in Apple’s eye. Or so I’m told – given the breakthrough at Blyth took place a month before I was born.

As offshore wind and I reach our respective 25th birthdays, I’m taking a moment to reflect on the story so far in Wales and look forward to how this technology is shaping up to power our future, delivering clean Welsh energy for decades to come.

When did offshore wind begin in Wales?

At the turn of the millennium, offshore wind was still the new kid on the block — innovative but unproven, and far from the economic heavyweight and reliable clean-power source it is today. The first two turbines off Blyth, producing just 4MW between them, were essentially an experiment to see whether offshore wind could work at all.

That’s why you could argue that the real take-off moment for offshore wind happened in North Wales. Just three years later, in 2003, North Hoyle off the coast from Rhyl became not only Wales’ first offshore wind farm but the UK’s first major offshore project. Jumping from two turbines to thirty, and from 4MW to 60MW, North Hoyle marked a dramatic step-change. It not only proved offshore wind could scale, but also paving the way for the industry we know today.

By 2009, offshore wind was rapidly becoming an industrial force, and one of our strongest tools in tackling climate change. That year, RWE’s Rhyl Flats wind farm came online five miles out from Llandudno. Delivering 90MW of clean electricity, enough to power around 70,000 homes, it marked another major leap forward, and has cut 1.7 million tonnes of carbon emissions over its lifetime. And the pace of growth continued. Just six years later, in 2015 off the same North Wales coast, Gwynt y Môr was commissioned. At 576MW and 160 turbines, it became one of the largest offshore wind farms in the world.

In the space of just 12 years, Wales had gone from the 60MW North Hoyle site to a project almost ten times larger. Offshore wind had leapfrogged from two pilot turbines in Blyth to one of Europe’s flagship clean energy assets in barely a decade and a half.

But here’s the stark reality: Gwynt y Môr was also the last offshore wind farm built in Wales. It’s now ten years since it was completed.

In other words, the last time Wales built offshore wind, I was still doing my GCSEs!

The great Celtic comeback

Wales’ offshore wind story isn’t over though, far from it. Two new offshore projects planned for North Wales are eligible to compete in this year’s Clean Power Auction, offering the chance to restart construction after almost a decade of pause.

But the real step change, the technology that will redefine the Welsh role in the UK energy system, is happening further south and west in the Celtic Sea. If North Wales was a trailblazer in fixed-bottom offshore wind, South and West Wales will now lead the UK’s floating offshore wind revolution: bigger, more powerful, and able to operate in deeper waters where traditional turbines can’t go. With The Crown Estate’s Leasing Round 5 in the Celtic Sea now complete, Wales is on the brink of hosting one of the most exciting renewables developments in the world.

Three sites have been secured by Equinor, Gwynt Glas, and Ocean Winds, which together are set to deliver:

4.5GW of clean power

More than 5,000 jobs supported and a £1.4 billion boost to the UK economy.

One of the largest floating offshore wind deployments anywhere on the planet.

Beyond that, the Crown Estate is progressing plans to deliver 12GW of floating offshore wind capacity in the Celtic Sea by 2035. For Wales, this represents a roaring comeback for offshore wind and a leap into a new era of industrial opportunity, jobs, innovation, and global leadership.

By the time I turn 50, Wales’ electricity demand is expected to double, and perhaps even treble, as transport, heating, and industry switch to clean power. Meeting that demand will require a transformation every bit as significant as the revolutions that shaped the country’s industrial past.

With 80% of the world’s offshore wind potential located in deeper waters, floating offshore wind will be critical to delivering the UK’s future energy needs. The Climate Change Committee estimates we will need 100GW of offshore wind by 2050. And, once again, Wales is positioned to lead.

But getting there depends on the choices we make now. Onshore wind is the runway to that success. It is the near-term opportunity that equips Welsh workers with the skills they need, readies Welsh businesses to grow capacity, and strengthens our ports and supply chain to prepare for the scale of floating offshore wind to come.

Just as Welsh coal powered the steam age, and Welsh steel built bridges, ships, and skylines across the world, we now have the chance to drive a new industrial revolution. In my lifetime offshore wind in Wales has grown from an emerging technology into one of the foundational economic growth areas of the 21st century.

And while David Gray is no longer topping the charts 25 years on, one thing hasn’t changed. Vladimir Putin is still very much in power and his invasion of Ukraine was a stark reminder that Wales' and the UK’s energy security can never again depend on volatile global fossil fuel markets. The case for home-grown, clean power has never been stronger.

What began with 60MW in North Hoyle has now reached 726MW of offshore capacity here in Wales. Over the next decade, that could rise to more than 5GW. As countries across the world race to adopt offshore wind, Wales will be remembered as one of the early pioneers - paving the way for current and future generations to enjoy a safer, more secure planet, running on clean, affordable energy.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-10 19:00:48.972003

Several high-value projects—including highway corridor modernization, logistics hub expansions, EV-supply-chain facilities, and bridge upgrades—depend on conformity analyses tied to ozone status.
Under Moderate status, contractors and public agencies will need clearer plans for idle reduction, equipment upgrades, or temporary offsets that prevent exceedances during peak construction seasons.
What This Means as 2026 Approaches Michigan must now develop and submit a complete RACT SIP and demonstrate implementation before EPA revisits Detroit’s attainment status.","The Sixth Circuit has partially overturned EPA’s decision to redesignate the Detroit ozone nonattainment area, ruling that the agency cannot approve attainment status unless all Moderate nonattainment controls are fully in place. The court upheld EPA’s wildfire-related data adjustments but rejected the redesignation itself, restoring regulatory requirements that will shape how Southeast Michigan advances transportation, industrial, and IIJA-funded infrastructure projects in 2026.

A Split Decision on Science and Procedure

In Sierra Club v. EPA, the court reviewed a 2023 EPA action that relied on two components: excluding two wildfire-influenced ozone days from Detroit’s design value calculation and redesignating the area to attainment. Judges agreed with EPA’s technical assessment of the June 2022 Canadian wildfire smoke event, finding the agency relied on a clear set of meteorological indicators, satellite data, and chemical signatures that supported a causal link to elevated ozone levels.

The outcome shifted, however, when the court examined Detroit’s redesignation. Because the region was bumped from Marginal to Moderate status after missing its attainment deadline, Michigan was required to implement Moderately classified ozone controls—most notably RACT for VOC and NOₓ sources—before EPA could approve attainment. Those obligations were still outstanding in May 2023. The court concluded that EPA cannot disregard statutory requirements based on the timing of a state’s request and vacated the redesignation.

Infrastructure Consequences With Immediate Reach

Restoring Detroit’s Moderate classification has direct implications for infrastructure planning across the region. Several high-value projects—including highway corridor modernization, logistics hub expansions, EV-supply-chain facilities, and bridge upgrades—depend on conformity analyses tied to ozone status. Remaining in Moderate classification shifts the burden back toward stricter review.

Transportation conformity.

IIJA-funded projects involving added capacity must now demonstrate compliance with SIP budgets that remain constrained without a RACT-backed emissions foundation. This may lengthen modeling timelines or require additional mitigation strategies before approvals move forward.

Industrial development.

Manufacturing expansions—particularly automotive and battery-related operations—must now undergo more detailed permitting for NOₓ and VOC emissions. RACT requirements will influence technology choices, operational strategies, and deployment schedules.

Construction-phase emissions.

Major projects generate temporary emissions from diesel fleets and detour traffic. Under Moderate status, contractors and public agencies will need clearer plans for idle reduction, equipment upgrades, or temporary offsets that prevent exceedances during peak construction seasons.

A National Signal for Ozone Governance

The decision also marks another indication that courts, post-Loper Bright, are reading the Clean Air Act more strictly. EPA’s historical flexibility around redesignations—particularly in regions trying to secure quicker permitting environments—may face more challenges. Other states that used early redesignation requests to soften the impact of bump-ups may now need to revisit whether all statutory control measures were in place.

What This Means as 2026 Approaches

Michigan must now develop and submit a complete RACT SIP and demonstrate implementation before EPA revisits Detroit’s attainment status. Until then, the regulatory environment across the region will remain more demanding for transportation agencies, industrial operators, and developers planning long-term infrastructure investments.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251209-184038-da7-Detroit%20City%20Street%20during%20the%20day.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:37.774941

Craig Pritzlaff, acting assistant administrator of EPA’s enforcement office, said the memo “reinforces a ‘compliance first’ orientation as the guiding principle” for the program, including for all civil enforcement and compliance initiatives at the agency.
They warned the guidance could stall staff from using measures to stop repeat offenders and stagnate enforcement action at EPA.
“The purpose of a compliance first orientation is to ensure that enforcement actions are tailored to achieve compliance faster and that enforcement in general is conducted consistently across EPA,” Hirsch said.

Craig Pritzlaff, acting assistant administrator of EPA’s enforcement office, said the memo “reinforces a ‘compliance first’ orientation as the guiding principle” for the program, including for all civil enforcement and compliance initiatives at the agency. The memo, obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News, also tells employees to seek approval from top leadership, pulls back guidance from the previous administration and bars mitigation efforts, known as supplemental environmental projects, or SEPs.

“This policy reinforces prioritizing environmental compliance across all OECA civil judicial and administrative enforcement activities in the most efficient, most economical, and swiftest means possible,” Pritzlaff said in the memo, dated Friday and sent to senior enforcement officials and attorneys across the country.

Former EPA officials said the agency already emphasized securing compliance first before digging further into its enforcement toolkit to crack down on those who breached environmental laws. They warned the guidance could stall staff from using measures to stop repeat offenders and stagnate enforcement action at EPA.

“When an entity fails to comply with EPA’s regulations, the agency needs to do more than simply give the violator another chance to comply,” said Larry Starfield, who served more than 30 years at EPA, including as the principal deputy assistant administrator in its enforcement office.

Starfield added when a facility repeatedly emits too much pollution, “The government can either say ‘try harder this time,’ or it can require objectively reliable measures” such as more air quality monitoring and data sharing with the public.

In response to questions for this story, EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement the whole point of the Friday memo is “to speed up enforcement and compliance,” adding it takes far too long to bring a facility in line with the law.

“The purpose of a compliance first orientation is to ensure that enforcement actions are tailored to achieve compliance faster and that enforcement in general is conducted consistently across EPA,” Hirsch said.

Memo ‘messing my day up’

Gary Jonesi, who served almost 40 years at EPA, including as an enforcement official, disagrees with that assessment.

“This memo makes it harder for EPA staff to enforce because it removes several incentives that violators have to settle cases and erects procedural barriers to rapid enforcement,” said Jonesi, now executive director of CREEDemocracy.

The new guidance is already having an impact on EPA’s enforcement work, according to agency staffers granted anonymity because they fear retaliation.

One EPA employee said they have been told to pause settlement negotiations. “It’s messing my day up,” they said about the memo.

A second staffer said “compliance first” sounds like “compliance only,” adding “that policy leans heavily towards the regulated community.”

A third employee pointed to one part of the memo that they called “particularly egregious.” That section said when those regulated by EPA have questions about how the agency has applied the law, those questions “must be elevated immediately” and decisions on how to proceed should be made at “a national level.”

“Inspectors and enforcement staff, including attorneys, are not responsible for resolving an ambiguity or concern,” the memo said.

“A regulated entity always raises concerns about EPA’s application of a statute. But those concerns are often recurring across cases and dispensed with easily,” the employee said. “This says we don’t dispense with them. We elevate them. This will stop all meaningful cases in their tracks.”

Hirsch with EPA said enforcement’s purpose is “to achieve compliance quickly” and remediate any releases required under law. If inspections show noncompliance repeatedly, “then additional enforcement would be applicable,” she said.

“It is unfortunate that a small number of employees have seen fit to publicly misrepresent the memorandum without even attempting to discuss their concerns and reach a common understanding with their colleagues,” the agency spokesperson said.

Laura Thoms, who served nearly 20 years at the Department of Justice, including earlier this year as assistant section chief for its Environmental Enforcement Section, found the memo’s directive “alarming” that enforcement must stop if a regulated entity raises concerns.

“This places the ability to delay enforcement directly in the hands of polluters,” said Thoms, now director of enforcement at Earthjustice, noting their questions will swamp EPA as the agency investigates thousands of facilities each year.

“Delaying enforcement means that more pollution is spewed into the air, more waste is dumped into rivers, and more communities are put at risk,” she said.

Biden-era guidance gone, SEPs no more

Pritzlaff’s memo is similar to other guidance issued by the Trump EPA. Jeffrey Hall, then EPA’s acting enforcement head, directed staff in a March 12 memo to ease enforcement on energy facilities and no longer consider environmental justice.

President Donald Trump nominated Hall to lead EPA’s enforcement program, but he has not been confirmed yet. Pritzlaff, formerly director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s enforcement program, joined the agency in August as principal deputy assistant administrator in that office.

Pritzlaff, in his memo, also voids guidance issued during the Biden administration for advocating “expansive remedies,” such as advanced monitoring, third-party audits and electronic reporting. “The 2021 memorandum is overly broad in its approach and therefore is rescinded,” he said.

Injunctive relief outside of the law and regulation may be appropriate in “limited, case-specific circumstances” but should be only by approved by the head of EPA’s enforcement office.

Starfield signed that 2021 memo. He said the new memo’s guidance will weaken enforcement because bringing violators into compliance is not enough.

“Allowing the use of the enforcement tools in the 2021 memo only as a last resort in emergency or other extreme situations will hamstring efforts to prevent repeat violations and will weaken EPA’s ability to protect human health,” Starfield said.

In addition, Pritzlaff’s memo targets the agency’s use of supplemental environmental projects for settlements. Polluters agree to fund those projects to improve the environment, which could be an air quality sensor or even a hiking trail.

“Until additional guidance on the use of SEPs in settlement agreements is issued, no settlement shall include a SEP,” the memo said.

Republican lawmakers have criticized the projects as government handouts, which the Biden administration restored at EPA after they were prohibited during Trump’s first term.

“The regulated community likes these,” Jonesi said about SEPs. “They are voluntary projects with a strong nexus to the violations, and they can significantly reduce a violator’s penalty and make it look a little better in local communities and beyond.”

Worries about environmental enforcement have spiked during the Trump administration.

The Justice Department and EPA have seen an exodus of staff, which will only increase the workload on those that remain in government. In turn, fewer cases could be filed against polluters and less money won in penalties and settlements.

“Polluting is easy. Meeting legal requirements that protect human health and the environment costs money,” Thoms said. “Without enforcement, there’s little incentive to comply.”

Hirsch, the EPA spokesperson, said the Trump administration has concluded as many civil enforcement actions as in the same period last year. The agency is focused on “achieving compliance as quickly as possible” rather than pushing “broad injunctive relief that goes beyond what the law requires and unfairly and unlawfully burdens industry and energy,” she said.

Pritzlaff’s memo, however, could heighten anxiety that enforcement will slow at the agency.

“Well, I could see how it could be used to end enforcement as we know it,” the third EPA employee said. “But then again, under Trump, no enforcement is getting done.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/57/19/c3b865874046a940a47fb353bf72/epa-headquarters-64893.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:14.892766

The advantages of GSI are widely recognized within the field of water management, and public awareness of GSI is growing as well.

Still, GSI implementation is not widespread in new builds or developments in Texas. So, how can GSI researchers help communities increase green stormwater infrastructure implementation?

This is a question that researchers have been trying to answer for years, including Fouad Jaber, Ph.D., a Texas A&M AgriLife professor and extension specialist in Dallas, who has been working with builders for more than a decade to increase green development practices.

In the Houston area, Aiyana Baptiste, a green infrastructure associate at Texas A&M AgriLife’s Green Infrastructure for Texas (GIFT), also works with city engineers, public works directors, and other municipal staff who develop policies around building and infrastructure development.

Baptiste and Jaber have found that it is essential to understand why people are hesitant about GSI before attempting to bridge the gap between research findings and everyday use.

Barriers to implementation

They have encountered many reasons that people don’t want to implement green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). One of those barriers is that GSI isn’t typical.

“It’s a new thing that challenges the accepted rule,” Jaber said. “Engineers learn how to design pipes, maybe detention ponds, and move on. And here you are. You’re telling them there’s this amazing thing that does beautiful stuff. It’s a depression with soil and plants, and it’s just hard to accept that you can put soil and plants and reduce the size of your pipe. You know, it’s just not typical.”

Another barrier is the misconception that it’s too expensive or hard to maintain, according to Jaber and Baptiste. This misconception is understandable. To many people, GSI is a new, unfamiliar solution. It can actually be a cost-effective solution, though.

Rain gardens, sunken areas of dirt filled with plants that help rain to soak into the ground, can be less expensive than traditional system replacement, according to a research study coauthored by Jaber. And that doesn’t include the ecosystem services they provide.

Additionally, the size and cost of GSI vary. For larger projects, grants are available, and options like using native plants can reduce costs, according to Baptiste. She encourages finding GSI solutions that fit each area’s needs and resources.

“GSI doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing approach,” Baptiste said. “Even small-scale projects like rain gardens, bioswales, or permeable pavements can make a real impact and inspire bigger changes over time. It’s about finding solutions that fit the community and its needs. There are grants, technical support, and real examples out there to help get started!”

Despite the misconceptions, GSI maintenance can also be lower-cost and easier than traditional structures.

“It’s actually not very expensive,” Jaber said. “If you have a median with turf grass on it, you have to mow it and water it weekly in the summer. That is way more maintenance than having a rain garden where you have to check it once a month to make sure nothing is wrong. There’s not any mowing needed, maybe some weeding here and there.”

Tips for cost-effective GSI implementation:

Use native plants, which require less maintenance since they are adapted to thrive in their native climate.

Build rain gardens instead of traditional system replacement.

Apply for grants and other financial funding opportunities.

Replace medians with rain gardens.

But not everyone can replace medians with rain gardens. Many cities have rules against altering these areas, and some cities also have limitations on practices like rainwater harvesting. City ordinance issues like these can be another barrier to implementation for builders.

In a 2022 study that Jaber coauthored, researchers found that barriers to GSI implementation exist in socio-cultural, financial, technical, biophysical, institutions and governance, and legislative and regulatory areas.

Solutions

So, what can be done to help more communities use GSI practices to protect their water and natural resources?

Jaber focuses on education and outreach. He and his team started by creating education materials and programs using grant funding. They organized workshops and spread the word with the help of Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service county agents.

As GSI became a national trend, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) encouraged it.

“There was this perfect storm, and cities started hearing us,” Jaber said. “We mostly targeted city stormwater departments. They would come to the lecture, hear about it, and then the next day someone would call, and they’re like, ‘There’s a big erosion problem here. Can you help us?’”

From there, the word spread further, supported with educational materials and results from grant-funded projects. Jaber and his team began using computer models to show the impact of GSI. They also held events for master naturalists to invite them to implement GSI in their volunteer projects.

“There are ways to make it simple enough so that people can build it,” he said. “Like, for your backyard, you don’t need an engineer. The idea is just to let it spread and have people want to adopt it.”

Baptiste has taken a similar path, focusing on education and outreach with city staff. According to her, most city staff are eager to learn about GSI and how to implement it. Her advice is to highlight benefits that will appeal to the city.

“When talking to municipal staff, it’s important to highlight the benefits that go beyond simply creating a greener community and supporting the environment,” said Baptiste. “GSI practices can offer the same advantages as gray infrastructure while also providing additional social and economic benefits.”

Social and economic benefits of GSI include:

Human health – Green spaces promote active lifestyles, connect people with their neighbors and provide areas to relax and destress, improving mental health.

Quality of life – GSI can improve water quality, conserve water, enhance air quality, and reduce noise pollution, all of which improve human quality of life.

Improved visual appeal – By incorporating natural elements into urban areas, GSI can create beautiful public spaces.

Community safety – By increasing infiltration, GSI can reduce flood risks, protecting the community.

Reduced costs – GSI can reduce flood damage and wastewater infrastructure costs by increasing infiltration and water reuse.

These AgriLife experts are also helping communities get GSI information by incorporating GSI into grade school and university curriculums, using financial tools to gather funding, implementing coherent and specific guidelines for GSI adoption, and creating regulations for keeping green spaces in new developments, according to Jaber’s research.

The benefits of GSI are plentiful and worthwhile, Baptiste said, improving communities’ safety, social infrastructure and environmental sustainability.

“I wish more people understood that GSI isn’t just about being ‘green,’ it’s about building resilient and healthy communities,” said Baptiste. “It creates spaces that can handle stormwater more naturally while improving quality of life. It can reduce flooding, support local ecosystems, and make neighborhoods more vibrant. GSI can work with existing infrastructure and doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive to make a difference. “

HARDI wrote that it also strongly supports the EPA’s proposal to repeal the installation date compliance requirement for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems.
In addition, Lennox supports EPA’s proposal to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial AC/HP components manufactured before January 1, 2025.
Trane Technologies supports EPA’s plan to eliminate the January 1, 2026, installation compliance date for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems.","Nearly 2,300 comments were submitted before the deadline, and EPA is in the process of reviewing them and then posting them to the public docket. A final decision isn’t expected until sometime in 2026, leaving many HVACR contractors uncertain about what equipment can be legally installed after January 1. Below are some of the concerns raised by HVACR stakeholders.

ACCA asked EPA to remove installation deadlines for residential, light commercial AC/HP and VRF/VRV systems manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025, arguing that the cutoff could strand lawful R-410A equipment, disrupt projects, and impose needless financial risk on contractors and consumers. The association added that eliminating the deadline would not increase the amount of high-GWP equipment produced but would simply allow lawful inventory to be installed until sold. ACCA also warned that differing state refrigerant rules could further complicate the transition and urged EPA to use its authority to discourage a patchwork of state refrigerant regulations.

As Barton James, president and CEO of ACCA, wrote, “In the absence of federal preemption under the AIM Act, several states are pursuing accelerated regulatory timelines that effectively mandate a transition to A3 refrigerants…A3 refrigerants pose materially different installation, ventilation, and ignition-risk challenges than A2Ls, and the rapid transition schedules under consideration in some states would force contractors to navigate incompatible codes, unavailable equipment, and unclear liability exposure.”

AHRI and the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy urged EPA to maintain the existing TT rule schedule, arguing that delaying transition dates or raising GWP limits would undermine years of industry investment, misalign HFC demand with the AIM Act’s tightening supply caps, and lead to higher refrigerant prices for consumers. They emphasized that “multiple substitute refrigerants are listed as approved under EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) [program], and building codes nationwide now allow for their installation,” adding that as of July 2025, nearly 90% of new residential and light commercial AC/HP systems used substitute refrigerants.

The groups warned that broad delays would reward laggards, disadvantage U.S. manufacturers, and trigger a patchwork of rules among the states. The letter stated, “The practical course is clear: keep one national schedule, preserve the 2029 supply-demand alignment, and use narrow, evidence-based relief only where necessary.”

Carrier supported the overall framework of the TT rule but requested several key modifications to ensure a smoother transition. Specifically, the company urged EPA to remove the installation deadline for VRF systems, aligning them with residential and light-commercial AC/HP systems to avoid stranded inventory and simplify compliance. Carrier also asked EPA to stop treating replacement residential and light commercial condensing units as service components under the rule.

“Treating the condenser…as a service component is not needed, nor is it in the best interest of consumers,” wrote Rob Six, head of government relations at Carrier. He noted that Carrier residential HVAC components carry a 10-year warranty, so most R-410A outdoor unit failures are covered. When failures occur after the warranty period, replacing only the outdoor unit can create system mismatches, “leading to inefficient performance and a higher likelihood of additional repairs over the system’s lifespan. Such increased costs for consumers run counter to the intent of the proposed rule.”

Copeland asked EPA to keep the current TT rule timelines, emphasizing that changes would create uncertainty, raise refrigerant costs, and “exacerbate an already complex patchwork of mandates and regulations” at the state level. The company noted that the industry is already moving to lower-GWP refrigerants, pointing to updated building codes, strong A2L adoption in the HVAC market, and a number of viable options for the food retail industry.

“Technologies such as CO₂, ammonia, A2Ls, R-290, and hybrid conﬁgurations each ﬁt different applications, giving [food retailers] ﬂexibility to match solutions with their technology preferences, regional conditions, and budget considerations,” wrote Jennifer Butsch, director of regulatory affairs at Copeland.

Extending HFC use could also strain future refrigerant supply under the AIM Act, she cautioned, which would be detrimental to the industry. “Maintaining the published transition timelines supports the OEMs that have made signiﬁcant investments in these solutions and helps preserve a stable HFC supply–demand balance, which is important for affordability now and in the future.”

Daikin expressed support for EPA’s plan to eliminate the installation deadline for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems built from components produced or imported before January 1, 2025. The company further noted that VRF systems should be granted the same indefinite installation allowance for pre-2026 components to ensure consistency across product categories.

“A uniform installation approach across air conditioners, heat pumps, and VRF would (i) prevent stranded lawful inventory; (ii) reduce the likelihood of potential economic losses borne by U.S. manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and end-users; (iii) align with the structure and rationale of the Technology Transitions program; (iv) eliminate the need for administratively complex permit-based carve-outs; and (v) avoid distorting multi-year commercial project pipelines that depend on predictable installation timelines,” wrote David Calabrese, executive vice president of government aﬀairs at Daikin.

Daikin also asked EPA to offer a time-limited No Action Assurance (NAA) — or similar enforcement flexibility — for equipment categories with January 1, 2026, compliance dates that could change during this reconsideration. Because it will take time to review comments, complete interagency review, and finalize the rule, Calabrese wrote that an NAA would give manufacturers and distributors some much-needed clarity on how existing inventory and pending orders will be handled.

HARDI wrote that it also strongly supports the EPA’s proposal to repeal the installation date compliance requirement for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems. “We urge the EPA to extend this repeal to all HVAC and refrigeration subsectors (e.g., commercial VRF and retail food refrigeration systems) in the ﬁnal rule. This change would eliminate the current rule’s prohibition on installing pre-existing refrigeration/AC/HP equipment after a certain date, meaning compliance for these products would be determined solely by the date of manufacture (or import) of the equipment,” wrote Alex Ayers, vice president of government affairs at HARDI.

That said, HARDI strongly opposes EPA’s proposed “graduated schedule” for retail food refrigeration, supermarkets, and cold storage warehouses, which would add a higher interim GWP limit in 2026/2027 and delay the original low-GWP requirement until 2032. Ayers wrote that this approach would violate AIM Act timing rules, create enforcement “donut holes,” destabilize the market, disadvantage distributors who invested in low-GWP options, and is unnecessary given the availability of compliant technologies.

HARDI also strongly disagrees with the EPA’s position on outdoor condensing units used as replacement components. “Allowing unlimited production of outdoor units for legacy systems could prolong the market for R-410A equipment for decades, undermining the transition to low-GWP refrigerants,” wrote Ayers. “It creates a loophole that allows a homeowner to effectively obtain a new R-410A system even after pre-2025 inventory has been eliminated by replacing the outdoor condensing unit multiple times beyond the system's intended lifespan.”

Lennox asked EPA to maintain the existing timelines and GWP limits in the TT rule for commercial refrigeration equipment in order to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, prevent duplicative costs and stranded assets, minimize consumer impacts, protect U.S. jobs and technological leadership, and avert refrigerant shortages and price spikes. The company also stressed that EPA should finalize the rule as quickly as possible to prevent further weakening of market demand.

In addition, Lennox supports EPA’s proposal to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial AC/HP components manufactured before January 1, 2025. “Lennox also recommends that EPA extend these provisions to VRF systems, providing an indefinite installation for VRF systems assembled entirely from components manufactured or imported before January 1, 2026, consistent with the proposed indefinite allowance for AC/HP systems assembled from pre-2025 components,” wrote Dave Winningham, senior engineering manager of regulatory affairs at Lennox.”

Rheem wrote that it, too, strongly supports EPA’s proposal to remove the deadline for installation of HVAC systems assembled from components manufactured and imported prior to 2025. According to Karen Meyers, vice president of government affairs, “Rheem recommends that the same compliance relief be fairly applied to other field-installed systems, including those for VRF and commercial refrigeration subsectors. There is little need to prematurely cease use of existing equipment when the present and ongoing supply chain dynamics, coupled with a reduction in the supply of refrigerant as brought about by the Allocation Rule, limit the ability for entities in the HVACR market channel to build significant inventory.”

Rheem also urged EPA to swiftly provide No Action Assurance, or other enforcement guidance, to cover the period of time between January 1, 2026, and the effective date of the amended final rule. “Given that it is unlikely for a final rule to clear necessary review and publish prior to the end of the year, the Jan. 1st installation deadline for both air conditioning and refrigeration systems in certain subsectors presents compliance ambiguity…Rheem implores EPA to provide written enforcement guidance prior to Jan 1, 2026, so that affected manufacturers, installers, and end users can have compliance certainty during the remainder of the rulemaking period,” wrote Allison Skidd, director of global regulatory affairs — air at Rheem.

Trane Technologies supports EPA’s plan to eliminate the January 1, 2026, installation compliance date for residential and light commercial AC/HP systems. The company noted that giving distributors the ability to sell existing inventory promotes an orderly transition and avoids wasting usable equipment, while keeping the manufacturing deadlines that advance the shift to lower-GWP refrigerants.

Helen Walter-Terrinoni, director of policy and advocacy at Trane Technologies, added that the company does not support allowing indefinite replacement of condensing units using legacy chemistries, which “incentivizes bad actors to continue importing such refrigerants labeled for service and repair and creates an enforcement issue for the Agency.”

She also urged EPA to issue a time-limited No Action Assurance, or other enforcement relief mechanisms, confirming that the Agency will not pursue enforcement for noncompliance with the January 1, 2026, deadlines until the Reconsideration rule is finalized. “This approach would maintain the EPA’s regulatory integrity while ensuring that the regulated community can operate in good faith without fear of inadvertent noncompliance resulting from administrative timing constraints,” she said.",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/12/09/Lennox-condensing-unit.jpg?height=635&t=1765293964&width=1200,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:42.447347

What Comes Next Electricity costs will continue to evolve as the grid modernizes and power demand grows, but this evolution creates long-term benefits.","Electricity costs are climbing across the U.S., with the EIA(link is external) expecting the nominal U.S. average electricity price to increase by 13% from 2022 to 2025. For customers, rising power bills can feel sudden and unsettling. Headlines often focus on a single culprit, but energy cost challenges are more complex and nuanced than most realize.

In reality, U.S. electricity costs reflect multiple factors: aging infrastructure, extreme weather, industrial growth, and new digital demand driven by AI — each adding strain to a grid built for a different era and increasing competition for a limited amount of assets, equipment, fuel, and water. Addressing these challenges is a shared problem for our sector’s various stakeholders, including utilities, OEMs, and policymakers.

“What’s different now is the convergence of technology, weather, and demand,” says Andrea Willwerth, Manager, Market Intelligence & Strategy, Mitsubishi Power Americas. “The system is being asked to do more than ever before.”

Utilities, IPPs, ISOs, and state leaders are balancing the pressure to deliver reliable, affordable energy while meeting the low-emissions goals of increasingly complex customers. These newer players, including hyperscalers, developers, and data center co-locators, are used to moving fast and scaling even faster, but now must navigate an energy ecosystem shaped by regulation, timelines, and competing priorities.

As the power ecosystem becomes more interconnected, clear communication with the public is even more critical. Today’s consumers expect transparency from the brands they trust, and power providers are no exception. That means explaining why prices are changing, what’s being done to manage them, and how strategic investments in a rapidly evolving power market now prevent higher costs later. That kind of transparency builds trust, strengthens credibility, and encourages smarter energy use, which ultimately supports affordability.

For many, electricity has been taken for granted. Power runs until it doesn’t. And because the grid is largely invisible, the need for modernization isn’t always obvious. By clearly communicating grid modernization as an investment into long-term efficiency and resilience, the energy sector can help consumers understand the forces behind rising costs and why upgrades matter. That’s the story our sector has a responsibility to tell.

What Are the Hidden Factors Driving Electricity Cost Trends?

Most consumers don’t realize how old the U.S. power system is or the impact that aging infrastructure has. An S&P Global(link is external) analysis shows the capacity-weighted average age of the generation fleet is approximately 28 years, and many coal-fired power plants are now 40–60 years old. Upgrades and replacements require major, long-term capital investments, costs that inevitably ripple into rates.

We expect regular updates for our cars, smart homes, hospitals, and classrooms because technology evolves and demands change. The grid is no different. While utilities are investing in their fleets, the broader grid lags behind the pace of innovation seen in other sectors. Transmission and distribution upgrades are underway, but according to a 2025 DOE report(link is external) on U.S. grid reliability, “The magnitude and speed of projected load growth cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.” When the grid is inefficient for today’s needs, consumers feel the cost, as essential upgrades are needed to keep the lights on.

Extreme weather is also driving up costs. Across major U.S. cities, the frequency of heat waves has tripled since the 1960s, according to the EPA. The EIA(link is external) reports 42% of U.S. households now heat primarily with electricity, up from 35% in 2010. Rising temperatures are forcing utilities to add new capacity, reinforce assets, and increase reserve margins (extra generating capacity kept on standby for reliability), all of which raise near-term costs.

Electrification adds another layer of complexity. As homes, vehicles, and manufacturing transition to electric power, the U.S. is experiencing its fastest demand growth in decades. This growth is contributing to higher base and peak loads. Bank of America Institute(link is external) projects U.S. electricity demand to grow at a 2.5% compound annual growth rate through 2035. Higher loads mean utilities need to increase spending on new lines and substations, costs that get passed on to consumers.

Industrial growth and U.S. reshoring are also adding pressure to the grid, and the EIA(link is external) projects that the industrial sector alone will grow at 2.1% annually between 2020 and 2026. The American Clean Power Association(link is external) says that new industrial load growth is disproportionately higher in markets like PJM (Mid-Atlantic and Midwest) and ERCOT (Texas), signaling where regional manufacturing is expanding rapidly. Reshored factories and new manufacturing plants are creating concentrated, location-specific demand growth, which challenges traditional grid planning and may require local infrastructure upgrades.

Of all the forces reshaping power demand, the digital boom may be the most visible to consumers. The IEA Energy and AI special report(link is external) projects that data centers will account for almost half of U.S. electricity demand growth through 2030. These centers power everything from ChatGPT and Google Gemini to cloud computing and other digital services, and McKinsey(link is external) estimates their electricity use will rise by about 25% annually through the decade. “Data centers are a growing part of the picture, but not the whole picture,” says Willwerth. “They’re part of a much larger convergence of forces driving load growth.”

The takeaway: No single factor is driving electricity costs. It’s imperative that we help the public understand that while these factors combined may raise bills, they also improve power generation efficiency and fund the transition to a stronger, more reliable grid that can ultimately stabilize or reduce costs in the long run.

Utilities Are Managing the Pressure with Grid Modernization, Capacity Addition, and Rate Design

Utilities’ energy strategies are adapting to maintain reliability and affordability amid accelerated demand growth. That effort requires investment and open communication with customers and regulators about why those investments matter.

Across the U.S., utilities are investing heavily in grid modernization. Digital grid monitoring, substation automation, and advanced transmission systems are reducing energy losses and outage risk while helping operators respond faster to changing loads. Together, these technologies enhance grid performance and responsiveness, helping keep energy costs in check.

At the same time, utilities are adding capacity and replacing aging units with flexible, efficient generation. Many are deploying hybrid systems that blend natural gas, renewables, and energy storage to manage peaks cost-effectively while lowering emissions.

So all of these factors – electrification, manufacturing, modernization – are influencing prices. But perhaps the most significant factor in determining what the end-user sees on their power bill each month is actually rate design, which is being influenced by data centers (though not in the way you might think). Let’s start at the beginning. A regulator’s central concern is that data center electricity cost is getting passed on to residential users. Historically, the contracts have been drafted out and executed where this would be the case. However, rate contracts are changing greatly as a response to hyperscalers and others coming online and demanding more power. These contracts, fittingly, are called large load contracts, and they are structured in distinctly different ways than traditional rate designs.

Generally speaking, large load contracts have three central qualities:

1. Structured in 15-20 year contracts

2. Utilize a ""take or pay"" clause

3. Leverage a ""cancellation fee""

For example, in Ohio and Michigan, utilities have worked with state regulators to introduce new requirements like take-or-pay provisions, requiring large-load customers such as hyperscalers to pay for roughly 80 to 85% of contracted capacity, regardless of usage. Some state mechanisms also include exit fees and collateral requirements to prevent stranded assets. The reforms aim to spread costs equitably across industrial and residential customers, and these structures are being increasingly adopted as more projects become real.

These contract structures are all part of the power sector evolving to meet the needs of customers and off-takers. “Utilities and hyperscalers are adapting,” says Xiufang Gao, Senior Director, Market Intelligence & Strategy, Mitsubishi Power. “States and regulators are interested in imposing cost-recovery mechanisms, so residents are not overburdened.”

The industry’s challenge now is to make these efforts visible and show how they benefit everyday consumers.

Original Equipment Manufacturers Innovation in Power Generation

Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) have a limited, but vital, role in cost containment. Although equipment typically represents only a limited percentage of the capital costs of a power plant, according to a visualization from Brattle(link is external), OEM energy solutions deliver efficiency, flexibility, and integration that support cost-effective power generation for decades.

Mitsubishi Power’s high-efficiency gas turbines and hydrogen-ready turbines improve fuel performance, lowering cost and emissions. These turbines bring more electrons to the grid today, while advancing toward the technologies of tomorrow. Through frame agreements and standardized designs, the company helps utilities shorten project timelines and manage costs. Digital tools like predictive maintenance, remote diagnostics, and advanced control systems help operators maintain top performance and extend asset life.

“We cannot control the macroeconomics, but we can help our customers control what’s in their hands,” says Gao.

Collaboration Is the Real Solution

The future of energy pricing is a shared design problem and an educational opportunity. Partnerships between utilities, data centers, OEMs, EPCs, and regulators are reshaping the cost and capacity conversation. Despite their differences, they share risk and a common goal: safe, affordable, reliable energy with a path toward lowering emissions.

Initiatives like DCFlex(link is external) explore how data center backup power is being integrated into the grid’s reserve margin, reducing the need for new peaking units. Tech companies like Google are experimenting with workload shifting to reduce computational demand during grid peaks.

“Regulators and hyperscalers are from completely different worlds,” says Willwerth. “But now, you probably can’t go to a power conference without hearing about data centers, and you can't go to a data center conference without hearing about power. They know they need each other, and they're really trying to understand each other and find common ground.”

These collaborations represent a new kind of progress where innovation is as much about partnership as it is about technology.

What Comes Next

Electricity costs will continue to evolve as the grid modernizes and power demand grows, but this evolution creates long-term benefits. Efficiency improvements and hybrid systems can help offset rising fuel and construction costs, while new rate structures and contract terms can balance fairness and flexibility across different types of customers. Early pilots are already producing blueprints for scalable solutions, showing that reliability and affordability can advance together.

By helping the public understand what’s being built, upgraded, and secured, we’re showing consumers the real value behind their electricity bills before misconceptions take hold.

The collaboration will produce 2 new Ford-branded EVs built on Renault's Ampere platform, expected to launch in early 2028.

The automakers have also signed a letter of intent to explore jointly developing and manufacturing light commercial vehicles.

Ford Motor Co. entered into a ""strategic partnership"" with French-automaker Renault Group to expand Ford’s electric vehicle offering in Europe, a deal that will ""significantly"" improve the competitiveness for both companies in Europe, the companies said Dec. 9 in a statement.

The collaboration, which is not a joint-venture, will involve the automakers developing two distinct Ford-branded EVs, Ford's statement said.

Additionally, the two auto companies have signed a Letter of Intent for a European light commercial vehicle collaboration. Under this letter, the companies ""will explore the opportunity to jointly develop and manufacture"" certain Ford and Renault light commercial vehicles, Ford said in a statement.

The two new EVs will be based on the Ampere platform — that's Renault's EV arm dedicated to designing advanced and affordable EVs. For Ford, the partnership means leveraging Renault's EV assets and competitiveness. The vehicles will be made by Renault Group in the north of France using Ampere’s ElectriCity’s “state-of-the-art” manufacturing expertise.

For Renault, the two vehicles, which are expected to come to market in early 2028, will be designed by Ford. The EVs will feature ""distinctive driving dynamics, authentic Ford-brand DNA and intuitive experiences"" and mark the first step in a new product offensive for Ford in Europe.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “How we compete here, how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

Ford and Renault take on the Chinese

Farley added that the partnership is an important step for Ford and supports ""our strategy to build a highly efficient and fit-for-the future business in Europe. We will combine Renault Group’s industrial scale and EV assets with Ford’s iconic design and driving dynamics to create vehicles that are fun, capable and distinctly Ford in spirit.""

Farley has been vocal about the importance of being competitive in EVs against Chinese manufacturers, which are known for making high-quality and affordable EVs, and have a growing footprint in Europe with major Chinese brands such as BYD and Geely gaining marketshare.

According to Schmidt Automotive Research, the marketshare for Chinese EVs in Western Europe is expected to increase to 11% this year or 269,450 vehicles, up from 9.6% in 2024. Western Europe includes Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain. That's a gigantic gain in marketshare given that in 2021 the Chinese EV companies had just 3.8% marketshare. But the research forecasts that Chinese EV marketshare will peak at 13% in 2028 then slide back to 11.7% in 2030 or 756,000 vehicles.

Currently, EVs represent a total of 16.1% of vehicles sold in Europe, Ford said, far below the required 25% of new vehicle registrations required to meet Europe’s strict CO2 targets by 2025.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose — whether that’s fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” Ford Europe President Jim Baumbick said in a statement. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Ford and Renault leaders say that by joining forces in innovation, design, software and service delivery, will help them to address industry challenges and better serve retail and commercial customers.

“Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” Baumbick said. “We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product. These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.”

The gains from the partnership

When asked how much cost-savings and efficiency Ford hopes to gain from this partnership or how much revenue it forecasts coming from sales of these new EVs once they come to market, Ford Europe spokesman Dirk Ellenbeck told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network: ""The partnership combines the expertise, industrial scale and supply base of Ford and the Renault Group and will improve the competitiveness of both parties. We are not disclosing financials associated with this partnership.""

But the partnership combines the expertise, industrial scale and supply base of two major companies to deliver efficiency and manufacturing scale.

François Provost, CEO Renault Group, said the collaboration reflects the strength of both companies' expertise and competitiveness in Europe.

""In the long term, combining our strengths with Ford will make us more innovative and more responsive in a fast-changing European automotive market,"" Provost said in a statement.

Ford's other partners

Ford has existing partnerships in Europe. Ford Otosan is its joint venture with Koç Holding, a Turkish investment company. That arrangement has helped support Ford's commercial vehicle business in Europe. Ford Otosan plants are supplied with electric drive units produced in the United Kingdom following a £380 million investment in the plant, and advanced engine technology from Ford’s Dagenham plant in England.

In 2020, Ford and Volkswagen AG agreed to develop commercial vehicles and a variety of passenger cars globally. Ford said the partnership is delivering ""significant contributions to strengthening both our commercial vehicle and passenger car businesses. Ford’s current range of electric vehicles from the alliance are produced at its new Electric Vehicle Centre in Cologne, Germany.""

At the same time, Ford is evolving its industrial operations in Europe to help it offer customers more choices for ""multienergy vehicles."" Ford’s plant in Valencia, Spain, will continue to play a critical role in realizing Ford’s plan for an enhanced passenger vehicle portfolio in Europe, the company said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/PDTF/87673924007-ford-ev.JPG?crop=6719,3781,x0,y349&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 14:01:22.245437

It became the first group to use non-violent methods to oppose nuclear weapons testing, frequently by attempting to enter or entering closed-off nuclear weapons testing sites.
The Sierra Club describes itself as being “unequivocally opposed to nuclear energy.” In its statement on nuclear energy, the Sierra Club points to nuclear safety, nuclear proliferation, and the long-term storage of nuclear waste as making “nuclear power a uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity.”[11] Greenpeace’s statement on nuclear energy asserts that nuclear “has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future.” The organization describes nuclear energy as both expensive and dangerous and asserts that “just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean.”[12] In another example, Friends of the Earth describes nuclear as a “slow and costly solution to the climate crisis” and “one that creates harmful waste we have no answer for.”[13] Nuclear professional and industry organizations—the American Nuclear Society, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, for example—have long favored the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Ultimately, the polarizing debate around nuclear energy is obscuring a simple fact: Our shared energy future is uncertain.","Nearly 15 years after Fukushima, proponents and critics of nuclear energy remain deeply divided about the accident’s seriousness and nuclear energy more broadly.

On March 11, 2011, an earthquake exceeding 9 on the Richter scale struck just off the East Coast of Japan. The earthquake caused a tsunami whose waves rose over 40 meters at their highest point and over 15 meters at the site of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, where they surged over the 10-meter-tall seawall, flooding the emergency diesel generators that were the main source of backup power for the plant, which had already lost connection to the electricity grid. Although the plant shut down, the fuel in the reactors continued to produce decay heat, gradually evaporating the water in which the fuel was initially submerged. This cooling water continued to boil and evaporate until the fuel itself became uncovered and began to melt.

Three of the reactors at the site experienced partial meltdowns (units 1, 2, and 3). Hydrogen generated by the overheated fuel ignited, causing explosions in three reactor buildings (units 1, 3, and 4) and widespread dispersion of radioactivity. It took three months of tireless effort before the plant staff could restore automatic cooling to the damaged units and another six months before the reactors were declared stable and in a state of “cold shutdown.” The makeshift arrangements needed to restore the reactors to a stable condition generated over 350 million gallons of contaminated water, now being filtered, diluted, and released into the Pacific Ocean. The radionuclides released during the reactor building explosions still contaminate the soil and air in the towns closest to the Fukushima Daiichi plant, and the decontamination work is ongoing.

Over 150,000 people were evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture in 2011. The latest estimates from November 2024 indicate that over 24,000 evacuees are still displaced, having resettled outside the area.

Many proponents of nuclear energy describe the events that unfolded at the Fukushima Daiichi plant as an extremely low-probability “accident” or, more specifically, a “beyond design basis accident” caused by a series of highly improbable events beyond human control. These proponents also describe the accident’s aftermath as a success story because it did not lead to any immediate radiation-related deaths. But for critics of nuclear energy, however, the very name of the Fukushima prefecture has become synonymous with disaster—a disaster they view as not at all unexpected, with many describing it as a “normal accident,”[1] meaning that it was inevitable (Perrow 2011).

Nuclear proponents use the Fukushima experience as evidence of why nuclear energy should not just continue to be used, but be used on a much larger scale, if the worst possible outcome is a Fukushima-like accident. Critics view the Fukushima disaster as a complete indictment of nuclear energy—calling not only for a halt to new reactor projects but also for shuttering existing reactors. Both sides, though seemingly drawing on the same set of facts, interpret them quite differently to reach their conclusions, with neither side offering a full picture.

Since its inception, discussion about nuclear energy has been marked by extreme polarization, with proponents and opponents seeming to inhabit separate worlds when making wildly different claims about the future of nuclear energy. In making these claims, proponents and opponents do not engage with one another, hoping to learn; rather, they try to evangelize, seeking to convince the other side of what they view as universal truths about nuclear energy.

These claims to absolute truth frequently rely on emotion, apocalyptic imagery, rigid logic, and separation of connected facts (what we call “rhetorical fission”) or connection of fragmented facts (what we call “rhetorical fusion”). Those claims are often divorced from the lived experiences—positive and negative—of people affected by nuclear power, whether through the benefits of greater access to reliable electricity and reductions in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions or, on the negative side, through accidents at power plants, the mining of uranium, and the storage of used nuclear fuel.

Here, we argue for a different way of discussing the many issues around the use of nuclear energy to provide electrical power, one that moves beyond rhetorical fission and fusion and acknowledges uncertainty and the place-based nature of the issue. This model asks proponents and opponents to think beyond their identities as advocates and bring previously unheard voices and forms of evidence to a deliberative co-creation of planetary futures.

How the nuclear debate arose

In the United States, the anti-nuclear movement began in the 1950s in response to the testing of nuclear weapons. The United States carried out 1,054 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992, with 210 of these being atmospheric tests.[2] Anti-nuclear protests intensified with an increase in atmospheric weapons tests, particularly after those in the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands led to fallout and widespread but unacknowledged health impacts for local communities.[3]

The Committee for Nonviolent Action (CNVA) was formed in 1957 in response to the US program of nuclear weapons testing. It became the first group to use non-violent methods to oppose nuclear weapons testing, frequently by attempting to enter or entering closed-off nuclear weapons testing sites. In 1957 members attempted to enter the Camp Mercury nuclear testing area near Las Vegas and made another attempt to enter the Eniwetok Proving Grounds in the Marshall Islands in 1958. Years later, CNVA’s attempts to enter these closed-off weapons testing sites would inspire Greenpeace protests.

Members of Greenpeace (who initially called themselves the “Don’t make a wave committee”) sailed to Alaska (on a ship called Greenpeace) in 1971 to stop a second nuclear weapons test on Amchitka Island.[4] Greenpeace’s activism against nuclear weapons testing spread to other countries as well. In France, Greenpeace activist David McTaggart played a central role in halting French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. Greenpeace’s activism, which began with a focus on nuclear weapons, shifted to also focus on the dumping of radioactive waste when, in 1993, a Greenpeace ship documented a Russian navy vessel dumping radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, in violation of the London Convention, an international treaty created to control ocean dumping (McCullagh 1995).

In 1961, a group known as the Women’s Strike for Peace mobilized roughly 50,000 women to march in protest against nuclear weapons in over 60 US cities. This organization began tying nuclear weapons issues to the health and lived experiences of everyday people. They used slogans such as “End the Arms Race—Not the Human Race” and “Pure Milk, Not Poison.”[5] As an organization composed primarily of mothers, the Women’s Strike for Peace was particularly concerned about the health impacts of weapons testing on children. This strategy of connecting anti-nuclear weapons arguments with everyday health and safety issues is one that would hold sway across organizations for some time.

By the 1960s, the nuclear power industry had begun to take off. Light water reactors had emerged as the leading design for the United States, and reactor designers and electric utilities were scaling initial designs for plants capable of generating hundreds of megawatts of electricity. Over this same period, environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club began to raise concerns about nuclear energy.

Although initially pro-nuclear energy, the Sierra Club began to oppose to nuclear energy in the late 1950s, specifically in the form of the Bodega Head nuclear power plant planned by Pacific Gas and Electric for a coastal site in Northern California. This project was ultimately stopped as a result of the club’s opposition and grassroots efforts that cited concerns about the proposed plant’s proximity to the San Andreas fault. At that point, the Sierra Club did not express a blanket disapproval of nuclear power, and the group otherwise supported the use of nuclear energy. But a second nuclear plant project, Diablo Canyon on California’s central coast, which ultimately was built, divided the club, with many, including then-executive director David Brower, believing that the Sierra Club needed to take a more radical stance against nuclear energy (Wellock 1992). (The Club officially adopted an anti-nuclear energy stance in 1974 and extended that stance to include opposition to fusion energy in 1986, though it appears that its stance on fusion is now undergoing reversal).[6]

In 1969, Brower, facing opposition from the Club’s board, left to start a new organization, the Friends of the Earth, which, since its inception, framed opposition to nuclear energy as central to its mission—a stance that continues now. Since its founding, the organization has led campaigns to shut down existing reactors and prevent the construction of new ones. In so doing, it combined lobbying, public education, and direct action to great effect.

Public education efforts initiated by anti-nuclear organizations shared a common feature with similar efforts launched by nuclear proponents: Both assumed a naive public that lacked knowledge about nuclear power, and, with few exceptions, they made universal arguments, framing their stances on nuclear energy as the only possible answer for the technology’s future. See figure 1 below.

By the 1970s, US environmental groups began calling for a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction, with regional groups such as the SHAD (Sound-Hudson Against Atomic Development) Alliance, gathering widespread support in the aftermath of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident. SHAD succeeded in shuttering the Shoreham, New York, nuclear power plant before it even began operation.[7]

Though these efforts did not lead to a nationwide ban on nuclear energy, many states adopted moratoria on building nuclear plants, instituting conditions restricting new nuclear plant construction. California’s 1976 moratorium on nuclear energy, for example, curtailed new nuclear construction until a federal plan for nuclear waste disposal was created. Moratoria passed by Kentucky (1984), Wisconsin (1983), and Illinois (1987) all cited the absence of a federal nuclear waste management plan. Notably, all three states have fully or partially repealed their moratoria to allow new nuclear plant construction, with Illinois’s partial repeal specifically allowing for the construction of advanced and small modular reactors. As of this writing, nine states in the United States still have moratoria on new nuclear energy construction.[8]

Though having US origins, many environmental and anti-nuclear groups had significant influence in other countries. In 1976, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, and 20 other environmental groups came together to form the “Campaign for a Non-Nuclear Future,” which had a goal of opposing the development of nuclear power in New Zealand and promoting the use of renewable energy.

Another organization central to the nuclear debate is the Union of Concerned Scientists. Founded in 1969 by faculty and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the organization combined scientific expertise, activism, and environmentalism. Its founders called for scientific research to be used for environmental preservation, and not the development of military technologies—including nuclear weapons.[9] The UCS would soon also play a role in a key debate about nuclear power.

In many countries, anti-nuclear power movements began as local protests against specific facilities and grew to become national in scope, gaining momentum in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents. In Germany, the anti-nuclear movement began in the 1970s with the opposition to a nuclear power project in the town of Wyhl (Glaser 2012). In France, large-scale protests began in 1971 against plans for the first light-water reactor at Bugey (Tompkins 2016).[10] In Australia, too, protests began in the 1970s against both uranium mining and the proposed Jervis Bay nuclear power plant (Candela 2017). In many European countries, these local movements gained the support of national environmental groups and helped shaped energy policy. These movements led to decisions to phase out nuclear power in Italy, Sweden, Belgium, and Spain. (The implementations of these phase-out plans have varied, and Belgium and Sweden recently reversed their national nuclear phase-out stances.) In the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima accident, Germany embarked on a plan to shutter all of its nuclear power plants.

Over this period of growing opposition, the nuclear industry found some unlikely allies. Inspired by the Atoms for Peace program, astrophysicist Heinz Haber authored “Our Friend the Atom” in 1956. The book, on the benefits of nuclear power, was illustrated by works from more than 20 illustrators from Walt Disney Studios. (Haber was a science consultant to the studios’ founder, Walt Disney). It was also part of a nearly hour-long episode of the television series Disneyland. The book and the episode were an effort to rehabilitate the atom, following the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the ongoing campaigns against nuclear weapons testing. In his writing, Haber acknowledged that the atom had become a “superb villain” but noted also that the power of the atom could be harnessed “for the welfare of all mankind” (Haber 1957). See Figure 2.

The book concluded with three chapters describing the three wishes the atom would grant humanity: power, food and health, and peace. Haber’s book and the Disneyland episode presented a utopian, inevitable vision for nuclear energy, without admitting to the realistic challenges of scaling up nuclear power as an energy source. See Figure 3 below.

In its efforts to promote nuclear power, the nuclear industry looked to researchers for guidance on how to engage with the public. In the late 1960s, emerging research on risk perception asserted that publics were seldom “rational” when weighing the risks of various technologies. Instead, studies found, public perception of risk is largely driven by emotion. The research showed that publics were willing to take on higher levels of risk for voluntary rather than involuntary activities, and that feelings of dread and lack of control heightened sensitivity to risks, leading individuals to focus on a bad outcome instead of the probability that it might occur—a probability that might be vanishingly small (Slovic 2016). One branch of research, led by noted physicist and nuclear expert Chauncey Starr, was rooted in what we know now as the “deficit model,” which suggested that the public’s perception of the riskiness of a technology was rooted in a deficit of knowledge.

Starr suggested that public perceptions of risk could be mediated and managed through better education and advertising (Starr 1969). The nuclear industry ran with these findings, launching campaigns to educate the public about nuclear power. This mode of engagement with the public became the norm and persisted for decades. Arguably, it persists today. In the 1980s, in the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident, several energy utilities banded together to form the US Council for Energy Awareness. In its advertisements, the council, in an effort to win public approval, tied nuclear energy to another salient issue—dependence on foreign oil. See figure 4 below.

Although the proponents and opponents of nuclear energy created separate discourses, seldom admitting to each other’s existence, there is at least one instance of a collaboration between the two that unequivocally led to public good by improving both the design and governance of nuclear energy technologies. In 1972, the US Atomic Energy Commission convened hearings on the design of emergency core cooling systems—a vital safeguard in nuclear reactors. The hearings had been convened following controversy over the AEC’s safety standards. The AEC had been designed with dual conflicting missions—to both regulate and promote nuclear energy. The hearings revealed that these conflicting missions had left the AEC fundamentally compromised, with the developmental arm slowing down or defunding the work of the regulatory arm.

Leading up to and during the two-year period of the hearings, AEC insiders collaborated with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) to uncover suppressed information. The UCS representatives at the hearings, Daniel Ford (an economist) and Myron Cherry (a lawyer) had no formal technical training but were coached by AEC dissenters and nuclear researchers from AEC laboratories. These dissenters supplied suppressed documents and helped the UCS’ representatives prepare their arguments concerning the flawed designs and simulations of emergency core cooling systems.

The hearings ultimately led to the collapse of the AEC and the creation of separate regulatory and developmental agencies. It also led to new safety standards for emergency core cooling systems, which were vital in light of the ongoing scale-up of nuclear energy (Wellock 2012). None of this would have been possible without collaboration across the “anti” and “pro” nuclear camps. Unfortunately, this collaboration marked but a brief détente. But perhaps this unlikely partnership between the AEC dissenters and the UCS activists presents a model of collaboration that we can repurpose for the present.

What the pro- and anti-nuclear debate looks like now

The rhetorical strategies applied by the anti- and pro-nuclear camps exhibit notable similarities. Nuclear opponents, starting with nuclear weapons activists, tended to vilify pro-nuclear individuals and organizations and frame anti-nuclear activists as “moral agents” and defenders of the environment and public health (Blain 1991). The nuclear proponents, on the other hand, have framed and continue to frame narratives of “nuclear necessity and inevitability” (Kinsella 2015). often linking nuclear energy to issues—such as fighting climate change, providing energy access and security, and more recently, powering AI—on which there is more widespread agreement. See Figure 4, above.

Across this history and the recent past, examples of polarized discourse tend to fall into five categories: emotion-driven arguments, apocalyptic imagery, rigid logic, separation of connected facts (rhetorical fission), or strategic combination of nuclear with more palatable issues (rhetorical fusion).

We use the term “rhetorical fission” to refer to arguments in which ideas that are not logically separable are disconnected to advance an argument. For example, claiming that the Fukushima accident is a story of success because there were no radiation-related deaths separates the many disastrous outcomes of the accident from a single fact about radiation. While technically correct, the argument paints an incomplete picture of the event and, to many people, rings untrue. Rhetorical fusion, on the other hand, combines nuclear arguments with other issues as a way to gain public acceptance. For example, advancing an anti-nuclear argument by associating energy with weapons. The argument is a misdirect in regard to the United States, where civilian nuclear power and the military nuclear arsenal have long been explicitly disassociated from one another.

Emotional and apocalyptic arguments tend to emerge from anti-nuclear organizations. The Sierra Club describes itself as being “unequivocally opposed to nuclear energy.” In its statement on nuclear energy, the Sierra Club points to nuclear safety, nuclear proliferation, and the long-term storage of nuclear waste as making “nuclear power a uniquely dangerous energy technology for humanity.”[11] Greenpeace’s statement on nuclear energy asserts that nuclear “has no place in a safe, clean, sustainable future.” The organization describes nuclear energy as both expensive and dangerous and asserts that “just because nuclear pollution is invisible doesn’t mean it’s clean.”[12] In another example, Friends of the Earth describes nuclear as a “slow and costly solution to the climate crisis” and “one that creates harmful waste we have no answer for.”[13]

Nuclear professional and industry organizations—the American Nuclear Society, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Electric Power Research Institute, and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, for example—have long favored the peaceful use of nuclear energy. But recently a newer group of pro-nuclear individuals and organizations not populated by nuclear engineers and industry professionals has emerged. These groups view their support for nuclear energy as central to their identity. And here we see instances of rhetorical fusion, pulling identity politics into nuclear arguments. For example, Mothers for Nuclear, founded in 2016, says that after “many years of questioning and working at California’s last remaining nuclear plant,” the group’s members changed their mind about nuclear and now “support nuclear as our largest and most hopeful source of clean energy, vital to addressing some of our world’s biggest challenges: climate change, air pollution, and energy poverty.”[14] The Breakthrough Institute asserts that advanced nuclear technologies promise “clean, reliable power with strong safety profiles and increasing benefits for energy security, climate, and economic development,” while noting that these benefits “require[s] a regulatory system that is equipped to license modern technologies at scale, and overcoming commercial hurdles.”[15]

More recent pro-nuclear advocacy showcases an amalgam of appeals, combining pieces of nuclear stories with bits of pop culture and science to create persuasive nuclear narratives. Pro-nuclear individuals—self-styled and even described by others as “nuclear influencers”—have gone viral on Instagram and TikTok for their accessible commentary on nuclear energy. One such nuclear influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, describes her work as being “at the intersection of art, science, and activism” and “inspiring humans to solve the world’s problems with optimism.” She created her Isodope persona to “advocate for nuclear electricity as a solution to climate change and energy inequality.”[16] A number of other nuclear influencers who identify as millennials and Gen-Zers have also risen to prominence.

Both proponents and opponents have attempted to find a place in the zeitgeist through film. Two recent examples include the Atomic Bamboozle (a 2023 short anti-nuclear film that was showcased as part of the Sierra Club’s Nuclear-Free film series) and Nuclear Now (a 2022 pro-nuclear documentary film that was screened at several university campuses across the US). See figure at top of page.

Both sides imply that their arguments are meant to be universal. For the anti-nuclear organizations, there is no conceivable time or place in which nuclear energy is desirable. For pro-nuclear proponents and influencers, a world without nuclear energy is inconceivable.

What is notably missing from this debate are the voices of people without a public microphone—and those not ideologically aligned with either debate.

Changing the terms of debate for a better nuclear future

Nuclear debate needs to change, and we propose a strategy that can be applied by those on both sides of the issue. We advocate bringing new voices into the conversation and putting opposing points of view in conversation with one another. Specifically, we propose strategic and widespread community engagement as one way to shift the debate away from the absolutism, high drama, and other unsuccessful strategies described above. We acknowledge that community engagement is not new in nuclear contexts, but neither is it the norm, and to date it has almost always been initiated by experts seeking approval for a nuclear project.

For many years, the nuclear industry has operated on the decide-announce-defend model for siting new facilities. Of course, this approach has been met with much opposition, project delays—and in some well-known cases, like Yucca’s Mountain waste repository, complete rejection. This approach to finding a nuclear waste repository has been largely replaced with consent-based siting, although some argue that securing consent is not enough. Particularly in the fusion energy community, the focus has shifted to securing social license (Hoedl 2022), or ongoing public acceptance, for a project in a given context. Social license is largely established by creating trusted pathways for two-way communication between communities and experts, including opportunities to learn from one another. These are valuable strategies, but, importantly, this model still operates under a rubric of persuasion—experts trying to persuade non-experts to accept and maintain a nuclear energy project.

We are arguing for community engagement as a strategy for listening and learning without intent to persuade. These engagements would be purposely not centered on or initiated because of a proposed facility or siting. Instead, they would focus on co-learning activities, where experts from either side of the nuclear debate share information about nuclear energy, and community members share stories about their community. Nuclear proponents and opponents alike could create “listening committees” in their organizations to build trust, establish communication, and even empower communities to invite nuclear projects into their region, instead of the other way around. Alternatively, communities uninterested in nuclear infrastructure reach such a stance through internal deliberation and make it known to developers. This process can support local decision-making, instead of the current situation, in which context and nuance are sacrificed in efforts to win the debate and decisions become transformed into national movements—as has been the case for both anti- and pro-nuclear efforts.

In our research and teaching on community engagement, we have also found that collaborative “futuring” activities—that is, prompts that invite people to imagine desirable future scenarios—can be a powerful way to unpack differences in perspective and find common ground (Verma, Snyder & Daly 2024). When such a strategy is included in community engagements, we have seen people on both sides of the nuclear debate change their minds and open their minds to ideas they never expected to entertain. We know from history that finding common ground is possible even across the most contentious issues. The unlikely collaboration between the AEC dissenters and the UCS activists described above is one example; we are proposing a model to invite more collaborations in this vein and resolve our long-standing differences for a shared common good.

At the same time, community engagement can give voice to people who have lived with nuclear energy and its impacts, for better and for worse, and those insights may help shift us away from the current, polarizing debate. Residents of Fukushima, Japan, for example, have valuable insight into the real-life risk and opportunity of nuclear power. In our experience in Japan this summer, local residents shared nuanced and unexpected perspectives about living through and beyond the Fukushima Daiichi accident. In many cases, residents expressed gratitude for the power provided by the reactor and for the lessons learned by way of the accident. And while solar panels and wind turbines have replaced nuclear in this area, some hope nuclear energy will return. Other people were, of course, not supportive of nuclear, having witnessed mass displacement, loss of loved ones, and an ongoing decontamination effort with no end in sight. But even those who were not supportive were not waging unreasoned arguments against nuclear energy. At the end of our conversations, community members across perspectives shared an outdoor picnic, knowing that Fukushima’s energy future is uncertain, but also that community perspectives are part of the decision-making conversation.

We acknowledge that many organizations may disregard our proposal on the basis of time, cost, or efficiency. Ultimately, the polarizing debate around nuclear energy is obscuring a simple fact: Our shared energy future is uncertain. Arguing more loudly or aggressively is not going to change that situation. A willingness to bring in new perspectives, consider opposing ideas, and embrace uncertainty may be the fastest way toward the clean, safe energy future we all envision.

The auction, which ended with $279.4 million in high bids, was the first of 30 ‍mandated by U.S. President Donald Trump's ​tax cut and spending bill, which he signed into law in July.

His administration's plans for offshore ​leasing are a ⁠significant departure from that of his predecessor, President Joe Biden, which had planned for a historically small number of oil and gas auctions as part of an effort to move away from fossil fuels and address climate change.

""We're entering a new era of offshore American energy dominance,"" Matt Giacona, ‌acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said at the start of ​the ‌auction, which was broadcast online.

BOEM ‍said 30 companies ⁠submitted a total of 219 bids on 1.02 million acres, about 1.3% of the acreage offered.

BP was the most frequent bidder, according to sale documents, followed by Chevron and Shell. Other top bidders included Anadarko, LLOG Exploration Offshore, Talos Energy and Murphy Exploration & Production.

The auction's highest bid was nearly $18.6 million, from Chevron, for a block in the Keithley Canyon deepwater area. The second highest was a joint bid of $15.2 million from Woodside ​Energy Deepwater and Repsol for a block in the Walker Ridge area.

BOEM, an arm of the Interior Department, offered 81.2 million acres in the Gulf at a royalty rate of 12.5%, the lowest permitted by Trump's new tax law. Previously, as mandated by Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, oil companies were required to pay a minimum of 16.66% in royalties to the U.S. Treasury, states and other federal funds.

Trump's law lowered the rate to encourage industry participation in lease sales. U.S. crude oil prices are down about 20% this year, which can limit investment by drillers, though technological innovations in deep-sea drilling are ​expected to help boost Gulf production.

Offshore production accounts for about 15% of U.S. output, but has lagged onshore shale fields in recent years because of longer timelines and higher upfront costs.

The last Gulf sale in 2023 attracted 352 bids by 26 companies covering 1.73 ​million acres. It raised $382 million, the highest of any federal offshore lease sale since 2015.

This work is part of a larger story—one we celebrated at our recent Legacy Luncheon, themed “Where Community Meets the Current.” As we reflected with donors, supporters, and friends, the impact we make along the river is only possible because our community shows up again and again to move this work forward.

Every dollar raised through events like the Legacy Luncheon helps support programs that bring our four pillars — Arts & Culture, Ecology, Education, and Recreation — to life. From seed libraries to artist-led activations, from hands-on learning to outdoor public spaces that welcome everyone, these pillars guide our mission to create a river that belongs to all.

Seed Series: Get Hands-On With Native Seeds

Every second Wednesday this fall, we hosted our ongoing Seed Series. This family-friendly gathering invited the community to label, sort, and package native seeds for the Confluence Park Seed Library. Guided by our dedicated River Warrior Docent, Brooke Adams, participants learned about native plants, biodiversity, and the crucial role seeds play in sustaining the ecosystems along our river. The Native Plant Society of Texas—San Antonio Chapter and the Alamo Area Master Naturalists support this work.

Stay tuned for more ways to get involved when we re-sprout our Spring Seed Series in 2026!

Kill Your Lawn – On Tour makes a visit to Confluence Park

Last month, we hosted a packed event with the Kill Your Lawn – On Tour, featuring Joey Santore, the creator behind Crime Pays But Botany Doesn’t. The inspiring presentation encouraged the community to rethink traditional lawns and explore native plants as living infrastructure—plants that evolved exactly for this place, supporting the wildlife and soils that have been here long before us.

Participants learned about:

The ecological cost of turfgrass

How native plants conserve water and build healthier soils

The wild, beautiful life that emerges when we let nature lead

It was an incredible turnout and full of inspired conversations. Stay tuned—more opportunities to learn, rethink landscapes, and engage with local ecology are on the way.

Growing a More Resilient River Community

Whether you’re sorting seeds, attending a talk, exploring Confluence Park, or visiting the Seed Library, every moment of engagement helps deepen our collective commitment to the health of the San Antonio River. Together, we’re nurturing a future where native plants thrive, wildlife flourishes, and communities feel connected to the natural world around them. Let’s keep growing—one seed, one event, one conversation at a time.

But it was still some time before I began to appreciate the human impacts of climate change, and how people contribute to the problem.
That summer, Jamie and I convened students in the Princeton program to discuss the threat of climate change and plan a youth climate march to demand policy action.
We need a cacophony of voices calling for an end to fossil fuels and for the emergence of thriving communities.","Eighty years after the founding of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and 55 years after the first Earth Day, humanity faces a growing profusion of existential threats. Most people—including politicians, business executives, and the financial institutions responsible for continued reliance on fossil fuels—know that climate change is a problem, and that it’s caused by human activities. But global leaders are floundering at the helm, and an informed populace hasn’t risen to the challenge.

Despite the deluge of information about impending climate catastrophe, climate scientists and environmental activists have failed to move enough people to action. As the co-founder of a youth organization advocating for climate justice—now working on fossil fuel policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council—I wish I knew why, given we have the solutions to transition our energy system. The youth climate strikes (as epitomized by activists such as Greta Thunberg) have lost steam, hard-won environmental policies are being overturned by every branch of our federal government, and 100-year climate disasters have become an annual occurrence. Apathy persists. If we knew why people turn a blind eye to the deterioration of the natural world around them, perhaps humanity wouldn’t be facing down doomsday. Nonetheless, it’s time to think more creatively about how to avert the worst of the climate crisis.

I’m 25 years old and a member of Gen-Z. Long before I was born, the scientific community (and the oil and gas industry) knew with confidence that the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causes human-induced climate change (Artis 2024). This fact was communicated to global leaders and the public, most famously by James Hansen in testimony before Congress in 1986 (Hansen 1986). Yet, here we are, forced to endure the consequences of past indecision and inaction.

Growing up in Connecticut, I lived through back-to-back hurricanes Irene and Sandy in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Hurricane Sandy was one of the costliest storms in US history, and scientists have estimated that approximately $8.1 billion of Sandy’s damages were attributable to sea level rise caused by anthropogenic climate change (Strauss 2021). Of course, as a child, I didn’t think anything about climate change. I enjoyed the days off from school and the novelty of playing games by candle and lamp-light while rain crashed from the sky overhead. “Global warming” as I knew it was still a distant problem. On frequent visits to the Mystic Aquarium, home to several beluga whales, I learned about habitat loss and the threat a warming planet poses to Arctic species. At the beach near my childhood home, I learned about sea level rise and plastic pollution threatening our coastline along Long Island Sound. But it was still some time before I began to appreciate the human impacts of climate change, and how people contribute to the problem.

In the summer of 2017, I met Jamie Margolin at a summer program for high schoolers at Princeton University. Before arriving in New Jersey, wildfires in California and Canada had blanketed her hometown of Seattle, Washington, in a cloud of smoke and ash. She was the first person that I remember drawing a causal link between political support for oil and gas, and the impacts of so-called natural disasters that she was experiencing. After meeting Jamie, I recognized that climate change was not an unstoppable force of nature, but rather a political outcome that all of us can affect.

That summer, Jamie and I convened students in the Princeton program to discuss the threat of climate change and plan a youth climate march to demand policy action. This eventually led us to found Zero Hour, a global youth-led climate justice organization advocating to end the era of fossil fuels. Much like the idea behind the Doomsday Clock, we chose the name Zero Hour to convey a sense of urgency: that we were out of time to delay action on climate change any further. In fact, it was through these early organizing efforts that I first learned about the Doomsday Clock and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; Arielle Martinez-Cohen, another organizer, let us use her song, “Two Minutes to Midnight,” for the video of Zero Hour’s Youth Climate March in Washington, DC (Martinez-Cohen 2018).

Since then, the Doomsday Clock has continued to tick, tick away, and it is now at 89 seconds to midnight.

These youth climate marches, led by Zero Hour organizers on every continent, helped to ignite a youth-led movement for climate justice. We were mobilizing our peers for the first time—a generation that was coming to terms with the fact that they’d experienced climate change their whole lives without anything being done about it from the people in power. In 2019, we helped to lead some of the biggest climate strikes in the United States, and welcomed Greta Thunberg to the United States to join us. We didn’t wait for approval, and didn’t care that so many people, even in the environmental movement, thought that we didn’t have the experience or education to lead a movement. We did it anyway, and we forged an intergenerational movement in the process.

It is time for the environmental movement to take risks and shake things up again. It’s time to build up the youngest generations of people to organize for climate justice again, and the Bulletin can help do that. Zero Hour made its mark on the world when Instagram was still being used to share selfies and candid shots—entirely unlike the manicured, influencer-heavy, ad-driven behemoth that the platform has become. Social media was our digital playground, and it’s a major reason why Zero Hour and other youth climate organizations have mobilized as many people as we have. Over the past several years, the media environment has continued to change—short-form videos now dominate social media and 54 percent of people get at least some of their news from these platforms (Pew Research 2025). Like the risks conveyed by the Doomsday Clock, attention is now counted in seconds, not minutes.

Social media has democratized the spread of information—today, any strong communicator can gain an avid audience—but it has also increased the challenge of communicating about complex, evidence-based topics like climate change. Like so many other young people, I often scroll on social media for entertainment and distraction, not to seek out news or ways to take action. In an era where there are limitless flows of content competing for the public’s attention, the climate movement needs to spark excitement instead of dread to capture the attention of people inundated with information. Where facts and science have failed, storytelling that evokes an emotional response may still succeed. The Bulletin can, and should, embrace this new horizon of social media to inform and activate Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha again.

In today’s political climate, strongly-held, ill-informed opinions trump facts, science, and expertise—any headline featuring RFK Jr. could tell you that. But when it comes to climate change, the science is settled: Greenhouse gas emissions, which have dramatically increased because of human activities, are causing the Earth to warm, and making the planet a far more dangerous and unpredictable place for human life.

When I joined the fight to end the era of fossil fuels, I presumed that when people know better, they do better. That belief—that climate education for the masses will lead to transformational shifts in our energy system and ways of living—is still widely held across the environmental movement. Yet, climate projections, models, and warnings from the world’s leading scientists urging policymakers to adopt policies to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius have been unsuccessful at convincing policy makers or the public to aggressively fight to end the era of fossil fuels. Enough about carbon reduction, it’s time to rally people around a transformation of our societies beyond just addressing emissions.

The Green New Deal is one ambitious proposal that does that. This is the kind of societal transformation that people deserve, and it leaves room to imagine what achieving it looks like wherever you live. A Green New Deal means environmental justice for everyone living in the colossal shadow of the oil and gas industry, but it also calls for universal healthcare, universal access to well-resourced and high-quality education, and a guarantee of good-paying union jobs. Adoption of a Green New Deal means winning the fight against climate change by doing more than meeting the bare minimum needs of the population. It is a vision for the future that humanity can thrive in, rather than getting by on scraps from the oligarchy. A Green New Deal is rooted in justice, and whether you live in remote Alaska, rural Alabama, or coastal Connecticut, the Green New Deal can be what it needs to be for your community.

When the Green New Deal rose to national prominence, right-wing politicians backed by corporate political action committees spent billions branding it as a radical socialist scam (Downie 2023). Vocal proponents in Congress, and even civil society advocates, have recently shied away from demanding a Green New Deal because it’s been bludgeoned in the court of public opinion by conservative media, trade groups like the American Petroleum Institute, and politicians like Donald Trump, who demonizes it as the “Green New Scam” (Thompson 2025). But while the Green New Deal has evoked the ire of corporations and the political elite, people across the political spectrum like the policy proposals at their core (Adcox 2024).

When the business-as-usual—or business-but-worse—policies of the current administration fail to deliver an affordable and safe future for all Americans, then climate and environmental activists, scientists, and well-informed politicians should have an ambitious and appealing alternative to offer them. The Green New Deal remains that alternative, even if it needs new framing for mass appeal. For too long, the climate movement has been plagued by a lack of imagination for a world beyond fossil fuels, and the mainstream environmental movement has failed to communicate the importance of dismantling the systems of oppression that have enabled the exploitation of people and nature for profit for hundreds of years. As a movement, we are reacting to every attack on the environment and public health coming out of the government, but this reactivity is why we’re struggling to build a movement with a long-term vision post-exploitation of nature and people.

We need more scientists, more business leaders, more journalists—more people everywhere—to step up and call for systemic changes to the way our society exists. We need a cacophony of voices calling for an end to fossil fuels and for the emergence of thriving communities. On its eightieth anniversary, I hope these words inspire the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to be a part of that cacophony of voices calling for radical transformation of our communities from leaders in power, and urge the public to demand their leaders achieve that transformation.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jan24-intro.png.webp,N,,2025-12-10 18:01:00.466343

[RUSH TWP, CENTRE COUNTY] – In a 2-1 vote on Tuesday evening, the Rush Township Supervisors in Centre County, Pennsylvania approved the pending permit for the renewable energy project known as Black Moshannon Solar.

The proposed solar project would generate 265 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 200,000 homes annually. At the same time, the project is being heralded for utilizing nearly 2,000 acres of toxic mineland, reclaiming otherwise unusable land, and including mineland clean-up as part of the project’s development. The project’s developers have committed to introducing pollinators and pollinator-friendly ground cover beneath the solar arrays, conducting water quality and soil studies throughout development and operations, and taking steps to enhance the soil by using lime to neutralize mining contamination and encourage vegetation to grow on the site.

The Black Moshannon Solar project is also expected to provide more than $5 million in tax revenue to support the Phillipsburg-Osceola Area School District and more than $700,000 in direct tax payments to Centre County.

In response to the approval of the permit proposal by Rush Township, statewide environmental group leaders and nonprofit clean energy advocates release the following statements:

“The bipartisan group of Rush Township Supervisors who got this proposal over the finish line should pat themselves on the back for this groundbreaking project,” stated David Masur, Executive Director for the statewide nonprofit organization PennEnvironment. “We are hopeful that other local government officials across Pennsylvania will follow Rush Township’s lead and implement similar, much-needed solar projects all across the Keystone State.”

“The Rush Township Supervisors are establishing productive farmland and sustainable energy infrastructure for future generations,” noted Jim Gregory, Executive Director, Conservative Energy Network-Pennsylvania. “In forty years, their forward-thinking decisions will be recognized as catalysts for environmental protection, public health improvements, and economic prosperity. The Conservative Energy Network-Pennsylvania commends their responsible leadership and dedication to the community’s long-term well-being.”

“The Black Moshannon Solar project is a perfect example of how renewable energy, natural resource conservation, and community benefits can align. This truly is a win-win-win for the community,” stated Nate Reagle, the Sierra Club Pennsylvania Chapter’s Clean Energy Program Advocate.

“As veterans, we understand what it means to serve something greater than ourselves,” said Moises Montalvo, Pennsylvania Lead Organizer for Veterans Power America. “Projects like Black Moshannon Solar give us a chance to continue that service—by strengthening our nation’s energy security, creating jobs for working families, and leaving behind a cleaner, safer country for future generations.”

“Approval of the Black Moshannon Solar project is a victory for the people of Rush Township, a victory for clean energy, and a victory for a sustainable economy,” stated Tom Pike, Clean Air Council Director of Campaigns. “This is the kind of forward-thinking work that communities across the Commonwealth should be looking to replicate.”

“This project is a powerful example of how local communities and elected officials are coming together to embrace solar energy. By redeveloping polluted lands for clean energy production, we can transform environmental liabilities into long-term economic and environmental assets, all while helping to lower rising energy costs for Pennsylvanians. It’s a no-brainer, and we hope other communities across the commonwealth will join in realizing the firsthand benefits of going solar,” said Abby Jones, Vice President of Legal & Policy at PennFuture.

The goal of the project is decarbonizing and reducing the mill's reliance on natural gas, said Irene Preto, the general manager of Kruger Kamloops Pulp.

The construction of the 10-megawatt facility, called the Kamloops Clean Energy Centre, is a collaborative effort between the Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc Nation, Elemental Clean Fuels and Kruger Kamloops Pulp.

On Dec. 8, Sc.wén̓wen , the economic division of the nation, announced the novel project.

The project prompted questions over why a pulp mill is choosing to produce hydrogen, and how it will be done. Here's what you need to know.

Why does a pulp mill want to produce hydrogen?

The Kruger Pulp Mill makes paper and pulp products using wood.

A part of its manufacturing process, the lime kiln, is particularly energy-intensive and requires a lot of heat — which is currently derived from burning natural gas.

""To be able to decarbonize the natural gas out of our lime kiln is a really big step forward towards our goal of becoming more renewable,"" said Preto.

The mill plans to replace 16 per cent of the natural gas used in the lime kiln with hydrogen.

When hydrogen is burned, rather than creating carbon dioxide, it creates water and heat.

Why hydrogen?

When hydrogen atoms are isolated, they can store and transport a lot of energy, similar to other energy-rich products like natural gas.

Hydrogen atoms are reactive, meaning they usually like to be combined with other atoms to form molecules — unless a lot of energy is present.

How is hydrogen energy produced?

Production is done in two ways: either by separating hydrogen from a carbon-rich molecule like methane (CH4), or from water (H2O).

But when carbon-containing molecules like coal or methane are burned for hydrogen production, carbon dioxide is released as a byproduct, leading to greenhouse gas emissions.

Some facilities capture and store the released carbon dioxide to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.

Alternatively, a process called electrolysis — which will be used by Kruger — uses electricity to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

Preto says the resulting oxygen atoms will be used to strengthen the pulp the mill produces.

When the electricity for electrolysis comes from a renewable source, like wind or hydroelectric dams, the product is called green hydrogen.

Where is the electricity for electrolysis coming from?

The electricity comes from the B.C. Hydro grid — but it is actually produced at the pulp mill from wood byproducts.

Wood byproducts are burned to create steam, which then turns a turbine and generates electricity.

The process is called biomass cogeneration, and the mill subsequently sells the resulting electricity to B.C. Hydro, part of which will be used for electrolysis.

Why replace natural gas?

Zachary Steele, the CEO of Elemental Green Fuels — the developer of the project — said in this case, replacing natural gas combustion with green hydrogen will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

“We're going to reduce the emissions by 7,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. That's the equivalent of taking 1,200 to 1,500 vehicles off the road,” he said.

Steele said simply using electricity from B.C. Hydro to power the kiln is not feasible, because it would require so much power it would stress the grid.

When will it be built?

Kruger received funding for the project from Natural Resources Canada through an Indigenous clean energy fund.

“The Kamloops Clean Energy Centre reflects our commitment to sustainability, economic self-determination, and highlights our leadership in advancing innovative, local clean energy solutions,"" said Kúkwpi7 (Chief) Rosanne Casimir of Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc.

The project is still being designed, and is a ways off from being operational.

Steele said the final investment decision is expected sometime in 2026, with construction beginning after that.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/cb146cc8-d2b2-4cfb-a406-12d2a14cbd12,1765250107245/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C76%2C1400%2C787%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-10 15:01:06.017295

House Republicans are implementing President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda, restoring our fighting force to greatness, deterring our adversaries, and ensuring our national security. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2026 codifies all or parts of 15 of President Trump’s Executive Orders and over 30 legislative provisions requested by the Administration.

This FY26 NDAA specifically focuses on reforming our broken acquisition system. Our current system is slow, inefficient, and doesn’t meet the needs of our warfighters – threatening our security and keeping us stuck in the past. The FY26 NDAA includes many of the critical reforms proposed in the Streamlining Procurement for Effective Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act including by reducing burdensome red tape to streamline the delivery and development of new capabilities that our warfighters desperately need. It establishes the BOOST program to align promising technologies with operational needs, removes regulatory burdens, and speeds up the requirements process for defense acquisition.

The legislation also prioritizes improvements to our servicemembers’ quality of life. To ensure our warfighters are supported, the legislation includes a 3.8 percent pay raise for all servicemembers, widens access to health care and childcare, and improves servicemember housing.

Additionally, the bill works to counter adversaries such as China and enhance U.S. posture in the Indo-Pacific region, strengthen nuclear deterrence and missile defense, and fund Trump priorities such as the Golden Dome, F-47, autonomous systems, and new warships. The bill also fully funds the deployment of troops to the border and authorizes over $1 billion to combat drug traffickers.

While investing in innovation and streamlining development to ensure our fighting force remains the strongest in the world, the FY26 NDAA also cuts woke programs to keep our Armed Forces focused on their core mission: keeping our nation safe. Our legislation cuts DEI programs, restores meritocracy, and ends ‘Green New Scam’ initiatives, and saves taxpayers nearly $20 billion.

As threats to our national security grow more complex, we must make certain our fighting force is ready to meet the challenge, and that means delivering the capabilities our warfighters need when they need them. This legislation does just that.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers' legislation, H. Amdt. to S. 1071, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026, strengthens our national defense and the lethality of our fighting force by reforming defense acquisition, improving servicemember quality of life, investing in top defense priorities such as the Golden Dome, securing our border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, supporting our allies, and cutting wasteful spending and radical Left initiatives from our military.

House Republicans are committed to implementing President Trump’s Peace Through Strength agenda and ensuring our fighting force is capable and ready to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.

Ensuring Energy Reliability and Affordability

Electricity demand in the United States is increasing rapidly due to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the data centers that power it, domestic manufacturing, and electrification of sectors across the economy. North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) projects peak demand will grow by 151 GW by 2034.

However, while demand has been rising, so have premature retirements of crucial baseload power plants due to Democrats’ overly burdensome federal environmental regulations and energy policies implemented over the last several years. NERC reports that around 115 GW of thermal generation has announced to retire by 2034, reducing our electricity generating capabilities at a time when we need it most and further threatening our nation’s supply of reliable energy.

Many Democrat-led states have pushed for wind or solar energy by imposing “green” standards that shut down baseload power plants, despite wind and solar lacking the reliability, consistency, voltage, and frequency support needed to keep the lights on when we need it most. A recent Department of Energy report found that our projected demands for electricity, when paired with the projected retirements of baseload generating units, could potentially increase the threat of power outages by 100 times by 2030.

A lack of energy and energy reliability leads to higher costs for American households. Today, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to make sure states are planning electric generation facilities in a way that increases reliability and affordability of energy for hardworking Americans.

Rep. Gabe Evans' legislation, H.R. 3628, the State Planning for Reliability & Affordability Act, amends the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to create a new federal standard for state regulatory authorities to consider requirements for utilities to have reliable and sufficient generation from dispatchable energy sources as part of their resource plans over a 10-year period.

Part II – Strategic Responses: Building the Automotive Talent Pipeline Higher salaries alone will not solve the human capital challenge in the automotive sector.
Below are talent development and attraction strategies that some automotive companies have started using and have seen success with.
In many ways, the automotive talent war mirrors the historical labor battles of the industry’s early days, when production lines reshaped manufacturing employment.
Automotive Manufacturing Competitiveness – Strategic Levers to Transform Supplier Capabilities (last visited Nov. 30, 2025), https://www.adlittle.com/sites/default/files/2025-11/ADL%20US%20automotive%20manufacturing%202025.pdf.","For over a century, the automotive sector was defined by mechanical engineering, fabrication, and assembly line mastery. But today, the industry is undergoing a technological transformation so profound it is rewriting the DNA of car manufacturing. The shift toward electric vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving, and AI-enabled and other technology driven systems has turned automakers and suppliers into competitors in a new kind of battleground — one for highly skilled technology talent.

While robotics and automation have long been present on the assembly floor, the integration of complex software systems, machine learning algorithms, and AI-driven quality control has raised the stakes. Car companies are no longer just competing with one another; they are vying against Silicon Valley giants, AI startups, and tech-forward industries that already have pipelines for rare digital and technical expertise. For OEMs and suppliers, the race is not just about building the car of the future, it is about finding the people who can make that future possible.

Part I – Why Automotive Companies Can’t Fill Their Technical Roles

Despite the perception of abundant college graduates, the reality is a mismatch: there are not enough candidates with the specific skills the automotive industry requires at this moment. According to a survey report by Arthur D. Little and MEMA, “labor is the binding constraint on U.S. manufacturing viability and a competitive disadvantage.”[1]

Over the past few decades, a societal push toward four-year degrees has inadvertently reduced the volume of skilled trade workers entering the workforce. This makes it exceedingly difficult for automakers to fill crucial hourly production jobs. Historically, these roles were feeder positions into manufacturing careers, but fewer workers are prepared, or willing, to take them. The result is a shortage of the very people needed to operate advanced manufacturing lines.

More challenging still is the skills gap in automation, technology advancements, and AI. In modern automotive plants, AI systems aid in predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization, and quality inspection. However, these systems do not run themselves—they require a workforce trained not only in programming but in data analytics and machine learning applications unique to automotive environments. For example, a recent manufacturing study conducted by Deloitte Consulting LLP and the Manufacturing Institute (the “Study”) indicates that there has been a 75% increase in demand for simulation and simulation software skills over the past five years. But many of these competencies are far more common in technology hubs like San Francisco or Austin than in traditional manufacturing regions, leading OEMs and suppliers to compete for talent with tech giants whose compensation packages and work environments set high expectations.

This has created a secondary bottleneck: the engineers, data scientists, and AI specialists needed for autonomous vehicle development are scarce. According to the Study, the skills gap and shortage of qualified applicants could lead to over 1.9 million manufacturing jobs going unfilled within the next decade. Without sufficient workforce to fuel innovation, the industry risks slowing its trajectory toward the future it has already promised consumers.

Part II – Strategic Responses: Building the Automotive Talent Pipeline

Higher salaries alone will not solve the human capital challenge in the automotive sector. Companies need to reinvent how they attract, train, and retain people—starting far earlier in the career lifecycle. Below are talent development and attraction strategies that some automotive companies have started using and have seen success with.

1. Start Early: Build the Talent Pipeline in High School

Recruiting highly skilled technology talent can no longer begin after candidates enter the job market; hiring efforts must start by inspiring career interest in this specialized area at the formative stage. In other key manufacturing-driven economies, this student-to-employee pipeline is formalized. Specifically, Germany adopted the “Verbundausbildung model, where businesses collectively take responsibility for training the next generation of apprentices.”[2] Japan, Korea, Mexico, and China have similar programs in which industry is involved in the pre-hire training process. Id. In the U.S., where such a structured training pipeline does not exist, automotive companies may find success by engaging directly with high schools and community colleges — not just through job fairs but by hosting STEM-focused workshops, plant tours, and interactive demonstrations of how automation and AI function in the modern car-making process. These activities demystify highly technical roles and make them aspirational for young students.

2. Meet Gen Z Where They Are

Today’s emerging workforce lives and networks online, meaning recruitment strategies need to leverage the same platforms they use to learn, socialize, and job hunt. Social media campaigns showcasing a company’s technology, sustainability efforts, and career opportunities can spark interest among digital natives. Video content highlighting cutting-edge EV projects or autonomous-driving labs can convey both the skillsets needed and the excitement behind the work.

3. Offer More Than Paychecks—Sell the Culture and the Lifestyle

Recruitment has shifted from a purely financial transaction to one in which intangible benefits matter greatly, particularly among the next generation of workers. Potential employees, especially younger ones, want to know about company culture, career growth opportunities, and the lifestyle they can enjoy outside of work. For example, some Michigan employers have tailored talent recruitment efforts to market the “Pure Michigan” lifestyle — including proximity to lakes, recreational activities, and the growing cosmopolitan appeal of Detroit. By aligning talent attraction with local identity and quality of life, companies can differentiate themselves from geographically scattered competitors.

4. Partner With Community Organizations for Recruiting and Training

Local trade organizations, workforce agencies, and school placement teams are untapped assets for many OEMs and suppliers. These partnerships can provide access to pools of potential candidates and allow for collaborative training initiatives. For instance, community colleges and technical education centers could run co-designed certificate programs in EV systems diagnostics or industrial AI, creating ready-made talent streams that feed into local manufacturing roles.

5. Increase Hiring and Retention Through Internships and Mentorships

One overlooked aspect of talent strategy is ensuring that recruitment and hiring efforts have a lasting impact. This means closely analyzing the effectiveness of programs aimed at increasing conversion rates of internships and apprenticeships into full-time positions. It also entails building mentorship programs that give new and prospective employees a sense of connection and clear growth paths within a company, which can help develop loyalty and establish long-term career trajectories. Fostering loyalty, career advancement, and a sense of belonging at a company are critical and may be the deciding factor for wavering candidates and employees, as businesses compete against each other and may try to lure workers with lucrative offers.

6. Consult with Counsel Regarding Talent Acquisition and the Use of AI in Recruiting

Companies benefit from consulting with legal counsel on methods for identifying candidates with highly technical skillsets and AI expertise, and on structuring total compensation packages that are likely to attract and retain highly sought-after talent. Counsel are well-positioned to offer best practices and/or training about the use of AI in hiring practices. Companies should be mindful of the legal risks associated with using AI in the recruiting and hiring process, including the risk of unintended discrimination from third-party AI screening tools, which may expose them to liability under federal and state laws.

Securing the Sector’s Future

The automotive industry sits at a turning point. EV adoption and autonomous driving are no longer distant possibilities; they are active engineering and manufacturing challenges unfolding in real time. Success in this era will be determined by the ability of OEMs and suppliers to secure and cultivate a workforce fluent in both hardware and software, capable of bridging traditional mechanical know-how with next-generation digital capabilities.

This means reframing the definition of “automotive worker” to encompass AI specialists, data analysts, robotics programmers, software engineers, high-tech maintenance technicians, and cybersecurity experts — roles previously associated with technology firms rather than assembly plants. And it calls for an evolution in education strategy: not just waiting for universities to produce graduates, but directly shaping curricula, influencing career ambitions, and offering training that is specific to automotive technology.

In many ways, the automotive talent war mirrors the historical labor battles of the industry’s early days, when production lines reshaped manufacturing employment. Today, that battle is fought not over the physical assembly line, but over digital innovation, machine intelligence, and the minds capable of bringing these systems to life.

The companies that win will be those that start early, think creatively about recruitment, and treat talent development as a core strategic priority — not a secondary HR task. In an industry as competitive and fast-moving as automotive, the true horsepower remains human.

The order aimed to prevent any of the Outer Continental Shelf, including the entire coastline of the mainland U.S. and Alaska, from being leased for offshore wind development indefinitely until the president decides to lift the restrictions.

Additionally, the order calls for an immediate review of the federal leasing process for both offshore and onshore wind development, which will consider the potential downsides, including “negative impacts on navigational safety interests, transportation interests, national security interests, commercial interests, and marine mammals.”

The order suggested that current studies showing an environmental benefit from the turbines may be insufficient and requests new studies to assess the various impacts on the environment, economy, and energy grid.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a ruling Monday vacating the order, arguing that the move was unlawful, siding with a coalition of state Attorneys General, including Aaron Frey of Maine.

Attorney General Frey shared a statement Tuesday applauding the decision.

“Mainers care about protecting our environment,” he wrote. “Whatever the federal Administration’s position is on wind power, it does not have the right to arbitrarily ban development of this sustainable energy resource.”

“I am gratified that the Court agreed that the Administration had once again, overstepped,” said Frey. “My colleagues and I will continue to hold Trump accountable to the law.”

The White House has stood by its energy policy positions, reasserting that their stance has proven to be beneficial for America.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

While the states bringing this case allege that the President does not have the authority to pause project permitting, the federal government has argued that the states’ claims represent nothing but a policy disagreement that ought to be settled outside of the courts.

These affordability concerns are well-founded. Federal data show U.S. electricity prices increased by 27% from January 2021 through January 2025 and by an additional 11% from January through September 2025, placing additional strain on Americans’ finances.

Electricity prices are especially high in traditionally liberal areas of the country. In total, 86% of states with electricity prices above the national average in the continental U.S. are reliably blue, having voted for the Democratic nominee for president in the 2020 and 2024 elections.3 In contrast, 80% of the 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red, defined as having voted for the Republican candidate in these contests.

Expensive Electricity Is A Choice: How States Shape Electricity

The data is clear: bluer states tend to have much higher electricity prices than red states.

More than almost any other product, electricity prices are a direct result of state energy policies because states have the exclusive power to decide which resources supply their grids.

Under the Federal Power Act (FPA), Congress preserved expansive state powers to regulate the electricity generated and sold within their borders. These powers allow states to determine their generation portfolios, site and permit power generation facilities outside nuclear and hydroelectric plants, regulate retail prices, and exercise authority over resource adequacy and reliability, meaning states are charged with ensuring that utilities, and electric cooperatives, often referred to as load serving entities (LSEs), maintain adequate power plant capacity to keep the lights on.

States can also enact energy policies requiring a certain percentage of retail electricity sales in the state to come from renewable generation under a renewable portfolio standard (RPS), or can set energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) or clean energy standards (CES).

The broad authority of states to determine their generation portfolios, set retail electricity prices, and establish mandates for wind and solar generators under the FPA has led to a diversity of policies that ultimately determine the price of electricity for families and businesses in the United States.

For example, Figure 1 shows the average all-sectors electricity price for each state from January 2025 through August 2025. In total, 86% of states with electricity prices above the national average of 13.54 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in the continental U.S. are reliably blue, having voted for President Biden in 2020 and Vice President Harris in 2024 (see Table 1 in the Appendix).

According to Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, each of the top five most expensive states for electricity have mandates requiring 100% of their power to come from renewable or carbon-free sources, making their electricity unnecessarily more expensive. These, and other mandates, such as net metering requirements, are driving up prices across America (see Figure 2).

In contrast, eight out of 10 states with the lowest electricity prices are reliably red, and seven of these states have no 100% carbon-free mandates. Additionally, 20 of 25 states with the lowest electricity prices are Red states; only four are blue, and one is purple (see Table 1, Appendix).

State Spotlights

Each state’s energy mix and regulatory structure is unique. The state spotlights below highlight how policies enacted in state legislatures impact the cost of electricity for their constituents.

New York

Federal data show New York’s electricity prices were 58% higher than the national average and 62% higher than Florida’s, based on the average all-sectors rate from January 2025 to August 2025.

Furthermore, a study from the left-leaning Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) found New York has experienced some of the fastest increases in electricity prices in the country. Retail electricity prices for residential customers increased by 36% between 2019 and 2024, nearly three times faster than the national average and the second-fastest increase in the country during this period, after California. PPI determined that electricity is expensive in New York due to a wide range of factors, but the report clearly explains: “The convergence of shrinking supply and rising demand inevitably leads to upward price pressures for consumers. These costs are compounded by the immense capital investment required to transform the grid and specific policy choices that increase the cost of energy production [emphasis added].”

For example, New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) constitutes a massive renewable energy mandate, requiring the state to produce 70% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 100% by 2040, which will require substantial capital investments financed by ratepayers.

At the same time, the state’s firm capacity is being diminished by the premature closure of the Indian Point nuclear power plant, the state’s decision to deny the expansion of needed natural gas pipelines, and the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s decision to block a number of necessary upgrades for natural gas power plants, which the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) warns could cause an increased risk of power shortages over the next five years.

Prices are also rising in response to state policies mandating the electrification of buildings and transportation, which are straining New York’s already overburdened grid and necessitating additional infrastructure buildouts. The state also suffers from natural gas supply issues due to its decision to ban hydraulic fracturing. In addition, ratepayers effectively pay a tax on carbon dioxide emissions as part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The expenses associated with these policies are projected to be so large that New York Governor Kathy Hochul delayed implementing the state’s capand-tax mandates under the 2019 climate law. The state claimed the regulations would be “infeasible” because they would impose “extraordinary and damaging costs upon New Yorkers.” The Governor has approved two natural gas pipelines as part of a rumored deal with the Trump administration to approve offshore wind facilities.

These policy reversals beg the question: If Democratic policies make energy so affordable, why are they backtracking from them?

California

California’s electricity rates are the second-highest in the nation. Rates are double the national average. Governor Newsom and California’s state legislature have embraced numerous policies that intentionally increase electricity rates, including a carbon dioxide reduction mandate, renewable mandates, solar cost-shifting (net metering), nuclear reactor closures, and EV charging subsidies, to name a few. Instead of trying to expand electricity generation to meet the energy needs of Californians, California is second in the country in electricity imports, as it embeds policy goals in electric rates to drive social policy. This is a toxic mix for California’s ratepayers.

California is second in the nation in total electricity generation from renewable resources and leads the country in utility-scale solar generating capacity. California’s generation mix is 42% natural gas, 39% non-hydroelectric renewables, 12% hydroelectric, and 7% nuclear.

California’s sky-high electricity rates are not the result of scarcity, or being in the middle of the Pacific Ocean like Hawaii, but rather are the direct consequence of policies that deliberately sidelined reliable, conventional fuels (including large hydropower) in favor of mandating and subsidizing preferred renewables. In 2002, Senate Bill (SB) 1078 created the Renewable Portfolio Standard, starting with a 20% renewables requirement by 2017. In 2006, Assembly Bill (AB) 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act, capped greenhouse gas emissions, forcing the state to adopt more wind and solar generation. Billions in rooftop-solar subsidies followed through the California Solar Initiative and other rooftop solar incentives, which have caused massive costshifting. In 2015, SB 350 raised the RPS target to 50% by 2030; in 2018, SB 100 pushed it to 60% by 2030 and 100% “carbon-free” electricity by 2045. In 2020, Governor Newsom issued an executive order creating a goal for all new cars sold in 2035 to be zero-emission vehicles, and the California Air Resources Board implemented that executive order by adopting the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation. The Advanced Clean Cars II regulation required a waiver under the Clean Air Act from the federal government. The waiver was granted by the Biden administration, but Congress later rescinded the waiver. The waiver would have allowed California to set strict emissions standards, forcing more demand on the grid by effectively banning the internal combustion engine in the state. California’s experience demonstrates that aggressive renewable energy mandates and climate policies entail steep costs borne directly by ratepayers. The state’s electricity rates, now double the national average, are not an unfortunate side effect but the predictable outcome of deliberate policy choices that prioritize emissions reduction over affordability.

Florida

Among the nation’s most populous states, Florida is a clear outlier for electricity affordability. Florida ranks as the second-largest electricity producer in the United States, trailing only Texas. Florida’s subtropical climate, characterized by hot, humid summers, mild winters, and a hurricane season, presents unique challenges for providing affordable electricity. Its residential sector stands out nationally: virtually every household relies on electricity for air conditioning, and about 90% use it for home heating. As a result, Florida homes account for 54% of the state’s total electricity consumption, the highest residential share of any state.

Despite these intense demands, Florida delivers electricity at prices 2% below the U.S. average at 13.27 cents per kWh for all sectors. It achieves this mainly by generating 75% of its power from natural gas, even though the state has no significant natural gas production of its own and must import virtually all of it. This traces directly to policy choices made under uninterrupted Republican control of the governorship and both legislative chambers since 1999. During the shale revolution that began around 2008, Florida pursued natural gas generation, raising its share from about 40% in 2005 to 75% today. Florida has been successful by avoiding the aggressive climate mandates adopted by most high-cost blue states. At the same time, the state manages to maintain these relatively low prices despite frequent hurricanes that regularly damage transmission lines, substations, and power plants, forcing ongoing investments in storm hardening and rapid restoration that add to overall grid expenses.

Louisiana

In 2025, Louisiana had the third-lowest electricity rates in the United States. The reasons are simple—73% of Louisiana’s electricity is generated by natural gas and unlike California or New York, Louisiana has not attempted to implement carbon dioxide or renewable energy goals through its electricity generation system.

Louisiana is very strong in natural gas production and infrastructure, and it leverages that strength to protect ratepayers; it is the third-largest natural gas producer in America. Louisiana has a very strong pipeline network because it is home to the best-known natural gas market center in North America – Henry Hub. Low natural gas prices in the United States lead to low electricity prices in Louisiana. Besides natural gas, 16% of the state’s electricity is generated by nuclear power, 6% by coal, 4% by non-hydroelectric renewables, and 1% by hydroelectric power.

Louisiana’s approach to electricity regulation stands in stark contrast to states like New York and California, which have pursued aggressive climate policies, and the results are reflected in ratepayers’ bills. By prioritizing affordability and reliability over mandates, Louisiana has maintained some of the nation’s lowest electricity rates. The state’s regulatory framework allows utilities to select generation resources based on economic fundamentals rather than political preferences, avoiding the costly mandates, emissions caps, and renewable portfolio standards that drive up rates elsewhere.

Kentucky

In 2025, Kentucky had the 13th-lowest electricity rates in the United States and the lowest rates of any state east of the Mississippi River. Kentucky’s rates are 21% lower than the national average. The reasons are straightforward—67% of Kentucky’s electricity is generated by coal and 26% by natural gas. Unlike states such as California or New York, Kentucky has not burdened ratepayers with the carbon dioxide reduction mandates or renewable energy requirements that inflate electricity costs.

Kentucky leverages its abundant coal resources to maintain affordable electricity for families and businesses. As the nation’s seventh-largest coal producer, Kentucky is home to about one out of five operating U.S. coal mines, more mines than any other state except West Virginia and Pennsylvania. This robust coal infrastructure allows the state to generate 67% of its utility-scale electricity from coal, the second-largest share of any state after West Virginia.

Kentucky has also developed significant natural gas infrastructure to complement its coal generation. The state has 22 underground natural gas storage sites capable of holding almost 222 billion cubic feet of gas. In 2024, natural gas-fired power plants generated 26% of Kentucky’s electricity, more than nine times greater than a decade earlier. The remaining 7% of Kentucky’s generation comes from hydroelectric and non-hydro renewables. Kentucky’s pragmatic approach to electricity regulation prioritizes ratepayers’ needs over political agendas. By allowing utilities to leverage the state’s abundant coal resources while incorporating natural gas for flexibility, Kentucky has maintained low electricity rates. This is important for Kentuckians as more than half of Kentucky households use electricity for heating.

Conclusion

Electricity affordability is a function of state-level policy choices. States that have embraced aggressive renewable mandates, 100% “carbon-free” targets, premature coal and nuclear retirements, rooftop-solar cost shifting, and restrictions on natural gas infrastructure routinely deliver the nation’s highest electricity prices. California and New York, the poster children for this approach, now charge their residents and businesses significantly more than the national average, with price increases that have consistently outpaced the rest of the country.

In contrast, states that have prioritized dispatchable, affordable generation consistently deliver the lowest electricity prices. Florida keeps rates below the national average despite near-universal airconditioning demand and frequent hurricanes. Louisiana enjoys the third-lowest rates in the nation while utilizing its abundant natural gas resources. Both states have done so under sustained Republican governance that has largely rejected the renewablemandate model.

Americans pay dramatically different electric bills depending on which party controls their state capitol. High electricity prices are not an inevitability; they are a choice. And in state after state, they are a choice made by left-wing policymakers who have prioritized climate symbolism over working families’ budgets.

When even deep-blue New York is forced to delay its own cap-and-tax scheme because it would impose “extraordinary and damaging costs” on residents, and when California ratepayers are paying double the national average to subsidize an electricity system that still imports power from neighboring states, the verdict is in. Americans struggling with utility bills need the same thing Florida and Louisiana residents already have: state leaders willing to put affordability and reliability ahead of ideological mandates. Until more states follow the red-state model, millions of households and businesses will continue to pay the price for expensive electricity as a deliberate political choice.

The BMW EVs with access (i4, i5, i7, and iX) are natively equipped with the CCS1 charging port. To use Tesla Superchargers (and other NACS chargers), drivers must use a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter.

BMW plans to release its official NACS-to-CCS1 adapter in Q2 2026, which is a few months away. However, until then, customers may use a third-party adapter. It seems that Lectron’s Vortex Plus NACS-to-CCS1 adapter is the one approved by BMW. The adapter costs $174.99, has a BMW-approved interlock design, is UL 2252 certified, and supports a power level of up to 500 kW (up to 500 amps and up to 1,000 volts).

BMW’s official NACS-to-CCS1 adapter, shown in the explanatory video, looks different and has the BMW logo:

Here is a better look at BMW’s adapter via SimplyGregsterEV (@SimplyGregster / X):

Tesla Supercharging dispensers with a built-in NACS-to-CCS1 adapter (aka Magic Dock) can be used without adapters. However, this possibility has been available for quite some time to all CCS1-compatible EVs when using the Tesla app to start a session. Tesla has more than 2,400 such stalls in North America.

Software Integration

BMW Supercharging access via the Tesla Supercharging network is possible within BMW’s software domain, as the German manufacturer has integrated the network into its systems.

Once the driver adds a NACS-to-CCS1 adapter in settings (see the attached explanatory video), BMW’s onboard navigation will display NACS (SAE J3400) chargers just like CCS1 chargers.

Separately, BMW’s Plug & Charge system can automatically initiate charging sessions and payments at Superchargers, just like in some other networks. The Plug & Charge integration is handled through Shell Recharge, so a Shell Recharge account is necessary.

If a user does not have the Plug & Charge option enabled, they can manually start a charging session in the My BMW app (see the video instructions).

Of course, if one wants to use the Tesla app, then one can start charging and pay for it there.

Who Will Be Next?

The list of Tesla’s NACS partners has reached roughly 20 companies, including (chronologically): Ford, Rivian, General Motors (Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC), Volvo, Polestar, Nissan, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Genesis, Kia, Honda, Acura, Jaguar Land Rover, Audi, Porsche, Toyota (including Lexus), Subaru, Volkswagen, and most recently BMW. The Subaru and BMW brands are still in the “Coming Soon” category on Tesla’s website, but it’s just a matter of an update to bring the list current, we guess.

There are also a few companies not listed at all, such as Stellantis, Mazda (now without an EV on the market), Mitsubishi (also without an EV), and a few other exotic nameplates.

Ultimately, all EV manufacturers in North America are expected to become Tesla’s NACS partners, as the network holds a huge market share of over 50% of DC charging stalls. Meanwhile, other charging networks have begun deploying chargers with NACS (SAE J3400) connectors, while manufacturers are now launching their first EVs with NACS charging inlets (see a list of NACS-compatible models here).",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251210-bmw.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 14:01:37.923756

Protecting the planet doesn’t have to be partisan.

There was a moment in U.S. history when pollution got so bad that the country did something rare: it agreed. Rivers were catching fire, cities were choked with smog, and people demanded change. In response, President Nixon, a Republican, created the EPA with a mission to protect human health and the environment, progress that crossed party lines.

That same grassroots energy that fueled the very first Earth Day in the 1970s is still alive today. In October, Senators Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Sheehy (R-Mont.) launched the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus to protect public lands. Different parties, with the same understanding: we all need clean water, and breathable air.

When people speak up, politicians respond. We hold the power to shape the future, even if it doesn’t always feel that way right now.

While Trump Proposes Cuts to EPA, More Than Half of States Have Also Cut Their Pollution Control Programs Over Last 15 Years

Washington, DC – At a time when the Trump Administration is proposing sharp cuts to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, claiming that states can take on more responsibility for environmental oversight, more than half of states (27) cut their environmental agency budgets over the last 15 years, according to an examination of state records by the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP).

Illinois ranked among the top states in the nation for cutting staffing from its pollution control agency, slashing 20 percent of its staff, or 193 jobs, between 2010 and 2024, according to EIP’s report, “State of Decline: Cuts to State Pollution Control Agencies Compound Damage from the Dismantling of EPA.”

The deep reductions at the state level mean that the Trump Administration’s planned downsizing of the EPA – with a vote by Congress planned next month on a proposal to slash EPA’s budget – will have an increased impact on pollution control efforts across the country. Not only will the federal pollution cop no longer be on the beat, state authorities may not show up either — because state inspectors have also been laid off in many areas.

“The Trump Administration is attempting to dismantle EPA and rollback commonsense federal pollution rules, claiming that the states can pick up the slack and protect our communities – but that’s not the case,” said Jen Duggan, Executive Director of the Environmental Integrity Project. “The implementation of our environmental laws depend on both a strong EPA and state agencies that have the resources they need to do their jobs. But our research found that many states have already cut their pollution control agencies and so more cuts at the federal level will only put more Americans at risk.”

Jen Walling, Chief Executive Officer of the Illinois Environmental Council, said: “In Illinois, we’ve asked our environmental agency to do more every year while giving it less than it had a generation ago. Because the state hasn’t invested general revenue dollars in the Illinois EPA since 2003, the agency is forced to rely on volatile fee revenue and federal grants. A 21 percent cut over 15 years has real consequences and if federal EPA funding collapses at the same time, there will be nothing left to backstop these critical protections. We are grateful to Governor Pritzker and Illinois EPA Director James Jennings for rebuilding capacity and restoring staffing to 850 employees, but even with their leadership, the agency is still operating with far fewer resources than Illinois communities need.”

EIP’s report found that seven states reduced their pollution control funding by at least a third from 2010 through 2024, when adjusted for inflation. The steepest budget cuts were led by Mississippi’s decision to slash its environmental agency by 71 percent, South Dakota’s 61 percent cut, and Connecticut’s 51 percent reduction.",,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:23.938679

With California experiencing power disruptions as it switches to cleaner energy, some key Washington state officials have said they support adding natural gas to the facility.
“Natural gas today is under the gun, but it is the backup for us … to avoid the brownouts, blackouts,” Gregoire said.
In an interview, Fitzgibbon, the state House majority leader, said he’s not opposed to TransAlta’s shift to natural gas.
“Having coal out of Washington power is a huge milestone,” Fitzgibbon added.","TransAlta Corporation has signed an agreement with Puget Sound Energy to switch the last coal-fired power station in Washington state to natural gas.

The deal, which TransAlta announced Tuesday, comes as the Centralia plant is set to fall silent at the end of the month.

Its closure is part of a deal the Washington Legislature approved in 2011. The winding down of the last coal-fired unit represents a long-sought goal for Democratic state politicians: the move toward cleaner energy to reduce fossil-fuel emissions and combat climate change.

But it also comes amid rising concerns that the state could face a power crunch as it makes that transition.

In a statement, John Kousinioris, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian-owned company, said the switch to natural gas “will lower the emission intensity profile of the facility by approximately 50 percent.”

“This project demonstrates the valuable role that legacy assets can play in supporting the State’s clean energy laws and system reliability in a cost effective and timely fashion,” added Kousinioris.

Under the agreement, the conversion will deliver 700 megawatts of power under a 16-year contract that runs through Dec. 31, 2044.

With California experiencing power disruptions as it switches to cleaner energy, some key Washington state officials have said they support adding natural gas to the facility.

In an interview conducted before the announcement, former Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire said she supported the company burning natural gas there as a backup while planned renewable energy projects around the state, like solar and wind power, get built.

During her tenure as governor, Gregoire, a Democrat, helped negotiate the agreement between TransAlta and the state that led to the winding down of the coal plant.

“Natural gas today is under the gun, but it is the backup for us … to avoid the brownouts, blackouts,” Gregoire said. “We do want to move to a clean energy future, but we have to do it in a way that we don’t deprive people and businesses and communities of the energy they so desperately need.”

She isn’t alone with that perspective. State House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon — a key architect of Democrats’ clean-energy blueprint under Gregoire’s successor, former Gov. Jay Inslee — said he supports TransAlta putting a natural-gas facility there for the short-term.

Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office did not respond to emails seeking comment.

State Senate Minority Leader John Braun, a Republican from Centralia, said generating power through natural gas would help avoid California-style energy disruptions seen in recent years.

“We have to make the transition without hurting anybody,” Braun said.

‘Risk of power shortfalls’

The Centralia site had once included a neighboring coal mine, the largest such mine in Washington. By 2009, when Gregoire signed an executive order on climate change that declared an intent to strike a deal with the company, that mine had already shut down.

“They were having to bring coal in, there were all kinds of pressures,” Gregoire said. “Whether that was a safety issue, a health issue, whether that was a good economic future for the people of Lewis County.”

Subsequent negotiations led to the 2011 agreement being passed by the Legislature. The agreement spelled out the coal plant’s decommissioning by the end of 2025 and secured the company an expedited consideration for a gas-powered facility.

The deal also secured $55 million from TransAlta to be spent on several things, including energy efficiency and economic development projects for the Centralia-area community.

“You can shut it down, and walk away, but what you leave behind is untenable,” Gregoire said. “So it was really about trying to find the right way in which to leave the opportunity to help those people who would be out of a job, to retrain. And a new vision for Lewis County.”

A recent study commissioned by Puget Sound Energy, Seattle City Light, Avista, Tacoma Power and others contends that Washington is already on the cusp of an electricity crisis.

The shift toward wind and solar has prompted the region to retire fossil fuel power faster than it has been replaced, according to the report released in September.

“Adding weather-dependent resources without balancing them with reliable backup has left the grid more exposed to extreme conditions,” it stated.

The region “is going to have to add natural gas peaking plants as a critical backstop for reliability when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing,” Matt Steuerwalt, a senior vice president with Puget Sound Energy, said in a statement.

“A key finding is the region is at risk of power shortfalls, which could lead to rolling blackouts during extreme conditions, such as a winter cold snap during a very low [hydropower] year,” Steuerwalt said, citing that study. “This is a problem now — not 2030 or 2045, though it will get worse as demand continues to grow and more legacy power plants shut down.”

In an email, state Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, said officials continue to work “on speeding the transition to clean energy by increasing solar and wind generation; making our grid more efficient; and exploring technological solutions such as demand management to reduce peak period electricity demand.”

“I suspect that we will also be extremely cautious about approving major new drains on the grid, such as data centers, that do not bring along dedicated generation facilities,” Pedersen added.

In an interview, Fitzgibbon, the state House majority leader, said he’s not opposed to TransAlta’s shift to natural gas. Fitzgibbon previously chaired the House’s energy and environment committee and sponsored the low-carbon fuel bill that passed in 2021. That was a key part of Democrats’ ambitious plans to reduce carbon emissions that passed under Gregoire’s successor, former Gov. Jay Inslee.

The envisioned TransAlta natural-gas facility, Fitzgibbon said, wouldn’t be expected to operate decades into the future like brand-new construction. The lawmaker added that he isn’t aware of any law that the Legislature would need to change to allow the project.

“Having coal out of Washington power is a huge milestone,” Fitzgibbon added.

Braun, the Republican state Senate minority leader, also called the TransAlta property the second-best place in the state for the next generation of nuclear energy, behind the Hanford nuclear site in central Washington.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1211_met_transalta-coal-plant.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 14:01:10.294610

The company will convert some existing lines at its EV manufacturing plant in Indiana to make ESS batteries.

Samsung currently operates out of the StarPlus Energy factory in Kokomo, Indiana. The site is a joint-venture between Samsung and Stellantis and was initially estimated to have a 34-GWh annual production capacity.

Samsung SDI’s prismatic LFP cells for ESS are packed in a 20-ft container, named the Samsung Battery Box (SBB) 2.0. The company launched the first edition of SBB with its flagship NCA cells in 2023. By expanding its portfolio into LFP technology, Samsung SDI is poised to strengthen its differentiated technological edge and further accelerate the global expansion of its prismatic batteries for ESS.

Compared to ESS using other types of LFP cells, Samsung SDI says its prismatic LFP cells are more resistant to external shocks due to the aluminum casing with safety design features like vents and fuses. There has been growing preference for prismatic cells from both EV and ESS sectors for safety reasons.

By using the prismatic cells, SBB features proprietary No Thermal Propagation (No TP) technology — preventing heat from spreading to adjacent cells by placing thermal insulation materials between cells and measuring the temperature of a specific cell through a prediction program.

§ 145.22(a) (2024); Class VI Primacy Application, 90 Fed.","The EPA’s November 2025 approval granting Texas primary enforcement authority over Class VI injection wells fundamentally changes who controls permitting of carbon capture and sequestration projects across the nation’s largest oil and gas state. For the 64 pending permit applications now transferring from federal to state oversight, this should improve permitting timeliness and accelerate projects tied to 45Q tax credits.

Texas became the sixth state to secure Class VI primacy, joining North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Arizona. The Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC) assumes authority on December 15, 2025.

I. What primacy means under cooperative federalism

“Primacy” is authority granted by EPA to a state to administer and enforce a federal environmental program. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), a state assumes regulatory authority previously exercised by EPA while the federal government sets minimum standards.

Once primacy takes effect, operators apply exclusively to the state agency. The RRC becomes the permitting authority, compliance monitor, and enforcement lead. EPA retains oversight authority and can revoke primacy if Texas fails to enforce federal standards.

SDWA Section 1422 requires states seeking primacy to meet an “at least as stringent” standard across site characterization, well construction, area of review modeling, monitoring, financial assurance, post-injection site care, and emergency response. EPA conducts line-by-line regulatory comparisons.

II. Understanding Class VI wells and the UIC program

EPA regulates underground injection through the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, authorized by the SDWA in 1974 to protect underground drinking water sources. Classes I through III handle industrial waste disposal, oil-and-gas-related injection (including enhanced recovery), and mineral extraction. Class IV wells—shallow hazardous waste injection into or above drinking water formations—are banned unless an injector obtains approval pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 144.13(c). Class V covers non-hazardous injection. Class VI, added in 2010, addresses long-term geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide.

Class VI requirements are among the most stringent in the UIC program. Carbon dioxide is buoyant, mobile, and corrosive in the presence of water, and projects inject massive volumes intended to remain underground for centuries. Regulations require sophisticated computational modeling to predict CO₂ plume migration, corrosion-resistant materials, continuous monitoring, and a default 50-year post-injection site care period.

III. How Texas earned primacy

Texas’s path to primacy began in 2009 when the legislature directed the state to pursue Class VI authority and established the legal framework for CO2 storage. The pivotal moment came in June 2021, when HB 1284 consolidated jurisdiction solely under the RRC—previously split between RRC and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality—and mandated pursuit of primacy.

Obtaining primacy required Texas to submit six core elements to EPA: a formal letter from Governor Abbott; a comprehensive program description; an Attorney General certification of adequate legal authority; a Memorandum of Agreement with EPA Region 6; copies of applicable statutes and regulations; and documentation of public participation.

Texas adopted comprehensive regulations at 16 Texas Administrative Code Chapter 5, which EPA determined meet or exceed all federal Class VI standards. EPA’s evaluation followed a four-phase process spanning three years, culminating in proposed rulemaking that received 7,534 public comments, the vast majority supportive, and final approval in November 2025.

IV. Why industry should pay attention

The practical impact centers on speed and certainty. EPA has issued only 11 Class VI permits nationally since 2011, with applications historically taking two or more years. As of late 2025, EPA had over 175 applications under review. By contrast, North Dakota and Wyoming have nearly cut Class VI permit review times in half.

For projects chasing 45Q tax credits, timing is critical. The credits—worth $85 per metric ton for point-source capture and $180 per metric ton for direct air capture—require secure geologic storage, meaning permitted Class VI wells. Projects must begin construction by year-end 2032 to qualify. Delayed permitting can destroy project economics.

Texas leads in announced CCS development. Occidental’s Stratos facility in Ector County—the world’s largest direct air capture plant at 500,000 tons annually—received EPA Class VI permits in April 2025. ExxonMobil’s Houston CCS Hub envisions capturing 50 million metric tons annually by 2030 with at least 11 major industrial partners. The Environmental Integrity Project tracks 34 proposed carbon capture projects statewide.

V. Practical takeaways for operators and legal teams

Companies with pending EPA applications should prepare for transfer to RRC jurisdiction. The transition requires no new application, but teams should familiarize themselves with RRC procedures and 16 TAC Chapter 5 requirements.

New projects should apply directly to RRC. The $50,000 application fee buys access to experienced reviewers with local geologic knowledge and shorter projected timelines.

In-house counsel should note one procedural difference: unlike EPA permits, suits for judicial review of RRC decisions do not automatically stay permit effectiveness. This shifts litigation risk calculations for both opponents and permit holders.

Finally, monitor RRC’s actual performance. Projected 12-month timelines are aspirational; the agency’s first decisions will establish real-world benchmarks. Texas has staked enormous economic and political capital on CCS leadership—the RRC’s execution will determine whether that bet pays off.

The MAX500 systems (500 kWh, 420 kW each) will charge zero-emission construction equipment and vehicles at locations where grid constraints and site logistics make fixed charging impractical.

Construction sites often face severe grid constraints, and heavy equipment such as excavators cannot be readily transported to distant charging points. Allye’s mobile battery systems bring charging infrastructure directly to equipment on-site.

“The MAX500 solves one of construction electrification’s most challenging problems: keeping heavy equipment charged and productive across sprawling sites,” said Alistair McNeil, COO of Allye Energy. “Our mobile battery systems bring charging infrastructure to the equipment, maintaining productivity whilst eliminating emissions.”

“The MAX500 systems from Allye offer mobile, zero-emission energy storage that helps construction sites overcome grid constraints whilst maintaining operational uptime,” said Josh Wright, CEO of Vital Power Group, Allye’s distribution partner. “Once deployed on our customers’ sites, the units will be fully supported by our comprehensive maintenance packages.”

The MAX500 is the first system in Allye’s range to feature DC fast recharging, enabling rapid replenishment from 20-80% state of charge in approximately one hour. This capability enables systems to recharge from any public DC fast charger or, for large-scale projects, to recharge each other in the field.

“By enabling our systems to rapidly recharge from DC sources—whether public infrastructure or other battery units—we’ve created a dynamic energy ecosystem that adapts to the complex logistics of large construction sites,” said Jonathan Carrier, founder and CEO at Allye Energy. “This capability will be rolled out across our entire MAX range.”

Allye Energy now offers four battery energy storage systems, tailored to different applications:

MAX300 (~300 kWh, 280 kW): a mobile, trailer-mounted system weighing under 3.5 tonnes with minimal ADR requirements. Suitable for construction sites, film and TV production, events and temporary power applications.

MAX500 (~500 kWh, 420 kW): offers an optimal balance of capacity, power and mobility for construction applications, featuring integrated DC fast recharging capability.

These corporations pay the greater of the regular corporate tax (21 percent of their taxable income) or the minimum tax (15 percent of their book income, with certain adjustments).
For some large corporations, the megabill’s corporate tax cuts create a new reason[6] their book income may exceed their taxable income, potentially exposing them to the minimum tax.
That’s exactly how the minimum tax was designed to operate, but it’s something that corporate lobbyists want Treasury to prevent by executive fiat.
First, they claim that Congress, in allowing the accelerated deductions, also wanted them to be fully exempt from the corporate minimum tax.","Industry groups are[1] lobbying[2] the Treasury Department to create a special exemption from the corporate minimum tax — enacted to ensure that corporations pay at least a minimum tax rate on their profits — that would give some of the largest corporations another tax windfall on top of their large tax cuts from this year’s Republican megabill[3] and the 2017 tax law’s permanent corporate rate cut[4].

Recent Treasury guidance has already weakened[5] Biden Administration rules governing the corporate minimum tax, which was enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); this new guidance effectively exempts significant income of cryptocurrency, private equity, and insurance companies from the tax. The weakened rules and the hollowing out of IRS enforcement (which will make it less likely that corporations pay what they legally owe) mean corporations are racking up large tax cuts that weren’t enacted by Congress. Granting the latest industry request on the corporate minimum tax, related to firms’ prior years’ research and experimentation (R&E) costs, would give billion-dollar corporations yet another tax cut.

The IRA requires some profitable corporations that otherwise may pay little or no corporate income tax in a given year to pay a minimum tax rate on the profits they report to shareholders, known as “book” income (or book profits). The tax applies only to corporations with book profits of more than $1 billion per year on average over three years. These corporations pay the greater of the regular corporate tax (21 percent of their taxable income) or the minimum tax (15 percent of their book income, with certain adjustments).

Corporations may be subject to the minimum tax if their book income is much higher than their taxable income. This can happen if they reduce their taxable income with certain large deductions or other tax breaks.

For some large corporations, the megabill’s corporate tax cuts create a new reason[6] their book income may exceed their taxable income, potentially exposing them to the minimum tax. The megabill reversed a 2017 tax law provision that, starting in 2022, required businesses to deduct their R&E costs gradually over time (or “amortize” them) instead of immediately expensing them. Allowing R&E expensing going forward doesn’t itself create a potential corporate minimum tax liability because those expenses would be treated the same way under both tax and accounting rules. But the megabill adds an extra benefit: for R&E costs that corporations incurred while the 2017 provision was in effect (2022-2024), the megabill also allowed companies to accelerate their remaining deductions to this year.

For some corporations[7], taking these accelerated deductions could lower their taxable income enough to trigger the corporate minimum tax based on their book income. That’s exactly how the minimum tax was designed to operate, but it’s something that corporate lobbyists want Treasury to prevent by executive fiat.

Industry lobbyists are making two main arguments. First, they claim that Congress, in allowing the accelerated deductions, also wanted them to be fully exempt from the corporate minimum tax. Congress certainly could have excluded those deductions from the minimum tax — just as the megabill specifically exempted certain fossil fuel-related expenses — but the new law didn’t exempt the accelerated deductions. Treasury, in implementing the minimum tax, shouldn’t try to create deductions[8] not stated in federal law.

Second, industry lobbyists argue that exempting the accelerated R&E deductions from the minimum tax would encourage investment and innovation. But providing a new tax break for business activity that has already occurred can’t encourage new investment[9]; it’s just a large giveaway to corporations and their shareholders on top of other large tax cuts in recent years.

The centerpiece of the 2017 tax law was a deep, permanent cut[10] in the corporate tax rate — from 35 percent to 21 percent — at a cost of $1.3 trillion over ten years. Congressional Republicans added the R&E amortization provision (and several other business tax increases) to the law to partly offset the cost of the rate cut. But the megabill reversed most of those business tax increases without revisiting the corporate rate cut — giving yet another windfall to corporate shareholders and adding around $700 billion[11] to the bill’s cost.

Exempting accelerated R&E expenses from the minimum tax would have further increased the megabill’s price tag, potentially pressuring Republicans to offset the provision by shrinking other tax cuts or expanding the new law’s massive program cuts, which will take away health coverage[12] and food assistance[13] from millions of people.",https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/iStock-182175598.jpg?itok=bR_oEXW8,N,,2025-12-10 13:01:37.898051

Just last month, the EIA said it expected U.S. electricity generation to grow by 3% in 2026, more than a percentage point higher.
The report said the EIA expects electricity demand in PJM to grow by 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026.
“We expect most of the growing electricity demand in the PJM region will be met by growing generation from coal and solar, up 23% and 63%, respectively, between 2024 and 2026,” the agency said.
“In ERCOT, the fastest growing energy source is solar, which we forecast will grow by 92% between 2024 and 2026.”","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

The Energy Information Administration cut its 2026 electricity generation growth forecast by 1.3% from last month “based on how much large load electricity demand has come online so far this year,” particularly in Texas, “and its implications for near-term growth,” according to its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook released Tuesday.

EIA now projects generation to grow 2.4% this year and 1.7% next year. The agency expects the United States will generate 4,327 billion kWh in 2026, down from a 4,382 billion kWh estimate issued last month.

Just last month, the EIA said it expected U.S. electricity generation to grow by 3% in 2026, more than a percentage point higher.

Much of the projected load growth is in the grids managed by the PJM Interconnection and the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, and the total downward revision appears to be driven by changes in ERCOT’s projected demand growth.

The EIA said it had revised its forecast of ERCOT growth rates since last month, shrinking its projections from 6% to 5% growth in 2025 and 15.7% to 9.6% growth in 2026.

The report said the EIA expects electricity demand in PJM to grow by 3.3% in both 2025 and 2026.

Even given the lower forecast, the expected increaseis “in contrast to relatively flat generation from 2010 to 2020 and is primarily driven by increasing demand from large customers, including data centers, concentrated in regions managed by” ERCOT and PJM, the agency said.

EIA also said it anticipated changes in the mix of energy sources used for generation in these two regions, while anticipating both regions’ largest generation source of natural gas will grow by 2% in both between 2024 and 2026.

Ambrose noted that while both planning and implementation processes have been well-researched, there’s been less scholarship on whether interagency collaborations transition successfully from planning to implementation — or why that happens.
“Planning and implementation are different activities, have different end goals, and require different organizational structures and responsibilities,” Ambrose says.
For example, the group collaborations for the Inland Bays, Tampa Bay and Tillamook Bay conservation projects began shifting toward preliminary implementation activities while still in planning stages.","For projects that require collaboration among multiple agencies and stakeholders, recent research suggests a different approach to moving from the planning stage to implementation.

Using four case studies, an NC State University researcher analyzed how 31 organizations collaborated on estuary conservation projects in the Delaware Inland Bays, Narragansett Bay, Tampa Bay and Tillamook Bay. The study found that these interagency collaborations started strong in earlier phases of the projects.

“These organizations tend to do a good job of planning, but then stumble when it comes to transitioning from the planning process to actually executing the projects,” says Graham Ambrose, an assistant professor of public administration at NC State who co-authored a paper on the work.

Organizations do a good job of planning, but then stumble when it comes to transitioning … to actually executing the projects.

Ambrose noted that while both planning and implementation processes have been well-researched, there’s been less scholarship on whether interagency collaborations transition successfully from planning to implementation — or why that happens. This lack of research has bearing on why organizations often apply planning techniques to implementation processes, and vice versa, with varying degrees of success.

“Planning and implementation are different activities, have different end goals, and require different organizational structures and responsibilities,” Ambrose says. “We think our contribution here is both practical and academic,” Ambrose says. “The primary goal of our work here is to offer more consistent and practical advice to practitioners.”

Smarter Steps for Collaborative Goals

In examining why groups struggle to get projects off the ground, Ambrose found that overlapping planning and launch phases can help collaborative teams stay resilient in spite of organizational shifts and changes. More importantly, it sets them up to achieve their project goals.

“Drawing on four case studies and the available literature, we find that groups are more likely to be successful if they adopt something we’ve termed a ‘mixed services transition approach,’” Ambrose says.

Instead of jumping directly from planning to launch — and treating each phase as a separate, distinct process — mixing these phases can help. Ambrose suggests small-scale implementation activities while groups are still working to finalize their formal planning.

Planning and implementation are different activities, have different end goals, and require different organizational structures and responsibilities.

For example, the group collaborations for the Inland Bays, Tampa Bay and Tillamook Bay conservation projects began shifting toward preliminary implementation activities while still in planning stages. Before finalizing formal plans, these groups piloted smaller projects to build support for their conservation efforts.

“Implementing pilot projects can help identify previously unanticipated challenges or opportunities, which can benefit larger-scale implementation efforts later on,” Ambrose explains.

Each group collaboration received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Estuary Program, which provides planning grants to organizations focused on preserving estuary ecosystems. The groups that took steps to secure additional funding were able to transition to implementation more successfully later.

“EPA funding is limited and can only be used for a defined range of projects,” Ambrose explains, which means some groups had to contend with the fact that certain project goals were ineligible for funding. Ambrose says that collaborations that found additional financial support were better positioned to implement their plans and maintain the interest and goodwill of their stakeholders.

The groups that proved more resilient also devoted resources to outlining how the collaborative organization’s structure would change to help their collaborations shift toward implementation.

“Many of these groups were unable to successfully transition from planning to implementation, stagnated and were dissolved,” Ambrose says. “Other groups made some headway, and some have proved to be sustainable and resilient.”

Ambrose used an organizational research framework called the Collaborative Life-Cycle to explore transitions collaborations make as they move from planning to implementation. The study’s recommended mixed services approach adds an additional, intermediary step between planning and implementation.

“While this additional stage took more time, those that did not engage in mixed services had less success in the [implementation] phase,” Ambrose’s study states.

Over the past several months, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved a series of pesticide products containing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever chemicals,” for use on lawns and crops, including food crops such as soybeans, lettuce, and other vegetables. These approvals reverse what had been a movement toward restricting these chemicals in agriculture and signal a major shift in federal chemical policy at a moment when scientific consensus increasingly links PFAS exposure to a range of health problems.

PFAS comprise a vast family of synthetic chemicals valued for their water-, oil-, and heat-resistant properties. They appear in a wide array of consumer goods, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-repellent textiles, waterproof outdoor gear, cosmetics, dental floss, and food packaging, as well as in industrial applications such as firefighting foams, metal plating, chemical manufacturing, and electronics production. In pesticides, PFAS help formulations to spread evenly on leaves, resist washing off in the rain, and extend product shelf life. Because they contain powerful carbon–fluorine bonds, they also resist environmental breakdown, persisting in soil, water, wildlife, and the human body for decades or more. Once PFAS enter the environment, they rarely leave.

The Regulatory Landscape

Before this recent deregulatory shift, government approaches to PFAS in the food system had been variable but generally trending toward more precaution. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for instance, authorized only limited use of PFAS in food-contact materials and, after safety reviews, secured voluntary phase-outs of these chemicals in the grease-proofing agents used in paper food packaging.

By early 2025, the FDA had declared 35 food-contact notifications for PFAS’ safety “no longer effective,” meaning that the agency no longer considered the supporting safety data valid. And, as a result, they were no longer legally authorized for use for those specific uses in food packaging. While not an outright ban, the FDA’s decision effectively removed these chemicals from legal circulation in food-contact materials. Yet at the same time, the EPA has been moving in the opposite direction, approving new pesticides containing PFAS and delaying compliance deadlines for drinking water limits.

These competing actions highlight a broader problem: the United States’ lack of a coherent strategy for regulatory oversight of PFAS makes it difficult for consumers, municipalities, and food producers to track or mitigate risk. The precautionary principle, which seeks to prevent harm before it occurs, has largely given way to a permissive stance, allowing PFAS into circulation despite insufficient long-term safety data.

Regulating PFAS is uniquely challenging because they are not a single chemical but a complex class of thousands. Each variant behaves differently, and long-term toxicological data on many are incomplete or nonexistent. Historically, regulators evaluated PFAS on a case-by-case basis. Some high-molecular-weight polymerized PFAS used in cookware coatings or gaskets were deemed low-risk because their large, stable molecular structures were not expected to break down or migrate into food, whereas PFAS used as grease-proofing agents in paper products were found to shed side-chains that could leach into food, particularly when exposed to heat or oils. The EPA argues that the newly approved pesticide chemicals fall outside the agency’s working definition of PFAS and therefore do not pose risks to human health.

However, many scientists and independent researchers do recognize these newly approved compounds as PFAS, and early evidence suggests they may behave like the broader class. Recent studies have identified PFAS in a significant share of pesticide formulations, and testing has detected PFAS-containing pesticides in rivers, streams, and other waterways, a sign that they are environmentally mobile and persistent. Although toxicological research on the specific PFAS now being introduced into pesticides is limited, their chemical structures share key features with better-studied PFAS that are known to accumulate in soil and water, resist environmental breakdown, and move through ecosystems in unpredictable ways.

What remains most concerning is the lack of toxicological data on these newly approved pesticide-related PFAS. While numerous studies link long-studied PFAS to immune disruption, liver and kidney harm, reproductive and developmental effects, and increased cancer risk, comparable long-term data for newer PFAS do not yet exist. This scientific gap means regulators cannot reliably assess how these chemicals behave in the environment, how easily they migrate into food or water, or what levels of exposure may be harmful. As a result, approving PFAS-based pesticides may be allowing a new generation of persistent chemicals into the food system without a clear understanding of their potential consequences, a regulatory gamble with implications that could unfold over decades.

What This Means for Health, Food, and the Environment

The health implications are substantial. Certain PFAS have been linked to liver toxicity, immune system suppression, hormone disruption, reproductive and developmental harm, and increased cancer risk. Approving these PFAS-based pesticides means that these chemicals can enter fields, waterways, and soil not only indirectly through manufacturing waste or in packaging but also directly through agricultural application. PFAS applied to crops can leach into groundwater, run off into rivers, or persist in soil long after the time of their intended use. There is growing evidence that plants can absorb PFAS, raising the possibility that food crops may become points of entry for human exposure. For farmworkers and rural communities already living near contaminated sites, these approvals may increase already long-standing environmental health burdens.

International scientific and regulatory bodies have increasingly recognized these hazards. The European Union designates some PFAS as substances of very high concern and is pursuing broad restrictions; the European Food Safety Authority has set extremely low exposure thresholds based on the immune and developmental effects of PFAS; Canada has proposed regulating PFAS as a class; and some countries, including Denmark, have banned them in food-contact packaging. Although toxicological data for many PFAS remain limited, global regulatory trends reflect the consensus that the risks documented for older-generation PFAS may extend to newer replacements with similar chemical structures.

Implications for the food system are also far-reaching. Introducing PFAS into agriculture creates new opportunities for contamination across supply chains, including those relied on by urban consumers who may assume that local or organic produce is free from synthetic chemical exposures. However, because PFAS can travel through water and soil, even farms that do not use PFAS-based pesticides may still be impacted. And these exposures also raise concerns for environmental justice, because rural communities and agricultural laborers typically face the highest cumulative exposure, meaning the total burden of pesticide contact that builds up over time from multiple chemicals and exposure pathways, leaving them at far greater risk than the general population and with limited political leverage to influence national chemical policy.

Ultimately, these policies threaten not only human health but also the health of the planet. PFAS used on crops do not stay in one place; they disperse into waterways, accumulate in soils, and travel long distances, affecting wildlife and degrading ecosystems. And the chemicals’ longevity means that regulatory mistakes made today may create environmental consequences that last for generations.

The recent shift toward leniency in the regulation of PFAS, particularly their approval for use in pesticides, marks a significant increase in the number of ways these chemicals can enter the food system. This moment demands that policymakers, researchers, and others working on food system issues scrutinize how current PFAS policies fail to protect human and environmental health. Developing a clear, consistent national strategy for managing these chemicals, one that is informed by emerging scientific evidence and long-term public and environmental health considerations, is essential for protecting our food, water, and community well-being.",https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2398892353-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 16:00:55.267806

At the AESC factory near the city of Douai, where production has been underway for several months, Chinese engineers and technicians supervise French recruits.

""They are the ones who train us on the equipment, how to operate it, how to fix problems,"" said Ericka Redjimi, 39.

Redjimi arrived at AESC in May without any experience in the sector.

""I sold clothes at open-air markets,"" she said.

Communication can prove complicated.

""We use Google Translate often.""

""I still need them, much less than at the beginning,"" but ""it's reassuring that they are still here,"" said Redjimi, who works in the section of the factory that makes battery cells.

Once finished, autonomous robotic sleds transport the cells to another section of the factory where they are assembled into battery modules that are used to power Renault's R4 and R5 models, as well as the Nissan Micra.

- Skills transfer -

By the end to the first quarter of 2026 the factory should be running at full speed, turning out batteries to equip 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles per year, said Ayumi Kurose, who heads up operations at AESC France.

He said the first few months of production had gone pretty much as expected.

""What's always complicated is gaining mastery of the equipment"" which often comes from Asia, and the training of staff, Kurose said.

Founded in Japan but now owned by China's Envision, AESC has been manufacturing electric car batteries in Asia for 15 years.

The group can rely on its in-house know-how to ensure ""good practices from beginning"" at its new factories elsewhere in the world, said Kurose.

He said there are currently nearly 150 Chinese experts working at the Douai directing 800 local staff.

These include experts in vision-based control of industrial machinery and cutting-edge soldering techniques.

""The goal is really the transfer of skills,"" said Kurose.

The experts ""come for between six months and two years, but they aren't meant to stay,"" he added.

The Douai factory should be ready to operate on its own by the end of 2026, he estimated.

One of the Chinese engineers also expressed confidence.

""I have to say, my French colleagues, they are always working hard,"" said He Xiaoming, 36.

If they acquire the necessary knowledge and gain additional experience ""they will go quite fast"", he added.

The nearby ACC factory, the first battery gigafactory to open in France in 2024, is also scaling up production after a difficult start.

""What we manufacture in a day now took us a month to do at the beginning of the year,"" said ACC's chief executive Yann Vincent.

""We're not yet where we want to be"", but in terms of the rate of defective cells and volumes ""we've made significant improvement.""

A joint venture of carmakers Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz plus energy firm TotalEnergies, ACC earlier this year struck a temporary partnership with a Chinese battery manufacturer.

The company, the name of which ACC hasn't disclosed, will manage one of its three production lines from A to Z until mid-2026.

Vincent said the Chinese have learned an enormous amount in two decades of manufacturing electric vehicle batteries, while France began from zero five years ago.

So ""it's better to rely on the people who know best"" to speed up learning a ""really delicate"" manufacturing process.

ACC, which currently employs 1,200 people at its Billy-Berclau factory, aims to manufacture batteries for 250,000 electric vehicles next year, against 10,000 to date.

Toyota’s $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina underscores a growing emphasis on hybrid-focused electrification, even as global EV sales climb past 17 million and approach one-quarter of all new cars in 2025. In the United States, EV sales hit record highs ahead of expiring tax credits, yet market uncertainty remains and hybrid demand is accelerating at a far faster pace. Together, these trends signal a shift toward diversified electrification strategies shaped by cost, policy, consumer behavior, and regional market dynamics.

The Battery Technology article reports that Toyota has opened a $13.9 billion battery manufacturing plant in Liberty, North Carolina. This 1,850-acre facility is Toyota’s largest single manufacturing investment and its first battery plant outside Japan. With 14 production lines and a planned output of 30 GWh, the plant will create 5,100 jobs and supply batteries to U.S. assembly plants in Kentucky and Alabama. Toyota is using the site to advance its hybrid-focused approach. The plant is vertically integrated, handling everything from cathode and anode processing to cell production and module assembly. Early production centers on hybrid electric vehicle batteries, reflecting Toyota’s view that spreading limited battery materials across many hybrids reduces more emissions than focusing on long-range EVs. The facility will also support Toyota’s first U.S.-built three-row electric SUV. Toyota is adding thousands of jobs, providing on-site employee services, and investing in local STEM education through $2.7 million in grants. State leaders say the project strengthens the region’s role in automotive and clean-energy manufacturing.

Global EV Outlook 2025

The International Energy Agency reports that global electric car sales passed 17 million in 2024, reaching more than 20% of all new cars sold. The global EV fleet grew to nearly 58 million vehicles, tripling since 2021 and displacing over 1 million barrels of oil per day.

China led the world with more than 11 million EV sales and an EV share close to 50%, driven by competitive pricing and a major trade-in incentive. Plug-in hybrids grew quickly, but battery-electric sales continued to rise.

Europe’s EV share held steady at about 20% as subsidies were reduced in major markets. Growth continued in the U.K. and Nordic countries, with Norway reaching 88% battery-electric sales.

U.S. EV sales rose to 1.6 million and passed a 10% share, though growth slowed. More models entered the market and leasing surged because it allowed buyers to benefit from tax credits.

Emerging markets saw the fastest growth, with sales up more than 60%, driven largely by affordable Chinese models and expanding local brands such as VinFast and Togg.

Government subsidies continued to decline, making up less than 7% of global EV spending in 2024. Early 2025 data shows sales rising 35%, and the IEA expects more than 20 million EVs to be sold in 2025, approaching one-quarter of global car sales.

U.S. EV Sales & Market Share

CarEdge reports that U.S. EV sales hit a record 437,487 units in Q3 2025, lifting market share to 10.5% as buyers rushed to purchase before federal tax credits expired. Tesla’s sales grew but its market share slid to 41%, while GM delivered the strongest gains, doubling sales and widening its lead over Ford. Hyundai Motor Group and Volkswagen also posted notable increases, though only nine of nearly 90 EV models sold more than 10,000 units. The surge was incentive-driven rather than a sign of lasting momentum. With tax credits gone, the EV market enters Q4 with significant uncertainty. Electrified powertrains continue to grow overall, but battery-electric demand is slowing compared to previous years.

S&P also notes that U.S. interest in hybrid vehicles is surging far faster than interest in fully electric cars. Hybrid registrations jumped from 3.1% to 16.3% between 2020 and 2025, nearly doubling the EV share, which rose to 8.6%. This growth is occurring across all regions and fuel types, showing a broad, sustained shift in consumer behavior. More buyers are switching to hybrids when returning to market. The share of EV owners choosing a hybrid doubled in three years, and gas owners shifted at an even higher rate. Hybrid loyalty has also strengthened, rising above 46% after a decade of lagging behind other fuel types.

Toyota leads the segment decisively. Nearly half of all new U.S. hybrid registrations are Toyota models—more than all major competitors combined. The brand’s hybrid mix is the industry’s highest, and Toyota reinforced its strategy by making the 2026 RAV4 hybrid-only. Regionally, West Coast markets post the strongest adoption, with several California cities, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. exceeding 20% hybrid share.

The once-affordable EVs, which benefited from the tax credit and aggressive lease deals, are no longer within reach for many consumers, exacerbating a broader trend of reduced demand for new cars.

Car prices have been climbing for years, but the pandemic and ongoing supply chain issues have exacerbated the situation. In recent years, EVs offered an affordable alternative due to government incentives, but with the removal of these incentives, the affordability of electric vehicles has diminished.

The End of the EV Tax Credit’s Impact

The removal of the $7,500 tax credit has significantly impacted the electric vehicle market. Once a key incentive, the credit helped lower the upfront cost of EVs, making them a more affordable option for many buyers. However, without these financial incentives, EVs have become less competitive.

November sales data showed a continued decline in EV sales, reflecting the broader trend. While the overall vehicle market showed a 6.3% drop in sales, electric vehicles saw the most significant decrease.

As Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, explained to Automotive News, the combination of high prices, elevated interest rates, and a lack of tax credits is pushing consumers to seek more affordable options. The removal of incentives has shifted demand away from EVs, with buyers opting for hybrid models or cheaper gasoline-powered vehicles instead.

Rising Vehicle Prices Squeeze Buyers

The steep rise in vehicle prices is not limited to EVs. Gas-powered trucks and SUVs, which typically dominate the market, have also become less affordable for many consumers. Ford’s recent sales report shows that sales of its utility vehicles dropped by 4.9%, while sales of entry-level trims on models like the Maverick and Ranger surged by double digits. This indicates that consumers are becoming more focused on affordability, with a shift toward lower-priced models despite the overall high cost of new cars.

Honda, too, reported a decline in sales, with total sales dropping by 15% in November. The company attributed some of the decline to global semiconductor shortages, which have affected production and inventories. As of November, Honda’s stock of vehicles was down to just over 145,000 models, a significant drop from the previous month. This reduction in supply, combined with high prices, has made it more challenging for consumers to find affordable new vehicles, reports InsideEVs.

EVs Are the Hardest Hit

Electric vehicles have borne the brunt of the sales downturn, as the absence of tax incentives makes them even more expensive. The Chevy Bolt, Nissan Leaf, and other previously affordable EVs have seen significant sales declines in recent months. Meanwhile, hybrid models, which offer a more traditional driving experience, have gained some traction, though they, too, are affected by the overall rise in vehicle prices.

With prices for new vehicles continuing to climb, many consumers are choosing to hold on to their older cars for longer or are turning to used vehicles, which, despite their own price increases, are still more affordable than new cars. While holiday deals may offer temporary relief, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, with consumers facing increasingly difficult choices in the face of high prices and limited incentives.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a-car-against-a-background-of-American-dollar-bills.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 13:01:09.698886

Among them was Patricia Brown, a longtime Sante Fe County resident and member of the New Mexico Energy Policy Research Advisory.
NEE has been leaning on its twofold outreach strategy to educate New Mexicans about the implications of taking New Mexico utility companies private.","New Mexico is the fifth-largest state by landmass. With its abundance of sunshine and wind, the Land of Enchantment is “a natural location for renewable energy production and clean energy jobs,” the New Mexico State Land Office explains on its website.

This ample renewable generation capacity has positioned New Mexico well to supply clean energy to Western states. According to Mariel Nanasi, executive director and president of New Energy Economy (NEE), “New Mexico can not only meet all of its energy needs through renewables and storage but could also produce electricity for the highly consumptive and populous states of Arizona and California.” Using transmission interties and wholesale market arrangements, it often does just that.

More from James Baratta

But Nanasi and her organization have sounded the alarm on a bid by Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, to acquire TXNM Energy for $11.5 billion. Announced in May, the deal would give Blackstone control of TXNM subsidiaries Texas-New Mexico Power and the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), which serve 800,000 customers. Unlike a leveraged buyout, the acquisition would be fully funded with equity.

For Nanasi, the proposed acquisition threatens to harm ratepayers by enabling the construction of data centers across New Mexico, rather than supplying affordable power to those who need it. “Blackstone sees this purchase as a very important strategic foray into the West,” she told the Prospect.

Before obtaining TXNM, Blackstone must secure regulatory approval from the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, or PRC. Blackstone also finds itself at the center of an ongoing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proceeding, the outcome of which will determine whether the world’s largest alternatives asset manager can acquire TXNM without undermining wholesale competition or transmission service, causing undue cross-subsidization, or adversely impacting consumers. NEE has intervened in all three proceedings.

Blackstone is not the only private equity player carving up New Mexico’s utility infrastructure. Bernhard Capital Partners, a smaller private equity firm based in Louisiana, has been seeking regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of New Mexico Gas Company (NMGC), the state’s largest natural gas utility. Bernhard reached an agreement with Emera, the utility’s parent company, to acquire NMGC for approximately $1.3 billion last year. The firm also owns traditional energy assets in Louisiana and Mississippi, after acquiring CenterPoint Energy and Entergy’s natural gas distribution businesses earlier this year.

For its part, Blackstone has a 5 percent stake in the embattled Ohio-based electric utility FirstEnergy, and 20 percent of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which is reportedly planning to expand its natural gas power plants to meet electricity demand from data centers. Acquiring TXNM would be a first for Blackstone, as the $1 trillion private markets manager has never owned a regulated utility outright.

A spokesperson for Blackstone told the Prospect the firm is “the right partner to support PNM’s long-term growth” and that PNM would operate as a stand-alone business with its own leadership, with strictly regulated rates from the PRC.

But the Center for Biological Diversity, an intervenor in the FERC case, recently argued that Blackstone’s application neglects the anti-competitive effects of acquiring TXNM on customers, as the company could leverage its ownership of the utility in its continued pursuit of data center investments. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) acknowledged as much in their December 4 letter to Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman.

“Private equity’s money-extracting playbook isn’t anything new, and the consequences that usually follow aren’t either,” the senators wrote.

BLACKSTONE HAS OFFERED TO PAY a 23 percent acquisition premium, or about $2 billion more than TXNM’s book value at the time the agreement was announced. The firm has proposed a $105 million rate credit to be distributed over a four-year period, equating to $3.51 a month for the average residential ratepayer. But NEE argues the rate credits on the table “are highly likely to prove illusory,” in large part because of the rate shock customers could face if the deal goes through.

Blackstone has also announced a $10 million Good Neighbor Fund to assist low-income ratepayers over a ten-year period. The firm has demonstrated its willingness to lay out $25 million in investments for innovative technologies related to grid modernization, as well as $35 million to support economic and workforce development.

“As part of the regulatory process, which includes further engagement with parties to the case, there will be opportunities for further discussions around the different ways affordability can be addressed with the benefits proposed in the application,” a TXNM spokesperson told the Prospect.

The PRC and most state-level utility commissions have made it clear that customers cannot be charged any acquisition-related transaction costs, but critics say Blackstone could try to recover those costs indirectly by requesting a higher return on equity (ROE) in future rate cases, or by increasing capital spending, both of which are part and parcel of the investor-owned utility financial model.

Blackstone disputes this, stating that the PRC and FERC “determine returns on equity and have oversight over capital spending; Blackstone Infrastructure and PNM do not control the authorized return on equity and PNM cannot recover capital spend in customer rates without commission approval.” (Bernhard Capital, in its attempted takeover of NMGC, has explicitly stated that customers “will not, directly or indirectly,” bear the costs of the acquisition.)

Apart from customer benefits, there’s also the question of whether Blackstone would allow the PRC to preserve its jurisdiction over TXNM. Nanasi asserts it would not.

“Blackstone has more money than the state of New Mexico,” she said. “They’re paying $2 billion more than the company’s worth because their plan is to get that back and then make some more money on it, so that’s how confident they are that they’re going to sweep us clean.”

The thrust behind her concern is the potential for affiliate transaction risk. Blackstone could leverage its ownership of PNM to benefit its investments in data centers and other businesses throughout the state. The firm owns three companies that already do business in New Mexico, including data center developer QTS. Under the PRC’s six-part test, Blackstone must demonstrate that it will not use PNM to give preferential treatment to its portfolio companies or cross-subsidize non-utility businesses like data centers. As a regulated utility, PNM has a monopoly on the delivery of electricity in its service area, which is why the burden is on Blackstone to prove that the company will not force ordinary ratepayers to pay more for electricity as a result of its non-utility activities. NEE has suggested that “Blackstone’s opaque corporate structure and history of self-dealing through affiliate transactions undermine transparency and regulatory oversight.”

Conversely, Blackstone argues that “any interactions between affiliates are subject to adherence to local and federal regulations that focus specifically on avoiding unfair advantages or disadvantages.”

But private equity firms should be expected to use every tool in their arsenal to influence regulatory decisions. One example comes from the Bernhard-NMGC case, which is further along in the PRC process than the Blackstone bid.

On October 20, Bernhard and NMGC filed a motion to exclude the direct testimony of NEE witness Jesse George. In addition to his work as an attorney focusing on utility regulation in Louisiana, he serves as New Orleans policy director at the Alliance for Affordable Energy. The PRC hearing examiners disqualified George as an expert witness, based on the apparent lack of evidence for his qualifications to “testify on New Mexico regulatory law or policy,” per the November 3 ruling.

George’s testimony focused on utilities Bernhard has owned, including National Water Infrastructure (NWI), one of the largest sewer utility companies in Louisiana. According to the Energy and Policy Institute, an inspection by the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality “revealed a large amount of sludge build-up, with bloodworms observed throughout the sludge—indicative of stagnant water containing organic matter often associated with sanitary waste.” Bernhard denied any wrongdoing, though it paid a small settlement to the department. In his testimony, George urged the PRC to consider Bernhard’s track record at NWI in its application of the six-factor test.

“I think this sort of reducing of his status is pretty unusual,” said Keriann Conroy, research associate at the Energy and Policy Institute. “The only detail that we get from the hearing examiners [is that George] is not qualified because they couldn’t find evidence that he has other significant regulatory experience, so that seems sort of like a denial of his experience in Louisiana in some ways.”

At a November 25 hearing, numerous public commenters expressed opposition to Bernhard’s proposed acquisition of NMGC. Among them was Patricia Brown, a longtime Sante Fe County resident and member of the New Mexico Energy Policy Research Advisory. She argued the PRC’s constitutional duty to regulate the state’s public utilities “was effectively subordinated when the hearing examiners barred from the record the history of fines, violations, audits, investigations and settlements associated with Bernhard Capital Partners and its affiliates.” Brown said that information “is directly relevant to whether the firm can be trusted to operate New Mexico’s gas systems safely, prudently and honestly.”

These types of maneuvers were also seen the last time TXNM tried to sell itself. In November 2021, the New Mexico PRC rejected the company’s proposed merger with Avangrid, an energy services company and subsidiary of the Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola. The ruling concluded nearly two years of regulatory proceedings that exposed the prospective buyers’ “record of poor service, high rates, safety violations, bad faith contracts and market manipulation,” according to NEE.

The following year, PNM and Avangrid appealed the PRC’s decision to the New Mexico Supreme Court. NEE described the move as “an effort to circumvent the authority and oversight of the Commission in their failed attempt to establish a ‘beachhead’ for domination of the energy generation potential in New Mexico at the expense of New Mexico electricity customers.” The group also alleged that “Avangrid and Iberdrola engaged in back door ex-parte communications” to convince the PRC to remand the case. The prospective buyers also threatened legal action against NEE, the only intervenor in the proceeding to oppose the deal, before abandoning their acquisition bid in January 2024.

While that had a favorable outcome from NEE’s standpoint, the persistence shows the disadvantage of public-interest organizations relative to private buyers.

PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS in New Mexico are appointed by the governor to serve six-year terms. In 2020, voters approved a constitutional amendment that restructured the PRC to be governed by three appointees rather than five elected commissioners, who previously served four-year terms. New Mexico has since counted itself among states like Minnesota where the governor is responsible for appointing public utility commissioners. The Prospect previously chronicled BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ efforts to manufacture support for its ultimately successful acquisition of ALLETE, detailing how the Minnesota Department of Commerce consulted with local environmental groups that came out in support of the deal. A similar saga is playing out in New Mexico.

As The Candle reported, Dominic Gabello, a former senior adviser to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) and independent consultant, arranged a meeting between his clients at Bernhard and Grisham to “talk about their vision for the company and how the acquisition is progressing.” Both Gabello and Grisham have been silent on the meeting, which reportedly occurred on the morning of October 11, 2024. The Candle also observed that Gabello has yet to register with the New Mexico secretary of state as a lobbyist for Bernhard.

NEE has been leaning on its twofold outreach strategy to educate New Mexicans about the implications of taking New Mexico utility companies private. “We have a legal strategy, and we have a political strategy, and we at all times try to marry those,” Nanasi told the Prospect. “Our jobs are to be translators.”

As part of its political strategy, NEE has taken to highlighting the inherent irony of the name Blackstone gave to the holding company it will use to acquire PNM: Troy ParentCo.

“The mission of the Trojan horse, a ruse, was to destroy Troy from the inside,” Nanasi said. “Blackstone is offering a Trojan horse to ratepayers; it’s a deceptive gift, and one that will ultimately dominate and destroy us if we allow them to enter New Mexico.”",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Baratta-Blackstone-NM-power.jpg?fit=2121%2C1414&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:05.752060

It’s also important to remember that risk forecasts aren’t guarantees, and climate change isn’t the only factor at play.","Earlier this month, the real-estate listing site Zillow ended a subtle social experiment. In 2024, they began to embed climate risk data directly in their property profiles, scoring a home’s future risks from flood, wildfire, wind, heat, and air quality on a 1-to-10 scale.

Say you are looking for a home in your budget for your growing family, and you find the perfect three-bedroom Cape Cod house — but it’s close to a shoreline. Zillow’s property listing might show that it has a nine out of 10 flood risk score. Depending on your personal risk tolerance, that might rule out the house for you.

Including this information seemed like an obvious move for Zillow. Disasters worsened by warming are contributing to multibillion-dollar damages to homes, and the site’s competitors, such as Redfin, already feature climate risk information in their listings.

“Climate risks are now a critical factor in home-buying decisions,” Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow, said in a statement last year.

Zillow’s own data proved that many homebuyers were indeed starting to think more about climate change alongside square footage, nearby schools, and curb appeal — so much so that real estate agencies and sellers complained that the climate risk scores were starting to hurt sales.

Which is kind of the point.

Giving homebuyers a sense of where warming temperatures could lead to a higher chance of a wildfire or flood should ideally steer people away from properties facing greater danger. Over time, people would buy safer homes — and if they chose to buy in riskier areas, at least they were forewarned and could boost their insurance policies.

Key Takeaways

Real-estate listing site Zillow began including climate disaster risk scores in its property listings last year, but recently removed them after complaints from realtors and sellers that the information was hurting sales.

This is just one example of how sellers, realtors, and governments have sought to limit the use of risk forecasts that factor in climate change because of the effects on real estate.

But just because some want to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to climate risk doesn’t mean these dangers will go away.

Communities that have examined their own risks and taken steps to reduce them have seen benefits. One community near Lake Tahoe managed to reduce property insurance rates after taking steps to reduce wildfire risks.

But climate risk assessments are not great if your current house has a bad score, and you’re trying to sell it. Under pressure from real estate groups, Zillow stopped including them. The climate risks, of course, haven’t gone away.

Welcome to the “la, la, la, can’t hear you” climate era.

In many parts of the US, populations are still increasing in areas vulnerable to disasters such as floods, extreme heat, drought, and fires, while the federal government under President Donald Trump is removing references to climate change from government websites.

People, too, will cover their eyes when the climate reality threatens real estate prices. Clear Lake, Texas, for example, installed signs showing the potential high water mark from storm surge after Hurricane Ike in 2011, but when locals complained that the warnings were hurting sales, the signs were taken down. In 2012, North Carolina outlawed a forecast of sea level rise that showed that many more coastal properties were at risk of flooding over the next century, in favor of adopting a forecast that only looked 30 years ahead.

Yet, while sellers might want to overlook future risks, banks, insurance companies, and buyers don’t want to lose money on what is often their single-most expensive purchase. More costly disaster damages are also taking a bigger bite out of the $55 trillion US residential housing market as a whole.

“I don’t think this is a good thing for anyone but Zillow — people need to know more about their risk, not less,” said Marc Ragin, a researcher studying disaster risk at the University of Georgia, in an email.

Anticipating future threats worsened by climate change is not just about creating warnings, though; they can be useful tools for adapting to climate change. One community that took them seriously actually saved money by lowering their property insurance rates. Here’s how.

What happens when you actually grapple with climate risk

Wildfires regularly confront the communities around Lake Tahoe in Nevada and California. Though the flames rarely make it into neighborhoods, the basin is often bathed in choking smoke from nearby blazes, and residents are starting to realize that it’s only a matter of time before they will face an inferno up close.

The Tahoe Fund, a nonprofit, took an unflinching look at the wildfire risks in the area and launched a pilot project this year to create “the most fire-ready community in Tahoe.” They laid out their process in a playbook for reducing fire risks that they hope any place looking to reduce the odds of homes going up in flames could draw on.

They began with a homeowners association in pine-forested Incline Village, Nevada — home to 9,000 people — where the average home price is $1.4 million. The association, Tyrolian Village, is composed of 228 homes. Using a mix of fire risk models, the Tahoe Fund team identified the areas most primed to burn. The models they used were more sophisticated than those used on real estate sites and more tailored to the community, but it helped the team get more bang for their buck when it came to figuring out what tactics would best improve the neighborhood’s fire resilience.

“Through technology, you don’t necessarily need to do everything,” said Amy Berry, who leads the Tahoe Fund. “You need to do the things that are the most important that are going to have the biggest impact on lowering risk.”

They then reached out to community leaders to set priorities for measures like reducing fuel loads in public areas, building defensible spaces, and making homes more fire-resistant, drawing on public funds and private donations. The pilot project also gave homeowners individual fire risk assessments and to-do lists, offering grants to spur owners of the highest-priority homes to act.

The effort is already starting to produce results. Tyrolian Village saw its home insurance premiums drop by one-third. Berry said that this kind of targeted risk reduction could be applied in many places.

Insurance looms in the background of any discussion of disasters. In California, insurance companies have been dropping customers whose wildfire risks were too hot to handle. In states like Florida and Louisiana, some private insurers have stopped insuring new properties, gone bankrupt, or left the market entirely. The federally backed National Flood Insurance Program is continually losing billions of dollars. So, a project that measurably reduces risks is encouraging.

Yet, there are still many people in the community who are reluctant to grapple with the threats they face. “We emailed everyone. We sent postcards. We said open your reports, so you know what to do, and only 50 of the homeowners have opened their reports,” Berry said.

It’s also important to remember that risk forecasts aren’t guarantees, and climate change isn’t the only factor at play. Plenty of homes that aren’t in established flood zones still flood, while some in high-risk areas have kept their basements dry. The same goes for homes inside and outside high fire-risk zones.

Still, having even a vague sense of where risks to property are higher and lower can be useful for planning things like storm drains and seawalls. Individual homebuyers could start to include climate risk assessments in their home inspections, checking structures for fire-resistant materials and water runoff alongside termite damage and cracks in the foundation.

But, that requires buyers to realize these perils are out there. Past research showed that another driver of real estate prices in vulnerable areas was belief in climate change. Homes in at-risk communities where people took threats of rising temperatures seriously sold for less than in flood zones where residents did not think climate change was a problem.

People also quickly forget the lessons of past disasters, often rebuilding and expanding in an area that’s flooded or burned. And it’s even harder to get people to adapt to things that they’ve never experienced before.

So, while forecasting climate change and adapting to emerging threats are still immense challenges, the biggest hurdle is human behavior, getting people to actually engage with the dangers they face. Hiding this information can only help sellers for a little while before the bill comes due.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GettyImages-1243090769.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:40.294543

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement.
“The SRS program is vital to maintaining schools, roads and emergency response services in rural, forested counties,” Crapo said in the press release.
“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement.
Reporter James Brooks of the Alaska Beacon and Editor Christina Lords of the Idaho Capital Sun contributed to this report.","After letting funding lapse for nearly two years, Congress voted to renew crucial federal funding that rural counties and schools have counted on for a quarter century.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West, including Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo.

The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”

Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.

In Idaho, $22.8 million was distributed across 34 counties to help pay for educational programs, emergency response systems and other services in Fiscal Year 2023, according to a press release from Crapo’s office.

“The SRS program is vital to maintaining schools, roads and emergency response services in rural, forested counties,” Crapo said in the press release. “We have a responsibility to these communities who house large swaths of untaxable federal land. The passage of this legislation will provide retroactive pay to counties that faced deep cuts since the program’s expiration at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 and restore funding levels for FY 2026. I continue to press for a long-term solution to provide Idaho’s county governments with more certainty.”

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.

U.S. House hasn’t voted on Secure Rural Schools funding after bill passed the Senate

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Crapo, a Republican.

But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.

Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.

Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”

Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.

In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.

Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

Distillates rose by 1 million barrels yet overall experienced a decrease of 2.88 million barrels.","Gasoline prices are at the lowest level since 2021, making life more affordable—and seeing that “affordability” is a new favorite word of the left, that should be a major win. Of course, the left will point out that electricity prices have been soaring, but that is directly attributable to the record demand that has happened because of power centers and demand from artificial intelligence that is growing our economy and the lack of investment in infrastructure that occurred due to democrat overregulation and the push toward green energy.

The leftist energy policies pushing toward green energy resulted in higher regulatory costs and set the American power infrastructure back years. However, under President Trump, they are realizing that meeting this demand in the future is like the Manhattan Project, and they will get caught up

Funny how quickly the left forgets their promises of energy affordability. Remember President Biden’s much-hyped green energy push—centered on the 2024 Inflation Reduction Act and its $391 billion in so-called clean energy incentives—was supposed to make energy cheaper, cut emissions, and spark a jobs revolution. I am waiting!

Energy costs began to escalate when policies designed to incentivize renewables—such as tax credits for solar, wind, and electric vehicles—did not deliver the expected savings. I was shocked. Instead, gasoline prices rose sharply, with some states seeing costs exceed $5 per gallon in 2022. Utility bills also surged by 20 to 30 percent in states with a strong focus on renewables.

Billions of dollars were funneled into projects, like “climate-friendly ketchup” which might taste good and eminent domain actions and trying to make energy production more politically correct and threatening energy companies with lawsuits and pushing affirmative action in the industry. Grid reliability suffered as the Biden administration pushed for an aggressive net-zero emissions goal by 2050 and a fully clean grid by 2035. They pushed their aspirational goals at the expense of the American people and their so-called precious affordability.

The Biden administration had this fossil fuel fantasy that they could replace fossil fuels without reliable backup systems in place that also led to instability and blackouts in many energies markets. The inflation reduction ask also focused and renewable energy supports sources and funnel to realize the importance of energy storage causing delays and volatility in the electrical grid.

They destroyed incentives for reasonable expansions of the electric grid because of their focus on their pet green energy projects and with the administration supporting states that canceled pipelines oil pipelines trying to make new building with natural gas impossible it turned out to be a major disaster that raised inflation

Fossil fuels were phased out too quickly, before reliable backup systems were in place, leading to blackouts and instability in energy markets. The Inflation Reduction Act’s emphasis on intermittent renewable sources neglected the importance of energy storage, causing delays and volatility within the electrical grid.

Despite the focus on green policies, fossil fuels remained central to U.S. energy production, reaching record highs under Biden with 13 million barrels of oil produced per day by 2023, casting doubt on the feasibility of the administration’s emissions reduction targets. Meanwhile, job losses in the fossil fuel sector outpaced gains in green jobs—over 100,000 fossil fuel positions were lost due to permitting delays and EPA regulations, while about 300,000 new green jobs were created, but not distributed evenly across the country.

States like Pennsylvania and West Virginia—energy powerhouses—were hit hardest by the administration’s so-called “green pivot.” These are states where energy jobs keep families fed and local economies humming, but instead they faced the brunt of misguided policies. All those promises to “bring manufacturing home”?

What a scam! Sure, the subsidies spawned a handful of shiny electric vehicle battery plants, but the reality is that sky-high costs and China’s iron grip on critical supply chains meant average Americans never saw those benefits.

The bottom line: Biden’s green energy experiment made for a great press release but delivered little when it came to affordable, dependable energy. In the end, everyday Americans are still footing the bill—just check your gas pump and utility statement. The dream of cheap, clean energy? That’s still just a dream, not a reality. If anything, Biden’s policies have made it even harder for families to keep the lights on and their tanks full.

Yet it also is about President Trump foreign policy that has brought down gas prices. Yesterday Z- Man energy pointed out that President Trump has given President Zelensky a limited timeframe to respond to Russia’s proposed peace plan and is advocating for elections to be held in Ukraine. In response, Zelensky is preparing to present a European-backed peace plan tomorrow, indicating that with sufficient security guarantees, early elections could be feasible next year.

Energy prices are trying to make a comeback today after Monday’s massive sell-off and the continued pressure that followed. But let’s be clear—if you’re scanning those , there’s no sign of the oil glut everyone’s been buzzing about. Even the Energy Information Administration’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook hints at a landscape that could shift dramatically at any moment.

The API figures indicated that gasoline inventories increased by 7 million barrels, followed by a reduction of 3.1 million barrels. Distillates rose by 1 million barrels yet overall experienced a decrease of 2.88 million barrels. stocks declined by 4.8 million, an additional 1.7 million, and a further 2.48 million barrels. Cushing inventories also decreased by 0.89 million barrels. These trends suggest that expectations of oversupply may require reassessment.

The in their “Short-Term Energy Outlook is still looking for an oil glut. The EIA says that looking ahead, global oil inventories are expected to rise through 2026, which is likely to exert downward pressure on oil prices in the coming months. Brent crude oil prices are forecast to average $55 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and remain near that level throughout the year. Despite the anticipated decline in crude oil prices, OPEC+ production strategies and China’s ongoing inventory accumulation are projected to help limit further price reductions.

In the natural gas market, the Henry Hub spot price is expected to average almost $4.30 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) this winter—an increase of over 40 cents/MMBtu compared to last month’s projection—primarily due to colder-than-expected December weather driving up demand for space heating. However, milder weather anticipated in early 2026 and rising production are expected to moderate prices, with the Henry Hub price averaging around $4.00/MMBtu for the year.

In terms of electricity generation, U.S. power sector output is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and by 1.7% in 2026. This marks a change from the relatively flat generation seen between 2010 and 2020, with the increase mainly attributable to higher demand from large customers such as data centers, particularly in areas managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the PJM Interconnection. The forecast for generation growth in 2026 has been revised downward from last month’s outlook, based on the actual amount of large load electricity demand that has materialized so far this year.

Natural gas markets experienced an exciting ride as EBW Analytics highlighted a breakout rally late last week, with prices soaring to $5.496 on the back of frigid December forecasts that spurred robust short covering. Although prices dipped 94.5¢ to Tuesday’s low when weather models shifted to milder predictions, the stage looks set for a partial recovery in the near term, especially with daily heating demand expected to ramp up into the upcoming weekend.

Adding to the positive momentum, LNG exports have reached record highs while production has tapered off. This trend could further tighten core fundamentals as we head into mid-winter. While winter weather will be the primary driver for pricing and the recent market volatility may take time to stabilize, several upbeat factors—including a shrinking storage surplus compared to five-year averages, elevated LNG exports, supply freeze-off risks, a bullish market skew, and DTN’s outlook for a chilly January—all point toward a favorable medium-term outlook for natural gas prices according to EBW.

Fox Weather is generating excitement with its latest reports, indicating that the eastern U.S. could experience its first major snowstorm of the season this weekend, particularly along the Interstate 95 corridor—if the incoming cold air collides with moisture racing across the country. Current computer forecast model guidance will lead to snow arriving in the Midwest on Saturday and pushing into the Northeast by Sunday. Still, there’s considerable uncertainty regarding snowfall amounts and locations, so residents in the Midwest and Northeast should stay tuned for updated forecasts as the week unfolds.

The FOX Forecast Center adds to the anticipation, explaining that forecast models showing the Polar Vortex’s circulation weakening later this week into the weekend. This shift is expected to allow even more cold air to spill into the Midwest and Northeast, following record low temperatures already reported Tuesday in New England.

For context, the Polar Vortex is a large, persistent zone of low pressure and frigid air situated near the poles, about 10–30 miles above Earth’s surface. When the Polar Vortex is strong, the coldest air remains confined to the Arctic regions; but as it weakens, that bitter cold can plunge into the lower atmosphere. Dips in the Pacific jet stream then help funnel this Arctic air from Canada into the Lower 48, setting the stage for dramatic winter weather events.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 13:01:43.145316

Evers’ efforts to ensure Wisconsin’s kids and families have clean, safe drinking water is available here.","MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR), today announced more than $159 million has been allocated for financial assistance through the Lead Service Line Replacement Program to 29 municipalities across the state to ensure Wisconsinites have access to clean, safe drinking water that is free of lead. The funding will help municipalities replace lead service lines, with a special focus on small and disadvantaged communities.

“There is no safe level of lead, period, and getting these harmful contaminants out of our water systems once and for all has been a top priority of my administration since Day One,” said Gov. Evers. “Wisconsin has been a national leader in spearheading lead service line replacement efforts, and thanks in part to the bipartisan, pro-kid 2025-27 Biennial Budget I signed earlier this year, in which we were able to increase borrowing for the Environmental Improvement Fund by over $730 million to help meet statewide demand for low-interest financing for clean water and safe drinking water loans, dozens of municipalities across the state are getting a much-needed boost to continue this important work.”

Passed by the U.S. Congress in 2021, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) included $50 billion for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to strengthen and rebuild the nation’s water infrastructure. This historic investment provided $15 billion for lead service line identification and replacement nationwide.

A subprogram of the federal Safe Drinking Water Loan Program, the Lead Service Line Replacement Program, utilizing federal BIL funding, provides funding to municipalities for both public and private lead service line replacements and related lead service line inventory work to protect public health. Since the first version of the Lead Service Line Replacement Program began in state fiscal year 2017, the DNR and the Wisconsin Department of Administration have provided more than $267 million in financial assistance to Wisconsin municipalities for lead service line replacement projects. Additional information about the current Lead Service Line Replacement Program can be found online here.

“Every family, every business, every school, and every community needs to know when they turn on their tap, it’s clean water coming out. Sadly, that is just not the case in too many of our communities, and the consequences of lead poisoning, especially for our children, are dire,” said U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin). “That’s why I am so proud to have voted for the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to replace dangerous lead pipes, delivering clean water to families across the state and creating good-paying jobs in the process.”

Funding requested for the current cycle totaled over $182 million. Any project that was not fully funded will be offered base Safe Drinking Water Loan Program funds that will be at the standard subsidized loan interest rate at either 55 percent or 33 percent of the market rate, rather than the 0.25 percent rate offered for loan funds from the BIL Lead Service Line capitalization grant. See the DNR’s Interest Rates webpage for more information.

According to the DNR, throughout the state, there are more than 132,000 known public side lead service lines, more than 128,000 known private side lead service lines, and more than 208,000 service lines of unknown composition that may contain lead. This funding will help municipalities continue their efforts toward the goal of replacing the remaining lead service lines.

Examples of preliminarily approved projects include:

Milwaukee | Over $50 million

The city of Milwaukee was allocated over $50 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $19 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Racine | $40 million

The city of Racine was allocated $40 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $21 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Manitowoc | Over $14 million

The city of Manitowoc was allocated over $14 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which nearly $7.3 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Oshkosh | Over $6 million

The city of Oshkosh was allocated over $6 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $2.7 million of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Chippewa Falls | Over $1.9 million

The city of Chippewa Falls was allocated over $1.9 million in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which $957,750 of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Thorp | Over $733,000

The city of Thorp was allocated over $733,000 in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which more than $366,000 of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

Rice Lake | $732,500

The city of Rice Lake was allocated $732,500 in Lead Service Line Replacement funding, of which nearly $550,000 of these funds are lead service line principal forgiveness, with the remainder through a loan with a 0.25 percent interest rate.

The 2026 Lead Service Line Replacement Program funding list is available here. Additional information on Lead Service Line Replacement funding is available here.

Gov. Evers has made efforts to replace lead service lines across the state a top priority. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers announced the Wisconsin Department of Health Services finalized a new rule, making permanent an emergency rule that the governor approved in January, to combat lead poisoning statewide by lowering the lead poisoning threshold to 3.5 µg/dL. By lowering the lead poisoning threshold, more kids and families will be eligible for lead poisoning and intervention resources, including education programming, screening, care coordination or follow-up services for kids not covered by a third-party payer, and other activities related to poisoning or exposure.

Additionally, the governor’s 2025-27 Biennial Budget proposal included an investment of more than $300 million to help get lead out of Wisconsinites’ pipes, bubblers, schools, homes, and child care centers for good. Unfortunately, Republicans in the Wisconsin State Legislature gutted the governor’s efforts to clean up lead, PFAS, and other harmful contaminants statewide and rejected hundreds of millions of dollars in investments to ensure kids, families, and farmers have access to safe and clean drinking water. Despite this setback, Gov. Evers maintains that replacing lead service lines and ensuring Wisconsinites have access to clean and safe water is essential.

ADDITIONAL EVERS ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO ENSURE WISCONSINITES HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN, SAFE DRINKING WATER

Gov. Evers declared 2019 the Year of Clean Drinking Water, and for the past six years, the governor has prioritized efforts to invest in clean water infrastructure and ensure Wisconsinites have access to safe, clean water statewide. Earlier this year, Gov. Evers declared 2025 the Year of the Kid in Wisconsin and announced several new efforts to address childhood lead poisoning and ensure clean drinking water for all, many of which were included in the 2025-27 bipartisan, pro-kid budget that the governor signed earlier this year.

To continue building upon the governor’s work to ensure Wisconsin’s kids and families have clean, safe drinking water, the 2025-27 Biennial Budget increases borrowing for the state’s Environmental Improvement Fund by $731.6 million to secure federal clean water and safe drinking water capitalization grants over the next four years. This will help meet the increasing demand from local communities who need support to upgrade local water systems and infrastructure to ensure every Wisconsin kid, family, and community has clean, safe drinking water.

In addition, the 2025-27 Biennial Budget provides:

$2 million for the development of a remedial action plan for the remediation of arsenic-contaminated sediment in the Kewaunee Marsh;

$4 million to be used for remedial action at the Amcast Superfund site;

$6 million in bonding to be used for the Kenosha Dunes restoration project;

$7.5 million for contaminated sediment removal from sites in the Great Lakes or its tributaries that are on Wisconsin’s impaired waters list to continue protecting this resource;

$4 million for Urban Nonpoint Source cost-sharing and the Municipal Flood Control Program;

$6.5 million to counties for capital projects that implement land and water resource management plans under the Targeted Runoff Management Program;

$7 million for grants to counties for implementation of land and water resource management plans, including cost-share grants to landowners that install conservation practices on their land, such as erosion prevention strategies, through the Soil and Water Resource Management Program;

$4 million for the repair, reconstruction, and removal of dams;

Over $1.8 million over the biennium to update the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources’ systems and improve customer service for Wisconsinites; and

More than $12 million to support county conservation staff around the state.

Additionally, Gov. Evers has been clear that his top priority in the 2025-27 Biennial Budget would be to pass a pro-kid budget that makes meaningful investments in Wisconsin’s kids at every stage and every age, from early childhood to K-12 to our higher education institutions, as well as ensuring kids and families have access to safe, clean drinking water. More information about the bipartisan pro-kid budget signed by Gov. Evers is available here. More on Gov. Evers’ efforts to ensure Wisconsin’s kids and families have clean, safe drinking water is available here.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-12-10 15:01:32.246736

About Empire State Development","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that People Center, Inc., d/b/a Rippling, a leading workforce management software company, will again expand its New York City operations, creating 371 new full-time jobs and expanding its presence in Manhattan. Empire State Development (ESD) is supporting the company’s expansion with up to $3.4 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits in exchange for job creation and continued investment in New York.

“New York continues to be the place where innovative companies choose to grow, hire and invest,” Governor Hochul said. “By once again expanding its footprint in Manhattan and creating hundreds of new jobs, Rippling is strengthening New York City’s position as a global technology hub and contributing to our state’s fast-growing innovation economy.”

Rippling plans to relocate from its current office at 4 World Trade Center to a larger space at 330 West 34th Street, expanding its New York footprint to more than 130,000 square feet. The company currently employs more than 500 people in New York City. This announcement builds on Empire State Development’s previous support for Rippling’s initial New York City expansion, when the company was awarded up to $3.5 million in Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits for the creation of 391 jobs — a goal that Rippling has already surpassed, growing its New York workforce faster than anticipated. That expansion helped establish Rippling’s New York office as a key hub for research and development.

Founded in 2016, Rippling has experienced tremendous growth and provides an all-in-one platform that helps businesses manage HR, IT, and finance functions from a single system.

Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York continues to attract the world’s most innovative companies. Rippling’s decision to expand in New York City reflects the strength of our tech ecosystem, the quality of our workforce, and our commitment to supporting businesses that drive economic growth and create good jobs.”

Rippling Co-Founder and CEO Parker Conrad said, “Most companies are stuck using a set of fragmented, siloed tools to run their business. It’s inefficient, it slows the company down, and it puts you at a real disadvantage with your competitors. Rippling solves this problem by helping companies manage and automate every part of the business across HR, IT and Finance with a single, unified system. Our clients run on Rippling so they can run their businesses with greater speed and clarity. We are grateful for the Governor’s support as we expand our team and footprint in NYC”

Empire State Development’s Excelsior Jobs Program provides performance-based tax credits to businesses in targeted industries — including technology, life sciences and advanced manufacturing — that create jobs or make significant capital investments in New York State.

Rippling’s expansion builds on a series of major technology-sector investments supported by ESD in recent years — including those by companies like Bilt and Figma — reinforcing New York’s leadership in innovation and digital growth.

New York’s Growing Tech Economy

New York’s tech sector continues to be one of the fastest-growing in the nation, adding tens of thousands of jobs and billions in venture investment each year. Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York State has gained over 34,000 new jobs in the technology industry, with New York City being home to more than 2,000 AI start-ups. Since the pandemic, the number of technology businesses in the state has increased by 27 percent to 31,000 businesses, and the New York City technology sector has added jobs at nearly 10 times the rate of the city’s overall economy.

The €220 million development will be important both locally and nationally, creating 2000 long-term jobs for the region, while also supporting the country’s renewable energy targets. Located at Rosslare Europort in County Wexford, the project will transform Rosslare Harbour into Ireland’s primary base for the construction, operation, and maintenance of offshore wind farms in the Irish and Celtic Seas.

The development represents a key step in meeting Ireland’s renewable energy targets and in positioning the southeast region at the forefront of the new green economy. The government has committed to achieving at least 5 GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030; Rosslare ORE Hub will have the potential to support the installation of approximately 0.5 GW to 1 GW of offshore wind capacity each year.

Subject to planning being granted and funding allocated, Iarnród Éireann aims to commence construction in early 2027, with delivery targeted for early 2029.

Chief Executive of Iarnród Éireann, Mary Considine, said: “The Rosslare ORE Hub marks a once in a generation investment in Ireland’s clean energy future, integrating national transport and maritime infrastructure to unlock offshore wind potential and deliver sustainable growth for coastal communities. It will also be a significant boost for the South East, creating jobs in an emerging and vital industry, and becoming a crucial asset in Ireland’s energy transition journey.”

Spanning 80 ha., the Rosslare ORE Hub will include two new heavy lift berths specifically designed for offshore renewable energy components, extensive areas for storage, marshalling and assembly and a new 64-berth, small boat harbour. The project also includes new access roads, utilities, environmental enhancements and facilities for local marine users, including the Rosslare Sea Scouts.

The planned works comprise 50 ha. of dredging, 32 ha. of land reclamation, including the creation of 19.7 ha. of new port lands capable of handling the largest wind turbine components. These facilities will enable Rosslare to serve multiple offshore wind projects underway in the Irish and Celtic Seas and deliver long-term economic and employment benefits to County Wexford and the southeast.

Glenn Carr, Director Commercial Business Units with Iarnród Éireann, Port Authority for Rosslare Europort, added: “Lodging planning for Rosslare’s ORE Hub is a significant milestone in the development of this critical piece of infrastructure that will support the development, growth and long-term operation of the offshore wind industry in Ireland’s South East region. Delivering this nationally significant infrastructure will support the continued expansion Rosslare Europort, strengthen the local economy, support local employment and deliver on national and EU policy priorities.”

The project, which is owned by Iarnród Éireann, has also been co-funded to planning stage by the EU Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The 2000 jobs created by Rosslare ORE Hub will span port construction, offshore wind construction activity and long-term operation and maintenance phases of offshore wind development.

Work is currently underway on approximately 27 hectares to create access roads and transport routes across the hilly forest area. Foundations are scheduled to be laid from May 2026, allowing the turbines to be installed in the last quarter of 2026.

With a total capacity of 18 MW, the turbines are expected to supply electricity for around 25,000 people, roughly one-third of Arnsberg’s population. Commercial operation is planned for spring 2027.

According to VSB, the location within the “Arnsberger Wald” protected landscape presents particular challenges for technical planning and environmental protection. The company welcomes the agreement with the local conservation authority and regional forestry offices on compensation measures and the promotion of resilient mixed deciduous forests. Approximately 70,000 square meters of site-appropriate deciduous forest will be newly planted.

In addition to supplying clean energy, the wind park will also benefit the city of Arnsberg economically. VSB shares 0.2 euro cents per kilowatt-hour generated with municipalities under § 6 of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). “Few regions illustrate as clearly as the Hochsauerland how closely nature, quality of life and the energy transition are interconnected.

Leveraging social behavior factors of pregnant women in Louisiana and in vivo models to study the impact of maternal vaping on birth outcomes and asthma in offspring

Goal: Identify the relationship between pregnancy intent, maternal vaping, and birth outcomes, including in an in vivo model to assess prenatally exposed offspring’s risk of developing chronic lung disease and asthma. Develop preventive and interventional strategies.

Wins: The team discovered that different sociodemographic characteristics, stress, and health conditions shape the use of cigarettes versus e-cigarettes before and during pregnancy. They also highlight the importance of complete cessation for improving birth outcomes and suggest e-cigarette use may follow different behavioral and social patterns than traditional smoking. Cigarette use during pregnancy was associated with lower socio-economic status, whereas e-cigarette use was not. While in an experimental model, prenatal exposure to e-cigarettes also reduced birth weight and decreased lung function. Overall, this study emphasizes the need for tailored public-health messaging that both promotes cessation and addresses the emerging dynamics of e-cigarette use during pregnancy.

What’s next? Continue to analyze the in vivo experiments to look at dust-mite-induced asthma and how it impacts the lungs of offspring exposed prenatally to e-cigarettes.

Wins: The team has designed, manufactured, and validated sensor systems, including custom-printed circuit boards cast in silicone, with optional placement in players’ helmets, chinstraps, and handwarmers. A 3D brain model was also successfully developed to simulate brain deformation under repeated impacts.

What’s next? Work with two Baton Rouge-area high school football teams—Catholic High School and St. Michael High School—on potential implementation.

On the team: Genevieve Palardy, Hunter Gilbert, Robert Herbert, and Andrew Becnel (LSU Mechanical and Industrial Engineering), Kshitiz Upadhyay (Aerospace Engineering & Mechanics at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities), and Dr. Shannon Alwood, Greggory Davis, Dr. Richard Lewis, and Dr. Michael Truax Jr. (LSU Health New Orleans, Our Lady of the Lake).

Preventing childhood obesity through AI-assisted behavioral counseling

Goal: Combat childhood obesity, as the state of Louisiana has one of the highest obesity rates in the nation with 40% among adults and 22% among children. Use geographic information systems, or GIS, to map disparities in childhood obesity risk across Louisiana communities. Conduct a clinical trial with Louisiana adolescents to test the effect of the LSU-built ProudMe program (Preventing Obesity Using Digital-assisted Movement and Eating) over a summer.

Wins: The team has completed its mapping of childhood obesity and obesity risk in Louisiana and found significant disparities related to walkability, park access, and food environments across Louisiana communities. The researchers have successfully developed the ProudMe app to enable AI-assisted health behavior management for adolescents. They conducted a pilot trial of the ProudMe summer intervention in 2025 (it was a two-week, half-day summer camp followed by digital self-monitoring and engagement with parents over five weeks). The camp made a clear impact on participants’ weight (i.e. waist circumference).

What’s next? Recruit a larger sample with random group assignments in summer 2026. Improve the ProudMe app user experience. Focus on removing barriers to post-camp lifestyle changes. Make campers’ summer days more structured. Leverage the research findings to compete for larger NIH grant funding.

On the team: Senlin Chen (LSU Kinesiology), Amanda Staiano (Pennington Biomedical), Fahui Wang (LSU Geography and Anthropology), David Shepherd (LSU Computer Science & Engineering), Dr. Stewart Gordon (Louisiana Healthcare Connections), Dr. Katie Queen (Our Lady of the Lake Children’s Health).

That marked a 45% decline year-on-year and made stationary storage the lowest-priced segment for the first time ever.
The research firm’s Energy Storage Market Outlook Report for the first half of 2025, published in October, forecasted an estimated 92GW/247GWh of energy storage, excluding pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) deployments, worldwide for this year.
Both average battery pack price and turnkey system costs saw their biggest falls since 2017 between 2023-2024.
Chinese manufacturers intensify competition, 3% fall predicted for 2026 There continue to be significant differences among regions: China saw the largest decline in average battery pack prices (13%), followed by Europe (8%).","Those metal price increases, particularly for cobalt, will have affected the electric vehicle (EV) segments more than the stationary battery energy storage system (BESS) segment, where an almost total switchover to lithium iron phosphate (LFP) from nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) or similar sub-chemistries has eliminated the BESS market’s dependence on cobalt.

Indeed, where EV battery cost reductions in 2024 were hailed as a breakthrough that meant that, at US$97/kWh average pack prices, battery vehicles were at cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in China and expected to follow elsewhere, this year BNEF reported a global average of US$99/kWh for battery EV (BEV) packs in 2025.

BNEF assessed 320 data points from across passenger EVs, e-buses, commercial EVs, two- and three-wheeler vehicles and stationary energy storage.

Stationary storage now the lowest-cost segment

Stationary energy storage, in fact, saw the most significant drop in price of any segment, with average battery pack prices found to be just US$70/kWh globally. That marked a 45% decline year-on-year and made stationary storage the lowest-priced segment for the first time ever.

This was due to growing competition in China and the country’s commensurate “massive overcapacity for battery cells specifically aimed at stationary storage applications,” the authors wrote, which was a significant driver of aggressive cost reductions.

BNEF said China currently has an estimated 557GWh annual stationary energy storage cell production capacity, which is roughly double the global demand in the sector.

The research firm’s Energy Storage Market Outlook Report for the first half of 2025, published in October, forecasted an estimated 92GW/247GWh of energy storage, excluding pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) deployments, worldwide for this year.

That said, the stationary storage industry will likely be keeping an eye out for a separate annual BNEF report, the Battery Storage System Cost Survey, which examines the entire system-level prices of turnkey BESS equipment worldwide.

Expected early in the New Year, the system cost survey last year found a 40% fall from 2023 numbers to US$165/kWh in 2024 (ESN Premium article). Both average battery pack price and turnkey system costs saw their biggest falls since 2017 between 2023-2024.

The average cost for a turnkey system in China in 2024 was just US$101/kWh (1-hour, 2-hour and 4-hour duration BESS). In the US, the average was US$236/kWh and in Europe US$275/kWh, and so it will be interesting to compare this year’s battery pack price data with system-level costs when they are published.

Chinese manufacturers intensify competition, 3% fall predicted for 2026

There continue to be significant differences among regions: China saw the largest decline in average battery pack prices (13%), followed by Europe (8%). North American pack prices fell just 4% year-on-year.

With Chinese exports to the US restricted by changes in both domestic US policy and international tariff disputes, Chinese manufacturers are shifting export volumes to Europe instead, which BNEF said intensified price competition in Europe.

The adoption of LFP, which is also becoming more common for shorter-range EVs where energy density is less important than cost, helped absorb the higher cost of metals, as did long-term contracts and other hedging strategies.

The lowest LFP cell price BNEF found was US$36/kWh and the lowest LFP pack price US$50/kWh, similar to numbers for last year and evidence, the researchers said, that low-cost products are not outliers in LFP.

After the temporary 2021-2022 pandemic-era reversal of cost declines, contracting supply deals with prices indexed to the cost of raw materials became more common, as did increased diversification of supply chains.

Although the metal price increases did not translate into higher costs for cells or packs, BNEF expects high cobalt, lithium, and nickel costs to exert pressure on manufacturer margins. While most manufacturers will be able to absorb and ride out the impacts in the near term, a persistent elevation of metal prices would likely result in short-term price rises.

For 2026, BNEF predicts a 3% decline in pack price across all segments, resulting in an average of just under US$105/kWh. Raw material price pressures are likely to persist, but the increased adoption of lower cost LFP will help drive next year’s falling price dynamics, BNEF said.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CATL-indonesia-fatory-rendering.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:00:51.703054

PETERSBURG, Fla. – Today, Duke Energy Florida announced the completion of two new solar energy sites: Half Moon Renewable Energy Center in Sumter County and Rattler Renewable Energy Center in Hernando County.

Why it matters

Expanding solar energy helps displace the cost of fuel, like natural gas, that would otherwise be needed to generate electricity. This creates savings for customers because the price Duke Energy Florida pays for fuel is a direct pass-through cost reflected on their bills.

The two solar sites each produce 74.9 megawatts (MW) of clean energy that have been added to the electric grid, saving the company’s 2 million customers an estimated $500 million over their service lifetimes.

These sites are part of the first phase of an agreement with the Florida Public Service Commission to build 12 new solar sites between 2025 and 2027. Together, these 12 sites will create 900 MW of energy and save customers a total of approximately $3 billion throughout their service lifetimes.

Our view

“Our customers are the motivation for our ongoing solar energy expansion – as they are for everything we do, every day,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “Each new solar site creates considerable savings for them, while diversifying and strengthening our generation fleet, ensuring we’re delivering on our commitment to providing safe, reliable energy at the lowest price possible.”

Zoom out

Duke Energy Florida currently owns, operates and maintains a portfolio of more than 30 solar energy sites across the state that contribute approximately 1,700 MW to the system.

By the end of 2033, Duke Energy Florida projects to have over 6,100 MW of utility-scale solar generating capacity online.

Duke Energy Florida

Duke Energy Florida, a subsidiary of Duke Energy, owns 12,300 megawatts of energy capacity, supplying electricity to 2 million residential, commercial and industrial customers across a 13,000-square-mile service area in Florida.

America has been the only nation in the world that has been actively rolling back permits for renewable energy projects, such as the federal government cancelling funding for a green hydrogen hub in California. Despite these ups and downs in the embrace of the sector, Coastal Virginia’s 2.6 GW offshore wind project remains on track to be completed by the end of next year.

Dominion Energy notes that the Coastal Virginia offshore wind project remains on schedule

Dominion Energy has stated that the project remains on track for a 2026 completion date. The project underscores the significant challenges in the US energy market for wind energy projects. This can be attributed to the apparent disdain that the current administration has for renewable energy generation, with wind power in particular aggravating President Donald Trump.

Dominion provides a stable energy supply for millions of customers in the Carolinas and Virginia, and has been working exceedingly hard to find an amicable solution to advance renewable energy projects in the United States. In Q3 of 2025, Dominion’s electric sales rose to $921 million, which is slightly more than the previous year, which came in at around $836 million.

The astonishingly huge offshore wind project will reshape the regional energy supply

Due to the fact that the US federal government has been actively rolling back permits for renewable energy projects, the 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project stands as a pillar of strength in a nation that has become exceedingly hard to operate wind projects in, or even get them past the planning phase. Once completed in late 2026, the project will be the largest offshore wind development in the United States by a long shot.

2026 will see the first electricity delivered to customers from the wind farm

During a recent earnings call, Dominion’s leadership noted that the project will begin delivering first electrons next year, with a full-scale launch expected by the end of 2026. Dominion’s CEO, Robert Blue, noted that while expectations are for the project to be completed by late next year, the installation of the final wind turbine may slip into early 2027.

Blue also noted during the earnings call that the total project costs are estimated to come in at around $11.2 billion, and include an unused contingency of $206 million. Due to the tariff situation in the global market, costs may increase next year by an astonishing $690 million. Despite the uncertainty of the estimated costs associated with the project, Blue notes that the project could save up to $3 billion for customers during its first decade of operations. Wind power generation has swept across the entire energy biosphere, with Europe embracing it like a long-lost family member.

“It’s the fastest way to get 2.6 GW on the grid that’s going to serve AI and technology companies, defense and security installations. It’s critical to important infrastructure upgrades at the Oceana Naval Air Station. And if you stop it now, it causes energy inflation.” – Dominon CEO, Robert Blue

Advancements in wind energy generation technology have reshaped global sentiments

While the United States faces an uncertain future in the renewable energy market, other regions of the world have taken a much more welcoming approach to the sector. Substantial advancements in wind energy technology have become a regular occurrence in the modern-day energy market and could potentially reshape the global adoption of the sector. The US will need to rethink its strategy for the renewable energy sector if it aims not to be left behind by the progress made in implementing new wind and other renewable energy projects in the future.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/45.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:36.441126

In a national survey of 1,000 likely voters, with an oversample of Black and Latino voters, 83% of respondents reported that their energy costs had increased over the last few years.

That’s near unanimous concern, regardless of race, political affiliation, or education. Over half (51%) of respondents say energy costs have increased a lot, while just 11% say they’ve stayed the same

Environmental advocates say that renewable energy alone can lower prices. The White House plan to slash bills relies on limiting electricity production to a ‘some of the above’ strategy with coal at its center. Americans aren’t buying either strategy.

On Electricity, Americans Want Fossil Fuels AND Clean Energy

Our research shows that a majority (59%) thinks a mix of clean energy and fossil fuels is best for the United States’s electricity sector. Most respondents have a favorable view of clean energy, including wind and solar (68%), as well as natural gas (73% favorable). Favorability of clean energy climbs to 76% when nuclear is included alongside wind and solar. Even oil and petroleum are above water, with 58% favorable and 35% unfavorable.

Partisanship does alter support for individual energy technologies, but not as much as one might think—59% of Democrats are favorable to natural gas, and 54% of Republicans are favorable to clean energy, including nuclear, wind, and solar. Republican favorability decreases to 37%, however, when asked about clean energy, including just wind and solar, and excluding nuclear.

Though party leaders and ideologues might be purists about one technology or another, Americans aren’t. They’re practical, and they understand that a mix of energy sources is the best way to achieve reliable energy.

Clean Energy Today, Lower Costs…Some Day

An overwhelming majority of Americans believe building more energy in the US will lower energy costs (82%). A slightly smaller share believes the US building more clean energy specifically will cut costs (73%). At the most basic level, Americans understand that building more energy helps lower costs and increases reliability.

Perception varies across individual technologies. Americans see wind as the most expensive energy source on the market (20%), followed by oil (16%) and coal (13%). Solar is seen as the most affordable source (26%), followed by nuclear (22%).

Respondents were closely divided on the impact of doubling US wind and solar: 41% believed doubling deployment would lower the cost of electricity. 35% thought it would increase costs. Participants clearly understood the basics of supply and demand—more energy means lower prices. But they have serious concerns about the affordability of some clean energy technologies, and those tech-specific concerns impact the perception of clean energy writ large.

As a result, Americans don’t totally buy that simply building more clean energy leads to lower costs. They want fossil fuels in the mix.

It’s also important to note that Americans aren’t sure how or when they’ll see cost savings from clean energy. Only 37% anticipate short-term cost savings, while 25% anticipate no significant effect on costs in the near future. 57% say clean energy will cut electricity costs in the long term. Americans are desperate for cost savings, and saying clean energy buildout alone will deliver relief simply isn’t credible.

Americans Like Clean Energy—They Just Aren’t Motivated By It

In an open-ended question, 69% of respondents identified the primary advantage of clean energy as some form of environmental protection, like mitigating climate change or improving air and water quality. Only 13% offered lower energy costs as a central benefit, and 22% said clean energy offers no clear advantage.

It is unsurprising that so few respondents identified the economic benefits of clean technologies, given what they reported hearing about clean energy in the media and in their communities. Just 6% reported hearing that clean energy could bring down electricity costs, compared with 11% who’d heard recently about the high cost of clean energy or other economic downsides.

Zoom out a bit, and it’s clear clean energy advocates are losing the messaging war:

41% of respondents reported hearing negative messages about clean energy, focused on things like high costs, unreliability, and land use.

17% reported hearing about political opposition to clean energy.

Just 24% reported hearing anything positive about clean energy, including messages on environmental benefits.

25% said they’d heard nothing at all about clean energy recently.

Despite considerable effort from advocates to raise awareness of the economic benefits of clean energy, those messages aren’t breaking through. And environmental benefits simply aren’t a priority for most Americans.

When asked about their top priorities for elected officials today, just 2% of respondents listed addressing climate change. That includes only 3% of Democrats and 3% of Independents.

Even when we get more specific and ask about respondents’ priorities for electricity generation, environmental protection still fails to break through. 31% of respondents say reducing pollution and lowering carbon emissions should be the number one consideration when making electricity in the US. 69% of respondents list affordability, reliability, and energy independence as their top concerns for the energy sector. Independents feel similarly, with 67% choosing affordability, reliability, and independence as their top concerns for the energy sector. Even committed Democrats aren’t totally convinced: 52% of Democrats say environmental protection should be the top priority for the energy sector, compared to 48% who chose other priorities like affordability.

Americans understand that clean energy delivers environmental benefits. But they don’t yet grasp that clean tech delivers where it matters most to them: providing affordable, reliable, and secure electricity.

Next Steps: Doubling Down on Economic Benefits

Americans—especially those less convinced of clean energy’s benefits—need to hear more about how clean energy can lower costs and provide consistent, dependable electricity. In our research, we’ve found that the most effective messages for these audiences were:

“The cost of wind and solar energy is coming down, and they will be far cheaper in the long run than fossil fuels, as the wind blows and the sun shines for free. Meanwhile, the cost to mine and drill for oil, gas, and coal is only going up.”

“By building domestic supply chains for clean energy technologies, the U.S. can create stable, good-paying jobs in fast-growing industries, with new opportunities in communities across the United States.”

With Independents, our strongest message was:

“With growing data centers and AI taking huge amounts of power, we’re going to need more electricity than ever to power businesses and homes. We should be investing in every energy source that can get us the power we’ll need, including wind and solar.”

To grow support for clean energy, advocates should certainly emphasize these core messages. But they also need to be sure messaging is deployed across media that Americans actually consume. 53% of survey respondents said they got most of their news from social media and podcasts, compared with 28% who consult national newspapers and their websites, and 34% who watch Fox, MSNBC, or other cable news.

Americans are strongly interested in relief from high energy prices. Clean energy can help, but only if advocates can make a credible case that it’s affordable and work to grow the coalition of supporters for clean energy deployment. That effort must go beyond good messaging and center on effective solutions that will lower costs now and create long-term stability. It’s not enough to talk about affordability. Policymakers and advocates must offer the public actionable solutions – and do what it takes to realize lower costs for working families.","https://uploads.thirdway.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=baseline-jpeg,quality=90,width=1200,height=630,fit=cover,gravity=auto/https://uploads.thirdway.org/products/all-of-the-above-poll-HG-G.jpg",N,,2025-12-10 11:02:48.669251

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is the largest, spanning 113,000 acres, mostly in Chesapeake and Suffolk and stretching into North Carolina.","Last year, officials built a pavilion at one of the main entry points to the Great Dismal Swamp in Suffolk.

The project, funded through federal grants and private donors, transformed an empty field at the Jericho Lane entrance into a space for public events, including an amphitheater.

Over the past year, however, overgrowth has claimed much of the site, said Kay Adams, president of the nonprofit Friends of the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, which led the project.

Cuts to federal staffing and funding are likely to blame and she fears more are on the horizon.

“As a result of these cuts, those lands are no longer being maintained,” she said. “The assets are unusable by the public.”

The Friends has a partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help boost public access and conservation of the swamp, Adams said. It’s one of many conservation groups nationwide raising concerns about the impact of cuts under the Trump administration.

More than half of U.S. national wildlife refuges lack sufficient resources to carry out their missions, according to internal assessments conducted by the Fish and Wildlife Service and recently analyzed by the nonprofit Defenders of Wildlife.

President Trump has proposed cutting the National Wildlife Refuge System’s budget by at least 22%.

The system was already understaffed, starting in 2025 with 30% fewer employees than in 2010. Since Trump took office, the system has lost another quarter of its workforce.

It’s unclear how many staff have been impacted at the Dismal Swamp. The refuge’s central office and visitor contact station in Suffolk is now listed as open only 8 hours per week, down from 40.

Spokespeople for the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Northeast region, which includes Virginia, did not respond to WHRO’s request for comment.

Hampton Roads is home to several national wildlife refuges, including Back Bay in Virginia Beach, the Nansemond River in Suffolk, Plum Tree Island in Poquoson and the Eastern Shore.

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is the largest, spanning 113,000 acres, mostly in Chesapeake and Suffolk and stretching into North Carolina. It’s the last vestige of a swamp that once covered more than a million acres.

The land contains more than 40 miles of trails and is a habitat for about 47 species of mammals, 200 bird species, 96 butterfly species and trees, including Atlantic white cedar, which is relatively rare because of logging and habitat loss.

The area also has extensive cultural and historical significance, including its role in supporting Indigenous tribes and serving as a refuge for “maroon” communities of enslaved people seeking freedom.

The National Park Service is studying a potential National Heritage Area centered around the swamp, which Congress would need to approve.

Adams said her nonprofit received grants through several federal agencies, including one in collaboration with Old Dominion University. This year, the money was canceled, withdrawn or paused indefinitely.

“A year and a half ago, we were operating with a grant portfolio in excess of $500,000,” she said. “That has now dropped to zero.”

Friends of the Great Dismal Swamp had to halt several education initiatives, such as hosting fourth-graders on field trips to the swamp and developing an environmental science curriculum for Suffolk Public Schools.

Adams said she hopes funding will eventually be restored, but in the meantime, the nonprofit aims to move forward by “marshaling resources from nontraditional areas.”

Local high school and college students are helping to document changes at the swamp in the wake of federal cuts, starting with a hike at the refuge last week. They plan to share the results with the public.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94fda70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F5c%2F58034f1f49c6a0d1d9414b4c4698%2Fimg-2587.JPG,N,,2025-12-10 11:05:00.363039

GREENVILLE, N.C. (12/09/2025) — East Carolina University’s Dr. Robert Hughes, associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, is the recipient of a $720,000 NCInnovation research grant for his project, “Cleaner, Safer Coatings for Marine and Industrial Equipment.”

Marine vessels — from fishing boats to research ships — struggle with fouling: the buildup of algae, barnacles and sludge that slows vessels down and increases fuel costs. Industrial bilge areas face similar problems, often requiring harsh chemical cleaners.

The goal of Hughes’ project is to develop environmentally friendly coatings that prevent this buildup without relying on toxic substances. By reducing drag and improving cleanliness, these coatings can help vessels operate more efficiently and minimize environmental impact. Industrial users may also benefit from coatings that require less maintenance and fewer harsh chemicals.

“I’m excited to work on a project that has a potentially high impact on our region of North Carolina,” Hughes said. “One of the things I love about eastern N.C. is our ease of access to recreational boating. This project could benefit the industry and the people of eastern NC.”

“Biofouling is an ongoing challenge for commercial and recreational boaters that is costly and requires frequent maintenance and reduces boating performance,” Hughes said. “Some of the most effective solutions against biofouling are currently being phased out because they also have negative environmental impacts.”

Over the next two years, Hughes will use the grant funds to advance the technology that will support the development, evaluation and commercial readiness of environmentally friendly marine and industrial paint. These products will assist in reducing biofouling and chemical buildup, and help vessels and coastal industries operate more efficiently while protecting workers and aquatic ecosystems.

“Dr. Hughes’s research has exciting applications for marine vessel maintenance, potentially impacting everything from research ships to ﬁshing boats,” said Michelle Bolas, NCInnovation’s interim CEO. “NCInnovation helps universities advance research with just this kind of real-world application, strengthening the university-to-industry pipeline that’s central to American competitiveness.”

NCInnovation helps university innovations advance toward commercialization by supporting university applied research through the critical research and development phase between proof of concept and readiness for the private market. NCInnovation’s grant funding is part of a larger effort to support the development and commercialization of university research in North Carolina. Learn more at NCInnovation.org.

Natural gas turbulence The good news is that after jumping on Friday, natural gas prices have tumbled 13% this week.
Households that use natural gas for heating are expected to experience a 3% jump in heating prices this winter, according to the EIA.","New York (CNN) — A new problem is threatening to worsen the affordability squeeze this winter: Natural gas prices have raced back up just as extreme cold forces Americans to crank up the heat.

President Donald Trump has said he’s focused on lowering energy prices. And the most visible energy price for most Americans, gasoline at the pump, has been a clear bright spot on the cost-of-living front.

But the progress on gas prices could be offset by the 39% spike in natural gas futures since the end of September. Natural gas recently climbed to the highest level since December 2022 before retreating sharply this week.

It’s a double whammy for consumers.

First, natural gas is the most common way to heat homes in America. The higher natural gas prices go, the more expensive it will be for many families to stay warm this winter.

Secondly, natural gas is by far the No. 1 fuel source powering the nation’s electric grid. Higher natural gas prices could exacerbate the sticker shock consumers are already experiencing when they open their electric bills.

“All that money the consumer is saving on gasoline may be eaten up by the soaring price of natural gas,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates.

Natural gas turbulence

The good news is that after jumping on Friday, natural gas prices have tumbled 13% this week.

Still, even at current levels, natural gas is nearly 50% more expensive than at this point last year.

Natural gas prices are extremely volatile, and analysts say it’s unclear at this point whether prices will continue to retreat or resume their recent climb.

Government forecasts don’t expect natural gas to crash back to earth anytime soon.

The Energy Information Administration ramped up its natural gas price forecast by about 10% on Tuesday from its November forecast, citing the “cold snap” in the United States that will drive up demand for heating.

After averaging just $2.19 per million BTU in 2024, the EIA expects natural gas to average $3.56 this year and $4.01 in 2026.

It takes time for those higher natural gas prices to filter through to Americans’ utility bills.

Households that use natural gas for heating are expected to experience a 3% jump in heating prices this winter, according to the EIA. That’s despite the fact that consumption is expected to be 2% lower.

The biggest price hikes are expected in the Northeast (4%) and the Midwest (7%), whereas heating costs in the West are forecasted to be flat and down 3% in the South.

Electricity prices are already rising fast

This isn’t just a wintertime problem.

Higher natural gas prices will contribute to higher electric bills.

According to federal data, natural gas accounts for about 40% of US electricity generation – more than the next two fuel sources, coal and nuclear, combined.

Electricity prices have already been rising sharply.

Residential electricity prices increased by 7.4% over the 12 months ending in September, the most recent month federal data is available. That’s more than twice the rate of inflation.

But the sticker shock is even greater in certain states, including Virginia (9%) and New Jersey (21%), two states where Democrats seized upon the issue in key gubernatorial wins last month.

‘Burned badly before’

So why is natural gas getting more expensive?

Part of the problem is supply.

Analysts say natural gas producers, especially public ones, have been apprehensive to ramp up production out of fear they’ll cause a supply glut that crashes prices.

“They’ve been burned badly before. No one wants that to happen again. There is a certain degree of reluctance,” said Robert Yawger, commodity specialist at Mizuho Securities.

Another factor: cheap oil.

Natural gas is a byproduct of drilling for crude oil. But oil drilling has slowed in recent months because crude is relatively inexpensive. That means so-called associated natural gas could take a hit. (Of course, cheap oil has helped keep a lid on prices for homes that rely on home heating oil to stay warm.)

Exports and AI boost demand

On the demand side, a relatively new phenomenon is that a significant chunk of natural gas produced in the United States is getting shipped overseas as liquified natural gas (LNG).

The EIA expects LNG exports to average 16.3 billion cubic feet per day next year, up 37% from 2024.

LNG exports are helping to supply US allies with relatively inexpensive energy, including European nations attempting to wean themselves off Russian gas.

But that also leaves less natural gas for Americans.

“That’s obviously contributing. These are molecules going overseas that were historically going to the consumer in the United States,” said Yawger, who estimates about 15% to 20% of the natural gas is getting exported.

New LNG export facilities are being built and slated to come online soon, potentially adding to demand.

Yawger emphasized that, at the end of the day, there’s no risk of running out of natural gas. If Americans need to produce more natural gas, it can be done relatively quickly.

But it could take a period of higher prices to encourage that production.

Another factor on the demand side: Artificial intelligence.

The data centers that act as the brains of the AI boom are sucking up enormous amounts of power – including natural gas.

“This is demand that I don’t think the market really anticipated as recently as a year ago,” said Patrick Rau, senior vice president of research and analysis at Natural Gas Intelligence.",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10/thermostat-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:05:09.775206

Judge Patti B. Saris vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
They say they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but did not halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.","A federal judge in Boston on Dec. 8 struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was arbitrary and capricious and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti B. Saris vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York AG Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Her 47-page decision is New York, et al. v. Trump, et al., Lawyers Weekly No. 02-653-25.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

AG Andrea J. Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said on Dec. 8 that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump lacks the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but did not halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William G. Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10 percent of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/09/AP25235584078133.webp,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:52.830982

With the BrightDrop electric van now discontinued, dealers want them out of the door–fast.

Huge discounts are offered, which go as high as $29,000 in some cases.

Chevrolet has stopped making the BrightDrop electric van, which means the number of competitors for Rivian’s electric van has gone down by one. But it also means that Chevy dealers are pretty desperate to get rid of the remaining inventory, so there are some fantastic deals to be had for those who are looking for a solid, battery-powered commercial vehicle made by General Motors.

Whether you need a simple van for your business or you’re planning on converting one into a home on wheels for that #vanlife, there are some huge discounts on brand-new vehicles, so look carefully at your local dealers, and you might just find the right one.

Probably the biggest discount in the country right now is a whopping $29,000 for a 2025 Chevrolet BrightDrop 400 with zero miles on the clock, and it’s offered by Bomnin Chevrolet in Miami, Florida, as spotted by Carscoops. With the discount, the van retails for just $40,435–a drop of almost 42% over the original price.

This particular van is a front-wheel drive model with the standard range battery pack, so it has a total output of 233 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque, while the official range rating is 177 miles on a full charge. Speaking of charging, the BrightDrop 400 can take in up to 120 kilowatts from a DC fast charger, so it’s not exactly lightning-fast, but for this price, it’s still a great deal.

But this is not the only big discount out there–many like it are available across the country. Chevrolet of Troy, Ohio, has a similar BrightDrop 400 in stock, with the same $29,000 discount on the hood, but the final price is even lower–$39,995.

If an all-wheel drive model or the larger BrightDrop 600 is more to your liking, then expect to pay $21,500 less than the MSRP, as that’s the main dealer discount that’s offered across the board until Jan. 2, 2026. A brand new 2026 Chevy BrightDrop 400 dual-motor is currently on sale for $60,035 at Kelley Chevrolet in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Similarly, a $50,575 BrightDrop 600 AWD is being sold by Simpson Chevrolet of Garden Grove, California.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, though. According to Chevrolet’s online work truck locator, there are almost 3,000 BrightDrop vans in stock at dealerships, so there’s plenty to choose from. As a reminder, the top-spec model with the biggest battery has a maximum driving range of 272 miles, so it’s not just an urban runabout.

A few independent outfitters have been using the BrightDrop van as a base for custom-made RVs, but if affordability is the name of the game, camping wannabes might want to go at it alone and modify a cut-price BrightDrop to their liking–potentially saving tens of thousands of dollars in the process. The cheapest ready-made BrightDrop-based RV, the Coachmen RVEX, starts from $150,000 and goes all the way up to $200,000 for the top-spec model. Meanwhile, the Grounded G3 starts from $165,000 and tops out at $200,000.

While the BrightDrop is no longer being manufactured, most–if not all–of the models that rolled off the assembly line in Canada are still covered by an eight-year warranty that’s backed up by General Motors, so customers should be covered if anything goes wrong.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/0eW4mW/s1/2025-chevrolet-brightdrop-600.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 09:59:29.622440

The document calls for policies benefiting low-income customers, like discounts and a summertime shutoff ban, along with changes to state oversight and regulations.

“Hoosier families are stretched thin, and they need relief now from monopoly utilities who’ve pushed policies for years that led to this crisis,” said Megan Robertson, the executive director of Indiana Conservation Voters, a clean environment and energy group.

“This plan gives state leaders a clear, practical path to lower bills that will protect Hoosiers most in need and build a more affordable, reliable energy future for every community in our state,” she said.

About 87% of Hoosiers were at least “somewhat” concerned about rising energy costs — with 59% “very” concerned — in a Bellwether Research poll conducted for Indiana Conservation Voters.

The survey of 800 registered voters statewide was performed Oct. 29-30 and Nov. 1, over call and text, and carried an error margin of plus or minus 3.5%.

Robertson’s organization was joined by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility ratepayer watchdog.

“For too long, Hoosiers have been footing the bill for decisions they didn’t make and policies they didn’t ask for,” said Kerwin Olson, the coalition’s executive director.

“Indiana’s regulatory system should be built to protect consumers, but that goal can only be achieved if lawmakers give regulators the tools and authority it needs,” Olson said. “The solutions have been ready for years. The need is now incredibly urgent, and we hope lawmakers will do their part.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s largest electric and natural gas utilities, said the industry is “listening closely to customers, stakeholders, policymakers, and state leaders” as regular legislative work approaches.

“We recognize that many policy proposals will be considered this legislative session, and we share the concern for how the current landscape is affecting the people we serve,” association President Danielle McGrath said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle. “We remain committed to keeping energy reliable and affordable for our customers.”

She noted utilities already have some options for cash-strapped consumers.

“Beyond providing power, the industry plays a critical role in supporting our customers and communities. We offer a range of assistance and affordability tools that help manage costs and consumption, such as bill payment assistance, notifications and alerts, and flexible payment options,” McGrath said.

She added that Indiana’s residential energy prices are below the U.S. average and rank the lowest in the Earth North Central region — Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio — according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

The plan, however, indicated residents are still hard-hit.

“Hoosiers are paying some of the highest energy bills in the Midwest,” it read. “… Families, seniors, renters, small business owners — everyone is feeling the pain.”

White paper’s suggestions

Recommendations in the “Help Hoosiers Now Ratepayer Relief Plan” are ordered by “how quickly they will affect Hoosiers,” according to the document.

It centers on a pair of policies targeting low-income households.

Under the first, lawmakers would establish a discount rate for each of the state’s investor-owned utility companies, applicable to ratepayers who qualify as low-income. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission would set the rate, which the plan suggests could be based on a 3% or 4% income burden threshold. The concept is similar to the 30% of income standard often used for housing affordability.

The second would prohibit shutoffs during high summer temperatures for participants in Indiana’s low-income home energy assistance program. State law already bans shutoffs for such households during the winter, from Dec. 1 through March 15, according to the plan.

The organizations also aim to shake up the regulatory space. They recommended reforming IURC’s jurisdiction in mergers or acquisitions involving utilities or their parent firms.

BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is close to purchasing AES Indiana, one of the “big five” investor-owned electric utility companies. Despite the potentially major implications, the state has no say, Axios Indianapolis reported.

Under other suggestions, lawmakers would require IURC to cap utility profit rates at the cost of capital and ban the commission from letting utilities include “political influence campaigns” in customer bills.

That would include activities related to lobbying, charitable giving, trade association expenses, litigation, investor relations and more. Utilities would file annual reports related to those activities, and the IURC would make them public.

Another proposal includes repealing or reducing cost trackers. Utilities can currently use them to adjust rates for certain expenses and recover those costs from customers on an ongoing basis.

Shrinking or getting rid of some trackers would “provide more stability in monthly bills and require utilities to go through the rate case process to pass along these costs,” the plan reads.

Other recommendations are longer-term endeavors.

That includes a revival of distributed energy generation policies, review of the state’s approach to controversial data centers and a requirement that big industrial energy-users participate in utility-led energy efficiency programs. They’d also help pay for the initiatives.

The plan additionally envisions a legislative confirmation process for IURC commissioners. The five members are appointed by the governor without lawmakers’ involvement.

And it delves into a contentious debate over utility-scale infrastructure siting. Indiana doesn’t have standards statewide, so it’s up to each of the 92 counties.

Will Flanders, the research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, also said the utilities’ estimates undervalue the benefits that community solar can add.
Duane Hinchley, a Cambridge dairy farmer, said community solar is an “innovative solution” that can give farmers a stable income to hedge against the risks in the agriculture business.
Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said repeatedly he didn’t understand how the program would work for the utility companies.
To me, there’s plenty of need for solar.” If the utility companies won’t support a community solar proposal, Spreitzer wondered, what do they need from the Legislature to encourage more solar development?","A Wisconsin Senate Committee held a public hearing Tuesday on a bill that would allow private companies to construct small solar projects on underutilized farmland and commercial rooftops across the state.

The bill, which would encroach on the monopoly the state’s existing utility companies are allowed to maintain under state law, is being considered while people across the country worry about rising energy costs amid a boom in the construction of data centers and the increased use of electric vehicles and appliances.

Environmental groups in the state have also regularly complained that the utility companies aren’t constructing enough renewable energy projects or sunsetting existing coal and natural gas power plants quickly enough.

The bill, authored by Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) and Rep. Scott Krug (R-Nekoosa), would allow people in Wisconsin to subscribe to get some of their power from a local “community solar” installation. The subscribers would receive credits they can put toward their utility bill. Because the power developed at the local solar installation will still need to travel through the utility company’s infrastructure, the bill includes a provision that all subscribers to the program would have to pay at least $20 per month on their electric bill.

In the hearing of the Senate Committee on Transportation and Local Government, the bill’s authors said allowing community solar projects would increase people’s energy choices while allowing the expansion of solar power in the state that avoids the objections from local residents that often come with large, utility-scale solar projects.

“This change will open a new market sector in a high energy industry, attract economic investments in Wisconsin, create local jobs, drive innovation and competition, and ultimately save consumers and small businesses money on their energy bills,” Testin said.

But the authors also acknowledged there is still a lot of disagreement over the details and the bill is not yet in its final form.

“We’re not exactly there yet. We’re not all agreeing on this being the best way forward just yet, but this public hearing is a really important step to vet that out a little bit more to get us closer to that answer,” Krug said. “So yes, there are still some kinks to work out between the utilities and individuals who want a more market-based approach to solar. I hope we can work through those issues here.”

Over the hearing’s three and a half hours, the testimony split among two groups — the utility companies who are opposed to the bill and a coalition of solar companies, economists, farmers and employers who are in favor.

The utility companies accused the bill of creating a “shell game” that would lower the costs for the subscribers of a given project while raising electric bills for everyone else. Zack Hill, testifying on behalf of Alliant Energy, said the utility estimated that community solar would result in an additional $8.75 billion in costs for ratepayers over the next 25 years.

“How does [the bill] pay for subscribers 10 to 20% energy savings? The short answer: It will shift costs to your other constituents,” Hill said. “Some have said this sounds like community solar voodoo economics, but all you have to remember is this, when a company promises you a discount, someone else has to pay for it.”

People in favor of the bill argued that the generation of more energy could only help lower energy costs while disputing the utility companies’ claims. Will Flanders, the research director at the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, also said the utilities’ estimates undervalue the benefits that community solar can add.

“This is a model that expands energy choice without large subsidies, without mandates, without turning more power over to monopoly utilities,” Flanders said. “In fact, it introduces competition at a time when Wisconsin needs it the most.”

“We argue that community solar can deliver net savings to the entire system,” he continued. “When we talk about a shell game, what we’re really saying is there’s no real additional resources being put into the system, but obviously there is additional resources being put in when we have these with these programs in place.”

Karl Rabago, a Denver-based energy consultant who testified with Flanders, said that the Alliant $8.75 billion estimate amounted to a threat that if the utilities don’t get to sell the energy, they’ll charge consumers for that loss.

“No one knows where this number comes from, but having seen how utilities make their case in other states, I am 99.9% confident they are basically saying, ‘If we don’t get to make the electricity and sell it, we could potentially lose $8.75 billion and and if we don’t make that money, we’re going to charge you for it anyway,’ and that’s how customer costs could go up,” Rabago said. “That’s the most likely explanation for a histrionic number. The utility position, to summarize, seems to sound a bit like ‘let us do it all and no one gets hurt.’ We’ve heard those kinds of exhortations. Monopolies do it particularly well.”

Toward the end of the hearing, a number of Wisconsin property owners testified, touting the benefits they’ll receive if they’re able to allow solar projects to be constructed on their land.

Duane Hinchley, a Cambridge dairy farmer, said community solar is an “innovative solution” that can give farmers a stable income to hedge against the risks in the agriculture business. Plus, he said, allowing farmers to participate will prevent land that has been farmed for generations from being developed into subdivisions.

“With the right policies in place, our state’s proud agricultural heritage can be a cornerstone of Wisconsin’s clean energy future,” Hinchley said.

But throughout the day, lawmakers from both parties appeared skeptical of the bill’s benefits.

Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine) said repeatedly he didn’t understand how the program would work for the utility companies.

“It sounds like a shell game to me,” he said. “I just, I’m really having a challenge with trying to figure out how that would work, because it would seem to me that the energy company, the regulated company, is the one that’s going to be footing the bill for this.”

Sen. Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) questioned how the program wouldn’t eventually raise energy costs for non-participants, but said one selling point for the bill was that it would encourage the increased development of renewable energy.

“I heard you say this is going to force more solar to be built, whether or not you need it,” Spreitzer said to a utility company representative. “And I guess that, to me, is the one selling point of the bill. Is that I look at where we’ve been in the landscape lately, where we have, unfortunately, federal incentives for solar that are going away. We have increasing demand for power from data centers. We’re seeing new natural gas plants get built. We’re seeing coal plants not being retired, when we hoped they would. To me, there’s plenty of need for solar.”

If the utility companies won’t support a community solar proposal, Spreitzer wondered, what do they need from the Legislature to encourage more solar development?

“And so if we’re not going to go down this route, what are the incentives that you all need to make sure that we can continue to drive solar development without increasing rates for customers and without saying, ‘let’s go build a natural gas plant instead?” he asked.

Anti-rights of nature bill

Also on Tuesday, the committee heard testimony on a bill from Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) that would prohibit local governments in Wisconsin from enacting “rights of nature” ordinances, which grant natural elements legal rights that can be protected in court.

Nass said in his testimony that the idea is anti-American and is contrary to the values of the U.S. Constitution.

“This is a radical departure from our current law. Rights are something that human beings have,” Nass said. “This concept of granting nature rights is something that has been done primarily in foreign countries … and many of these countries lean dramatically towards socialism and communism, and their attitude is not compatible with private property rights in our country.”

But proponents of rights of nature resolutions frequently point to the fact that corporations are granted rights under U.S. law. Communities including Green Bay and Milwaukee have passed or begun drafting rights of nature ordinances and some Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill that would grant Devil’s Lake State Park some rights that can be protected in court.

In a statement after the hearing, Rep. Vincent Miresse (D-Stevens Point), one of the co-authors of the Democratic proposal, wrote, “As we heard from advocates today, Rights of Nature is one of the strongest tools local governments have to protect clean air, clean water and healthy soil for future generations — so that our grandchildren, and their children after them, can drink our waters, eat food grown in our soils, and hunt in our forests.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hotel-Verdant-roof-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:48.426206

Each year, the group releases a state of the air report compiling data from official air quality monitors so people know what they’re breathing.
“There are air quality reports that you can look up and especially folks that have health issues, lung issues, etc.
I say we because I have asthma and I'm really thinking about that a lot when it's a poor air quality day.
You can tell really, you can tell if you go out and it's been, um, uh, like an orange or red day for air quality.","Power plants in Arkansas have received exemptions for compliance with the Enviormental Protection Agency’s Mercury and Air Toxic Standards until July 2029. Ozarks at Large's Jack Travis reports that letting these plants avoid the rules could harm public health, especially in some of the state’s lower income communities. He spoke with the director of Advocacy in Arkansas for the American Lung Association to learn more.

In March earlier this year, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin invited power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industrial polluters to apply for temporary exemptions from federal rules that limit toxic air emissions. The specific rules that coal-burning power plants were attempting to circumvent are the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, under section one twelve of the Clean Air Act. This regulation, which the Biden administration finalized last May, requires polluters to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals like mercury, arsenic and benzene.

“So there is technically a provision in the Clean Air Act that makes this possible, but it's very, only meant to be used in very limited and specific circumstances, which is not how it's being applied.”

That’s Laura Turner. She is the director of advocacy in Arkansas for the American Lung Association, an organization that works to improve lung health through research, public education and advocacy.

The provision she’s referring to is in section 112. It allows the president to exempt certain polluters from compliance with any standard or limitation for up to two years if the technology to implement the standard is not available and it is, quote, “in the national security interests of the United States to do so.”

“And they're making it incredibly easy to get the exemptions. In fact, all a company would need to do would be email the EPA. There's an email inbox to request to be exempted. No lengthy application process or anything like that.”

So far, three companies in Arkansas received exemptions from federal limits on toxic air pollution: the White Bluff Steam Station in Jefferson County, the Plum Point Energy Station in Mississippi County, and Georgia-Pacific chemicals manufacturing plant in Ashley County. Only the former two are coal powered plants and covered by the EPA’s Mercury and Air toxic standards.

Turner says that while the MATS rule focuses on airborne mercury, other chemicals like nickel, arsenic, and lead can also come from these plants and pose equal danger.

“With all of these kind of combined…There are various health effects that can happen, including irritation of the lungs, the skin, mucous membranes. It can affect your kidneys. It can damage your nervous central nervous system, and can cause, you know, sooner, sooner impacts. Nausea and vomiting can lead to cancer as well.

“So looking at all of this long list of chemicals that are covered under this law, these different pollutants can also cause heart attacks, and developmental delays in children. That's one that you kind of hear a lot about. Especially with lead. That's one we're familiar with. And then another piece of it too is that power plants also emit fine particulate matter and gases like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon, carbon dioxide. There's just a whole spew of things that are bad for us to inhale or be exposed to. Inhaling particulate matter specifically can lead to a wide range of adverse health effects like coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, which is kind of really relevant to what we do here in healthy adults and also result in asthma attacks with people of any age.”

She says industrial polluters typically operate in rural or densely urban areas. This causes specific populations to bear the effects of unhealthy air disproportionately.

“People of color and low income people are more likely to live in what we call fenceline communities that are most burdened by that pollution. So, and I'm sure there's a lot of history behind that that we won't get into, but we know that there's already, um, yeah, that's just a higher risk. That's not necessary and a lot of times people can't afford to move away from there or maybe don't want to. So they're kind of trapped, breathing in that pollution.”

As of producing this report, some of the U.S. Census Bureau’s website is down, so gathering data from the agency is difficult. However, Data USA pulls from sources such as the Census Bureau to offer profiles on places across the country. According to their profiles on Jefferson, Ashley and Mississippi counties, all have poverty rates ranging from twenty point six percent to twenty two point seven percent — roughly double the national average.

Turner says the ALA protects clean air and helps prevent lung disease by advocating against policies like the section 112 exemptions and mobilizing local support. Each year, the group releases a state of the air report compiling data from official air quality monitors so people know what they’re breathing. They also alert volunteers and health professionals when lawmakers are taking comments on air quality rules, with Turner often testifying herself.

“So whenever those do come up and there’s a chance to do it, I try to, and sometimes you just gotta say it anyway, even if nobody’s asking for it. And then with our state of the air report, which comes out in April, we do a great deal of media advocacy around that report. And Arkansas is one where we get a lot of traction. I think usually with the state of the air report and kind of use that to draw attention to what’s going on… for better or for worse.”

Outside of the ALA’s efforts, environmental groups nationwide have filed suit against President Trump, Lee Zeldin and the EPA, challenging the legality of the exemptions and the use of the provision in section 112 to allow them. Turner says citizens at large have a voice too.

“Talk to legislators, talk to council members. In some cases, I mean, anybody can go to those organizations that regulate air quality at the state level, and anybody can go to those meetings.”

She recommends visiting the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Division of Environmental Quality’s website and signing up for alerts if available — specifically with the division’s Office of Air Quality.

“Just kind of seeking those out and reaching out to the people that work there as well and letting them know you care about this. There’s no rule against that. So that’s something that I would encourage people to do. Even if you think your voice doesn’t matter. Every little voice counts. And I think more than anything, folks that are local have a very powerful opportunity to do that if they’re the ones who are having to breathe this air. Those are the ones whose opinion is the most valuable.

What's more, everyone can take small steps within their own lives to reduce pollution:

“That usually looks like trying not to drive more than you have to. Gassing up in the evening rather than during the heat of the day, especially during high ozone season, which is in the summer, and trying to use public transportation if it's available, biking if you can. We all have different options available to us. But, those are all little things we can do to fight pollution. And also just being aware of what the air quality is.”

Turner says those with breathing difficulties can acutely feel the impact pollution has on their quality of life.

“There are air quality reports that you can look up and especially folks that have health issues, lung issues, etc. we need to be really sensitive to that. I say we because I have asthma and I'm really thinking about that a lot when it's a poor air quality day. You can tell really, you can tell if you go out and it's been, um, uh, like an orange or red day for air quality. I feel it in my lungs for sure.”

“This proclamation is a strong recognition of Louisiana’s history and future as an energy powerhouse,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc. “Gulf Coast Energy Day honors the workers and communities behind a century of energy leadership, and it reinforces Louisiana’s role in America’s energy security and the next wave of innovation. Louisiana has led for generations and is ready to lead what comes next.”

The Governor announced the proclamation as part of his remarks during the day’s activities, which come ahead of the forthcoming Gulf lease sale on December 10, 2025, a milestone for the state and country’s offshore energy industry.

At the inaugural Gulf Coast Energy Day, attendees participated in conversations that included:

Federal activity updates from Bryan Domangue, Gulf of America OCS Region Director, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)

State energy planning remarks from Jason Lanclos, Director of State Energy Development and Planning

An energy outlook presentation from Dr. Greg Upton of LSU

A panel moderated by Michael Hecht of Greater New Orleans, Inc., featuring Tommy Faucheux (LMOGA), Erik Milito (NOIA), Chett Chiasson (Port Fourchon), Anna Guichard (SLB), and Eric Zimmerman (LLOG)

“These lease sales put Louisiana to work and puts our state at the forefront of furthering America’s energy dominance,” said Tommy Faucheux, President of Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. “By expanding access and supporting investment in the Gulf of America, we are creating jobs, strengthening energy security, and delivering vital funding to restore Louisiana’s coastline.”

In the proclamation, the Governor cited Louisiana’s long-standing position at the forefront of energy development, including offshore production, pipelines, refineries, petrochemical complexes, LNG export leadership, and maritime support services. The proclamation also emphasized the energy sector’s measurable economic impact, including:

306,750 jobs supported by Louisiana’s energy sector, representing 15% of total employment

$25.5 billion in annual statewide earnings, representing 19% of all wages

$77.7 billion in economic value, roughly 25% of the state economy

Significant fiscal contributions in FY 2024, including $974 million in specific state taxes, $1.1 billion in local property taxes, and $3.48 billion toward state taxes, licenses, and fees

The proclamation further detailed regional impacts across Louisiana, from the Mississippi River corridor to the Bayou region and Southwest and Northwest Louisiana, and noted that each direct oil and natural gas job generates approximately 1.8 additional jobs elsewhere in the state economy.

“Gulf Coast Energy Day highlights the women and men of the energy industry throughout the Gulf Coast who tirelessly and safely produce the energy that fuels our country,” said Erik Milito, President of National Ocean Industries Association. “The Gulf of America remains the gold standard for offshore energy: driving prolific production, supporting good-paying jobs, bolstering local and national supply chains, funding conservation programs nationwide, and anchoring U.S. energy and national security. From Louisiana to Texas to Mississippi to Alabama, the Gulf Coast leads the way.”

The proclamation also pointed to Louisiana’s competitive position as global energy markets evolve, including growth opportunities in an all-of-the-above energy portfolio, as well as a catalog of announced energy-related projects totaling $133 billion in capital expenditures that are projected to generate 34,000 new jobs, according to Louisiana Economic Development.

“Offshore oil and gas investment is a long-term play that requires certainty and stability from the federal government,” said Mike Moncla, President of Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “We are thankful that President Trump recognizes the importance of offshore development. Offshore production represents 15% of the nation’s oil output and thousands of jobs across the Gulf Coast. It’s an honor to host the first ever ‘Gulf of America’ lease sale here in New Orleans.”

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years.
“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement.
Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West.

The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”

Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican.

But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July.

With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.

Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.

Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”

Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.

In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.

Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

But their advocacy may be out of step with even the most progressive members of Congress.

As data centers expand to meet the artificial intelligence boom, numerous Democratic lawmakers have expressed concerns about the climate impacts and electricity needs of the centers. But none have called for a complete moratorium on construction — indicating a potential divide between progressive advocates and those drafting legislation.

Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the ranking member on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, shrugged off the calls for a moratorium.

“They should call for an above-all energy plan that allows for the construction of renewables to play into that demand for the future,” she said in response to the progressive groups’ letter.

“We’re growing, so we need more energy sources. And the President killing energy [research and development] and killing clean energy is a big mistake,” Cantwell added.

The letter, led by Food and Water Watch and sent to Congress on Monday, cited the intense electricity and water needs of AI data centers as reason to pause construction until the regulatory landscape can be ironed out.

About 230 green groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, joined the call for the moratorium. The letter generally encompassed the most progressive of the green groups, without more center-left organizations.

“What we have found is that groups that are directly connected to communities on the ground that are fighting these data centers were much more willing to join together for a national moratorium as opposed to trying to stick to fighting the state, local fights individually,” said Mitch Jones, Food and Water Watch’s managing director of policy and litigation.

Jones said that the coalition has seen some interest from members of Congress in a national data center moratorium — but he declined to name specific members.

There are congressional offices interested in taking a more “regulatory approach” by adding data centers to existing federal environmental laws, Jones said.

“There is a mix of reaction on the Hill, but there is also increasing interest from members to address this issue, including going so far as supporting a national moratorium,” he said.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Commerce Committee who has long championed progressive climate policies, applauded the advocacy around data centers and their climate impacts — but stopped short of endorsing a construction moratorium.

“I’m going to continue to work with environmental groups on this looming crisis,” Markey said in an interview. “We need to have a reconciliation between the AI industry and the need for renewable energies to power that.”

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) similarly said he would not yet endorse a moratorium.

“I think my colleagues are still working their way through it. This is obviously a big proposal, and I’ve told you how I see it — I think that there has been significant abuse of taxpayer money as it relates to data centers,” Wyden said.

Among Democrats, Wyden said, there is fairly widespread worry about some of the Trump administration’s policies to speed up construction and grid connection.

“The concern about data center growth isn’t just limited to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party or to the aggressive wing of the environmental movement,” Jones said. “I believe that we will find support for this moratorium will grow from that aggressive, progressive wing, not only throughout the Democratic Party, but also across the whole political spectrum.”

There are further lines that dictate where lawmakers stand on data centers than just the political spectrum, Jones added. Geography plays a role, with members of Congress from communities with major data center growth often expressing the most worry about climate and grid impacts.

For example, Jones said, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has slammed the unchecked growth of data centers in her state. Tlaib’s office did not respond to request for comment on whether she supports a national moratorium.

Lobbying, too, may well draw a dividing line both across Congress and within the Democratic Party. AI companies have ramped up lobbying significantly in the past year.

“Let’s be honest, we’re talking about politics — there’s always going to be money behind this as well,” Jones said.

Although a moratorium, even if it garners more congressional support, is highly unlikely to become law under Trump, Jones said that the advocacy could open new dialogue on Capitol Hill.

“We’re hoping to broaden that conversation in Congress to make sure that the communities that are really being affected by the data centers are being heard just as much as the billionaires who are benefiting from them,” Jones said.

In the meantime, Democrats have introduced more narrowly focused legislation to address the rise of data centers.

On Tuesday, Reps. Greg Landsman of Ohio and Don Beyer of Virginia introduced the “Protecting Families from AI Data Center Energy Costs Act,” which would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to meet and issue recommendations on how to protect residential rates from increasing in areas with data centers.

“The rapid growth of data center construction to meet power demands from the proliferation of AI platforms is driving electricity prices up sharply in Virginia and across the country,” Beyer said in a statement. “Our bill would respond to this growing problem to generate policy changes that protect consumers and lower prices for the American people.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/b9/63/77d3e256499aa2e326f50d8a809f/u-s-congress-18371.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:04:00.511445

Wyoming

More than 620,000 miles of barbed-wire fences divide the American West. They keep cattle contained. They’re expensive to build and expensive to maintain. A single mile of new fence line can cost a rancher $25,000. And margins in that business are thin.

Enter virtual fences and GPS collars, which some livestock managers are using on their cattle in Wyoming to manage their herds from afar, with much less need for fencing. The tech is reminiscent of the invisible fencing used by some suburban dog owners. As a cow approaches a boundary, the collar beeps. If she crosses, it delivers a mild electric shock.

Ranchers use GPS coordinates to set precise boundaries on pastures to keep cows away from streams or sagebrush. They can move cows around to prevent overgrazing. They can also monitor cows’ exact locations, and, if they see the herd bunched up, they can ride out to see if the animals are under threat from a wolf or a grizzly bear.

What is happening? Last week, Netflix unveiled an $83 billion deal to take control of Warner Bros. On Monday, Paramount tried to snatch the deal away, going straight to Warner Bros. shareholders with what it called a superior offer, one that valued the company at approximately $108 billion. Aggressive!

How is Trump responding? Either deal would need the government’s blessing. And President Trump has broken precedent by placing himself at the center of the regulatory process, our media reporter Michael Grynbaum explained. “I’ll be involved in that decision,” Trump vowed.

Paramount and Netflix have both made nice with Trump. Ted Sarandos, a chief executive of Netflix, visited the Oval Office in November, while David Ellison, the Paramount chairman, was spotted with Trump on Sunday, just hours before his company made its offer.

What could happen next? It’s possible a Paramount victory could bring the future company more in line with Trump’s views. Ellison and Trump are close, and a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, is part of the Paramount deal. The president says a Netflix win “could be a problem,” giving it too much market power. That’s Paramount’s argument, too.

Still, Trump has praised Sarandos. And while Paramount, which owns CBS, paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit that Trump brought against “60 Minutes,” Trump has continued to criticize the show. He wrote that since CBS came under Ellison’s leadership, “60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”

Which means buying an EV in 2026 could either make you feel incredibly smart or slightly undercut.
The truth is, 2026 sits right in the middle of the EV world growing up and the EV world transforming again.","SPONSORED CONTENT

If you’ve been anywhere near a charging station, dealership, Reddit thread, or dinner table debate lately, you’ve heard the split. Half the country is convinced 2026 is finally the moment to ditch gas for good. The other half thinks you’d be crazy to buy an electric car right before the next big wave of upgrades hits.

And the argument only gets louder when you see EV owners personalizing their rides with things like the HALODISC 2 wheel cover series because EV culture isn’t niche anymore; it’s mainstream. Which makes the timing question even more important: is now the right moment to jump in?

What makes this particular year so confusing is that the U.S. EV market is moving in two directions at once. Prices are dropping, finally making EVs accessible to normal shoppers but the tech inside those cheaper cars is on the edge of a huge transition.

Charging is about to become dramatically simpler but not every 2026 model will fully benefit. Incentives are still around but fewer cars qualify than last year. It feels like standing on the edge of a big moment and trying to guess whether you’re staring at a takeoff or a turbulence zone.

And that’s why 2026 could genuinely be the best year ever to switch, or the worst.

Remember when the mythical $30,000 EV felt like Bigfoot? Everyone claimed it was coming, but you never actually saw one. That era is over. Chevrolet, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, and even Tesla are preparing EVs priced in the low-to-mid $30k range, and these aren’t compromised econoboxes. They’re real cars, with real range, built for real American families.

This is the first time U.S. buyers can look at an EV and say, “Yeah, that actually fits my budget.”

The timing is beautiful and also slightly cruel because just as these accessible models arrive, the technology underneath them is about to take a generational step forward. And as these more affordable EVs hit the market, accessories like the HALODISC 2 wheel covers allow owners to personalize their cars without spending a fortune. Whether it’s the understated RTP for a sleek, planted look or Custom Numbers for personal flair, these covers make the car feel more “yours”.

NACS Is About to Change Everything

Charging has always been the part of EV ownership that felt like a gamble. Sometimes it works beautifully, sometimes it works eventually, and sometimes it works “if you jiggle the plug and pray.”

Then came the biggest plot twist in the industry: nearly every major automaker agreed to adopt Tesla’s NACS connector.

By 2026 and 2027, new EVs from Ford, GM, Rivian, Mercedes, Honda, Hyundai, and others will plug directly into the Supercharger network, the most reliable fast-charging infrastructure in the U.S.

But this transition year is messy.

Some 2026 models will ship with NACS built in.

Some will rely on adapters.

Some won’t gain full charging access until software updates roll out.

Buy too early and you might end up with a car stuck in the “in-between” phase of America’s charging revolution.

Incentives Are Still Around… but They’re Getting Weird

Federal tax credits remain a game-changer when a model qualifies. And that’s the tricky part now. New sourcing rules have cut eligibility for several best-selling EVs, and automakers are still shuffling supply chains to satisfy requirements.

In 2026, the situation looks like this:

A car might qualify early in the year, then lose eligibility.

Another might not qualify now but will once a U.S. battery plant opens.

Some models may qualify inconsistently depending on trim.

For buyers, this means the exact same car could swing in price by up to $7,500 depending on whether you buy in January or August—and none of it has anything to do with you.

The Price War Isn’t Over Yet

Tesla fired the first shots back in 2023 and 2024, slashing prices and forcing the rest of the industry to react. Now we’re watching the next wave unfold. Automakers are preparing new battery plants, new EV platforms, and cheaper components and competition is only getting fiercer.

Some analysts think EV prices will bottom out between 2025 and 2027. Others say the bottom is already here. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Several industry forecasts expect battery costs to drop another 5–10% in 2026, which means EV sticker prices may still have room to fall—one more reason shoppers are torn between buying now or waiting.

Which means buying an EV in 2026 could either make you feel incredibly smart or slightly undercut.

That uncertainty alone is enough to keep some people waiting and others rushing to buy before the market shifts again.

So… Is 2026 the Moment or the Mistake?

If you’re the kind of driver who values stability, predictable charging, mature software, a wide selection of models, and a clear understanding of real-world costs then 2026 finally feels like the year EVs became “normal cars.” That alone makes switching attractive.

But if you’re someone who always wants the best version of whatever you buy, the newest connector, the next-gen battery, the lowest possible price, the cleaner incentives picture, waiting a year or two could easily pay off.

The truth is, 2026 sits right in the middle of the EV world growing up and the EV world transforming again. It’s a rare year where neither choice is wrong, but both require a little courage.

Are you the person who jumps now because the cars finally make sense?

Or the person who waits because the next chapter is going to be wild?

That’s the real question for 2026.",http://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image1-e1764952918401.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:00:58.179760

Genoa and Savona, two major Italian ports, are embracing electric heavy-duty vehicles in a bid to make their logistics operations more sustainable. This landmark move comes as part of a pilot project initiated in October 2025 by LC3 Trasporti, a leader in eco-friendly transport solutions, and Costa Cruises, a giant in the cruise industry. Together, they are driving efforts to reduce emissions in one of the world’s most important transport sectors – maritime logistics.

The new fleet of electric trucks represents a giant leap toward achieving zero emissions in port supply operations, setting a clear example for others in the industry to follow.

Genoa and Savona Take Bold Step Toward Greener Ports

In the bustling ports of Genoa and Savona, where shipping and logistics are vital to the economy, the introduction of electric trucks marks a significant moment in the fight against climate change. The pilot project, launched in October 2025, is a partnership between LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises, aimed at reducing emissions while maintaining the efficiency of port operations.

These electric vehicles (EVs), capable of carrying loads exceeding 40 tons, are being used to supply cruise ships with essential goods, replacing traditional diesel-powered trucks. The initiative is part of a broader, long-term strategy to decarbonize the maritime logistics sector.

Zero Emissions: These electric trucks produce zero tailpipe emissions, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of port operations.

Sustainable Logistics: The move represents a shift toward more sustainable logistics practices, an essential step for reducing the environmental impact of maritime industries.

Pioneering Zero-Emission Logistics with Electric Trucks

This initiative builds on previous efforts by Costa Cruises and LC3 Trasporti, which already employed BIO-LNG-powered vehicles in the ports. BIO-LNG, a renewable alternative to traditional LNG, has been used for medium- and long-distance routes in Italy and Europe to reduce emissions from logistics activities. Now, the move to electric trucks marks a new chapter in sustainable logistics.

Key benefits of this shift:

Cleaner Air: By replacing diesel trucks, the electric fleet helps cut down on harmful emissions like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter, contributing to cleaner air in port areas.

Operational Efficiency: The electric vehicles are not just eco-friendly; they also provide operational advantages, including reduced fuel costs and lower maintenance needs compared to traditional vehicles.

Sustainability Leadership: The project positions Genoa and Savona ports as leaders in the transition to sustainable maritime logistics, encouraging other ports to follow suit.

Boosting the Green Transition in Italian Ports

The partnership between LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises is already showing positive results. Since their collaboration began in 2022, the companies have made significant strides in reducing CO2 emissions compared to 2018 levels. This success is a testament to the commitment to sustainability from both organizations.

Now, with the introduction of electric trucks into the port supply chain, the collaboration is expanding. The results of the initial pilot project have been promising, leading to plans for increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles in the coming years.

Key Achievements in Emission Reduction

Here are some of the significant results from this collaboration:

Reduction in CO2 emissions: Compared to 2018 levels, the use of BIO-LNG and now electric vehicles has helped cut emissions significantly, showcasing the potential of green logistics in maritime operations.

Electric Vehicles in Action: The electric trucks in operation are setting a benchmark for other ports, demonstrating how large-scale logistics operations can be greener and more efficient.

Scaling Up for a Sustainable Future

The pilot project launched in Genoa and Savona has set the stage for broader adoption of electric vehicles in the port supply chain. Following the success of this initiative, the companies are now looking to expand the use of electric trucks across additional Italian ports. The ultimate goal is to integrate these vehicles alongside BIO-LNG-powered trucks to create a fleet that is completely sustainable.

As the demand for greener solutions grows, LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises are committed to continuously improving their logistics services and introducing innovative, low-emission technologies that will ensure a sustainable future for the industry.

Long-Term Strategy: The companies plan to scale up the use of electric trucks and other sustainable transport solutions over the next several years, further reducing the environmental impact of port logistics.

Collaborative Success: This initiative demonstrates how collaboration between industries can achieve significant sustainability milestones, providing a model for other companies to follow.

The European Commitment to Decarbonization

This pilot project also aligns with the European Union’s ambitious goals for decarbonization. The EU aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, and these efforts in Genoa and Savona ports are helping Italy and the broader European region work toward these targets.

By investing in zero-emission technologies, both LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises are actively contributing to the EU’s sustainability goals and helping shape the future of green logistics across the continent.

Key European benefits:

EU Green Deal: The introduction of electric trucks in Italy’s ports supports the EU Green Deal, which seeks to make Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

Market Leadership: By leading the way with electric vehicles in the logistics sector, Italy is setting an example for other countries within the EU and beyond, showing that sustainable logistics solutions are not only feasible but also effective.

Looking Toward a Greener Future for Ports

The move to electric trucks in Genoa and Savona ports is just the beginning of a larger movement toward sustainable maritime logistics. As the partnership between LC3 Trasporti and Costa Cruises expands, so too will the use of electric vehicles in Italy’s maritime sector. With each successful step, these companies are reinforcing their commitment to sustainability and green logistics, providing a roadmap for other industries to follow.

With this bold initiative, both Genoa and Savona ports are now recognized as leaders in green logistics, setting a precedent for ports around the world to follow in their efforts to reduce emissions and improve environmental responsibility.

With March being the least windy month in Germany since records began in 1950, wind power output, on the other hand, faced a drop of 5.2 percent compared to 2024.
Germany therefore must stay the course on expanding renewable power sources.
Frithjof Staiß, head of research institute ZSW, said the strong growth of renewable power sources despite a difficult economic environment showed the sector’s robustness.
Researchers from the government-backed Ariadne research project likewise warned against creating obstacles for a sustained rapid expansion of renewable power capacity.","Renewable energy sources covered nearly 56 percent of Germany’s gross electricity consumption in 2025, according to preliminary figures by energy industry group BDEW and research institute ZSW. Despite a “historically weak” first quarter of the year for wind power production and a significant drop in hydropower output, the share of renewables grew by 0.7 percentage points compared to the previous year thanks to an increase in installed solar power capacity.

Solar power output increased by 18.7 percent over the whole year, while the strong growth in installed capacity from previous years could be sustained, with more than 17 gigawatts (GW) added to the system. With March being the least windy month in Germany since records began in 1950, wind power output, on the other hand, faced a drop of 5.2 percent compared to 2024.

However, stronger winds in the second and third quarter compensated for much of the early-year decrease. Onshore turbines with a capacity of 5.2 GW were added to the grid, a marked increase from the 3.3 GW in the previous year. Due to significantly less precipitation this year compared to 2024, hydropower output dropped by nearly one quarter (24.1%), while remaining only a fraction (3.2%) of total renewable power output.

“The energy transition is the foundation of the adaptability and resilience of our economy,” said BDEW head Kerstin Andreae. Germany therefore must stay the course on expanding renewable power sources. However, in order to back up intermittent renewable power production, auctions for gas-fired power plants and a capacity market were urgently needed, she added.

Frithjof Staiß, head of research institute ZSW, said the strong growth of renewable power sources despite a difficult economic environment showed the sector’s robustness. “But uncertainty about future regulation is growing,” Staiß warned. He urged the government to provide clarity on the support framework for individual technologies, which he said would also accelerate the country’s green hydrogen plans.

Researchers from the government-backed Ariadne research project likewise warned against creating obstacles for a sustained rapid expansion of renewable power capacity. This would result in higher power prices as well as increased dependence on gas-fired power production and electricity imports. The researchers reacted to the government’s monitoring report on the energy transition released in September, which had found great uncertainty regarding projections for the growth of the country’s electricity demand. A slower-than-expected increase is possible, the report showed.

However, to conclude that this allowed for slowing down renewables expansion would be wrong, the Ariadne resesarchers said. Even if reduced support for new wind turbines and solar panels allowed the state to save money, total system costs would increase due to higher consumer prices, they found in a scenario modelling exercise. Moreover, expanding renewables at a slower pace would also lead to higher emissions and put the country at risk of missing its climate targets, they added.

Instead of enabling a longer use of fossil energy sources, policymakers should aim to push flexibility technologies, such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, or batteries. In combination with renewables, these would allow power system costs to fall while maintaining a viable emissions reduction pathway, the researchers said.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-10 12:02:05.896656

On Wednesday, the Houston-based company said it closed a Series E funding round led by a new investor, B Capital, a global venture capital firm started by Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin. With the latest announcement, Fervo says it’s raised about $1.5 billion overall since 2017 as it develops what could become the world’s largest ​“enhanced geothermal system” in Utah.

“Fervo is setting the pace for the next era of clean, affordable, and reliable power in the U.S.,” Jeff Johnson, general partner at B Capital, said in a news release.

The Series E funding comes as Fervo reportedly prepares to become a publicly traded company, which would let it raise even more capital for its ambitious projects. When asked about a potential IPO, Fervo said only that the company is ​“focused on executing our development plan” in an email to Canary Media. ​“We have a lot of capital needs going forward to fuel our planned growth and will be tapping a lot of different opportunities to make that happen.”

Fervo is part of a burgeoning movement in the U.S. and globally to unleash geothermal energy in many more places.

The carbon-free energy from deep underground is available around the clock, but it represents only about 0.4% of total U.S. electricity generation — largely because the existing technology is constrained by geography. Today’s geothermal plants rely on naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water and steam to spin their turbines and generate power, which are available in a limited number of places.

Fervo’s approach involves creating its own reservoirs by fracturing hot rocks and pumping them full of water. The company uses the same horizontal drilling techniques and fiber-optic sensing tools as the oil and gas industry in an effort to reach deeper wells and hotter sources than is possible with conventional geothermal technology.

Its flagship development, Cape Station, is well underway in Beaver County, Utah. The project’s initial 100-megawatt installation is on track to start delivering power to the grid in October 2026, which will make it the first commercial-scale enhanced geothermal project to hit such a milestone worldwide, according to Fervo. An additional 400 MW is slated to come online in 2028.

“It’s very exciting to see at this point in time, because of the tangible progress that has been made,” Sarah Jewett, Fervo’s senior vice president of strategy, told Canary Media. ​“It’s really looking like a power project out there” in Utah, she added, noting that an electrical substation and three power facilities now sit alongside the drilling equipment and well pads. About 350 people currently work at the site.

Fervo has already completed a pilot project in Humboldt County, Nevada. The 3.5-MW facility went online in November 2023 and supplies power directly to the Las Vegas-based utility NV Energy. Google, which backed the project, also joined the Series E as one of Fervo’s new investors.

The financing announced this week will enable the startup to continue building Cape Station and to start development on other project sites where Fervo is conducting rock and soil analyses, Jewett said. One of the new projects will be in Nevada, where Fervo is working with NV Energy and Google to develop 115 MW of geothermal energy that will power the tech giant’s data centers. But the startup isn’t ready to disclose more details on the other locations.

Ford CEO Farley said the Renault partnership will complement its existing one with Volkswagen.","Renault will jointly develop small, cheaper electric vehicles for Ford for the European market and will also team up to produce commercial vans to cut costs and fend off rising competition from Chinese rivals, the companies said on Tuesday.

“We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters in Paris on Monday ahead of the announcement, when describing Ford’s response to the threat posed by cheaper Chinese competition. “There is no better example than here in Europe.”

Europe’s traditional automakers face an influx of Chinese rivals from BYD to Changan and Xpeng.

Filling A Gap on The Lineup

As part of the Ford-Renault partnership, the first of two planned small EVs – to be produced at a Renault plant in northern France – will reach European car showrooms in 2028. They will be smaller than any Ford plans for the U.S. market and fill a gap in the automaker’s lineup, Farley said.

The two automakers will also jointly develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe.

In a client note, Oddo-BHF analyst Michael Foundoukidis wrote that the deal allowed Renault to offset its fixed costs and generate revenue while offering “a capital-efficient route to market for affordable EVs” for Ford.

“More broadly, this partnership underscores the growing necessity for ‘pragmatic cooperation’,” between traditional automakers to counter lower-cost Chinese competition, he wrote.

A Powerhouse for Light Commercial Vehicles

“Together we can create a powerhouse of LCV in Europe that would be very difficult for the Chinese to compete with,” Farley said.

Although there are few Chinese brand vans on sale in Europe, Farley said the two companies “compete with them directly every day” in emerging markets.

“The Chinese will come soon and that’s why I don’t want to wait,” said Renault CEO Francois Provost.

The partnership was formed after a Renault team visited Ford’s Detroit headquarters in March. Both Farley and Provost said the two automakers do not plan to merge.

Ford’s share of the European passenger car market has almost halved in Europe from 6.1% in 2019 to 3.3% in the first 10 months of this year as it has pulled back from passenger vehicle sales. As part of a series of restructurings, the company has cut jobs and this year closed its Saarlouis plant in Germany.

Given the withdrawal of EV support from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, the No. 2 U.S. automaker faces the dual expense of investing in combustion-engine models and expensive new EV technology.

Using Renault’s EV platforms with Ford designs should help the U.S. automaker to compete in Europe’s electric car market against traditional automakers such as Volkswagen VOWG.DE as well as the Chinese.

Ford already produces two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and makes vans with the German automaker. Ford CEO Farley said the Renault partnership will complement its existing one with Volkswagen.

The French automaker also develops vans with Nissan and Volvo Group.

Europe’s Smallest Mainstream Automaker

Renault is Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker and does not sell vehicles in China or the United States – the world’s two biggest car markets – so the Ford partnership boosts its manufacturing scale to lower costs.

The French carmaker is actively seeking partnerships to make fuller use of its factories and reduce the burden of developing new EVs.

In 2026, Renault will produce two vehicles using platforms from China’s Geely in Brazil and is in talks with more automakers, including China’s Chery 9973.HK, to jointly produce and sell cars.

“Our ambition … is to show that in Europe we can produce EV cars in Europe as competitively as anyone, including the Chinese,” Renault’s Provost said.

Nonprofit name

Kalamazoo Climate Crisis Coalition (KCCC)

Year formed

Our team formed in 2019 and we obtained 501(c)3 status in 2022

Mission & population served

Our mission is to mobilize collective action to achieve immediate and drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and rapid adoption of renewable energy through a transition grounded in social, racial, economic, and environmental justice.

We are committed to the work of a better climate future for our community, specifically to address these inequities: high energy costs and increasingly chaotic weather mean many of our neighbors struggle to afford needed home repairs and rising utility bills, often leading to an “eat or heat” dilemma; historic inequities, like redlining and decades of socio-economic challenges have led to barriers in property ownership and value, education and employment; and the preservation and efficiency upgrades of under-resourced family homes, which is one of the most impactful ways to reduce CO2 emissions locally.

At the heart of our work is a deep understanding that climate solutions must put the needs of those most impacted first. We offer programs in partnership with organizations committed to collaborating with homeowners in historically underserved areas in Kalamazoo County, including: providing critical home repairs and energy-efficiency upgrades in partnership with skilled trades experts; resource navigation leverages additional state, utility, and other public dollars to bringing more than $1M to Kalamazoo homeowners to support efficiency upgrades; workforce development training in partnership with existing programs; education to ensure those most impacted by pollution and extreme weather events have access to tools and knowledge to take action; and outreach to the community at-large by offering a book club and listening circles to normalize talking about topics that are taboo in some spaces.

The federally funded $18.9M Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Change Grant (CCG) we were awarded in late 2024 was terminated earlier this year, along with recipients of other organizations across the country focusing on environmental justice. This funding represented a years-long strategic investment in our community. The loss has been devastating.

However, we remain steadfast in our commitment to addressing generations-deep inequities across Kalamazoo – one home at a time – by providing critical home repairs and energy-efficiency upgrades. Each situation is unique, and may include added insulation, replacement windows, and/or a new HVAC system, ultimately reducing homeowner utility costs, increasing comfort, and making homes more adaptable to extreme weather events. More efficiently functioning homes lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Every energy efficiency measure gets us closer to driving real, impactful emissions reductions of atmospheric CO2 on a community scale.

We aim to increase the labor force skilled in green trades by supporting capacity building for existing workforce development programs. Workforce training programs can provide career pathways that break cycles of economic instability and address widespread shortages of skilled laborers for high-demand, good-paying jobs essential for Michigan’s infrastructure and economic future.

Through outreach and education, we are assisting homeowners and contractors in navigating options for tax incentives and rebate programs. For the community at-large, we continue our six-years-running program, Climate Conversations (formerly Fridays for Future), with a variety of guest speakers on issues relating to climate change. The Climate Change Book Club, offered in partnership with Western Michigan University, meets virtually every month. Our Ardea Youth Climate Leaders (YCL) program just graduated the fifth cohort in August. This youth-led initiative empowers high school students to become informed, confident and effective advocates for climate action. We are pleased to offer periodic in-person and virtual Climate Cafés in collaboration with the Michigan Climate Action Network to provide spaces for deep listening and normalize the feelings we experience in this time of multiple cascading crises.

The robust cross-community collaborations that were formed in preparation for the EPA CCG award remain, and today we are at nine partnerships. We will continue to strengthen and expand on those as project needs arise.

Impact story

Despite the devastating loss of our $18.9M Community Change Grant, our staff, board and all-volunteer Coordinating Committee scaled back planned outcomes to reframe the work and keep going. We remain deeply committed to our environmental justice priorities, and continue to pursue raising the funds required to provide critical home repairs and energy efficient upgrades. Collaborating with homeowners and contractors to secure resources for tax incentives and rebate programs remains a critical part of our work, and we are pursuing grant funding to help with this navigation service .

Our all-volunteer team formed in 2019 to plan and participate in a day-long series of events in observance of a global climate strike. It feels important to call out a few of the many accomplishments we have achieved since then, including securing formal climate emergency declarations from five local municipalities, establishing over 40 affiliate members from faith, education, business and environmental organizations, launching numerous education offerings, and obtaining grant awards.

Dec 10 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump’s freeze on approvals for major onshore wind and solar projects is leaving thousands of megawatts of clean power capacity in limbo at a time of soaring demand for electricity, a Reuters review of permitting data and interviews with industry officials shows.

Just one solar project has been approved on federal lands since Trump took office in January, and none have been permitted since July when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered that all new decisions related to renewable energy projects require his personal sign-off.

That compares to 13 solar and two wind projects approved on public lands under former President Joe Biden.

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has promised to fast-track energy infrastructure to meet rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence ‍and data centers, declaring an “energy emergency” to keep the United States competitive. But that policy excludes wind and solar projects.

The bottleneck extends to renewable projects proposed on private and state lands too, because they often require federal permits for wildlife or water impacts or access roads, according to developers and government officials.

Reuters examined permitting databases maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior and spoke with 10 industry representatives for this story.

Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said it has identified 18 gigawatts of solar projects on federal lands that were canceled or are inactive due to limited development progress since the start of the year.

“It’s extremely detrimental to our industry because it just upsets the ability to deliver projects,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which estimates that more than 500 solar and storage projects are threatened by the freeze.

Last week, more than 100 solar companies penned a letter to Congressional leaders urging them to revoke the Interior Department policy, which they said amounted to a near moratorium on new permits.

“It is difficult to understand how these actions align with the President’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability,” three Democratic senators, Michael Bennet, John Hickenlooper and Ben Ray Lujan, said in a letter to Burgum last month.

U.S. electricity demand is expected to increase 32% by 2030, with ‌data centers accounting for more than half that growth, according to an analysis by power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies.

An Interior Department spokesperson defended its approach, without confirming the details of the Reuters reporting. “The Department continues its ‌heightened oversight of wind and solar projects on public lands and waters to protect America’s national security and critical infrastructure,” the agency said in a statement.

The freeze of onshore projects has been happening quietly in the background of the administration’s very public assault on offshore wind, a nascent industry in the U.S. that has been hit with stop-work orders, funding cancellations and revoked approvals for fully-permitted facilities. A federal court ruled on Monday that the administration’s suspension of leases and permits for new wind projects was illegal.

Trump has repeatedly argued renewable energy sources like solar and wind are too expensive, receive unfair subsidies, and are less reliable than fossil fuels because they depend on the wind blowing or the sun shining.

Instead, the administration has moved aggressively to expand fossil fuel production, accelerating leasing for oil, gas and coal projects, and ordering a cut in permitting timelines for fossil energy projects and mines to no more than ​28 days.

“President Trump’s energy dominance agenda unleashes our abundant resources like oil and gas, positioning the United States to win the AI race while simultaneously lowering energy prices and increasing grid efficiency,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email.

CLOUDS OVER NEVADA

Nevada, with its sun-soaked deserts, has emerged as the epicenter of the permitting slowdown, with more than 33 gigawatts of solar and battery storage projects on or adjacent to federal lands in various stages of development, according to Republican Governor Joe Lombardo.

Lombardo warned in an August letter to Burgum that federal delays threaten supplies to NV Energy, the ‍state’s top power provider, and may hinder mining and data center expansions.

The solar projects named by Lombardo are being developed by divisions of NextEra Energy, Korea’s Hanwha and Japan’s SoftBank.

“Nevada ​remains committed to an all of the above energy strategy that includes responsible solar development,” Lombardo said in a statement to Reuters.

NextEra and SB Energy both declined to comment. Joo Yoon, the CEO of Hanwha development arm 174Power ​Global, said several of its projects are suffering from federal permitting delays, “and we are making every effort to resolve these matters in any way possible.”

An NV Energy spokesperson confirmed discussions with the Interior Department are ongoing but did not elaborate.

In October, two months after Lombardo sent his letter, the Bureau of Land ‍Management canceled the environmental review for Esmeralda 7, a proposed complex of seven solar farms spanning 62,000 acres near Tonopah, Nevada.

The agency said developers may reapply individually.

The stakes are high for communities like Boulder City, a Las Vegas satellite community, that relies on revenue from solar projects on city-owned land. Leases on existing projects generate $21 million a year, or nearly 40% of the city’s operating budget, according to city officials.

Two new developments – Hanwha’s Boulder Solar 3, and Scout Clean Energy’s Boulder Flats – would add another $3 million annually. But both projects are waiting for a final sign-off from the Bureau of Land Management because a transmission corridor is under federal jurisdiction.

“They do not communicate with us,” Brok Armantrout, Boulder City’s revenue contracts manager, said of the city’s inquiries to BLM staff. “Even though the field office is here in Las Vegas, they’ve given us email addresses promising updates. And crickets.”

Scout Clean Energy, a unit of Brookfield Asset Management, declined to comment.

FREEZING WIND

Delays are rippling across the west.

In California, power provider San Diego Community Power renegotiated a supply contract for the 400-megawatt solar-plus-battery Purple Sage Energy Center project in Nevada in May after delays pushed its timeline back by a year, ‍according to documents and video from an agency board meeting.

“There has been no movement or guidance from the Bureau of Land Management on review timelines,” SDCP’s director of power contracts, Kenny Key, told Reuters in a statement.

The project’s developer, Primergy, a division of private equity firm Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, had no comment.

Federal authorities also missed permitting deadlines for EDF’s 300-megawatt Bonanza Solar, a Nevada project that has a contract to provide power to two Los Angeles-area cities, Pasadena and Azusa, according to a federal permitting website.

And in September, Idaho Power asked the state’s utility regulator to cancel a 300-megawatt, 35-year ‍contract with NextEra’s planned Jackalope wind project in Wyoming, citing federal permitting delays. A spokesperson declined to comment.

Wood Mackenzie has ‍said federal permitting hurdles, combined with tariffs, could lower its U.S. onshore wind installation forecast by 22% through 2029.

Other agencies have also stepped up scrutiny of permits for wind and solar facilities, including those on private ​lands.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which issues permits to projects that impact streams or wetlands, announced in September it would prioritize projects that generate the most energy per acre to comply with Trump’s emergency ​declaration.

Sprawling wind and solar projects ⁠generate less power per acre than gas or nuclear plants, and have spawned criticism about aesthetics, threats to property values and the environment. But they are also faster and cheaper to build than ‌alternatives like natural gas or nuclear power plants, according to the investment bank Lazard, which conducts an annual analysis of the cost of generation technologies.

The Army Corps said it has about 37 pending applications for solar and wind projects and added that applying the new policies should not meaningfully delay permit reviews. A spokesperson did not say whether any permits had been approved this year.

In another sign of obstacles now facing wind and solar development, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service restricted access to an online planning tool that developers of all kinds can access to quickly determine if a project overlaps with threatened species, migratory birds or their habitats and evaluate a facility’s impacts.

A notice posted on the website states that “solar and wind projects are currently not eligible to utilize” the tool until they are reviewed by Interior officials.

A service spokesperson said the change would improve coordination and create a faster and more predictable process. The agency did not say whether it was currently issuing permits to wind and solar projects. It does not maintain a public permitting database.

Renewable energy project proponents are now left wondering how long planned facilities can survive the stonewalling.

“When is the next presidential election?” Armantrout said when asked how long Boulder City is planning for the stoppage to last. “I know that’s a flippant answer, but ⁠it all depends.”

Great British Energy, the government’s state-backed renewable energy company, has been allocated £700 million for UK clean power manufacturing operations.
In its Clean Energy Jobs Plan, which was released after the committee report finished collecting evidence, the government announced unspecified funding for Local Net Zero Hubs to map clean energy skills and jobs with local authorities.
It also announced £2.5 million in funding across 2025-26 for regional programmes in Cheshire, Lincolnshire and Pembrokeshire to support clean energy jobs.","The UK could gain between 135,000 and 725,000 jobs from the energy transition by 2030 with the right policy, planning and skills programmes, according to a new report from the government’s Energy Security and Net Zero committee.

The “Workforce planning to deliver clean, secure energy” report said that the UK’s energy transition will create “winners and losers” in the workforce, as energy sector businesses move their operations away from fossil fuels towards low-carbon technologies, but that there is scope for “smart policy and expenditure” to harness opportunity.

In October, energy secretary Ed Miliband announced the Clean Energy Jobs Plan, aiming to make the UK “the winner in the global clean energy jobs race”. The plan introduced a range of measures on employment, regional powers and workers’ rights, along with £1.2 billion per year to support skills development.

The report highlighted the importance of transitioning skills from traditional energy sectors into the burgeoning clean energy economy. It said that the government must “tackle barriers preventing existing energy sector workers transitioning successfully”. Most prominently, North Sea oil and gas workers have become an emblem of the energy transition’s impact on jobs. Trade union Unite recently called the government’s North Sea Future Plans for workers “tinkering around the edges”, which lacks a reliable skills transition.

The Energy Security and Net Zero committee’s report said “many of the skills of the existing energy, engineering and construction workforces are highly transferable”, and called on the government to expand Skills Passports and associated funding to enable skills transfers between sectors. It also called for “tangible workforce transition and support targets” and measures to “leverage UK manufacturing content requirements where possible”.

The government’s Clean Energy Industries Plan, published earlier this year, said that the solar PV and storage industries are “vital” to the country’s industrial transition, alongside frontier industries like wind, nuclear and carbon capture and storage. Great British Energy, the government’s state-backed renewable energy company, has been allocated £700 million for UK clean power manufacturing operations.

The UK may need to import “specific skills” from overseas in the short term to meet decarbonisation targets, the committee argued.

The report also called for greater power for devolved governments and measures to transition local workforces. “National workforce planning will need to be delivered beyond Whitehall,” it said, and said delivering workforce change may look different in different local circumstances. It said that these differences should be considered “while providing both a consistent quality in career pathways, standards and training and a portability of skills across the UK’s nations.”

Statistics from big-four consultancy PwC showed that Scotland led the UK in clean energy jobs as of November 2024.

Now the organization is calling attention to the environmental impacts of the pipeline company that brought it to court and won a $345 million judgment.

A new report released Wednesday identifies oil spills, gas releases, air pollution and other incidents at Energy Transfer’s web of pipelines and infrastructure nationwide, including subsidiaries and joint ventures. More incidents occurred in Texas, where Energy Transfer is headquartered, than any other state, according to the report.

The report, titled Bad Neighbor, follows a March 2025 jury verdict that found Greenpeace USA liable for damages during protests against Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access pipeline. Greenpeace calls the case a strategic lawsuit against public participation, or SLAPP, designed to silence criticism of the company. Greenpeace’s report on Dallas-based Energy Transfer summarizes public information on the company’s environmental record and calls for defending the rights to protest and free speech.

“Greenpeace’s bread and butter has always been exposing and bearing witness to air pollution, water pollution, the climate catastrophe, and the impacts on people and ecosystems,” said Tim Donaghy, the report’s author and Greenpeace USA’s research director. “This is what Greenpeace was built for.”

Energy Transfer denies that the lawsuit aimed to stifle free speech. In a statement, the company called the guilty verdict “a win for all the law-abiding Americans who understand the difference between the right to free speech and breaking the law.”

In its report, Greenpeace referenced what it called four “major disasters” associated with Energy Transfer and its affiliates since September 2024, including two in Texas and one offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Greenpeace also reported that of the 300 spills on pipelines owned by Energy Transfer and its affiliates between 2018 and 2025, almost two thirds occurred in Texas. The report said that Energy Transfer’s vast network of infrastructure in the Permian Basin is emitting millions of metric tons of greenhouse gases a year.

The report does not attempt to compare Energy Transfer to other companies, but shows the wide impact of one company that holds a large market share. Energy Transfer transports approximately 30 percent of U.S. natural gas and 40 percent of U.S. crude oil production.

Energy Transfer has been fined more than $100 million by federal, state and local regulators over the last three decades, according to the report. Greenpeace argues this is a “cost of doing business” for a company that in 2024 reported annual revenue of $80 billion.

“There is something wrong with a system that lets polluters off the hook but penalizes those who oppose them,” the report said.

“We are aware of the report, which recycles publicly available information in an attempt by Greenpeace to manufacture headlines,” Energy Transfer responded in a statement. “Furthermore, to intentionally misrepresent the data, the report falsely attributes to Energy Transfer issues with pipelines in which we hold only passive ownership, and which are operated by other companies.”

In the report, Greenpeace explains its methodology in detail. The report includes pipeline incidents from joint ventures where Energy Transfer is not the pipeline operator, but the company holds a greater than 25 percent interest. Greenpeace also included incidents for subsidiaries where Energy Transfer is the pipeline operator.

“Energy Transfer has a complex corporate structure that has changed significantly over time,” the report states. “The latest 10-K for FY 2024 lists over 400 named subsidiaries and several joint ventures. This makes the compilation and interpretation of past events complicated.”

Greenpeace on the Offense

Energy Transfer brought its suit against Greenpeace in 2017, alleging the organization defamed the company while supporting protesters who damaged property. Earlier this year a North Dakota jury found Greenpeace liable to pay $667 million in damages to Energy Transfer. In October, a judge cut that amount to about $345 million.

Post-trial motions are ongoing. Greenpeace spokesperson Madison Carter said the nonprofit plans to ask for a new trial if the court issues a final judgement that does not satisfy the organization. If that fails, Greenpeace can appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

Greenpeace USA’s Donaghy said that the lawsuit goes beyond the defendants.

“If people don’t feel free to speak out against those who are polluting their air and water, and whose business model is driving us towards climate collapse, then what chance do we really have in enacting solutions to these problems?” he said.

Greenpeace said it compiled the report using public databases and records, which lawyers and fact checkers reviewed. It was also shared with Energy Transfer before publication.

Energy Transfer is primarily a pipeline company, transporting oil and natural gas from areas of production to facilities where it is processed and refined. The company has also expanded into the liquified natural gas industry and has extensive offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Greenpeace said it relied on Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) data to compile liquid spills and releases of hazardous gas.

Between Jan. 1, 2018, and June 30, 2025, Energy Transfer and its affiliates, joint ventures and subsidiaries, including Sunoco, reported 300 spills of hazardous liquids, or one every nine days, according to the report. Nearly 250 of those spills involved oil, totalling 31,860 barrels, or 1.34 million gallons.

“Fossil fuels are inherently polluting and it does seem that oil spills are continuously happening,” said Donaghy. “If you look at the data collected by PHMSA and across the industry, there’s just a drumbeat of small spills and large spills over time.”

During the same time period from 2018 to 2025, Energy Transfer and its affiliates reported 126 natural gas releases, according to PHMSA data cited in the report. More than 5,000 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas were released in these incidents.

In Energy Transfer’s 2024 Corporate Responsibility report, the company said the total number of hazardous liquid accidents off its property decreased 21 percent from 2023 and were down 31 percent from the five-year average.

The largest gas releases occurred on the offshore Sea Robin gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico in two incidents in January 2025 and a third in May 2025, according to the report. The three leaks released a total of more than 3,000 MMcf of gas. All three incidents are among the five biggest gas releases reported to PHMSA by any company since 2010, according to the report.

An explosion at Energy Transfer’s Justice pipeline in Deer Park, Texas, on Sep. 16, 2024, was the largest release of hazardous liquids that Energy Transfer has reported to PHMSA since 2018, federal records show. More than 38,793 barrels of highly volatile liquids, which include natural gas liquids, were released.

The explosion occurred when a car slammed into a pipeline valve in the Houston suburb. The vehicle was engulfed in flames and the driver died on the scene. The death was later ruled a suicide.

Four people were injured and five homes were damaged, according to local news reports. A shelter-in-place order covered more than 1,000 nearby homes, businesses and schools.

Months later, the Railroad Commission of Texas, the state’s oil and gas regulator, reported that it had found no safety violations at the pipeline and would not issue fines.

The fire burned for more than three days as the pipeline depressurized. Energy Transfer reported releasing 18,312 pounds of nitrous oxides and 383,214 pounds of volatile organic compounds.

Air Alliance Houston, a nonprofit focused on the health impacts of air pollution, called for a better accounting of the incident and improved communication with local communities.

“There is a risk that comes with having pipelines in densely populated areas,” Inyang Uwak, the organization’s research and policy director, told Inside Climate News. “There can be fires and explosions that result in air pollution and chemical exposure.”

Uwak, an epidemiologist, added: “Pipelines are often considered a low-risk method of transporting hazardous compounds. However, accidents do happen, and we need to proactively prevent these accidents, particularly with above-ground pipelines.”

Energy Transfer added new concrete barricades around the pipeline valve site after the incident, according to Railroad Commission documents.

Katherine Culbert, a process safety engineer in Houston, said it raised a “red flag” that the Railroad Commission said it found no safety violations after investigating. Culbert is running for the Republican nomination for a seat on the Railroad Commission.

“I have worked for pipeline companies,” she said. “Every company has something where they could improve. If people are dying, there is something that could be done to make it better.”

Railroad Commission spokesperson Bryce Dubee said that less than half of 1 percent of reported hazardous liquid incidents were caused by vehicle damage. “Whatever the cause is, we thoroughly investigate each incident,” he said.

Energy Transfer’s largest crude oil spill since 2018 occurred on May 5, 2025, in Arlington, Texas, according to the Greenpeace report. The spill released a reported 6,600 barrels, or 277,200 gallons, of oil underground. The oil entered a broken sewer pipe and flowed to Fort Worth’s Village Creek wastewater treatment plant a few miles away. Oil appeared in several areas of the treatment plant and a popular birding area was closed. Cleanup costs were estimated at $5 million.

The report goes on to document greenhouse gas emissions from Energy Transfer’s operations in the Permian Basin, worker safety violations and other lawsuits that the company has brought challenging the constitutionality of pipeline safety enforcement.

“We’re not able to say if Energy Transfer is worse or best [among pipeline companies],” said Greenpeace’s Donaghy. “But we can say that their operations are causing impacts for communities, and that makes them a bad neighbor.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2172868791-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 09:00:37.708336

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) is pulling out familiar and some new tools to spark interest in the Model Y as the year winds down. With only a few weeks left in 2024, the company is offering 0% APR financing for up to six years, along with free color and interior upgrades that normally add $1,000 to $2,500 to the price. Buyers considering the Model 3 can also get financing at 2.99% APR, a significant drop from typical rates.

The push comes at a moment when the loss of federal tax credits has made electric vehicles less affordable for many shoppers. Still, the incentives gave the stock a lift, with shares rising nearly 2.5% on Tuesday as investors welcomed signs that Tesla is working to protect delivery volume.

Even so, the broader landscape remains challenging. In Europe, Stellantis is teaming up with ride-hailing company Bolt to introduce driverless vehicles to a massive customer base a move that could crowd Tesla's position in autonomous driving. Ford has also stepped up its efforts, calling the current period a fight for survival in the EV market.

The European Commission has unveiled an EU Grids Package, a set of legislative and policy measures to modernise and expand Europe’s electricity grids. The Package is a crucial step to make energy more affordable and secure for households and industry. It addresses long-standing bottlenecks in grid development. It proposes new rules for grid planning and permitting. And it sets out a vision for a more integrated, resilient, and future-proof energy system – based on high shares of wind.

Today the European Commission presented an EU Grids Package. It aims to boost investment in Europe’s grid infrastructure, strengthen interconnectivity, and support the EU’s energy security and competitiveness goals.

Grids are the biggest bottleneck to new wind energy projects. Europe needs to invest €584bn by 2030 to upgrade its grid infrastructure. But grid investment has long fallen short.

This underinvestment leads to curtailed renewable electricity and higher energy bills. It undermines Europe’s energy security. WindEurope’s latest study shows that a renewables-based energy system will save Europe up to €1.6tn, as compared to four alternative energy system scenarios, even when you factor in grids and system integration costs.

“Grids are vital to Europe’s energy security and competitiveness. A renewables-based energy system will be much cheaper for Europe – even when you factor in the additional costs for grids, storage, and electrification. But you can’t have more renewable electricity without more grids. The EU Grids Package will enable faster permitting, better planning and increased investment certainty”, says Giles Dickson, WindEurope CEO.

What it means for wind

Today wind energy is 20% of all electricity consumed in Europe. It will be 34% by 2030 and more than 50% by 2050. But Europe is not building enough new wind. Around 500 GW of wind energy projects are currently waiting for grid connection permits. The system is clogged up; authorities are overloaded.

To resolve this issue, the EU Grids Package recommends a shift from today’s “first come, first serve” principle to “first ready, first serve”, including new filtering criteria and project milestones. This new approach will help prioritise viable projects and filter out speculative “zombie projects”. This increases the visibility for permitting authorities and allows viable projects to move forward faster.

“We have entered a new age of electricity”, Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera explained, presenting the Package. Europe is set to ramp up the share of electricity in its total energy consumption, from below 25% today to 50% by 2040. This requires a totally different approach to grid planning.

The Package proposes better top-down grid planning. The Commission will take on a bigger role: it will create a forward-looking scenario for Europe’s Ten-Year Development Plan (TYNDP), in line with the EU’s 2040 and 2050 objectives. Europe’s transmission system operators will then base their planning on this new scenario. A new “infrastructure needs identification report”, drafted by ENTSO-E will identify present and future gaps and investment needs.

The Package will ensure grid investments mobilise both public and private finance. On the public side, the EU is scaling up its support for energy infrastructure in the next EU budget, including with a 5-fold increase in the Connecting Europe Facility. On the private side, the EU will launch a new Clean Energy Investment Strategy in 2026. It will propose concrete private sector actions, including from institutional investors, as well as support from the European Investment Bank (EIB).

The Package also aims to scale up Europe’s grid equipment supply chain. It proposes the establishment of a new platform for EU distribution network planning to track distribution grid related-manufacturing needs. Next year’s revision of the Public Procurement Directives will further strengthen Europe’s manufacturing base for grids technologies “made in Europe”.

Finally, the Package recognises offshore grids as a new priority. It contains new initiatives and rules around cross-border grid planning and cost-sharing. Next to that, the Package proposes new “Energy Highways”, key grid projects, such as cross-border interconnectors and offshore hubs.

Accelerating permitting

The Package tables a permitting acceleration directive which will involve tweaking various directives, including the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Electricity Market Design Directive (EMD). The targeted Commission proposal contains important improvements, for example on the permitting of repowered wind farms, storage units and hybrid power plants.

“The Grids Package proposes a targeted and well-balanced revision of existing permitting rules. Good. But well-intended attempts to accelerate permitting must not end up undermining investment security. And they must not undermine public acceptance either. Stick to the sensible and targeted measures proposed by the Commission. And otherwise focus on implementing the Renewables Directive rules that are not being tweaked,” says Giles Dickson.

The Package includes further improvements to permitting, such as the option to introduce “positive silence” to speed up permitting decisions, a toolbox for public inclusion, and the application of “overriding public interest” to Projects of Common Interest (PCIs).

The Package asks Member States to establish a single digital portal at national level for all the steps of the permitting procedures for renewable energy, storage and grid projects. All document submissions and communication between project developers and authorities would take place on the portal. This marks a breakthrough in the digitalisation of permitting and could make paper-based applications obsolete.

Next steps

Electricity grids are the backbone of our energy system. They connect countries and allow electricity to be transported to where it is needed. The EU Grids Package sets out a clear vision for a modern, integrated, and resilient grid infrastructure that can deliver on the EU’s energy security and competitiveness goals.

Many elements of the Grids Package come in the form of recommendations to Member States. National implementation will be crucial. WindEurope stands ready to work with EU Member States and industry partners to make Europe’s grids fit for a future energy system based on high shares of wind energy.",https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/Grids-europe.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:07.955785

STOCKHOLM, Dec 10 (Reuters) – Leaders from across Europe’s electric car industry on Wednesday urged the European Commission to stick ‍to its 2035 zero-emission target for new cars, warning that any retreat would undermine investment and widen the bloc’s gap with China.

The EU executive is set to unveil an automotive package on December ‌16 that could give more flexibility ‌on CO2 targets and ease an effective ban on new sales of combustion-engine cars from 2035, something being pushed by German automakers and the European Automobile ​Manufacturers’ Association.

In an open letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, campaign group ‍E-Mobility Europe and ChargeUp Europe, ​backed by nearly 200 signatories such ​as Swedish automakers Polestar and Volvo Cars, called ‍for the targets to be kept.

“We are deeply concerned about recent efforts to dilute your objectives,” the letter said, referring to intense lobbying efforts by the wider auto industry.

The groups added ‍that reopening the door to transitional technologies such as plug-in hybrids and CO2-neutral fuels would create uncertainty ‍and slow ‍the shift to electric vehicles, even ​as Chinese electric automakers streak ahead ​and ⁠cut costs.

“Every delay in Europe only ‌widens the gap with China,” it added.

After announcing it will back over 1,000 local and community energy projects over the next five years, the company has increased renewable funding for the UK’s devolved nations by £12 million to over £21 million.

It follows an initial pledge of £9.3 million for the devolved governments to use for renewable energy schemes and solar panels on public sector buildings.

The Scottish Government is receiving a further £5.5 million from Great British Energy and is today announcing 23 new projects, partially backed by both the new funding and Scottish Government investment. Together they will have offered funding to 71 community projects across Scotland this year – from a community solar farm on the Isle of Arran to wind farms in Aberdeenshire.

Meanwhile Great British Energy is backing the Welsh Government with an additional £6.6 million, with more than £2.8 million announced in March, to fund solar panels for schools, leisure centres and museums across Wales, as well as supporting the Welsh Government’s new Ymestyn scheme that will help public sector and communities to complete projects such as solar canopies and battery energy storage.

And in Northern Ireland Great British Energy will help the Further Education Colleges to benefit from clean energy, through installation of Solar PV at a number of sites.

UK Government Minister for Energy Michael Shanks said:

Great British Energy is empowering communities in every nation of the UK to take a stake in their own energy.

This is our clean energy superpower mission in action – putting communities in the driving seat of energy generation and making sure working people and local businesses profit.

Great British Energy CEO, Dan McGrail, said:

Communities are at the heart of our clean energy future. By increasing our support for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great British Energy is ensuring that communities benefit directly from the transition to renewables – through lower bills and greater energy security.

This funding will help unlock hundreds of projects that will not only provide clean energy to communities but also help accelerate our mission to make the UK a clean energy superpower.

Welsh Government Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change, Huw Irranca-Davies, said:

We are driving towards a net zero public sector by 2030, and this funding will help us get even closer.

Thanks to this funding, organisations across Wales will see their energy bills falling in a matter of months.

Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said:

Community-led energy projects are at the heart of Scotland’s journey to net zero. By empowering local groups to generate their own clean energy with local solutions, we are not only cutting emissions but also reducing costs and creating resilient communities. These projects show what can be achieved when people come together with a shared vision for a sustainable future.

This funding is giving communities the tools and confidence to take control of their own energy needs, keep money circulating locally, and build a fairer, greener economy.

Scotland’s transition to net zero must be inclusive and fair, and community energy is a vital part of ensuring that everyone benefits from the opportunities of a clean energy future.

Secretary of State for Wales Jo Stevens said:

Wales is at the centre of the UK’s clean energy industry which is already delivering the well-paid, highly-skilled jobs of the future.

This funding from GB Energy, which includes solar panels in public buildings across Wales, will bring lower bills as well as help our drive towards energy security.

The funding marks progress in Great British Energy and government’s Local Power Plan that will ensure the benefits of the government’s clean power mission are felt at a local level across the UK, with energy security, good jobs and economic growth – while also helping to rebuild the nation’s public services.

It follows a £255 million investment to roll out solar panels for 260 NHS sites and over 250 schools as well as military sites in England, helping to cut bills for frontline services, as well as £10 million in grant funding for England’s Mayoral Strategic Authorities to deliver local clean energy projects, announced earlier this year.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:11.020960

But its real purpose is creating emissions-free energy to power an electric vehicle through an innovative process involving ammonia.

A few miles away in Shed 5 in Detroit’s historic Eastern Market, Civilized Cycles founder and CEO Zach Schieffelin tools around in an electric tricycle pulling a small trailer that carries as much as 800 pounds of cargo.

Neither is a fanciful science project. They are finalists in the global three-year, $9 million Toyota Mobility Foundation Sustainable Cities Challenge aimed at “helping cities move more safely, inclusively, and sustainably.”

The challenge is sponsored and organized by the Toyota Mobility Foundation, or TMF, which was established “ to create a truly mobile society that will help people live better lives no matter where they are,” as stated by Akio Toyoda, foundation board chairman on the organization’s website.

Partnering with the TMF are Challenge Works and World Resources Institute.

Launched in 2023 with a call to cities looking to address mobility issues, the following year, three cities were chosen from a shortlist of 10 to host what are called “city challenges” to tackle specific sustainability issues:

Venice, Italy: Increase the use of existing low and zero-carbon transport modes

Varanasi, India: Create innovative, data-driven solutions that make crowded areas of Varanasi's old city of Kashi safer and more accessible for all.

Detroit, Michigan: Demonstrate solutions that decrease fossil fuel use and reduce costs of freight operations in Detroit’s Eastern Market.

Founded in 1891, the Eastern Market is a bustling 24-acre urban oasis that typically draws thousands of shoppers searching for fresh produce, meat, flowers, treats and meals along with artwork, crafts, clothing and music.

All that merchandise has to be moved in, out and between the market’s storefronts and sheds and other hard-to-access downtown destinations.

“Through the challenge we want to understand, for example, current freight patterns, look at ways to reduce emissions, test solutions that support Eastern Market’s long term health,” said John Daly, Toyota Mobility Foundation program manager, in an interview.

Neology and Civilized Cycles are two of four companies participating in the Detroit challenge and vying for larger shares of the prize money.

The other two are Electricfish Energy Inc. and Orange Sparkleball Inc.

Using different technologies, both are addressing the Eastern Market’s goal of cleaner mobility as a way of demonstrating a broader practical uses for their innovations.

For Switzerland-based Neology, it’s all about finding a safer way to create and transport hydrogen to power electric fuel-cell vehicles through a process called ammonia decomposition, or cracking. It uses a catalyst and heat to decompose the ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen.

The advantage, explained Maroonian, is, it solves the issue of storing and transporting highly flammable hydrogen, a major impediment to wider adoption of fuel cell vehicles which emit only water vapor.

The only substance transported is more stable ammonia.

“I think that could be one of the game changers in enabling hydrogen to change, actually, the way we store it, and we actually, in our process, what we're saying you never see hydrogen. So when you need it, you produce it. When you don't need it, you skip it.” said Maroonian.

Aside from providing clean energy with less concern about storage and transportation, Maroonian also touts a considerable cost savings pointing out four times more energy density per volume compared to hydrogen in high pressure, reducing moving costs 30%-40%.

Already awarded some funds from the challenge, Maroonian is hoping to win even more to expand Neology as a provider of hydrogen for fleets operating fuel cell vehicles, and in particular, to Detroit and its Eastern Market.

“The reason why I’m extremely excited with Detroit Sustainable Cities Challenge is, first, here is the mobility town. Mobility needs to change or bring this hydrogen to the market,” said Maroonian.

Civilized Cycles tackles the clean mobility issue by swapping out gasoline or diesel-burning delivery vans for three-wheeled electric Semi-Trikes that can transport modest loads, pollution-free.

“They've used it for moving whiskey from the distillery factory that's outside the market, into their retail facilities on market, and we are starting fairly shortly, a bunch of demonstration projects, where we are picking up compost,” said Schieffelin. “We're picking up recoverable food for, like, food pantries and for doing deliveries, all mostly going downtown, but not 100% downtown, from Eastern Market, from existing vendors who are currently using cars and trucks to do those deliveries.”

Like Neology, Civilized Cycles has been awarded some funding to help finance its efforts and Schieffelin is hoping to add more units to his fleet and expand his business should the company win further funding.

Eastern Market director of programs Brandon Seng is very encouraged with what he’s seen so far. Given the market’s unique set-up, he knows what works there won’t work everywhere else, but it’s worth giving ideas a try, explaining, “That's really what we're trying to do, is see what works and how we can move things a little bit more efficiently and a little bit more environmentally friendly, and hopefully all these things knit together into something that's a little bit more sustainable moving forward.”

Indeed, the city of Detroit was anxious to join the challenge for the express purpose of accelerating development and experimentation with mobility innovation at the Eastern Market and beyond.

“The Sustainable Cities Challenge gave us an opportunity to give Brandon and Eastern Market kind of a glimpse of the future, and that allows us to have better dialog with a different vocabulary about what future funding should go to and where we should be focusing. Because otherwise, you know, this would all be theoretical,” noted Vincent Keenan, head of innovation engagement for the office of mobility innovation, office of the Mayor of Detroit, in an interview.

The challenge concludes in March when up to three winners in each of the three cities will be announced, with the remaining funds divided between them to continue their work, according to Daly.

In the case of Detroit’s Eastern Market, the goal for Daly and the Toyota Mobility Foundation, the real prize from the challenge will be shared far beyond the Motor City, declaring, “We're really hoping that it enables Eastern Market in the city of Detroit, to be able to be able to eventually achieve a goal of being thought leaders in an area that that multiple cities across the country, across the globe, are struggling with clean freight innovation. How can we do it in a responsible way? Well, we may not have all the answers, may not have all the innovation, but it's a start.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69387b4f93006cc434e86b6f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-10 07:59:04.475488

Thoughts of running out of battery in the middle of nowhere or waiting hours at a slow charger may give pause to even the most seasoned road-trippers. But the good news is that with a bit of strategic planning, cross-country EV travel can be just as smooth, and even more enjoyable and cost-effective, than traditional gas-powered journeys.

Below are expert tips to help you minimize charging stops, avoid range anxiety, and make the most of your trip.

Gas Stations Are Everywhere, Chargers Aren’t (Yet)

Gas stations have been a part of U.S. infrastructure for over a century. There are more than 145,000 gas stations across the country, and they’re located in virtually every town, off every freeway exit, and often within a few miles of each other. They’re easy to spot, often with large signs and consistent branding.

In contrast, while the number of EV chargers is skyrocketing, with over 65,000 public charging stations and nearly 170,000 charging ports in the U.S., they’re often tucked away in parking garages, behind buildings, or in hard-to-spot locations, such as hotel lots or the back corners of shopping centers. Unless you’re using a dedicated app to guide you, they can be tough to find.

Coastal states such as California, New York, Oregon, and Washington are leading the charge in electric vehicle adoption and public charging infrastructure development. Others, particularly in the Midwest, South, and parts of the Mountain West, still have limited access to reliable public EV charging. So, depending on where you are going, there may be lots of chargers or they may be hard to find.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center offers an Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations map, which helps you locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the United States and Canada. This tool is useful for identifying areas where EV charging is scarce.

Use a Route Planning App or Built-In EV Navigation

Many newer EVs come with built-in navigation systems that automatically calculate charging stops based on your vehicle’s range and your selected destination. For example, EVs with Google Maps integration, such as those from General Motors, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, can automatically route you through the nearest fast-charging stations.

Keep these on your phone:

PlugShare: Crowdsourced database of nearly all chargers, with reviews, photos, and filter options.

A Better Route Planner (ABRP): Custom route planning with charging stops tailored to your vehicle.

Google Maps now shows EV chargers, and some locations list the real-time availability and speed of the chargers.

Always Have a Backup Plan and Range Cushion

Even with a carefully planned route, things can go wrong: chargers may be out of order, temporarily offline, or occupied. That’s why it’s smart to consistently identify a secondary charging station near each planned stop, preferably within a 10- to 15-mile radius.

Also, leave yourself a range buffer; don’t aim to arrive at a charger with 1% battery remaining. Weather, traffic, or terrain (like unexpected hills) can impact range. Having a cushion of at least 20–30 miles can be the difference between reaching a charger and getting stuck on the roadside.

Download EV Charging Apps and Sign Up

Unlike the standardized experience of gas stations, EV charging infrastructure is still maturing, and it’s split among various networks. That means you’ll likely use chargers from several different companies during your cross-country adventure. To make this seamless, download the apps for the major charging networks before you hit the road, and create user accounts with a payment method stored. Keep your usernames and passwords handy.

Key apps to have on hand:

Electrify America

ChargePoint

Blink

EVgo

Most mobile apps show real-time charger status, availability, and even user reviews.

Lack of Universal Charging Standards

While the recent push toward adopting the North American Charging Standard (NACS) is helping to simplify things, the charging ecosystem remains fragmented. Teslas use NACS, some vehicles use CCS, others use CHAdeMO, and not every station supports every plug type. Tesla’s Supercharger network has traditionally been limited to Tesla drivers (although that’s changing). If you’re not driving a Tesla, your charging options might be more limited depending on your route.

Get an Adapter

Most EV makers offer an officially licensed and approved adapter for CCS or CHAdeMO to NACS. With these adapters, you won’t be locked out of charging opportunities. In July 2025, Honda announced that Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX owners now have access to more than 23,500 selected Tesla Superchargers across the United States with the availability of the first Honda-approved NACS-CCS DC fast-charging adapter.

Know Your EV’s Charging Capabilities

Not all EVs charge at the same speed. Some max out at 150 kW, while others can reach 250 kW or more. Knowing your car’s peak charging rate can help you avoid wasting time at chargers that exceed your vehicle’s limits. For instance, if your EV maxes out at 100kW, there’s no benefit to stopping at a 350kW charger.

Book Hotels with On-Site Charging

One of the smartest ways to simplify your trip is by staying at hotels that offer EV charging. These are typically Level 2 chargers, which can add 20–40 miles of range per hour, allowing you to fully charge your battery after an overnight stay. This approach saves you from having to make a charging stop first thing in the morning.

Apps like PlugShare enable you to filter for hotels with charging stations, and many hotel websites are now listing EV amenities directly. Some hotel chains, including Marriott, Hilton, and Best Western, have steadily expanded EV charging access across their properties. In many cases, these chargers are provided free of charge or included with your stay, adding convenience and cost savings.

Plan Stops Where You Can Eat, Shop, or Relax

Charging doesn’t have to be dead time. Many EV drivers find that stopping every few hours for a 30-minute charge lines up perfectly with breaks for meals or rest. Try to plan your stops around amenity-rich locations, such as places with nearby restrooms, restaurants, coffee shops, or grocery stores. This way, you’re not just waiting for a charge; you’re grabbing a bite, stretching your legs, or even getting some shopping done.

Some charging stations, particularly those of Electrify America and Tesla Supercharger locations, are strategically placed near retail areas and fast-food chains. But that’s not always the case, so use Google Maps or Yelp to check what’s within walking distance of the stations on your route.

You can also tweak your charging stops in ABRP or your vehicle’s navigation system. Just ensure the alternate charger is still within range and has the required charging speed.

If you can charge at level 2 during these stops, you’ll save money as it’s less expensive than DCFC (Level 3) fast-charging stations.

Make EV Road Trips Fun, Plan Ahead

Taking a cross-country trip in an electric vehicle no longer means endless anxiety about charging or limited route options. With innovative tools like route planning apps, real-time station data, and an expanding nationwide charging network, EV road trips are becoming easier, faster, cheaper, and more enjoyable than ever.

The key is preparation: plan your route with charging in mind, keep a backup for each stop, and choose places to recharge where you can relax and refuel. Stay at hotels with overnight charging and carry the right apps for your vehicle and charger access. Get an adapter if you can.

With the right approach, a long road trip in an EV can be just as convenient as driving a gas car. Not only that, but cheaper, quieter, cleaner, and more satisfying.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southtexasnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/14/d14eb52e-bf3f-5555-9d5a-d0facffe1dc9/6912518c7b185.preview.jpg?crop=1948%2C1023%2C0%2C20&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-10 12:03:22.661332

Other states and electric rates Across the border in South Carolina, Kansas-based QTS Data Center is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in York County.","Duke Energy is investing billions to upgrade its power grid, in part responding to unprecedented demand expected from a surge in new data centers. The Charlotte utility giant is adamant, however, that residential customers’ bill will not grow because of those data centers.

Some experts aren’t so sure. That’s already happening to customers of other utility companies around the country, they say.

The rise of artificial intelligence that’s now commonplace is fueling the ravenous power needs of data centers around the Carolinas and nationally. Domestic energy usage by data centers is expected to double or triple within just three years, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

So how is Duke Energy handling those needs?

The company is adding 13 gigawatts (GW) of capacity over the next five years, with a total cost between $95 billion to $105 billion, CEO Harry Sideris announced during a November earnings call. The plan is across all of Duke Energy’s six-state market, including the Carolinas.

That 13 GW is equal to having capacity to power about 2.3 million homes annually.

The long-term goal, detailed in Duke Energy’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan, involves modernizing power generation by both adding more clean energy sources and expanding capacity and efficiency in its electric grid infrastructure. That plan includes new substations and transmission lines in the Carolinas.

The costs cited by Sideris are higher than the $83 billion grid modernization plan through 2029 the company had announced in February.

Locations for some of these potential investments are in “preliminary evaluation,” said Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman. He noted that the company’s most significant proposed projects are publicly shared prior to evaluation by the N.C. Utilities Commission, often including local public hearings.

Top NC leaders fighting Duke Energy rate hike

Duke Energy Carolinas covers the western half of the state, including Charlotte, and serves about 2.9 million residential customers. Progress operates in the eastern half, including the Triangle region, serving 1.8 million customers. Both companies also serve parts of South Carolina.

Combined, the utilities serve over 4.7 million customers.

In mid-November, Duke Energy proposed an approximately 15% rate hike for its nearly 5 million customers with Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The rate increase would occur between 2027 and 2028, if approved by state regulators.

But top N.C. leaders objected to that rate hike last week.

Attorney General Jeff Jackson said he was intervening in the rate request before the Utilities Commission to “ensure it is necessary.” Gov. Josh Stein quickly backed Jackson, saying he too opposes the hike because it is “simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy.”

Duke Energy previously told the Observer it does not make rate requests lightly, and looks forward to continuing constructive dialog with all parties as the review moves forward next year.

During the earlier earnings call, Sideris reiterated that Duke Energy is focused on ensuring all 10 million of its customers receive service at a fair price, and that “customer value and affordability remain front and center.”

“Our job is to address the needs of all customers,” Sideris said, “from large industrial customers that are competing against a global market to residential customers that are managing their household budgets.

“We’re protecting existing customers through tariff structures and contract provisions for new large load projects,” he said. Tariffs refers to the structured rates the company charges customers for electricity.

How Duke Energy plans to ensure fair power bills

Residential customers won’t be on the hook for huge data center usage, according to Duke Energy.

The company says it plans to implement new terms of service, rate structures and contracts to ensure that large-load customers cover the full costs of serving them. “These customers will pay substantial energy bills, and their rates will be continually reviewed to ensure fairness,” Duke Energy stated in an email to the Observer. “Residential customer rates are not based on proximity to large energy users.”

Duke Energy also is working to manage costs through use of AI and combining Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress utilities. If approved, Sideris said the deal would save retail customers more than $1 billion through 2038. Internally, Duke Energy has established work teams to accelerate the time it takes to meet growing energy needs, according to CFO Brian Savoy.

Just this year, the company signed electric service agreements with data centers for 3 GW, including Digital Realty and Edged, which are making multibillion-dollar investments in North Carolina to support AI infrastructure.

“We’re protecting existing customers through tariff structures and contract provisions for new large load projects,” Sederis said.

Rising electric rates

Nationally, the digital infrastructure boom risks driving up electricity prices for U.S. households an average of 8%, according to a study by Carnegie Mellon University and NC State University released in June. “Policymakers must act now to align infrastructure investment and regulation with this demand surge,” the analysis said.

Legislators and utility providers are looking to shield residents from increased electricity bills and potential blackouts amid rapid data center expansions and the infrastructure upgrades required to support them.

Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, cited by CNBC.

Three states that climbed faster than the national average are Virginia, known as “Data Center alley,” as well as Illinois and Ohio. All have a high concentration of data centers.

In North Carolina, the Power Bill Reduction Act, passed in July, overriding Stein’s veto. It had been debated regarding its potential impact on power bills, pitting businesses and residents against each other. The bill delays Duke Energy’s interim 2030 carbon reduction goals and allows the company to charge rate-payers for new power plants before they’re built.

An analysis by N.C. State University found the bill could cost ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050.

But Duke Energy says the bill helps lower the long-term price customers pay for new power generation, with up to $15 billion in total cost savings.

Energy demand and data centers

Understanding the full impact that surging power demands for electricity that AI-fueled tech is bringing, and its implications for data centers, is an ongoing issue.

Some experts say more power-generating capacity is critical for the U.S.

“If we can’t build the energy infrastructure, we will be really struggling to meet the hype of AI. And I think there’s a real risk that we may not be able to do it in this country,” said Robert Cox, executive director of Energy Production & Infrastructure Center and associate professor of electrical and computing engineering at UNC Charlotte. “To do AI, you need big data centers.”

There are environmental concerns to consider, in addition to power and economic ones.

To meet rising energy needs, Duke Energy wants to extend the life of three North Carolina coal-fired plants at Marshall Steam Station on Lake Norman, Belews Creek in Stokes County and Cliffside in Cleveland County.

“The carbon footprint from data centers is very large because they consume a huge amount of energy, and most of that energy comes from non-renewable resources,” said Srijan Das, a computer science assistant professor at UNC Charlotte. “So they’re creating a lot of CO2 pollution, which leads to climate change.”

Duke Energy is preparing for an additional 2 GW of new data center load across the Carolinas and secured 11 new natural gas turbines, manufactured in Greenville, S.C., to help meet demand. That amount of gigawatts is equivalent to powering about 1.5 million homes a year.

Just last year, Duke Energy officials signed agreements for 2,000 megawatts of new data centers in the third quarter of 2024, the News & Observer in Raleigh reported.

Duke Energy did not specify locations or how much of that capacity is in the Carolinas. But Savoy noted that data center developers are attracted to the Carolinas because more than half of the energy mix is carbon-emissions-free nuclear power.

Other states and electric rates

Across the border in South Carolina, Kansas-based QTS Data Center is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in York County. Company spokeswoman Karen DiMaggio said her conclusion is that “data centers aren’t to blame for higher electric bills.

“States where the power bills are the highest are not states that have a high concentration of data centers,” she said at a Lake Wylie, S.C., community meeting in November.

The average U.S. retail price for electricity is 12.68 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Hawaii has the highest average price in the U.S., paying 38 cents per kWh.

North Carolina and South Carolina are at 11.65 cents and 10.90 cents per kWh, respectively. Still, they are higher than Virginia, with the world’s largest concentration of data centers, which is at 10.62 cents per kWh.

“We recognize that our work to provide affordable energy for customers is never done,” Sideris said. “But we are proud that average rate changes have paced below the rate of inflation over the last decade, and that our rates are well below the national average.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/public/latest-news/rypdrb/picture311356385/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/buck-combined-cycle-4217.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 05:59:46.530524

State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency.","HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Southeast Asia is a bright spot for the embattled offshore wind industry as it reels from U.S. President Donald Trump’s push against renewable energy.

The White House's policy pivot has thrown billions of dollars' worth of U.S. offshore wind projectsinto turmoil. Industry interest and investment are looking elsewhere, and developing regions with ample wind resources, like Southeast Asia, have the most to gain from this likely reshuffling, analysts say.

Wind energy is essential to efforts to curb climate change, scientists say, as global temperatures drift perilously higher. Offshore wind, which uses turbines installed in the sea, is set to grow rapidly because it can harness stronger, steadier ocean winds to generate clean electricity, the International Energy Agency says.

Southeast Asia, with its archipelago nations, long coastlines and consistently windy seas, is emerging as one of the world’s most promising regions for this technology. As energy demand continues to rise, the Philippines and Vietnam are building policy momentum that proponents hope will spur interest across the region.

Those moves could turn Southeast Asia into a model for other developing nations seeking to use wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, said Rebecca Williams, with the Global Wind Energy Council.

“Asia and Southeast Asia are a beacon of hope for the industry,” she said.

Trump has actively sought to kill the U.S. offshore wind industry, one of his presidential campaign promises.

He opposes using renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes burning fossil fuels for electricity, contending that climate change is a hoax.

The White House has halted construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked and paused permits, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for wind energy and cut $679 million in federal funding for a dozen projects — a complete reversal from former President Joe Biden's Administration.

Trump’s anti-renewable energy stance has shaken U.S. confidence in offshore wind projects.

That has kickstarted an industry-wide search for other places to invest.

Globally, wind energy generation is growing, led by China. It dominates wind power installations and manufactures more than half of the world’s wind turbines. Beijing is also emerging as a quiet force in the region’s offshore wind buildout, supplying turbines and engineering expertise as countries race to tap their coastal wind potential.

“We’re seeing more governments in the Global South, especially in countries in Asia, who haven’t had that background in offshore wind, now really step up,” Williams said.

Home to half of the global population, Asia is expected to account for much of the world’s future energy demand. Yet the region still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and wind generates barely 7% of Asia-Pacific’s electricity, according to the IEA.

The 11 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, a vast region that includes tiny Brunei to populous Indonesia, have no installed wind power capacity.

So there's a lot of untapped potential up for grabs, said Amisha Patel, with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, an organization of countries promoting offshore wind.

Trump's rhetoric is disappointing given America's vast wind potential, but it hasn't slowed global wind power developments, and ""Southeast Asia is stepping forward as the U.S. retreats,” she said.

Last month, Singapore announced a three-year plan for wind energy conferences to attract investment and become a regional hub for the industry.

“Asia is looking very, very attractive because of the momentum that we’re seeing there and the core understanding of the value of offshore wind,” Patel said.

The Philippines and Vietnam have an early advantage.

The Philippines held its first offshore wind auction in November, allowing companies to bid and compete for the right to build 3.3 gigawatts of wind farms on designated seabeds. Energy Secretary Sharon Garin said that shifted offshore wind power from “potential to reality,” with clear rules and plans for how wind farms will connect to the grid, which ports they'll use and how equipment will be moved.

“The Philippines is ready to compete for global investment,” she said in a statement.

Filipino corporation ACEN partnered with Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners in May to co-develop the nation’s first large-scale offshore wind project, aiming for up to 1 gigawatts in the central Philippine province of Camarines Sur.

Vietnam has revived long-stalled offshore wind ambitions, issuing new rules and courting foreign investors. It revised its national power plan in April, targeting up to 17 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, and is speeding up marine zoning rules and updating permitting procedures.

Regulatory delays led Norway's Equinor to withdraw from Vietnam in 2024, but investor confidence is slowly growing. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is working with state-owned PetroVietnam on an offshore wind project in south-central Vietnam and Germany’s PNE AG is planning a $4.6 billion, 2-gigawatt farm in Binh Dinh province.

Vietnam is exploring regional projects. It signed a deal in May for a transmission line to export power to Singapore and Malaysia.

China is also emerging as an important player in the region. State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency. In the Philippines, Mingyang Smart Energy is exploring a 2-gigawatt project in Northern Luzon.

Extreme weather is a challenge for offshore wind, especially in the Philippines and Vietnam, which endured an onslaught of deadly typhoons this year.

But technology for disaster-resilient turbines exists, said Michael Hannibal of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. ""Countries will just need to make sure offshore wind sites are adapted and made for the environment that they are to live with and stand in,"" he said.

Putting dollars to work

Of the total allocation this month, $463 million has come via Senate Bill (SB) 1, the Road Repair and Accountability Act of 2017, and $190 million from the 2021 federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

SB 1 has invested approximately $5 billion annually toward transportation projects since 2017. It provides funding split between the state and local agencies. Road projects progress through construction phases more quickly, depending on the availability of funds, including those partially funded by SB 1.

California is expected to receive nearly $42 billion in federal infrastructure funding over a span of five years. These investments will upgrade the state's roads, bridges, rail, public transit, airports, ports, and the electric vehicle charging network.

The gold standard for American EV infrastructure

California is tearing down barriers to ZEV deployment, speeding up EV charging station installations, and deploying infrastructure in hard-to-reach and low-income areas.

While qualifying for federal ZEV incentives contributed to the sales spike this quarter, becoming an EV driver in California is increasingly getting easier. There are now over 200,000 publicly accessible EV charging stations statewide. EV chargers can be found at grocery stores, park-and-ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared EV chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors' offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared private EV chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes.

California's climate leadership

Pollution is down, and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 - even as the state's GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world's fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, making it the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day this year.",,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:16.107092

Community solar, when implemented through a true free-market approach, can strengthen reliability, reduce costs, and open a competitive and innovative energy market in Wisconsin.","Madison, WI — In a hearing that lasted more than 3 1/2 hours, fourteen witnesses including Wisconsin farmers, contractors, solar developers, economists, and major employers testified today in strong support of Local Solar legislation (SB-559 and AB 493), highlighting how the legislation would lower energy bills for all Wisconsinites, strengthen the grid, and return decision-making power to local communities.

Wisconsin families are struggling under some of the highest electricity costs in the Midwest and need affordable, locally generated energy options. The bill creates a community solar program that allows farmers and developers to build small-scale projects (typically 20–30 acres) that neighbors can subscribe to, expanding access to solar – the cheapest form of electricity – while avoiding larger developments that sometimes face local opposition. The legislation ensures that taxpayer dollars are not needed for projects; they are funded by private dollars.

Testifiers emphasized that the proposal restores local control by shifting siting authority from the Public Service Commission to municipalities and towns, ensuring decisions are made closest to the people affected. Farmers described how the bill would create a lifeline for many family farms, allowing them to lease small, unproductive portions of land to diversify income without sacrificing productive acreage. Contractors noted that their highly skilled workers are being forced to travel out of state for community solar jobs they’d much rather do here at home.

Today’s hearing showcased the breadth of the coalition behind this measure. Supporters include major employers, health systems, builders, farmers, and clean-energy advocates — including Walmart, Advocate Aurora Health, Arch Electric, Organic Valley, Wisconsin Farm Bureau, Kohler, RENEW Wisconsin, Associated Builders and Contractors, and farmers across the state.

Witnesses agreed: Community solar puts power back in the hands of Wisconsin communities and offers a practical, affordable solution to the state’s mounting energy challenges.

The bill’s sponsors, Sen. Pat Testin and Rep. Scott Krug, underscored growing frustration among constituents who want alternatives to large solar farms and skyrocketing utility bills.

Quote from Sen. Pat Testin

“Community solar gives people the freedom to choose affordable, locally generated power while putting decision-making back where it belongs: in our communities. This bill is about lowering bills, strengthening our grid, and making sure local voices are heard in the energy decisions that affect them every day.”

Quote from Rep. Scott Krug

“Community-scale projects give our communities a say in where projects are sited, keeping land use decisions close to home while opening the door to real savings for households and businesses. This legislation delivers a practical, Wisconsin-made approach to clean, affordable energy. Today’s testimony shows just how broad the support truly is.”

Quote from Ryan Jolma, Jolma Utilities:

“I’ll be honest I wasn’t so excited about coming all the way down here from Ashland today. I’m just here for our people – I know what it would mean for Northern Wisconsin if we had the opportunity to build community solar projects here at home for good wages instead of traveling 8-10 hours a week for work in Illinois.”

Quote from Duane Hinchley, Hinchley Dairy Farm (Cambridge, WI):

“As a second generation dairy farmer in Dane County, I like that the benefits of community solar stay local, giving my neighbors the chance to subscribe to a portion of the power and reduce their electricity costs.”

Quote from Craig Bain, Farmer (Arpin / Wood County):

“The steady income from this community solar lease is what will allow me to keep the rest of my land in agricultural production. It stabilizes my business and ensures that I can pass this land on to my family, rather than having to sell it off to a developer who might pave it over for good.”

Quote from Dave Klevesahl, Farmer (Door County):

“If I was not a landowner with an opportunity to start a community solar farm and I had this opportunity to help with getting community solar farms created in Wisconsin, I would still be eager to help make it happen, because it’s the right thing to do. We need to pass community for the little guy, for the family farm to supply another clean honorable product, and for the many Wisconsinites who are tired of never ending rate increases. Community solar is the only opportunity to save real people real money on the monthly utility bills.”

Quote from JD Smith, Arch Electric:

“Over 100 of Arch Electric’s Plymouth, WI based staff work exclusively on community solar but have to go to Illinois for work. Those good jobs should be available here at home.”

Beata Wierzba, RENEW Wisconsin:

“Community solar will make affordable solar power accessible to Wisconsin families who may not have their own financing, enough sun exposure, or own their property. These medium-sized projects benefit businesses and individuals, both as subscribers saving on their electric bill, and as hosts, allowing private investment in renewable energy.”

Quote from Karl Rábago, Rábago Energy, LLC:

“Utilities have said a lot of false, scary things about the costs of this program. To set the record straight, non-subscribers will not be asked to pay for benefits that only subscribers receive. New, local, in-state generation boosts reliability and affordability for all customers—reducing charges from inflated monopoly utility spending.”

Quote from Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty Research Director, Will Flanders: “Wisconsin is heading toward an energy shortfall, and the free market offers the best path to lower energy costs. Community solar, when implemented through a true free-market approach, can strengthen reliability, reduce costs, and open a competitive and innovative energy market in Wisconsin. Greater freedom and consumer choice are essential to meet the growing demands on our electric grid, and this is a great opportunity to move in that direction.”

Quote from Bonnie Beyer, Farmer:

Our farm has been passed down with care from one generation to the next and we’d like to preserve our farm’s legacy and not sell it off. We feel a deep connection to Wisconsin agricultural heritage and we’ve turned down offers over the years from real estate developers, but profitable alternatives are needed for retiring farmers like us. But this opportunity is on hold due to outdated laws preventing us from having this option. Wisconsin has always relied on the ingenuity of its farmers…why should we stop now?”

Quote from Brandon Smithwood, Dimension Energy:

“This legislation is an opportunity to lower Wisconsin families’ energy bills when they need it the most. It’s a win for ratepayers who will pay less, farmers who could use an additional income source, local businesses who are currently sending their workers out of state, and communities that don’t have a say over utility-scale energy projects.”",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:24.491151

The letter identifies generative AI and cryptocurrency as among the most significant environmental and social threats of this generation, citing their role in fueling an unregulated expansion of data centers across the country.

According to the letter, this unprecedented growth is driving a rapid increase in energy demand, accelerating fossil fuel depletion, polluting the environment, and overconsuming water resources. Electricity prices are soaring, and the expansion of AI infrastructure raises additional concerns about societal impacts, including job losses, economic monopolies, and broader instability.

The letter details the ""massive"" harms new AI data centers are inflicting on the US, highlighting their ""enormous"" energy consumption. Data center capacity is expected to triple over the next five years, with the new facilities consuming as much electricity as roughly 30 million households. Consequently, electricity bills have already increased by 21.3 percent from 2021 to 2024, outpacing inflation.

The rapid growth of AI data centers is also projected to strain water resources. New facilities may require as much water as 18.5 million households, primarily for cooling servers used to train large language models and generate AI outputs.

The letter states that data center plans fueling the AI and crypto ""frenzy"" are disrupting a growing number of communities across the US, threatening Americans' economy, environment, and water security. Representing the collective interests of millions of people across all 50 states, the document urges Congress to impose a federal moratorium on new data centers until ""adequate"" regulations are implemented.

Currently, Big Tech and AI companies are acting as if they operate in a lawless wasteland where scarce natural resources are up for grabs. The IT industry plans to spend a staggering $8 trillion to build new data-crunching server plants, while some proposals even suggest orbiting data centers in space – an environmentally questionable, sci-fi-esque idea.

According to Emily Wurth, managing director of Food & Water Watch, the organization behind the letter, there is now bipartisan support for significant pushback against new data centers.

""A lot of people don't see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water,"" Wurth said.",https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2025/12/2025-12-09-image-11.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:04:07.022144

In May, the coalition filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration’s decision to indefinitely halt all federal approvals necessary for the development of offshore and onshore wind energy projects pending federal review. Yesterday, a federal judge in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated and declared unlawful the Trump Administration’s actions, ruling that they were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.

""I am pleased to have defeated Donald Trump’s senseless attack on wind energy,” said Attorney General Ellison. “Minnesotans are counting on our state to keep energy costs as low as possible, help create good paying jobs, and combat climate change, and wind energy is helping us achieve all those goals. In fact, wind already supplies a quarter of all electricity in Minnesota. I will continue to do everything I can to stand up to the Trump Administration when it tramples on our rights or makes it harder for Minnesotans to afford their lives.”

Wind energy is particularly important to Minnesota, where it provides 1/4th of all electricity generated in Minnesota and 3/4ths of all renewable energy generated in the state. Increased wind energy will help achieve Minnesota’s emissions-reduction goals and provide a robust contribution to the state’s economy—including meaningful jobs for a highly-skilled workforce.

Minnesota law already requires all energy utilities to supply carbon-free electricity to Minnesotans by the year 2040. In 2023, Minnesota ranked eighth in the nation in wind capacity, and yesterday’s victory will help Minnesota build on those gains.

On January 20, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum that, among other things, indefinitely froze all federal approvals needed for the development of wind energy projects pending federal review. Pursuant to this directive, federal agencies stopped all permitting and approval activities.

In their lawsuit, the attorneys general alleged that the federal agencies’ actions harmed their states’ efforts to secure reliable, diversified, and affordable sources of energy to meet their increasing demand for electricity and help reduce emissions of harmful air pollutants, meet clean energy goals, and address climate change. The agencies’ actions also threatened to thwart billions of dollars of states’ investments in wind industry infrastructure, supply chains, and workforce development.

The coalition argued that federal agencies’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws because the agencies, among other things, provided no reasoned explanation for categorically and indefinitely halting all wind energy approvals. The lawsuit also argued that the abrupt halt on all permitting violated numerous federal statutes that prescribe specific procedures and timelines for federal permitting and approvals—procedures the Administration wholly disregarded in stopping wind-energy development altogether.

Attorney General Ellison was joined in this matter by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 11:03:28.724706

This shift represents an unprecedented energy transformation, with solar power at its core, creating a profound impact on the Gulf Coast region and setting a global example for economic diversification.

Solar Power Initiatives in the Gulf clean energy sector

The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is leading these efforts with new solar power projects and the integration of energy storage solutions. DEWA’s board of directors recently discussed plans to build a 6th and 7th phase at the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. This flagship project, which aims to reach 5,000 MW by 2030 with a total investment of Dh50 billion (USD 13.6 billion), will utilize advanced photovoltaic (PV) solar technology. The success of such large-scale installations depends on a solid understanding of the basics of solar panel manufacturing.

Additionally, DEWA is advancing its battery storage capabilities. The board reviewed the construction progress of a 200 MW/400 MWh capacity battery energy storage system (BESS) at the solar park. This BESS, being built by a consortium led by China’s BYD and Strabag Dubai, is expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2025. It will be crucial for stabilizing the grid and ensuring a consistent energy supply, especially after sunset.

Oman’s Battery Storage Ventures for Gulf clean energy

Oman is also making significant strides in clean energy by focusing on battery storage systems. These efforts are highlighted by the impressive growth in Oman solar energy and storage integration. The Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) has invited bids for the construction of two large battery storage projects with a combined capacity of 400 MW/800 MWh. These projects, planned for the Misfah and Liwa areas, are part of the country’s efforts to enhance grid stability and integrate more renewable energy sources. The tender for these projects was set to close in March 2024, with the plants expected to be operational by 2027.

Saudi Arabia’s Renewable Energy Ambitions in Gulf clean energy

Saudi Arabia is rapidly expanding its renewable energy sector. Beyond projects like the 150 MW solar plant and a 50 MW/100 MWh battery storage system in Tabuk, the Kingdom is spearheading massive cross-border initiatives. A landmark joint development agreement between ACWA Power and Bahrain’s Bapco Energies will see the development of a 2.8 GW solar power plant in Saudi Arabia. This project, integrated with large-scale battery storage, will transmit clean electricity to Bahrain, aiding its national renewable energy transition. Executing such a complex venture requires deep knowledge of the entire solar panel manufacturing process.

Kuwait’s First Solar Project for Gulf clean energy

Kuwait is joining the regional shift towards renewables, with plans for its first major solar power projects. As the nation embarks on a journey to launch a 1 GW solar energy project, even larger plans are taking shape. The Al Dibdibah solar plant is set to have a capacity of 2,000 MW and will include a 500 MWh battery storage system. This project, which will be built in two phases, is expected to be operational by 2027 and will play a key role in diversifying Kuwait’s energy mix. The integration of storage here is part of a wider trend of developing large-scale solar energy and battery storage projects to ensure grid reliability.

These projects collectively represent the Gulf region’s unwavering commitment to transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. By investing heavily in solar power and battery storage, countries like the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait are setting a powerful example for balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility. The success of this transition hinges on mastering the technology and economics, from the specific manufacturing machines used to produce panels to a detailed plant cost breakdown.

South 8 Technologies is a US startup company that has developed a liquefied gas (LiGas) electrolyte, which is designed to enhance battery performance by enabling ultra-low temperature operation, outperforming conventional liquid electrolytes, which struggle below -20° C.

The two companies’ cooperation is part of a larger aerospace initiative involving KULR Technology and NASA to develop batteries for deep space missions that can withstand the harshest environments.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013.
As part of the restart, Santee Cooper and its customers won’t put a single cent more into construction.
Davidson said this arrangement works differently than historical nuclear projects because it’s not just utilities and their customers putting their pocketbooks on the line.
“We’ve got to make sure that we build these power plants efficiently and at a reasonable price,” Davidson said.","A day after inking a $2.7 billion deal to lead South Carolina’s nuclear reboot, executives of a New York investment firm were in the Palmetto State to talk about what drew them to the multibillion-dollar undertaking.

Hundreds gathered Tuesday on the floor of Colonial Life Arena in Columbia to hear from South Carolina utility executives, legislators and leadership of Brookfield Asset Management — the winning bid holder selected to restart construction on two abandoned reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.

“It’s a bit of a no-brainer for us,” Mitch Davidson, a managing partner in Brookfield’s Renewable Power and Transition Group, told the crowd at the second annual nuclear summit.

In October, Brookfield, its subsidiary Westinghouse and Canada-based Cameco inked a partnership deal valued at $80 billion with the U.S. government. The companies will build 10 reactors identical to those at V.C. Summer.

South Carolina’s reactors could be the first and second on the list.

Three Mile Island restart project gets a $1 billion federal loan

“There are parts of this project that are already there, big parts that are there — equipment is there, foundations are there,” Davidson told the SC Daily Gazette. “So this seems to be the perfect opportunity for us as a start.”

The companies involved still have at least six months’ worth of engineering and financial feasibility studies to determine whether the project — a black mark on the state for nearly a decade — stands a chance of ever getting done.

“I’m not going to tell you that we’re able to do it faster. That’s all things that we have to determine,” Davidson said. “But you would think, because it’s already partially built, that you can do quicker, faster, cheaper.”

And according to the leaders of Santee Cooper, if it happens, it will be done differently this time.

“This is not going to be on the backs of rate payers. It’s not going to be on the backs of our taxpayers in the state,” said board chairman Peter McCoy, who’s led the utility since 2021.

He draws a distinction from the debacle he investigated as a House committee chairman, then prosecuted as U.S. attorney.

“This is private business stepping up, with help from the federal government,” McCoy said.

Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.

The utilities scrapped the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a megawatt.

As part of the restart, Santee Cooper and its customers won’t put a single cent more into construction. The utility will, however, retain a 25% ownership interest in the expansion should it be successful, allowing it to buy, at cost, a portion of power produced to sell to its customers.

Davidson said this arrangement works differently than historical nuclear projects because it’s not just utilities and their customers putting their pocketbooks on the line. There are more parties involved so the financial risk gets chopped into smaller pieces.

“I work with utility companies around the United States, and I would tell you that all of them are very focused on this project,” said John Cogan of Centerview Partners, financial advisors to state-owned utility Santee Cooper amid the sale effort. “They see Jenkinsville as the rebirth of the nuclear renaissance in the United States.”

And the driver behind this “renaissance,” according to the panelists, is the massive demand for electricity coming from major industrial users — namely, data centers.

“We haven’t seen load growth, like true load growth, in this country for a decade,” Davidson said. “The data centers have been the driver behind all of this. The data centers, and the size that they’re getting to today, are the genesis.”

That’s why tech giants, such as Microsoft, have taken an interest and been willing to act as financial partners in the restart of retired nuclear reactors in places such as Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island.

“We’ve got to make sure that we build these power plants efficiently and at a reasonable price,” Davidson said.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement.","After letting funding lapse for nearly two years, Congress voted to renew crucial federal funding that rural counties and schools have counted on for a quarter century.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday evening voted 399-5 to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act through September 2026, and to provide lapsed payments for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The vote came after a year-long campaign led by bipartisan federal lawmakers from the West.

The U.S. Senate in June unanimously voted to reauthorize the act. It now goes to the president to be signed into law.

“The Secure Rural Schools program has been a lifeline for rural communities across Oregon since I originally authored the program back in 2000,” Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in a statement. “I’m relieved the House has finally done its job with the long-overdue passage of my bill to return the safety net for critical services to communities that need it the most.”

Wyden co-authored the original law that provided tens of millions each year for rural schools and communities that previously benefited from revenue generated by natural resource industries on public lands. Since then, it has provided $7 billion in payments to more than 700 counties and 4,400 school districts across 40 states and Puerto Rico that have large swaths of federal land within their borders.

Oregon, where more than half of the state consists of federal land, has experienced the biggest loss of any state since the funding lapsed in 2023: nearly $48.7 million in money for rural roads, public services and schools, according to a September report from the D.C.-based Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy and think tank. Idaho has missed out on $21.3 million, Alaska more than $12.6 million and Washington more than $14.7 million.

Overall, states have lost out on more than $207 million in the two years since the act expired, the Center for American Progress found.

Twice since December 2024, the Senate has voted to renew the act in an effort led by Wyden and Idaho’s senior U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican.

But each time the Senate approved it, the House failed to take a vote. The bill lapsed in 2023 and counties haven’t gotten payments since early 2024. House Republicans most recently failed to reauthorize the act in the tax and spending cut megalaw they passed in July.

With just weeks before the House is due to wrap its work for the year, Wyden, Crapo and 83 bipartisan lawmakers from the Senate and the House sent a letter to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, urging them to take a vote on the act before they recessed.

Just 12 hours after receiving the letter, the House announced it would fast-track consideration and a vote on the bill.

Washington’s U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat representing southwest Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, led the passage of the bill in the House.

“The Secure Rural Schools program is absolutely critical, and the passage of this legislation is beyond overdue,” she said in a statement. “Candidly, the only reason it took this long is because way too many folks in D.C. have been blissfully ignorant about how disastrous the lapse of SRS has been for timber communities in Southwest Washington and across the West. Schools have closed up, teachers have been laid off, and our kids have been left footing the bill for Congress’s neglect.”

Since the funding lapsed, schools in Skamania County in her district have laid off staff and a middle school was forced to close.

In Alaska, the failure to reauthorize the program caused rural school districts to cut their budgets, particularly in southeast Alaska, home to the vast Tongass National Forest.

Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voted for the bill on Friday, and both of the state’s senators — Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — supported it as well.

Oh the irony, it burns. US President Donald Trump is bending over backwards to make solar power less accessible here on Earth, but clever entrepreneurs are simply going behind his back to harvest it from outer space. The latest example is the California-based startup Aetherflux, which has zeroed in on the ability of space solar systems to skip the long wait times for a conventional, terrestrial power hookup.

Look, Up In The Sky … It’s Galactic Brain!

Harvesting solar power for space operations is as old as the Vanguard 1 satellite, launched by the US in 1959. Solar panels in space are now as common as lambs in springtime. However, in recent years, the space solar industry has begun to branch out in new directions. Startups like Aetherflux have been racing to see who can be first to harvest solar power in space and beam it down to Earth on a 24/7 basis, regardless of the weather.

That sounds like the stuff of science fiction — and at one time, it was — but the technology pieces are in place to transfer solar power from arrays in space to Earth wirelessly, and investors are smelling money in the water. Aetherflux’s space-to-Earth solar beaming plan first crossed the CleanTechnica radar in 2024 as a self-funded project of Robin Hood co-founder Baiju Bhatt, who founded Aetherflux and serves as CEO. Earlier this year, additional investors piled onto Aeitherflux to the tune of $50 million, enabling Bhatt to lay plans for launching his first orbiting solar power plant in 2026.

In addition, the AI boom has fostered the idea of launching solar-powered data centers into space and beaming the data down to Earth. Aetherflux has that angle covered as well. On December 9, the company announced plans to launch its first commercial, solar-powered orbiting data center in Q1 of 2027. If all goes according to plan, the system will scale up by adding nodes to create a constellation.

“The project, dubbed ‘Galactic Brain,’ offers a bypass to the current five-to-eight year time horizon for data centers to be built on Earth,” Aetherflux explained, while observing that “securing real estate, establishing utility connections and constructing new data centers can take more than half a decade.”

Bhatt also chipped in his two cents in a press statement. “The race for artificial general intelligence is fundamentally a race for compute capacity, and by extension, energy,” he said. “The elephant in the room is that our current energy plans simply won’t get us there fast enough.”

“Galactic Brain puts the sunlight next to the silicon and skips the power grid entirely,” Bhatt emphasized.

Space Solar Wins The War Against Solar Power

If that sounds like Bhatt is blowing a big, fat, solar powered raspberry at Trump, well, maybe. In July, Trump directed the US Department of the Interior to stop issuing permits for solar projects on federal lands. Solar projects on land under state, local, and private ownership are also in jeopardy if they require any type of federal permit.

The situation is so desperate that 143 US solar companies banded together to plead for a policy change. “Federal agencies are implementing this directive in a way that amounts to a nearly complete moratorium on permitting for any project in which the Department of Interior may play a role, on both federal and private land, no matter how minor,” they wrote in a letter dated December 4, addressed to all members of the US Senate and House of Representatives.

“Businesses need certainty in order to continue making investments in the United States to build out much-needed energy projects,” they emphasized. “Certainty must include a review process that does not discriminate by energy source.”

Is anybody here old enough to remember that Republican members of Congress and their allies in the conserve-o-sphere roundly criticized Democrats for “picking energy winners and losers” with policies that promoted domestic wind and solar power? How the worm has turned! Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” does just that. It excludes wind and solar — and only wind and solar, among all other domestic energy resources — from federal support.

Solar Power Is Just Better, That’s All

For the record, Trump’s energy policy does support other renewables, namely biomass, geothermal, and hydropower. Even the yet-to-emerge field of marine energy somehow made the cut. However, all of these domestic energy resources face formidable obstacles to scale-up, particularly so in the near term.

In contrast, the killer combo of solar and energy storage has already scaled. Together, solar and storage are widely acknowledged as the fastest and most economical way to add more utility-sized power plants to the US.

The Solar Energy Industries Association has the numbers to prove it. On December 9, the organization issued its latest report under the title “U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2025,” which leads off with the observation that the US solar power profile grew another 11.7 gigawatts in new capacity in Q3, making it the third-largest quarter on record for solar activity regardless of the ill winds blowing out of the White House.

“Despite actions in Washington targeting clean energy, solar and storage account for 85% of all new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump Administration,” SEIA added with a twist of the knife.

Twisting the knife further, the SEIA report shows that the vast majority — 73% — of solar capacity installed so far in 2025 landed squarely in states carried by President Trump on Election Day 2024. In particular, SEIA name-checks Texas, Indiana, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Utah, Kentucky, and Arkansas along with Utah.

Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper had plenty to say.

“Remarkable growth in Texas, Indiana, Utah, and other states won by President Trump shows just how decisively the market is moving toward solar,” Hopper said in a press statement. “But unless this administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable, and reliable solar and storage will be frozen by uncertainty and Americans will continue to see their energy bills go up.”

That’s not to say that all solar activity in the US will grind to a halt. The new SEIA report was prepared in collaboration with the firm Wood Mackenzie, which anticipates that 250 gigawatts in solar capacity will be added to the nation’s grid by 2030, Trump or no Trump. However, that figure reflects the impact of today’s partisan politics. “The solar industry would be well positioned to meet more of this new demand if existing constraints were alleviated, presenting upside to our forecast,” explained the head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report, Michelle Davis.

WG: The role of different local officials in promoting low-carbon policy is not very well understood.
That helps us to understand why climate policy can become durable in some places and not others.
CB: Could you give an example of what drives innovative local climate policies?
If climate policy is not prioritised, or written into their job responsibilities, that can be a challenge for sustaining implementation.","Local officials are often viewed as relatively weak actors in China’s governance structure, largely implementing policies issued from the central level.

However, a new book – “Implementing a low-carbon future: climate leadership in Chinese cities” – argues that these officials play an important role in designing innovative and enduring climate policy.

The book follows how four cities – Shenzhen, Zhenjiang, Xiamen and Nanchang – approached developing low-carbon policies over the course of almost a decade.

It identifies “bridge leaders” – mid-level local bureaucrats who have a strong interest in a specific policy area and who are unlikely to move often between different posts – as key to effective local climate policymaking.

Carbon Brief interviews author Weila Gong, non-resident scholar at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy’s 21st Century China Center and visiting scholar at UC Davis, on her research.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Gong on why cities are important: “Over 85% of China’s carbon emissions come from cities. The majority of Chinese people live in cities, so the extent to which cities can become truly low-carbon will also influence China’s climate success.”

On what motivates local policymakers: “Mid-level bureaucrats need to think about how to create unique, innovative and visible policy actions to help draw attention to their region and their bosses.”

On cities as a way to test new policies: “Part of the function of local governments in China is to experiment with policy at a local level, thereby helping national-level officials develop responses to emerging policy challenges.”

On how local policymakers get results: “Even though we tend to think that local officials are very constrained in terms of policy or financial resources, they can often have the leverage and space to build coalitions.”

On uneven city-level engagement: “To begin with, all regions received political support if they joined the [low-carbon city] pilot programme. But over the years, different regions have engaged very differently.”

On the need for ‘entrepreneurial bureaucrats’: “China will always need local officials willing to introduce new legislations or try new policy instruments…For that, it needs entrepreneurial bureaucrats who are willing to turn ideas into actions.”

On international cooperation: “Even with how geopolitics is really complicating things, many cities continue to have common challenges. For example, collaboration between Shanghai and Los Angeles on green shipping corridors is still ongoing”.

On the effectiveness of mid-level bureaucrats: “They are creative, they know how to convince their boss about the importance of climate action and they know how that can bring opportunities for themselves and their boss. And because of how long they have worked in one area, they understand the local politics, policy processes and the coalitions needed to provide solutions.”

Carbon Brief: You’ve just written a book about climate policy in Chinese cities. Could you explain why subnational governments are important for China’s climate policy in general?

Weila Gong: China is the world’s largest carbon emitter, so the extent to which global efforts to address climate change can actually reach their goal is largely influenced by China’s efforts.

If you look at the structure of China’s carbon emissions, over 85% of China’s carbon emissions come from cities. The majority of Chinese people live in cities, so the extent to which cities can become truly low-carbon will also influence China’s climate success. That’s why I started to look at this research area.

We tend to think of China as a centralised, big system and a unitary state – state-run and top-down – but it actually also has multi-level governance. No climate action or national climate targets can be achieved without local engagement.

We also tend to think subnational level [actors], including the provincial, city and township levels, are barriers for environmental protection, because they are focused on promoting economic growth.

But I observed these actors participating in China’s low-carbon city pilot programme [as part of my fieldwork spanning most of the 2010s]. I was really surprised to see so many cities wanted to participate in the pilot, even though at the time there was no specific evaluation system that would reward their efforts.

We think of local governments just as implementers of central-level policy. When it comes to issues like climate change and also low-carbon development – in 2010 [policymakers found these concepts] very vague…So I was curious why those local officials would want to take on this issue, given that there was no immediate reward, either in terms of career development or in terms of increasing financial support from the central government.

CB: Could you help us understand the mindset of these bureaucrats? How do local-level officials design policies in China?

WG: The role of different local officials in promoting low-carbon policy is not very well understood. We tend to focus on top political figures, such as mayors or [municipal] party secretaries, because we see them as the most important policymakers.

But that is not entirely true. Those top local politicians are very important in supporting efforts to tackle problem areas…but the focus in my book is the mid-level bureaucrats.

Unlike mayors and party secretaries, mid-level officials tend to stay in one locality for their entire career. That helps us to understand why climate policy can become durable in some places and not others.

Mayors and party secretaries are important for [pushing through policy solutions to problem] issues, but they can also be key barriers for ensuring continuation of those policies – particularly when they change positions…as they tend to move to another locality every three to five years.

Therefore, these top-level officials are not the ones implementing low-carbon policies. That’s why I looked at the mid-level bureaucrats instead.

The conventional understanding of these bureaucrats is that they are obedient and only follow their bosses’ guidance. But actually, when low-carbon policies emerged as an important area for the central government in 2010, opportunities appeared for local governments to develop pilot projects.

Mid-level local officials saw this as a way to help their bosses – the mayors and party secretaries – increase their chances of getting promoted, which in turn would help the mid-level bureaucrats to advance their own career.

Impressing central government officials isn’t really a consideration for these officials…but their bosses need visible or more reliable local actions to show their ability to enforce low-carbon development.

As such, mid-level bureaucrats need to think about how to create unique, innovative and visible policy actions to help draw attention to their region and their bosses.

Secondly, mid-level bureaucrats are more interested in climate issues if it is in the interest of their agency or local government.

For example, Zhenjiang [a city in east China] came to be known as a leader in promoting low-carbon development due to a series of early institutional efforts to establish low-carbon development. In particular, in part because of this, it was chosen for a visit by president Xi Jinping in 2014.

As a result, the city created a specialised agency [on low-carbon development]. This made it one of the first regions to have full-time local officials that followed through on low-carbon policy implementation.

This increased their ability to declare their regulatory authority on low-carbon issues, by being able to promote new regulations, standards and so on, as well as enhancing the region’s and the local policymakers’ reputations by building institutions to ensure long-term enforcement.

Another motivation for many local governments is accessing finance through the pilot programmes. If their ideas impress the central-level government, local policymakers could get access to investment or other forms of financial resources from higher levels of government.

In the city of Nanchang, for example, officials were trying to negotiate access to external investment, because the main central government fund for low-carbon initiatives only provided minimal finance.

Nanchang officials tried to partner with the Austrian government on sustainable agriculture, working through China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).

It didn’t materialise in the end, but they still created a platform to attract international investment, and gathered tens of millions of yuan [millions of dollars] in central-level support because the fact they showed they were innovating allowed them to access more money through China’s institutional channels.

CB: Could you give an example of what drives innovative local climate policies?

WG: National-level policies and pilot programme schemes provide openings for local governments to really think about how and whether they should engage more in addressing climate change.

The national government has participated in international negotiations on climate for decades…but subnational-level cities and provinces only joined national efforts to address climate issues from the 2010s – starting with the low-carbon city programme.

So we can see that local responses to addressing climate change have been shaped by the opportunities provided by the national government, [who in turn] want more local-level participation to give them successful case studies to take to international conferences.

Local carbon emission trading systems (ETSs) are an example of giving local governments opportunities to experiment.

In my book, I look at the case of Shenzhen, which launched China’s first local ETS. [Shenzhen was one of seven regions selected to run a pilot ETS, ahead of the national ETS being established in 2018.]

Part of the function of local governments in China is to experiment with policy at a local level, thereby helping national-level officials develop responses to emerging policy challenges.

I remember a moment during my field research in 2012, when I was with a group of officials from both the national and local government.

The national government officials asked the local officials to come up with some best practices and solutions, to help them envision what could be done at the national level.

Then there are drivers at the international level, which I think is very interesting.

I observed that the officials particularly willing to take on climate issues usually had access to international training.

During the early stages of subnational climate engagement, organisations such as the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) worked with the NDRC and other national-level agencies to train local officials across the country.

This created more opportunities to help local officials understand what climate change and carbon markets were, and how to use policy instruments to support low-carbon development.

In Shenzhen, local bureaucrats also turned to their international partners to help them design policy.

The city created a study group to visit partners working on the EU ETS and learn how it was designed. They learned about price volatility in the EU ETS and pushed legislation through the local people’s congress [to mitigate this in their own system].

One thing that made the Shenzhen ETS so successful is what I call “entrepreneurial bureaucrats” [who have the ability to design, push through and maintain new local-level climate policies].

Shenzhen’s vice mayor worked with the local people’s congress to push the ETS legislation through. This was the first piece of legislation in China to require compulsory participation by more than 600 local industrial actors. It also granted the local government authority to decide the quotas and scope of the ETS.

These 600 entities also included Shenzhen’s public building sector[, a powerful local interest group].

This shows that, even though we tend to think that local officials are very constrained in terms of policy or financial resources, they can often have the leverage and space to build coalitions – even in China’s more centralised political system – and know how to mobilise political support.

CB: You chose to look at the effectiveness of four cities – Shenzhen, Zhenjiang, Xiamen and Nanchang – in climate policymaking. Why did you choose these cities and how representative are they of the rest of China?

WG: We tend to believe that only economically-advanced areas or environmentally-friendly cities will become champions for low-carbon development…But I was surprised, because Zhenjiang and Nanchang are not known for having an advanced economy, but [they nevertheless built impactful climate] institutions – regulations, standards and legislation that shape individual and organisational behaviours in the long term. I thought they were interesting examples of how local regions can really create those institutions.

Then there was Xiamen, which is seen as an environmentally-friendly city and economically is comparable to Shenzhen when you look at GDP per capita. Xiamen actually did not turn its low-carbon policy experimentation into long-term institutions, instead randomly proposing new initiatives [that were not sustained].

I conducted more than 100 interviews, talking with policy-practitioners inside and outside of government about specific policies, their processes and implementation.

I found that, over the course of eight years, these [cities] showed very different levels of engagement.

Some I categorised into substantive engagement, where the local government delivered on their climate goals. [Shenzhen falls into this category.]

Then there is performative engagement – such as in the case of Nanchang – where the local government was more interested in [using climate policies to] attract external investment and access projects from higher levels of government.

But they were not able to enforce the policies, because impressing higher levels of government became the primary motivation.

Zhenjiang was a case of symbolic engagement. It actually created a lot of institutions, such as a specialised agency and a screening system to ensure new [low-carbon] investment. When I was observing Zhenjiang, from 2012 to 2018, officials recognised they needed to be carbon-constrained.

The problem was that Zhenjiang has a very strong power sector – mainly coal power – which supplies the whole eastern coast. That meant, even though the government was very determined to promote low-carbon policies, they faced [opposition from] very strong local actors – meaning the government could only partially implement the targets they set.

Then there is sporadic engagement, as seen in Xiamen. [The city’s approach to climate policy was incremental and cautious] because of a lack of political support [from officials in Xiamen], as well as local coalitions between key actors. So instead, we find random initiatives being promoted.

This explains the uneven policy implementation in China. To begin with, all regions received political support if they joined the pilot programme. But over the years, different regions have engaged very differently, in terms of the regulations, standards and legislation they have introduced, and whether those were paired with enforcement by a group of trained personnel to follow through on those initiatives.

CB: What needs to be done to strengthen sub-national climate policy making?

WG: It’s very important to have groups of personnel trained on climate policy. Since 2010, when I started studying the low-carbon pilot programme, there were no provincial-level people or agencies fully responsible for climate change. Back then, there was only the [central-level] department of climate change under the NDRC.

By the time I finished the book, provincial-level departments of climate change had been created across all provinces. But almost nothing has been established at the city level, so most city-level climate initiatives are being managed under the agencies responsible for air quality.

That means climate change is only one of those local officials’ day-to-day responsibilities. Only a handful of cities have dedicated staff working on climate issues: Beijing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Shenzhen and Guiyang.

Nanchang devised some of China’s first legislation to include an annual [financial] budget for low-carbon development. But when I revisited the city, officials were not actually sure about how and whether that budget was being used, because there wasn’t a person responsible for it.

Therefore, even if there are resources available, they can go unused because local officials at the city level are so busy. If climate policy is not prioritised, or written into their job responsibilities, that can be a challenge for sustaining implementation.

In China’s governance structure, the national government comes up with ideas, and the provincial level transfers these ideas down to local-level governments. City-level governments are the ones implementing these ideas.

So we need full-time staff to follow through on policies from the beginning right up to implementation.

Secondly, while almost all cities have now made carbon-peaking plans, one area in which the Chinese government can make further progress is in data.

China has recently emphasised the need to strengthen carbon-emissions data collection and monitoring. But when I was conducting my research, most Chinese cities had not yet established regular carbon-accounting systems.

As such, inadequate energy statistics and insufficient detail remain key barriers to effective climate-policy implementation.

In addition, the relevant data usually is owned by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which does not always share it with other agencies. Local agencies can’t always access detailed data.

When I visited Xiamen, officials told me the local government is now improving emissions monitoring systems. But there should be more systematic and rigorous data collection, covering both carbon emissions and non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Also, much of the company-level data is self-reported, which could affect the accuracy of carbon-emissions statistics.

For continued climate action, it’s also important that the central government ensures that local officials have the institutional support needed to experiment and propose new ideas.

…China will always need local officials willing to introduce new legislations or try new policy instruments – like Shenzhen with its ETS, or establishing new carbon-monitoring platforms.

For that, it needs entrepreneurial bureaucrats who are willing to turn ideas into actions. Ensuring that local governments have the right set of conditions to do this is very important.

CB: What did you find most surprising when researching this book?

WG: That international collaboration is still very important. I found that many officials learnt about climate change through international engagement.

In the current situation, I think international engagement is still very important – particularly given how, even with how geopolitics is really complicating things, many cities continue to have common challenges. For example, collaboration between Shanghai and Los Angeles on green shipping corridors is still ongoing.

That can bring opportunities for continuing climate action at the city level in the face of rising international tensions, as long as national governments give them space to be involved in international climate action.

Another surprise was the factors of what exactly made climate action durable. I was really surprised that many of the cities that I revisited were still involved in the pilot programmes, despite the central government restructuring that shifted the climate change portfolio from the NDRC to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment – which created challenges for the local governments who had to navigate this.

I also thought that the change in mayors for all four cities would lead to climate initiatives falling off the agenda.

But actually, Zhenjiang, Xiamen and Nanchang all maintained their low-carbon initiatives, despite these changes. This showed it isn’t only strong mayors that bring success, but rather a group of trained personnel building and enforcing regulations and standards. So the importance of bureaucrats and bureaucracy in making climate action durable was actually way beyond my initial expectations.

I was also surprised that bureaucrats can be entrepreneurial, even though they work in a centralised system. They are creative, they know how to convince their boss about the importance of climate action and they know how that can bring opportunities for themselves and their boss. And because of how long they have worked in one area, they understand the local politics, policy processes and the coalitions needed to provide solutions.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2X94R1P.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 01:57:27.368099

It alone is projected to use 2.2 gigawatts of power — almost 10% of Indiana’s entire current electricity demand.
Meanwhile, communities that approved these projects would be left with empty shells of data centers designed for a single purpose and unusable for anything else.
Adopted in 2019, it was crafted for modest data centers, not today’s behemoths.
If data centers run full-tilt during those peak moments, they could trigger billions in new spending on generation and transmission.","This past June and July, my family’s electricity bill jumped by more than 30% compared to last year. I know we’re not alone. Hoosiers everywhere are seeing higher electric bills — and unless we change course, they’ll keep climbing. Cost pressures are pushing from multiple places.

For decades, Indiana saw little growth in electricity demand, and investment in utilities stagnated. The result is a grid that hasn’t kept pace with our needs. Meanwhile, severe storms are hitting more often, and hotter summers mean higher demand for cooling. Utilities will need to spend more just to maintain reliability, let alone improve it.

On top of that, new gas pipeline proposals and rapid price inflation for natural gas turbines, the machines that turn gas into electricity, are raising costs. For example, GridLab reports that the price of a new combined-cycle gas turbine has nearly doubled to $2,000 per kilowatt. That expense will land on someone’s bill.

But the biggest pressure of all comes from the explosive growth of artificial intelligence and the data centers needed to run it. By 2035, AI-driven data centers are expected to add the electricity demand equivalent or greater than building a second Indianapolis, a second Fort Wayne, a second Gary, and a second Evansville combined.

Take the planned data center campus in New Carlisle for example. It alone is projected to use 2.2 gigawatts of power — almost 10% of Indiana’s entire current electricity demand.

Lawmakers and economic-development officials see data centers as a fast track to economic growth. But in this race to attract them, we’re ignoring an essential truth: in every race, there are winners and losers.

Even Wall Street is voicing concern as many analysts are warning of a looming data center bubble. According to The Center for Public Enterprise’s Bubble or Nothing report, some major developers are building data centers using circular financing — borrowing from one another while depending on one another’s cash flows — and betting that AI profits will justify these risky financial relationships. But as we learned when the dot-com bubble, even transformational technologies aren’t always profitable and can collapse under unsustainable economics.

So let’s imagine what would happen if AI profits don’t materialize as hoped, data center companies will falter, and operators shut down. The massive, custom-built electric and water infrastructure serving them, paid for in part by ratepayers, becomes underused or abandoned. Those costs don’t disappear; they shift to households and businesses.

And the power plants built to serve these centers, especially large gas plants, could become stranded assets, leaving Hoosiers to pay for billions in infrastructure that no longer has customers. Meanwhile, communities that approved these projects would be left with empty shells of data centers designed for a single purpose and unusable for anything else.

Where to go from here

While this picture is bleak, it is also avoidable. Indiana has the opportunity to benefit from economic growth related to AI, strengthen our grid, and improve our utility cost structure. How?

First, Indiana should repeal the data-center sales-tax exemption. Adopted in 2019, it was crafted for modest data centers, not today’s behemoths. Right now, the state forgoes about $5 million each year in electricity sales tax for just one 100-megawatt facility. Scale that to 5 gigawatts of projected data-center growth, and Indiana could lose $250 million annually in revenue. Restoring this tax would cool speculative development and provide a stable new funding stream for our state.

Second, we must require large data centers to operate flexibly. Our grid is built around meeting peak demand — the most extreme hours of usage each year. If data centers run full-tilt during those peak moments, they could trigger billions in new spending on generation and transmission. But if they reduce demand during key hours, Indiana can avoid new peaks altogether.

And flexibility isn’t only for giant companies. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission is writing new rules for distributed energy resources — everything from smart thermostats to batteries to EV chargers. These resources can shift demand, cut bills, and relieve stress on the grid. When deployed at scale, they help integrate more affordable clean energy, reduce costs for everyone, and reduce harmful environmental impacts that come with new fossil fuel generation.

Third, data-center developers must be transparent with the communities they hope to join. Local governments should require enforceable commitments before granting zoning approvals. That includes long-term power-purchase commitments that shield other ratepayers from unforeseen challenges; developer-funded infrastructure upgrades; cleaner backup-power options rather than fleets of diesel generators; and strong protections for local water resources, including avoiding groundwater withdrawals for cooling.

These expectations are reasonable, practical, and essential to safeguarding communities.

Hoosiers deserve honest conversations about the risks and rewards of data-center expansion. Utilities, local officials, and state leaders must fully understand what’s at stake — not just for economic development, but for affordability, reliability, and environmental stewardship.

Electricity prices are rising from every direction. If Indiana rushes headlong into unchecked data-center development, we risk burdening families and businesses with higher bills, strained infrastructure, and stranded assets. The tech giants sprinting to build these facilities understand that not everyone will win this race.

Indiana shouldn’t sprint blindly alongside them. Instead, we must chart our own course — one that protects ratepayers, strengthens our grid, and safeguards our natural resources.

Hoosiers value responsibility, fairness, and foresight. Now is the time to apply those values to the energy decisions that will shape Indiana for generations.

Both renewable technologies have already become deeply ingrained in the Texas electricity system.","Pump jacks nod and the smell of gas wafts across the low brush and cactuses in the oil fields outside Christine, Texas. Little about the landscape suggests that a new form of alternative energy has been gaining its first commercial foothold in Texas.

But down a dirt road, near a coal-fired power plant, sits a unique kind of industrial battery, one that uses water pressure and the techniques of hydraulic fracturing to store energy deep underground and then release it to generate electricity when the time is right.

The energy storage system — known as a geopressured geothermal well — is among the most concrete examples of how some Texas oil and gas workers and executives are applying their knowledge of the underground to geothermal energy.

50 States, 50 Fixes is a series about local solutions to environmental problems.

“We don’t have to wait to build skill sets,” said Cindy Taff, a former executive at Shell who now runs Sage Geosystems, the company behind the energy storage project. Teams that drill for oil, she said, can just as easily drill a geothermal well.

That overlap has helped make Texas a hub of innovation in the expanding world of what’s considered next-generation geothermal power. Some of the most prominent start-ups, including Sage and Fervo Energy, are based in Houston, not far from the campuses and office towers of major oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Exxon Mobil.

“In Texas, we know what the world looks like under the surface,” said Barry Smitherman, a former chairman of the state’s oil and gas regulator and now the head of Texas Geothermal Energy Alliance, which promotes the industry.

The industry has also maintained support at the federal level, even as the Trump administration has pulled back from other forms of renewable energy, like solar and wind power. An executive order signed by President Trump as he took office included geothermal among the energy resources — along with natural gas and coal — to be promoted in response to what Mr. Trump said was the nation’s “energy emergency.”

The energy secretary, Chris Wright, later spoke at an event hosted by Project InnerSpace, which promotes the geothermal industry, that included red hats emblazoned with the letters MAGMA — suggesting a symbiosis between the president’s political movement and the molten rock inside the Earth that makes geothermal energy possible.

“We can mine simply massive amounts of heat from underground,” Mr. Wright said in his remarks.

Legislators in Texas have also been working on laws to encourage geothermal exploration and production.

“It’s kind of like an awakening,” State Representative Drew Darby, a Republican, said in an interview, describing the reaction in Texas to the idea of using drilling techniques to tap into the Earth’s heat.

Still, even though some of the biggest start-ups are headquartered in Texas, the largest initial geothermal projects have been in states like Utah where underground heat is more easily accessible.

Texas has enormous potential for geothermal energy, experts said, because the level of heat rises relatively quickly underground. But accessing it is still expensive.

Mr. Darby, who represents parts of the oil-rich Permian Basin, said he hoped costs would drop as Texas start-ups help prove that the technology can succeed commercially. He said he would like to see geothermal energy added to a Texas program that supports the construction of natural gas and nuclear plants.

Demand for energy has been surging in Texas, where companies like Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft are building huge data centers. The state has projected that its energy demand could roughly double by the end of the decade.

“This is the existential moment for geothermal,” said Jamie Beard, the executive director of Project InnerSpace. “It either competes and wins now, or it stays irrelevant.”

This year, Texas approved its first geothermal well, drilled for the Sage project outside Christine.

On a recent visit, the geopressured geothermal battery — made up of a wellhead similar to those at oil and gas locations, some long pipes, a small turbine and huge pool of water — sat dormant, waiting to be connected to the electric grid. A fence surrounded its perimeter to keep animals out. “This place has alligators,” said Shannon Bolton, Sage’s project manager.

The 9,600-foot-deep well for the battery system, which can discharge about three megawatts of electricity, was drilled using an oil-and-gas rig and a crew of local workers who had little trouble applying their expertise to what would have been considered, in another era, just a dry hole.

The well is the same type that Mr. Bolton oversaw when he worked at Shell as an oil drilling foreman. “You just have a different target down hole,” he said.

It works by capturing excess electricity from the grid and using it to pump water deep into cracks in the rock that were created with techniques similar to those in traditional gas fracking. The system then holds the water under pressure. When electricity is needed on the grid, a valve releases the water through a turbine, turning the water pressure back into electricity.

The storage system differs from most geothermal power, which uses water heated by rocks deep underground and can run constantly.

Instead, the idea is to create a kind of battery that can discharge electricity over four to six hours — a longer period of time than lithium-ion batteries, which usually discharge for two to four hours. That way, the energy generated from solar power, for example, can be stored and used during long stretches when the sun isn’t shining. (Sage Geosystems is also developing traditional geothermal power generation and has pilot projects in Texas.)

The project is part of an effort by the local power provider, San Miguel Electricity Cooperative, to replace the electricity generated by an aging coal-fired plant with electricity provided by solar power and battery storage.

In January, Constellation announced plans to acquire Calpine in a cash and stock transaction valued at an equity purchase price of approximately $16.4 billion. The deal became one of the largest in the history of power generation at a time when demand for electricity has exploded. Constellation already owns and operates the largest fleet of nuclear plants in the United States. Constellation is also the largest producer of clean energy in the U.S. The company generates more than 32,400 megawatts of capacity, including through nuclear, gas, wind, solar and hydropower assets.

The strategic deal centres on Ford developing new electric passenger vehicles based on Renault’s dedicated Ampere platform and tapping into its state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. This manufacturing agreement allows Renault to maximise its EV production capacity and advance its core Ampere strategy. Furthermore, the partners have signed a Letter of Intent to explore the joint development and manufacture of selected light commercial vehicles (LCVs) for both brands, with the primary aim of achieving competitive industrial scale and cost efficiency in a capital-intensive region.

The carmaker's latest strategic shift, announced in Cologne, sketches an industrial and political wager. The aim is to fashion a leaner, more agile European operation capable of turning a profit while consumers inch hesitantly toward electrification. For Ford, which has in recent years restructured factories, trimmed portfolios and navigated volatile EV demand, Europe remains both an opportunity and a warning as it tests the technological mettle of global carmakers.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” said Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford Motor Company. “How we compete here - how we innovate, partner, and invest - will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

The new plan reasserts three organising principles. First, to strengthen Ford Pro’s commercial dominance. Second, to rebuild passenger car desirability with distinctive, multi-energy products arriving from 2028. And third, to recalibrate Ford’s manufacturing base to secure scale, cost efficiency and flexibility in a region where margins remain elusive.

Ford’s evolving agenda for Europe

Ford’s next phase centres on a product offensive timed for the late 2020s. A new family of multi-energy passenger and commercial vehicles, positioned as affordable rather than aspirational, is intended to offer customers gradual electrification rather than ideological purity. These additions will join the existing portfolio in 2028 and are pitched as a counterweight to both low-cost Asian challengers and European rivals accelerating their EV ramp.

The company describes this portfolio as a pathway to “sustainably profitable” operations, a phrase that signals Ford’s intent to avoid the margin erosion currently afflicting parts of the EV market. Europe’s regulatory direction of travel may be clear, but demand patterns are not. Electric vehicles account for 16.1 per cent of new sales across the region, well below the level required to satisfy upcoming CO2 thresholds.

Inside Ford’s brownfield automation strategy: Scalable robotics, in-house AI, and workforce-first deployment

At AMNA 2025, Ford revealed how it’s modernising legacy plants through modular automation, low-code AI inspection tools and scaling automation without massive CapEx.

Detailing the Strategic Partnership

The collaboration with Renault Group involves the co-development of two Ford-badged electric passenger vehicles on Renault’s Ampere platform, due in 2028. Critically, Ford will lead styling and driving dynamics to maintain its distinct identity and brand assertion, even while leveraging Renault's core technology and production assets.

Ford frames the collaboration as a necessary but controlled step in an increasingly capital-hungry industry. “Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” said Jim Baumbick, president, Ford Europe. “We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product. These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.”

This arrangement is strategically significant for both parties. For Ford, it represents an expansion of its model to offer new electric vehicles at lower capital investment, following a similar agreement that utilises Volkswagen’s MEB platform. For Renault, the deal is an important alliance separate from Nissan, whose traditional partnership has recently faced challenges. The new collaboration with Ford, alongside a separate partnership with Geely, underscores Renault’s shift toward building a robust, new network of strategic global alliances.

Collectively, the effort follows a well-established pattern. Ford’s alliances with Koç Holding and Volkswagen underpin its commercial vehicle leadership, and the new tie-up with Renault extends this logic into the passenger car domain.

Commercial strength and data-driven services

Ford Pro remains the dependable engine of Ford’s European performance. Beyond hardware, the division now sells uptime. Its Liive Uptime system, which turns billions of data points into predictive maintenance insights, added an estimated 820,000 days of vehicle availability for European businesses in 2024 alone. Such services are increasingly central to Ford’s argument that digital ecosystems, not drivetrains, will differentiate commercial vehicle brands.

Recasting the industrial footprint for multi-energy flexibility

The restructuring of Ford’s industrial base is unfolding through a mixture of modernisation and inter-company synergy. Ford Otosan, the joint venture with Koç Holding, is widely cited as one of the sector’s most effective collaborations. Its plants are supplied with electric drive units from Halewood in the UK, following a £380 million investment in the facility, equivalent to roughly $480 million today. Advanced engines continue to flow from Ford’s Dagenham plant, maintaining its strategic relevance. Volkswagen also remains a pivotal partner, with Ford’s EVs from their alliance produced at the Electric Vehicle Centre in Cologne. Meanwhile Ford’s Valencia plant is being positioned as a backbone for the next phase of passenger car development, supporting the shift toward multi-energy architectures. Collectively, these arrangements represent Ford’s attempt to offset Europe’s structurally high costs while preserving control over product character.

Europe’s carmakers cut production as overcapacity bites

Stellantis, Volkswagen, and Ford are pausing production at multiple plants across Europe amid falling demand, rising inventories, and shrinking market share. With utilisation rates dropping, industry-wide plant closures are beginning to look inevitable.

Ford presses Europe for regulatory realism

As Ford refreshes its industrial and product agenda, it is also making a political one. The company argues that Europe’s regulatory trajectory risks outpacing consumer readiness. The disparity between mandated CO2 reductions and actual EV uptake has sharpened tensions between policymakers and manufacturers.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose – whether that's fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” said Jim Baumbick. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Ford proposes three adjustments. The first is regulatory alignment with market reality, including a longer runway for hybrid sales. The second is sustained incentives and nationwide charging investment, bridging the divide between affluent cities and rural regions. The third is relief for commercial fleets, where only 8 per cent of new vans are electric. Ford warns that current CO2 rules amount to an “economic tax” on small enterprises that constitute more than half of the continent’s GDP. The argument ultimately reflects Ford’s broader strategy. A successful transition, the company contends, depends on giving customers time, choice and affordability rather than forcing technological adoption ahead of demand.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/2575116.jpg?imageId=2575116&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-12-10 00:58:34.956032

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken calls for a new approach to jointly tackle the most pressing environmental issues including climate change and biodiversity loss that threaten over 1 million plant and animal species with extinction.

The U.N. Environment Assembly — which the U.S. government didn’t attend — produced the new report this week by almost 300 scientists from 83 countries.

The issues, which also include land degradation and pollution, are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme’s Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. “You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.”

They’re “all undermining our economy,” worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven’t made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What’s more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn’t involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded, and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn’t measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren’t the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.”

International cooperation falters

Despite the report’s urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He’s promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn’t attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and “said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she’s confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

When we launched How They Voted more than a decade ago, our goal was clear: show North Carolina employers which legislators stand with the pro-growth, jobs-focused agenda they helped create.

The NC Chamber’s charge is to influence policy so businesses can grow, innovate, hire, and reinvest in their communities. But employers also need clarity on a fundamental question: Are their elected officials voting in alignment with the policies that drive competitiveness and economic opportunity?

How They Voted gives them that answer. It is the business community’s scorecard—built by job creators, grounded in real votes, and focused solely on the policies that move North Carolina forward.

A Tool Built for Job Creators — Not Politics

How They Voted evaluates lawmakers based strictly on their support for the NC Chamber’s Legislative Agenda, shaped annually by employers across every industry and region of the state.

It measures whether legislators supported:

Workforce and talent development pipelines

A competitive tax and regulatory climate

Strong, reliable infrastructure

A fair, predictable legal environment

Efficient, transparent rulemaking

Policies that allow businesses to expand, compete, and create jobs

Every scored bill is tied directly to what employers identify as critical to long-term competitiveness.

Why Business Engagement in Politics Isn’t Optional

Public policy shapes everything about the operating environment for North Carolina companies:

The cost and complexity of hiring

Tax predictability

Infrastructure reliability

The speed of project approvals

Legal and regulatory certainty

The strength of our workforce pipelines

These decisions determine whether employers can keep investing in their people and communities.

This is why we urge business leaders to stay engaged. When employers speak up, policymakers understand what it truly takes to compete—and North Carolina wins.

How They Voted ensures that engagement is informed, strategic, and grounded in facts.

What Sets How They Voted Apart

There are a lot of scorecards out there, but this one is different.

It evaluates only what matters to job creators. No ideology. No political games. No personal opinions. If a vote affects competitiveness and the full chamber has an opportunity to vote on it, we score it. If it doesn’t, we don’t.

It is objective and transparent. Votes are measured exactly as they occurred. No bonus points. No personality factors. Action is the metric.

It reflects the full ecosystem that drives growth. Child care capacity, energy reliability, transportation funding, tax policy, barriers to housing, regulatory certainty—How They Voted captures the real-world issues employers face.

It is built by and for North Carolina business. The business community sets the agenda. How They Voted shows who supported it.

Accountability Builds Competitiveness

North Carolina’s economic success has been decades in the making. It happened because employers engaged, policymakers listened, and sound policy followed. But staying competitive requires vigilance.

How They Voted provides the accountability needed to keep North Carolina moving forward. It empowers job creators and strengthens the public-private partnership at the heart of our state’s success.

Looking Ahead — And a Call to Action

As we continue to advocate for policies that strengthen our workforce, modernize our infrastructure, and expand economic opportunity, How They Voted will remain a cornerstone of our work.

But advocacy alone isn’t enough.

The NC Chamber actively engages in efforts to support candidates who support pro-business policies.If you want to learn how to get involved, or how your business can support Jobs Champions at the ballot box, email Jake Cashion.

North Carolina’s economy is strong because its business community is strong. Stay engaged. Stay informed. And stay involved.

Together, we will keep North Carolina competitive as the best place to live, work, and do business.",https://ncchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/HTV.png,N,,2025-12-10 00:58:39.205428

Front-month gas futures for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 33.8 cents, or 6.9%, to settle at $4.574 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their lowest since November 26.

Financial firm LSEG said average gas output in the Lower 48 states held at 109.6 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in December, the same as November’s monthly record high of 109.6 bcfd.

On a daily basis, however, output was on track to fall to around 108.4 bcfd on Tuesday, putting it down about 2.8 bcfd since hitting a daily record high of 111.3 bcfd on November 28.

Record output has allowed energy companies to stockpile more gas than usual, leaving the amount of fuel in storage at about 5% above normal for this time of year.

Meteorologists forecast weather across the country would remain mostly warmer than normal through Dec. 24, reducing the amount of gas needed to heat homes and businesses.

LSEG projected average gas demand in the Lower 48 states, including exports, would slide from 143.7 bcfd this week to 142.6 bcfd next week. The forecast for next week was lower than LSEG’s outlook on Monday.

Average gas flows to the eight large U.S. LNG export plants rose to 18.8 bcfd so far this month, up from a monthly record high of 18.2 bcfd in November.

In LNG news, Freeport LNG’s 2.4-bcfd export plant in Texas was on track to take in more gas on Tuesday in a sign that one of its three liquefaction trains returned to service after shutting down on Monday.

The Imsaikah LNG vessel, meanwhile, docked at Exxon Mobil /QatarEnergy’s 2.4-bcfd Golden Pass LNG export plant under construction in Texas, according to LSEG data.

The ship is carrying LNG from Qatar that traders and analysts say will be used to cool equipment as part of the plant’s commissioning. The facility is expected to start producing LNG later this year or early next year.

Around the world, gas prices held near 19-month lows of about $9 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) benchmark in Europe and $11 at the Japan-Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia.

Global prices have declined in recent weeks with a slow start to the winter heating season and hopes peace talks over Ukraine could result in lifting of sanctions against Moscow. That could allow Russia, the world’s second-biggest gas producer behind the U.S., to export more fuel in the future.

The group, led by national environmental organization Food & Water Watch, has written a letter to Congress calling for a ban on the approval and construction of data centers.

It cites what it describes as “massive and unsustainable consumption by data centers of energy and water resources, and skyrocking utility costs for families and small businesses,"" as reasons a ban is needed.

Signatories include the US branches of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, as well as the US Climate Action Network and dozens of regional and state organizations.

The latter states: “The rapid expansion of data centers across the United States, driven by the generative AI and crypto booms, presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.

“This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources, and raising electricity prices across the country.”

It points to a report from the University of California and think tank Next 10, released last month, which claims that health impacts from pollution associated with California’s data centers tripled from 2019 to 2023. It recommends that policymakers in the state take action to increase the amount of renewable energy in the grid and encourage data center operators to use low-carbon technologies such as battery storage.

“Californians are already living with major polluters like fossil fuel operators and water-guzzling agribusiness putting our water at risk, while simultaneously struggling with soaring utility costs,” said Nicole Ghio, California director for Food & Water Watch. “Given that, it’s highly problematic that we would give even one drop of our precious water to thirsty data centers or drive costs up for ratepayers.

“The only way forward is to pause the rampant expansion of the big data industry and investigate all potential harms before it’s too late.”

The AI boom and rapid build-out of data centers across the US have led to increasingly vocal opposition from environmental campaigners, as well as community groups concerned about the impact of large campuses on their neighborhoods.

Some of the protests are having a major impact on developments. In September, QTS cancelled a $2 billion data center planned in Porter County, Indiana, citing local opposition as the reason.

However, the chances of a federal data center ban would appear non-existent, given the vital role the AI boom has played in boosting US GDP over the last 12 months.

Moratoriums have been imposed in smaller, individual markets, notably Singapore and Irish capital Dublin, as well as Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

Trump’s Tokyo fantasy is based in a certain reality: Our cars are too big and too expensive.
The other directs the federal government to put out an annual report on how NEPA affects project timelines, costs, and outcomes.","He’s right: Kei cars are neat. These pint-sized coupes, hatchbacks, and even micro-vans and trucks are so cute and weird that U.S. car collectors have taken to snatching them up (under the rules that allow 25-year-old cars to be imported to America regardless of whether they meet our standards). And he’s absolutely right that Americans need smaller and more affordable automotive options. Yet it’s far from clear that what works in Japan will work here — or that the auto execs who stood behind Trump last week as he announced a major downgrading of upcoming fuel economy standards are keen to change course and start selling super-cheap economy cars.

Americans want our cars to do everything. This country’s fleet of Honda CR-Vs and Chevy Silverados have plenty of space for school carpools and grocery runs around town, and they’re powerful and safe enough for road-tripping hundreds of miles down the highway. It’s a theme that’s come up repeatedly in our coverage of electric vehicles. EVs are better for cities and suburbs than internal combustion vehicles, full stop. But they may never match the lightning-fast road trip pit stop people have come to expect from their gasoline-powered vehicles, which means they don’t fit cleanly into many Americans’ built-in idea of what a car should be.

This has long been a problem for selling Americans on microcars. We’ve had them before: As recently as a dozen years ago, extra-small autos like the Smart ForTwo and Scion iQ were available here. Those tiny cars made tons of sense in the United States’ truly dense urban areas; I’ve seen them strategically parked in the spaces between homes in San Francisco that are too short for any other car. They made less sense in the more wide-open spaces and sprawling suburbs that make up this country. The majority of Americans who don’t struggle with street parking and saw that they could get much bigger cars for not that much more money weren’t that interested in owning a car that’s only good for local driving.

The same dynamic exists with the idea of bringing kei cars for America. They’re not made to go faster than 40 or 45 miles per hour, and their diminutive size leaves little room for the kind of safety features needed to make them highway-legal here. (Can you imagine driving that tiny car down a freeway filled with 18-wheelers?) Even reaching street legal status is a struggle. While reporting earlier this year on the rise of kei car enthusiasts, The New York Times noted that while some states have moved to legalize mini-cars, it is effectively illegal to register them in New York. (They interviewed someone whose service was to register the cars in Montana for customers who lived elsewhere.)

If the automakers did follow Trump’s directive and stage a tiny car revival, it would be a welcome change for budget-focused Americans. Just a handful of new cars can be had for less than $25,000 in the U.S. today, and drivers are finally beginning to turn against the exorbitant prices of new vehicles and the endless car loans required to finance them. Individuals and communities have turned increasingly to affordable local transportation options like golf carts and e-bikes for simply getting around. Tiny cars could occupy a space between those vehicles and the full-size car market. Kei trucks, which take the pickup back to its utilitarian roots, would be a wonderful option for small businesses that just need bare-bones hauling capacity.

Besides convincing size-obsessed Americans that small is cool, there is a second problem with bringing kei cars to the U.S., which is figuring out how to make little vehicles fit into the American car world. Following Trump’s declaration that America should get Tokyo-style tiny cars ASAP, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said “we have cleared the deck” of regulations that would prevent Toyota or anyone else from selling tiny cars here. Yet shortly thereafter, the Department of Transportation clarified that, “As with all vehicles, manufacturers must certify that they meet U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, including for crashworthiness and passenger protection.”

In other words, Ford and GM can’t just start cranking out microcars that don’t include all the airbags and other protections necessary to meet American crash test and rollover standards (not without a wholesale change to our laws, anyway). As a result, U.S. tiny cars couldn’t be as tiny as Japanese ones. Nor would they be as cheap, which is a crucial issue. Americans might spend $10,000 on a city-only car, but probably wouldn’t spend $20,000 — not when they could just get a plain old Toyota Corolla or a used SUV for that much.

It won’t be easy to convince the car companies to go down this road, either. They moved so aggressively toward crossovers and trucks over the past few decades because Americans would pay a premium for those vehicles, making them far more profitable than economy cars. The margins on each kei car would be much smaller, and since the stateside market for them might be relatively small, this isn’t an alluring business proposition for the automakers. It would be one thing if they could just bring the small cars they’re selling elsewhere and market them in the United States without spending huge sums to redesign them for America. But under current laws, they can’t.

Not to mention the whiplash effect: The Trump administration’s attacks on EVs left the carmakers struggling to rearrange their plans. Ford and Chevy probably aren’t keen to start the years-long process of designing tiny cars to please a president who’ll soon be distracted by something else.

Trump’s Tokyo fantasy is based in a certain reality: Our cars are too big and too expensive. But while kei cars would be fantastic for driving around Boston, D.C., or San Francisco, the rides that America really needs are the reasonably sized vehicles we used to have — the hatchbacks, small trucks, and other vehicles that used to be common on our roads before the Ford F-150 and Toyota RAV4 ate the American car market. A kei truck might be too minimalist for mainstream U.S. drivers, but how about a hybrid revival of the El Camino, or a truck like the upcoming Slate EV whose dimensions reflect what a compact truck used to be? Now that I could see.

2. MAHA activists push Trump to fire EPA chief

The “Make America Healthy Again” wing of President Donald Trump’s political coalition is urging the White House to fire Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin over his decisions to deregulate harmful chemicals. In a petition circulated online, several prominent activists aligned with the administration’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., accused Zeldin of having “prioritized the interests of chemical corporations over the well-being of American families and children.” As of early Friday afternoon, The New York Times reported, more than 2,800 people had signed the petition. By Sunday afternoon, the figure was nearly 6,000. The organizers behind the petition include Vani Hari, a MAHA influencer known as the Food Babe to her 2.3 million Instagram followers, and Alex Clark, a Turning Point USA activist who hosts what the Times called “a health and wellness podcast popular among conservatives.”

The intraparty conflict comes as one of Zeldin’s more controversial rollbacks of a Biden-era pollution rule, a regulation that curbs public exposure to soot, is facing significant legal challenges. A lawyer told E&E News the EPA’s case is a “Hail Mary pass.”

3. Congo curbs cobalt exports

The Democratic Republic of the Congo, by far the world’s largest source of cobalt, has slapped new export restrictions on the bluish metal needed for batteries and other modern electronics. As much as 80% of the global supply of cobalt comes from the DRC, where mines are notorious for poor working conditions, including slavery and child labor. Under new rules for cobalt exporters spelled out in a government document Reuters obtained, miners would need to pre-pay a 10% royalty within 48 hours of receiving an invoice and secure a compliance certificate. The rules come a month after Kinshasa ended a months-long export ban by implementing a quota system aimed at boosting state revenues and tightening oversight over the nation’s fast-growing mining industry. The establishment of the rules could signal increased exports again, but also suggests that business conditions are changing in the country in ways that could further complicate mining.

With Chinese companies controlling the vast majority of the DRC’s cobalt mines, the U.S. is looking to onshore more of the supply chain for the critical mineral. Among the federal investments is one I profiled for Heatmap: an Ohio startup promising to refine cobalt and other metals with a novel processing method. That company, Xerion, received funding from the Defense Logistics Agency, yet another funding office housed under the U.S. military.

4. China and France tighten ties over nuclear energy

Last month, I told you about China’s outreach to the rest of the world, including Western European countries, to work together on nuclear fusion. The U.S. cut off cooperation with China on traditional atomic energy back in 2017. But France is taking a different approach. During a state visit to Beijing last week, French President Emmanuel Macron “failed to win concessions” from Chinese leader Xi Jinping, France24 noted. But Paris and Beijing agreed to a new “pragmatic cooperation” deal on nuclear power. France’s state-owned utility giant EDF already built a pair of its leading reactors in China.

The U.S. has steadily pushed the French out of deals within the democratic world. Washington famously muscled in on a submarine deal, persuading Australia to drop its deal with France and go instead with American nuclear vessels. Around the same time, Poland — by far the biggest country in Europe to attempt to build its first nuclear power plant — gave the American nuclear company Westinghouse the contract in a loss for France’s EDF. Working with China, which is building more reactors at a faster rate than any other country, could give France a leg up over the U.S. in the race to design and deploy new reactors.

5. A bellwether coal plant in Indonesia seeks a life extension

It’s not just the U.S. backpedaling on climate pledges and extending operations of coal plants set to shut down. In smog-choked Indonesia, which ranks seventh in the world for emissions, a coal-fired plant that Bloomberg described as a “flagship” for the country’s phaseout of coal has, rather than shut down early, applied to stay open longer.

Nor is the problem reserved to countries with right-wing governance. The new energy plan Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a liberal, is pursuing in a bid to leverage the country’s fossil fuel riches over an increasingly pushy Trump means there’s “no way” Ottawa can meet its climate goals. As I wrote last week, the Carney government is considering a new pipeline from Alberta to the West Coast to increase oil and gas sales to Asia.

THE KICKER

There’s a new sheriff in town in the state at the center of the data center boom. Virginia’s lieutenant governor-elect Ghazala Hasmi said Thursday that the incoming administration would work to shift policy toward having data centers “pay their fair share” by supplying their own energy and paying to put more clean power on the grid, Utility Dive reported. “We have the tools today. We’ve got the skilled and talented workforce. We have a policy roadmap as well, and what we need now is the political will,” Hashmi said. “There is new energy in this legislature, and with it a real opportunity to build new energy right here in the Commonwealth.”

There are a lot of other ways regulation and bureaucracy get in the way of innovation and clean energy development that are not related to NEPA. Some aren’t even related to permitting. The biggest barrier to building transmission lines to carry new carbon-free energy, for example, is the lack of a standard process to determine who should pay for them when they cross through multiple utility or state jurisdictions. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are working on additional bills to address other kinds of bottlenecks, and the SPEED Act could end up being just one piece of the pie by the time it’s brought to the floor.

But while the bill is narrow in scope, it would be sweeping in effect — and it’s highly unclear at this point whether it could garner the bipartisan support necessary to get 60 votes in the Senate. Just two of the 20 Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee voted in favor of the bill.

Still, the context for the debate has evolved significantly from a year ago, as artificial intelligence has come to dominate America’s economic prospects, raising at least some proponents’ hopes that Congress can reach a deal this time.

“We’ve got this bipartisan interest in America winning the AI race, and an understanding that to win the AI race, we’ve got to expand our power resources and our transmission network,” Jeff Dennis, the executive director of the Electricity Customer Alliance and a former official at the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office, told me. “That creates, I think, a new and a different kind of energy around this conversation than we’ve had in years past.”

One thing that hasn’t changed is that the permitting reform conversation is almost impenetrably difficult to follow. Here’s a guide to the SPEED Act to help you navigate the debate as it moves through Congress.

What is NEPA again?

NEPA says that before federal agencies make decisions, whether promulgating rules or approving permits, they must assess the environmental impacts of those decisions and disclose them to the public. Crucially, it does not mandate any particular action based on the outcome of these assessments — that is, agencies still have full discretion over whether to approve a permit, regardless of how risky the project is shown to be.

What’s the problem lawmakers are trying to solve?

The perceived problem is that NEPA slows down infrastructure projects of all kinds — clean energy, dirty energy, housing, transit — beyond what should reasonably be expected, and thereby raises costs. The environmental assessments themselves take a long time, and yet third parties still often sue the federal government for not doing a thorough enough job, which can delay project development for many more years.

There’s a fair amount of disagreement over whether and how NEPA is slowing down clean energy, specifically. Some environmental and clean energy researchers have analyzed NEPA timelines for wind, solar, and transmission projects and concluded that while environmental reviews and litigation do run up the clock, that has been more the exception than the rule. Other groups have looked at the same data and seen a dire need for reform.

Part of the disconnect is about what the data doesn’t show. “What you don’t see is how little activity there is in transmission development because of the fear of not getting permits,” Michael Skelly, the CEO of Grid United, told me. “It’s so difficult to go through NEPA, it’s so costly on the front end and it’s so risky on the back end, that most people don’t even try.”

Underlying the dispute is also the fact that available data on NEPA processes and outcomes are scattered and incomplete. The Natural Resources Committee advanced two smaller complementary bills to the SPEED Act that would shine more light on NEPA’s flaws. One, called the ePermit Act, would create a centralized portal for NEPA-related documentation and data. The other directs the federal government to put out an annual report on how NEPA affects project timelines, costs, and outcomes.

Wasn’t NEPA reformed already?

During Biden’s presidency, Congress and the administration took a number of steps to reform NEPA — some more enduring than others. The biggest swing was the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which raised the debt ceiling. In an effort to prevent redundant analyses when a project requires approvals or input from multiple agencies, it established new rules by which one lead agency would oversee the NEPA process for a given project, set the environmental review schedule, and coordinate with other relevant agencies. It also codified new deadlines for environmental review — one year to complete environmental assessments, and two years for meatier ""environmental impact statements” — and set page limits for these documents.

The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law also established a new permitting council to streamline reviews for the largest projects.

The Inflation Reduction Act allocated more than $750 million for NEPA implementation across the federal government so that agencies would have more resources to conduct reviews. Biden’s Council of Environmental Quality also issued new regulations outlining how agencies should comply with NEPA, but those were vacated by a court decision that held that CEQ does not have authority to issue NEPA regulations.

Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed in early July, created a new process under NEPA by which developers could pay a fee to the government to guarantee a faster environmental review process.

None of these laws directly affected NEPA litigation, which many proponents of reform say is the biggest cause of delay and uncertainty in the process.

The SPEED Act’s Three Biggest Moves:

Creating shortcuts for environmental review. The bill allows agencies to skip the environmental review process when a project has already been reviewed by a state or Tribal government. It makes it easier for agencies to adopt “categorial exclusions,” which enable certain types of projects that are deemed relatively benign to skip environmental review altogether. It allows agencies to ignore scientific or technical information that becomes publicly available after the project has submitted its permit application. It prohibits agencies from delaying a decision to wait for new scientific research to be completed. It also says agencies cannot consider environmental or other kinds of effects that are “separate in time or place from the project or action” — potentially barring consideration of global climate change in permitting decisions.

Limiting judicial review. Under current law, anyone can sue the government over the NEPA process for up to six years after a project was approved. The bill would shorten that period to 150 days and limit litigation to individuals that submitted public comments during the environmental review process. It enacts new timelines for how long any lawsuit can take — about 210 days to get to a court decision, and another 240 for any appeal process to play out. It instructs courts to defer to an agency’s judgment when it comes to the environmental effects of a project. It also neuters the courts’ potential remedies if it finds that an agency violated NEPA, prohibiting courts from vacating permits or issuing injunctions on projects.

Trump-proofing permit withdrawals. The bill seeks to prevent Trump, future presidents, or their administrations from pulling fully approved permits willy-nilly. It says “a Federal agency may not revoke, rescind, withdraw, terminate, suspend, amend, alter, or take any other action to interfere with an authorization.” It goes on to list a number of caveats — unless the agency is required to revoke the permit by a court; unless the project developer has violated the terms of the permit; unless there is evidence of fraud; unless termination is necessary to prevent immediate and substantial harm to life, property, or national security. In any such case, the decision must be “supported by clear and convincing evidence,” it says.

What do people like about these changes?

The most positive comments I heard about the SPEED Act from clean energy proponents were that it was a promising, though flawed, opening salvo for permitting reform.

Dennis told me it was “incredibly important” that the bill had bipartisan support and that it clarified the boundaries for what agencies should consider in environmental reviews. Marc Levitt, the director of regulatory reform at the Breakthrough Institute and a former Environmental Protection Agency staffer, said it addresses many of the right problems — especially the issue of litigation — although the provisions as written are “a bit too extreme.” (More on that in a minute.)

Skelly liked the 150-day statute of limitations on challenging agency decisions in court. In general, speeding up the NEPA process is crucial, he said, not just because time is money. When it takes five years to get a project permitted, “by the time you come out the other side, the world has changed and you might want to change your project,” but going through it all over again is too arduous to be worth it.

Industry associations for both oil and gas and clean energy have applauded the bill, with the American Clean Power Association joining the American Petroleum Institute and other groups in signing a letter urging lawmakers to pass it. The American Council on Renewable Energy also applauded the bill’s passage, but advised that funding and staffing permitting agencies was also crucial.

What do people not like about these changes?

Many environmental groups fundamentally oppose the bill — both the provisions in it, and the overall premise that NEPA requires reform. “If you look at what’s causing delay at large,” Stephen Schima, senior legislative council for Earthjustice Action, told me, “it’s things like changes in project design, local and state regulations, failures of applicants to provide necessary information, lack of funding, lack of staff and resources at the agencies. It’s not the law itself.”

Schima and Levitt both told me that the language in the bill that’s supposed to prevent Trump from revoking previously approved permits is toothless — all of the exceptions listed “mirror almost precisely the conditions under which Trump and his administration are currently taking away permits,” Levitt said. The Solar Energy Industry Association criticized the bill for not addressing the “core problem” of the Trump administration’s “ongoing permitting moratorium” on clean energy projects.

Perhaps the biggest problem people have with the bill, which came up in my interviews and during a separate roundtable hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center, is the way it prevents courts from stopping projects. An agency could do a slapdash environmental review, miss significant risks to the public, and there would be no remedy other than that the agency has to update its review — the project could move forward as-is.

Those are far from the only red flags. During a Heatmap event on Thursday, Ted Kelly, the director and lead counsel for U.S. energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, told me one of his biggest concerns was the part about ignoring new scientific research. “That just really is insisting the government shut its eyes to new information,” he said. Schima pointed to the injustice of limiting lawsuits to individuals who submitted public comments, when under the Trump administration, agencies have stopped taking public comments on environmental reviews. The language around considering effects that are “separate in time or place from the project or action” is also dangerous, Levitt said. It limits an agency’s discretion over what effects are relevant to consider, including cumulative effects like pollution and noise from neighboring projects.

What’s next?

The SPEED Act is expected to come to a vote on the House floor in the next few weeks. Then the Senate will likely put forward its own version.

As my colleague Jael Holzman wrote last month, Trump himself remains the biggest wildcard in permitting reform. Democrats have said they won’t agree to a deal that doesn’t bar the president from pulling previously-approved permits or otherwise level the playing field for renewable energy. Whether Trump would ever sign a bill with that kind of language is not a question we have much insight into yet.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjI5Njc0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDQwNzMxNn0.xe41PtHsH_mtiyQsuLuDdeGxZc1JI7QDMF3I1swrw-c/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-10 06:58:08.706423

The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — saying 80% of that would power data centers.
That’s in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.
But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.","ATLANTA (AP) — With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes? Or could the utility overbuild and stick other ratepayers with the bill?

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state’s economy and “allow Georgia to contribute to the nation’s focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.”

“Given the number of companies interested in doing business in Georgia and the amount of customer load with signed contracts or in advanced discussions, it is important to continue moving forward with support for this great growth opportunity,” company officials said in testimony.

But electricity bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize the power demands of technology behemoths.

“I think what’s happening in Georgia is in some sense a perfect microcosm of what’s happening nationwide,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase public involvement in utility regulation. “You’re seeing electricity demand grow at the fastest rate in decades, and you’re seeing electricity prices rise at the fastest rate in decades.”

A growing political issue

Electricity costs were a key issue in last month’s elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, both data center hot spots. On Tuesday in North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.

In Georgia, the five elected Republicans on the Public Service Commission will decide on Georgia Power’s proposal weeks after voters delivered a stinging rebuke to GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the panel in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

After hearings next week, commissioners are scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 19. The two new Democrats won’t take office until January and current commissioners denied a request by opponents to postpone the decision until then.

Brionte McCorkle of Georgia Conservation Voters, a group that advocates for carbon-free energy and supported the Democrats, fears the vote will be one last gift from the all-Republican commission to Georgia Power.

“It would be a slap in the face for the commission to rush through this proposal, and give the power company everything it wants,” said McCorkle “It’s just not listening to what the people have said loud and clear.”

80% of new capacity for data centers

Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas. That’s according to an analysis by power consultant Grid Strategies of forecasts filed with federal officials. The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity — enough to power 4 million Georgia homes — saying 80% of that would power data centers. That’s in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.

Whether the forecast is accurate and who will pay the bill if data center customers don’t materialize is at the heart of the decision. Commissioners in January adopted rules meant to make sure data centers pay the costs of building new power plants and transmission lines they need. But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.

“The whole argument is premised on the idea that if we get all these new customers, then we can take costs and spread it out over more people and therefore put downward pressure on prices,” Hua said. “Well, if you don’t actually end up getting all those customers and you built all this new infrastructure, then you could see a scenario where you actually drive bills through the roof even more.”

The ultimate potential costs are unknown because Georgia Power’s estimates are partially a trade secret that the company won’t release. For example, the $15 billion price tag only covers construction costs for 80% of the current 10,000 megawatt request, and it doesn’t include any of the borrowing costs, which customers must also pay. The price of the 3,000 megawatts approved in 2024 remains entirely secret. Because of the rate freeze, ultimate costs won’t become clear until 2028, the next time commissioners set electricity rates.

Will customers pay?

Public Service Commission staff members who have analyzed the request say Georgia Power will need $3.4 billion a year in additional revenue by 2031, which could equal out to $20 a month for a residential customer. The company replied that such a claim is “flatly incorrect.”

“These customers pay upfront the full costs of serving them, commit to long-term contracts, and provide financial guarantees,” said spokesperson Matthew Kent. “That means residential and small business customers are protected from cost increases tied to these projects.”

Staff members recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build capacity for new large customers only after they have signed contracts starting with 3,100 megawatts of capacity and up to 7,400 megawatts total for contracts signed by March 16. That recommendation would also allow the commission to avoid approving contracts for some new multibillion-dollar natural gas-fired power plants. Costs for such construction have risen sharply, partly because equipment manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand.

The company reacted sharply against that recommendation, saying “it would significantly inhibit” its ability to sign up new data centers, hurt economic development, and reduce the opportunity to lower rates.

The company and staff could negotiate a settlement before the Dec. 19 vote. McCorkle said any outcome should focus on protecting customers.

The groups’ request came in a letter shared with members of Congress on Monday.

With the rise of generative artificial intelligence, data centers are expanding rapidly across the United States. The large facilities store rows of computer servers and networking equipment that require lots of energy, plus water for cooling. In 2024, data centers accounted for more than 4% of the country’s total electricity consumption, according to the International Energy Agency.

Data centers trigger environmental concerns because of the large amounts of water and energy they use. And to power the data centers, utilities must generate significantly more electricity.

“Someone has to pay for that,” said Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer with the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, the lead group pushing for a national moratorium on new data centers.

As of now, Ward said, proposals she has reviewed from utility companies in Florida would have consumers covering at least some of those higher energy costs from data centers.

“The need to build out infrastructure is expensive, and Florida families would be footing that bill, under current proposals,” Ward said.

“As it stands, the plans for building out data centers would increase bills drastically, and we already have Florida families struggling under the weight of increasing bills, rate hikes that have been coming more rapidly and at larger increments.”

State regulators recently approved a rate settlement that will have Florida Power & Light customers paying billions more in the coming years. Next year, FPL base rates are expected to rise by a collective $945 million. Critics of the settlement say they expect to fight the plan at the Florida Supreme Court.

RELATED: PSC OK's FPL deal that increases base rate in parts of Florida

Ward said at least two major utilities in Florida, FPL and Duke Energy, have made it clear “they plan to lay out the red carpet” for more data centers in the Sunshine State. “We need to make sure that Florida families are involved in these decisions … that utilities aren't allowed to charge massive increases to customer bills to pad the pockets of shareholders.”

At a press conference last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis shared his plans for a statewide “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights” that would, among other things, prevent utilities from charging Floridians more in order to support a hyperscale data center. DeSantis promised the proposed legislation would “protect ratepayers in the state of Florida.”

“What we are proposing will be the most significant protections for individuals anywhere in the country, by far,” DeSantis said.

RELATED: DeSantis proposes Florida AI bill of rights

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump announced this week he plans to issue an executive order soon to create a single, national AI rule.

“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something. THAT WILL NEVER WORK!”

Earlier this year, senators overwhelmingly voted against blocking states from enacting their own AI laws. The failed proposal was a “total non-starter,” DeSantis said last week.

“There's so many implications for what they're doing with respect to artificial intelligence,” DeSantis said. “States like Florida not only have a right, we have a responsibility to make sure that we're creating sufficient guardrails so that this stuff isn't hurting our kids, our families, our businesses and our senior citizens.”

DeSantis drew a line in the sand between everyday Floridians and big technology companies driving the growth of generative AI.

“The incentives of big tech are not the same as what's in the interest of the people and the public. The incentives of big tech is to maximize profits off of this. They're spending a lot of money on creating data centers … to get a return on the investment,” DeSantis said.

For Ward and others hoping for a national pause on new data centers, the requested moratorium would end only once regulations are in place to protect consumers and prevent the facilities from causing environmental harm.

“If we are to have data centers, we need them to be powered by clean renewable energy,” Ward said.

Ward said she appreciates DeSantis pushing for state regulation of data centers and AI. She only wishes his efforts had come sooner.

“Unfortunately, though, Governor DeSantis's fight on affordable energy is coming kind of late. I mean, it was his commission that just passed the largest rate increase in U.S. history,” Ward said, referencing the FPL rate settlement.

Still, Ward said, she welcomes the governor’s interest in ensuring Floridians have a voice in the discussions around regulation of data centers and AI.

“We do hope to see that Florida is able to establish some regulations that prevent this massive data center buildout in the face of the federal call for expansion, and that whoever steps into the governor's office next January continues this fight that DeSantis is starting,” Ward said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14d2424/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2996x1573+0+214/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fec%2F0d77cf884be9b7a4b16c769f0cec%2Fdata-pexels-panumas-nikhomkhai.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 21:00:06.048697

WASHINGTON — The Maritime Administration (MARAD) has terminated the deepwater port license application for West Delta LNG, an offshore LNG export terminal proposed off the coast of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. The project would have increased greenhouse gas emissions and health-harming air pollution and built a pipeline through marsh wetlands.

The applicant LNG 21 received eight extensions since December 2019, yet still failed to submit a viable project application for federal agencies to begin their review. At the end of 2024, LNG 21’s CEO informed MARAD their delays were caused by “broader challenges in the LNG industry” as reasons for needing more time.

“This decision reflects how, in their rush to make more money, the LNG industry tries to get away with proposals for massive, harmful projects that aren’t even fully planned,” said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks. “Expediting LNG export terminals has real consequences for Americans, including costing us more on our energy bills.”

There are three additional applications for “floating” LNG export terminals off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana being considered by MARAD. The West Delta project would have emitted 1,041,670 tons of greenhouse gases each year, 1,609.98 tons of criteria air pollutants each year, and 18,880 pounds of hazardous air pollutants each year.

The Gulf Coast is especially at risk from higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more intense hurricanes due to the climate crisis, increasing the danger proposed floating LNGs have on infrastructure, workers, environments, and coastal communities. There are no floating LNG export terminals currently operating in the U.S.

While the Trump administration has since allowed work on Empire Wind to resume, the states have argued the wider freeze on permits for other projects is hitting the US economy as developers and financiers back away from earlier plans.

The court judgement detailed how Trump's Wind Order also caused major delays to other key wind projects including Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind in New Jersey, which was expected to bring nearly $2bn in economic benefits but had been either ""jeopardized or deferred"", while the SouthCoast Wind project in Massachusetts was postponed delaying thousands of megawatts of clean energy.

Plans for a transmission line in New York that would have connected the city's power grid to offshore wind farms, saving money over time, were also curtailed.

Timothy Fox, managing director at the Washington, DC-based research firm ClearView Energy Partners, said he did not expect this court ruling to reinvigorate the industry.

""It's more symbolic than substantive,"" he said. ""All the court is saying is ... you need to go back to work and consider these applications. What does that really mean?"" he said.

Officials could still deny permits or bog applications down in lengthy reviews, he noted.

Trump has sought to boost government support for fossil fuels after campaigning for the presidency under the slogan ""drill, baby, drill.""

Days after his return to office, Trump said ""we're not going to do the wind thing"" and called them ""big, ugly windmills"" that were dangerous to wildlife.

Trump has previously claimed, without evidence, that wind turbines kill whales.

According to its website, the Empire Wind project is expected to take two years to complete and be fully operational by the end of 2027.

Before becoming president, Trump battled - and ultimately failed - to stop the construction of a wind farm off the coast of his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

Sharice Davids, D-Kan.; Mike Flood, R-Neb.; Troy Carter, D-La.; and Tracey Mann, R-Kan., on Dec. 9 introduced legislation that aims to reinstate the 45Z clean fuel production credit premium for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and extend the 45Z credit through 2033.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

President Trump on July 4 signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation package that extended the 45Z credit through the end of 2029, altered the credit by limiting eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Canada or Mexico, and eliminated the “special rate” for SAF. The elimination of the “special rate” effectively caps the value of the SAF credit at $1 per gallon starting in 2026.

The SAF Act is not the only legislation introduced in recent months to reinstate the SAF bonus credit. In October, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., introduced a bill that aims to reinstate many of the renewable energy tax credits eliminated by the OBBBA. One provision of that bill aims to reinstate the 45Z credit premium for SAF.

The bipartisan SAF Act is endorsed by major industry and agricultural groups, including National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Greater New Orleans Inc., Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugarcane League.

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, executive director, SAF Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

Candidates in Louisiana strongly preferred.

Program Overview

EDF's U.S. Legal & Regulatory team engages in strategic regulatory advocacy and litigation to achieve clean and healthy air, drive clean energy progress, and ensure a stable climate for all. We envision a world in which people from all backgrounds and experiences feel connected to the public health and environmental challenges we face, and are engaged in creating durable, equitable solutions. The U.S. Legal & Regulatory team works primarily out of the Washington, D.C., Boulder, CO offices and remotely.

The US Clean Energy program works to increase the speed and scale of deployment of clean energy resources in the United States in order to decarbonize the electric system and enable electrification of vehicles, buildings, and industry while maintaining reliability and affordability. We focus on addressing the barriers that block and delay the construction of clean energy projects and the infrastructure needed to support them, particularly the electric transmission system. The barriers we work to address include insufficient and misdirected system planning, funding and financing challenges, inefficient siting and permitting processes, and biased market structures; as well as efforts to subsidize, prop up, and expand the use of fossil fuel generation and block the development and integration of clean resources.

Our Clean Affordable Power program advances our mission by advocating before state public utility commissions and other state and regional bodies for clean, affordable energy solutions that benefit consumers, bolster electric grid resilience and reliability, and deliver health and climate benefits. We work with experts across EDF, and with a broad range of partners including industry, community organizations, consumer advocates, and regulators, to secure practical energy system progress. We seek to modernize electric utility planning and rate design to accelerate clean energy deployment and reduce the need for new fossil fuel investments; promote cost-effective and efficient electric grid development that unlocks clean energy resources; advance clean transportation solutions; and move toward a clean future for natural gas utilities.

Louisiana is a priority for EDF's energy advocacy due to its significant power sector emissions, rapidly growing electric loads, exceptional potential for clean, low-cost electricity generation, significant opportunities for improved regional and interregional transmission, and immense untapped energy efficiency reserves. EDF seeks to leverage these opportunities to ensure the development of a clean, affordable, reliable, and resilient energy system in Louisiana.

Overall Function

The Senior Attorney, Louisiana Clean Affordable Power leads EDF's legal and regulatory advocacy in support of clean energy in Louisiana.

2025 continues to be a whirlwind of global trade developments. Yet in spite of all of the surprises defining this year, one trade issue is certain: renegotiation of 2020’s United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA). Although a review and potential renegotiation are scheduled to occur by July 2026, there is potential for this to begin by late 2025.

What is less certain is what a renegotiated agreement may look like. The U.S. administration’s first tariff announcements targeted Canada and Mexico (in addition to China), kicking off a circuitous path of announcements, pauses, exemptions, and tariffs that have generated hard feelings and a persistent environment of uncertainty.

The core fundamentals of the North American economy are at stake. Agricultural goods, energy, construction materials, and automotive manufacturing are only a few of the critical sectors at risk. Long-established supply chains in smaller sectors can be disproportionately reliant upon USMCA trade as well, exposing direct risks for many industries.

PATHS TO CONSIDER

There are three basic outcomes. In the first, the USMCA could be renewed for another 16 years. Another result could be renewal through 2036 but with annual reviews by the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. Lastly, any of the participating countries may formally withdraw within six months, effectively collapsing the agreement. Investors and communities should be well on their way with preparation for different outcomes of these talks. Some potential scenarios can help inform what these might look like.

Renewed but Modified

A renegotiation deal is reached with tariffs on non-USMCA goods. Terms would largely replicate the current version, with goods not under USMCA facing a higher tariff of 10 to 15 percent. Certain sectors, especially automotive, could be reworked to promote U.S. reshoring, such as through rate quotas. The deal would include firm investment commitments and no regular review as terms extend into the 2030s. This scenario would provide significant certainty, giving Canada and Mexico a large advantage in the current trade environment.

Less Than Free Trade

A renegotiation is reached with key changes, such as a flat tariff rate and annual reviews. A 10 percent flat tariff would be applied to most goods within USMCA, with non-USMCA goods facing higher tariffs. There could be reductions or quotas for more strategic sectors such as steel and energy. High-level investment commitments would be made with few details, while annual reviews would reopen deal uncertainty every year. This scenario provides modest certainty. The core benefits of a legally binding agreement would be in place, but this is counterbalanced by annual reviews and their likely use as leverage.

Transactional Downgrade

Renegotiation collapses, leading to withdrawal from USMCA and higher tariffs. Tariffs of 10 to 25 percent would apply to most goods, with reduced rates for significant sectors such as food, autos, and energy, and quotas on others. There would be an extended timeline for resolution to account for bilateral talks, and investment commitments would be postponed. Mexico and Canada could reorient more supply chains with free trade partners—and China. Low certainty would be established. Bilateral trade terms among the three countries would be difficult and lengthy to achieve, putting North American supply chains at high risk of shifting.

WHERE DO COUNTRIES STAND

Both Mexico and Canada have been preparing by demonstrating their commitment to U.S. political priorities. Mexican leadership adjusted policies on immigration, organized crime, and Chinese imports to accord with U.S. priorities. Outrage in Canada with U.S. administration actions and language has challenged bilateral relations, but the Canadian government has largely aligned with its neighbor on economic and border control policies.

For now, leaders of both of these countries enter the USMCA renegotiations in positions of strength. They were elected relatively recently and have political support to advocate aggressively for national trade interests. The perception of coming under threat by the U.S. has also generated broader public support for Canadian and Mexican leadership. And recent, high-level coordination between the two countries has confirmed a desire to work more closely in the lead-up to USMCA talks.

The U.S. is the key actor in these talks. The U.S. administration has shown a willingness to seek out and utilize trade leverage to maximize gains, largely in the form of tariffs and foreign investment commitments. With the U.S. Congress removing itself from the trade conversation, the administration has had considerable leeway to determine trade matters as it sees fit. In order to qualify as a legally binding trade agreement, a renegotiated USMCA will need to be approved by Congress. However, the U.S. administration has repeatedly been able to convince its legislative majority, however slim, to support its priorities.

WHAT CAN WE EXPECT

Rhetoric during the talks is likely to be heated as positions are not aligned. Canada and Mexico are firmly in favor of renewing USMCA and its tariff-free terms as much as possible. As such, they have both made conciliatory moves toward the U.S. vis-à-vis China and migration. The U.S. administration, on the other hand, is interested in reducing trade deficits (as the U.S. has with Canada and Mexico) and an increase in U.S.-based manufacturing. Tariffs are the preferred tool for the U.S. administration to reach these goals and may well be an end in and of themselves. With Mexico and Canada aligned with the status quo and the U.S. in favor of new terms, the U.S. position will be the key to success or failure in USMCA renegotiations.

Hard numbers may ultimately encourage all sides to reach some agreement. Per the U.S. Trade Representative, exports to the U.S. are core to Canadian and Mexican economic growth, making up 75 percent and 80 percent of all of their exports, respectively. This reliance on the U.S. is not lost on the American administration. At the same time, 33 percent of U.S. exports head to Mexico or Canada, making them not only the top two destinations but also more than the next nine countries combined. Key U.S. sectors—construction, agriculture, automotive, and many others—are reliant upon USMCA supply chains.

The status of economic indicators may inform negotiating positions as well. Growth in the U.S. is a positive signal, but negative consumer outlooks echo slowdowns in manufacturing, labor, and inflation reduction. Similarly, growth in Mexico and Canada amidst trade disruptions belies negative outlooks into 2026. A slowdown among any of the three countries could incentivize a new, growth-oriented USMCA.

One factor that complicates trade negotiations is the U.S. administration’s emphasis on incorporating political issues into economic issues. The “weaponization” of economic tools has risen in prominence in recent years, and the White House is expanding on that trend by utilizing tariffs to serve political goals. Few examples are more prominent than the use of the drug trade and illegal immigration as reasons for tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Whether the U.S. is satisfied with bilateral collaboration on these issues or not will be a critical aspect.

Evidence from this year’s tariff deals offers clues on what a deal could look like. The parameters of announced deals are often slimmer than initially suggested, easing the prospect for agreement. While these agreements have not been formally approved by Congress, as is typical for U.S. trade deals, it is worth noting that participating sides have honored their stated commitments. Announced investment figures by trade deal countries have remained just that—announcements—and scant details do not inspire confidence at this stage. And no country has escaped with zero U.S. tariffs, as even close partners like the United Kingdom face a minimum 10 percent tariff rate.

Could we end up with a new USMCA that echoes this framework? What these factors underscore is the lack of certainty compared to the trade deals of years past, including USMCA and its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement. The biggest risk may not be that talks fail, but that they extend uncertainty—mandating an annual review, for example, or making facets of an agreement conditional upon a future, opaque target, such as inbound investment. The relative stability of any agreement, however limited, may be the best outcome in the current environment.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id81660_USMCA-Shake-Up1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 21:00:17.550075

Forty-two years earlier, a similar group–including the Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor and the EPA Administrator—also stood before a crowd, outlining a vision for the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay.

But the scene this December was also notably different. Joining the original signatories were the governor of Delaware, and representatives from New York and West Virginia.

A Revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement

Over the past 42 years, three other agreements have guided Chesapeake Bay restoration. The 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement established the first numeric goals to reduce pollution, while Chesapeake 2000 established 102 goals that expanded into fisheries management and sound land use practices.

Then came the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement–the first agreement to add “watershed” in the title, with the headwaters states of Delaware, New York and West Virginia signing on. The agreement aligned with federal directives like the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load, and incorporated goals that considered changing environmental conditions and expanded objectives to engage all residents of the watershed. It also established expectations for transparency and accountability.

The 2014 agreement included 10 goals and 31 outcomes, several of which set 2025 as a target for achieving progress. While work toward many of these outcomes remains relevant and ongoing, updates were needed to reflect the most current science, data and policy. As a result, the partnership decided to revise the existing Watershed Agreement.

“This refreshed Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement marks a new chapter in our enduring partnership, made possible through contributions from experts in every field and input from every corner of the watershed,” Chesapeake Bay Commission Chair Sara Love proudly noted.

Bringing New Partners to the Table

Board members of the Indigenous Conservation Council sat in the audience at the recent Chesapeake Executive Council meeting for a very important reason—the partnership had just been tasked to work with the federally recognized tribes of the watershed to determine how to best include them in the Chesapeake Bay Program moving forward. These recommendations are expected to be presented to the Principals’ Staff Committee by July 1, 2026.

Before the meeting began, the four tribal representatives met with members of the Executive Council for a gift ceremony. Chief Richardson presented each member with wild rice, which is an important symbol in Native traditions that, among its many meanings, honors growing relationships and interdependence.

The meeting also marked the first time the Agricultural Advisory Committee participated. The committee was established at the 2024 Chesapeake Executive Council meeting to facilitate greater engagement with the agricultural sector and advise the partnership on high-level policy recommendations.

“We are also excited to welcome, for the first time, the new Agricultural Advisory Committee and to begin exploring a formal relationship with Indigenous voices of the Chesapeake Bay,” said Abel Olivo, chair of the Stakeholders Advisory Committee.

A headwaters leader takes the reins of the partnership

At a comical, yet symbolic, moment of the meeting, outgoing chair Maryland Governor Wes Moore and incoming chair Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro exchanged hats. Gov. Shapiro’s was a wide-brimmed fishing hat decorated with the Maryland flag, while Gov. Moore’s ball cap sported a blue crab.

This light-hearted gesture underscored the importance of this moment. This marked the first time that Pennsylvania had taken over leadership of the partnership in 20 years.

“I’m honored to be elected as the next chair of the Chesapeake Executive Council by my fellow governors and I’m looking forward to continuing this work to get stuff done together for the people we serve,” Gov. Shapiro said.",https://www.chesapeakebay.net/files/_670xAUTO_crop_center-center_none/dec_9_25_1800-01-_08A7499.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 03:57:52.511433

What’s climate change?
EPA removed references to human contributions to climate change from some pages on its website, Jean Chemnick writes.
Two sections on “climate change indicators” and “climate change impacts and analysis” are gone from the website.","Sen. Bernie Moreno is floating a new Republican take on why the Biden administration supported electric vehicles: It was duped by China.

“We were ahead of them by a mile, by 10 miles on the internal combustion engine,” the Ohio Republican said at a Washington auto-industry conference last week. But then the Chinese “went into EVs, and then they convinced the Western world to go into EVs and play their game.”

Encouraging the transition away from gasoline-fueled cars “was just an irrational, dumb policy,” Moreno added.

Moreno’s outlook is the latest twist on the common — though not universal — GOP worldview that buying an EV only helps America’s biggest geopolitical adversary.

Today, China is a clear leader in the EV competition. It controls and processes most of the raw materials and precursors for batteries. Sales of its low-cost electric vehicles, made possible by years of government subsidy, are growing in virtually every global market except the U.S., where high tariffs keep them away.

Former President Joe Biden pointed to China’s domination in the EV market as the reason to pursue policies that encouraged the growth of a domestic industry.

During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden said that failing to foster EVs had “allowed China to race ahead in the competition to lead the auto industry of the future.” His administration implemented tax credits and grants that aimed to boost both EV sales and manufacturing — most of which the Trump administration has reversed.

A long road

Moreno, who made his fortune as a car dealer, was elected last year, joining a small cadre of mostly conservative former auto salesmen in Congress.

He was among the lawmakers who signed off on President Donald Trump’s agenda to remove nearly every trace of Biden-era support for electric vehicles.

Moreno’s interpretation of why America first turned toward electric vehicles was disputed by Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which lobbies for EV-affiliated companies.

The threat of competition from all-electric automaker Tesla, starting with the introduction of the Roadster in 2008, got domestic carmakers to start taking EVs seriously, Gore said.

A decade earlier, environmentalists’ desire for a car that didn’t burn fossil fuels gave rise to General Motors’ pioneering EV1 in the mid-1990s. And before that, in the 1980s, American scientists developed the lithium-ion battery that made modern EVs possible.

“We’re talking about things that have been invented here and have been manufactured here in large numbers,” Gore said.

The global market

Doubling down on internal-combustion engines might not bode well for U.S. automakers in a global market that is transitioning to EVs. Last year, 29 percent of General Motors’ cars were sold abroad, according to figures from S&P Global Mobility. Ford was even higher, at 41 percent.

“If you put all of your eggs into that [internal-combustion] market, and that market struggles, then you have no backstop, you have nowhere to go,” said Stephanie Brinley, an S&P auto analyst.

But Moreno’s take got an endorsement from Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of climate and energy issues at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which developed the Project 2025 policy playbook that has served as a blueprint for the Trump administration.

Policies that support EVs in the U.S., she said, always help China.

The Biden-era rules and subsidies that promoted EVs “means we have to use a Chinese-subsidized product,” she said.

Jumping through hoops at EPA

Probationary employees are back at the Environmental Protection Agency this week after spending roughly nine months on administrative leave, writes Kevin Bogardus.

The staffers, who are generally in their first year of government service, have been fired, then reinstated, then placed on leave with full pay and now called back into the office. Even more uncertainty looms as the Trump administration restructures EPA.

One agency staffer told Kevin that the past year has been a “complete roller coaster.”

“I wish I just could walk away from it and be done, but I don’t want the Trump administration to win,” said the employee. “It has been a lot of they say, ‘Jump!’ and I say, ‘How high?’”

NextEra Energy is teaming up with companies including Meta, Google and Exxon Mobil to build power generation for data center hubs around the country, Christa Marshall writes.

The power company, the nation’s largest renewable energy developer, plans to largely build new gas plants, in a move that could sway the electricity mix around the country. The project’s scope is massive — 15 gigawatts of new generation by 2035 to power at least 20 data center hubs. NextEra CEO John Ketchum said that total could double.

“We’re in the golden age of power demand,” Ketchum said during an investors day in New York. The target is “fairly conservative,” he said.

The announcement was made in Fredericton by David Myles, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Identity and Culture and Minister responsible for Official Languages and to the Secretary of State (Nature), on behalf of Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson. More than $9 million will go through the Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program to install more than 1,200 chargers in public places, workplaces, on-street locations and multi-unit residential buildings. Most of these chargers will be deployed in New Brunswick, Alberta and Ontario.

A separate $1.4 million investment will support a University of New Brunswick research project developing magnetic materials that could lower the cost and improve the performance of EV motors.

Hodgson said the investment is intended to build charging infrastructure and promote domestic innovation. “We are driving the installation of electric vehicles chargers where Canadians live, work and travel and supporting Canadian innovation and research. It’s time to build more resilient supply chains and a cleaner, more secure and more competitive economy.”

Myles said the added infrastructure will help Canadians feel more confident choosing electric. “With today’s announcement, we are helping enable the transition to zero-emission vehicles with the installation of additional EV chargers across Canada, many of which will be located in New Brunswick. Canadians can choose electric vehicles with confidence, knowing they can get where they need to go. We are also proud to support innovative research from Atlantic Canadians that makes EVs more affordable and efficient.”

Green Economy Canada — a national non-profit that supports businesses in reducing emissions — is one of the organizations receiving infrastructure funding. Senior business sustainability manager Luke Robertson said the demand for support has been strong.

“Green Economy Canada received overwhelming demand for the funding we were allocated for delivery through the Zero Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Program. Canadian businesses are clearly looking to be a part of the transition to electric vehicles, and we expect to see continued growth in adoption rates in tandem with decarbonization of our electrical grids.”

The New Brunswick Power Corporation, the province’s public electric utility, will also install chargers. Its president and chief executive Lori Clark, said expanded charging access will make EV driving more practical for customers.

“This funding is about more than just money — it is about helping New Brunswickers in their decision to reduce emissions by eliminating range anxiety, ensuring they can reliably get to where they are going and making their EV experience more convenient. By significantly expanding our charging network, we are putting the customer experience at the centre of our clean energy transition, modernizing the utility and making it easier than ever for New Brunswickers to drive worry-free.”

The University of New Brunswick, one of Canada’s oldest public research universities, will receive support for EV-motor research. President Paul J. Mazerolle said the federal contribution will help advance homegrown innovation. “I am proud to see University of New Brunswick researchers leading work on EV technology and contributing their expertise to this complex, challenging topic. This support from the Government of Canada enables Dr. Clodualdo Aranas and his team to work on paving the way for a more sustainable, made-in-Canada transportation future.”

Rammed Earth House, a residential estate by London-based Tuckey Design Studio, combines renovated brick buildings with new rammed earth structures, harnessing the clay soil of the very land it sits on. “The material is already under your feet, and it doesn’t come with all the carbon baggage that other [building] materials come with,” says studio founder Jonathan Tuckey.

As a building technique, rammed earth—which combines clay soil with aggregate such as gravel into tightly compressed layers—traces back thousands of years. It was widely used in ancient China, but appears globally throughout history, including in the U.S. After the industrial revolution, and the innovations of steel, concrete, glass, and mass-produced bricks, the traditional method fell out of favor. Now, however, an increasing number of architects are looking to the material as a sustainable, place-rooted way to build amid a climate crisis that calls for dramatically reduced carbon emissions.

“It has this carbon credit locked into it—that’s a major head start against any other material,” says Tuckey. Because rammed earth doesn’t require high-temperature firing processes like bricks or concrete, and can use material from the building site itself (without need for transportation), its associated carbon emissions tend to be much lower.

It can also harness material that might otherwise go to waste. At Rammed Earth House, the client wanted some run-down buildings on site to be demolished—but rather than this rubble being wasted, Tuckey Design Studio used it as the aggregate for the rammed earth, recycling the old buildings into the new.

“It’s an entirely circular material,” says Tuckey of rammed earth. “If you ever wanted to demolish it, it would just go back into the ground. If you wanted to repair it, you can just pick up the clay from the ground and bash it in simply—it will be restored immediately.”

Architects also praise rammed earth’s high thermal mass—insulative properties that regulate a building’s indoor temperature. For U.S practice Lake Flato Architects, this was particularly helpful for a home in west Texas, Marfa Ranch.

In the desert environment, temperatures vary greatly; using rammed earth meant the dwelling “could be comfortable on the hottest days of the year, and also on the coldest,” says practice partner Bob Harris. The material also connected the building to its landscape, using locally sourced earth. “It felt really natural for us to build of that material,” says Harris.

The same was true for global practice Snøhetta, which is using rammed earth for the upcoming Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in North Dakota’s Badlands, integrating large internal walls made from the material. “We were looking to create a building that is of the place,” explains Aaron Dorf, director and architect at Snøhetta. The surrounding landscape is “defined by layers and layers of earth that you see—it’s profoundly beautiful.”

The material has a natural, textured and warm-hued appearance that can enhance an interior. “It’s a much more tactile public-facing material,” says Dorf. Tuckey describes it as looking like “some precious travertine stone.”

The expertise problem

The material does come with challenges, however—and resilience, labor, time, and location are primary issues.

“When you decide to use rammed earth, you come quite quickly to a fork in the road as to which route you’re going to go down, and they are fundamentally different materials,” says Tuckey. These two versions, “stabilized” and “unstabilized” rammed earth, demand different features and have variable ecological credentials.

Stabilized rammed earth has cement in the mix to make the material more robust and resilient, especially to water. Some sustainability experts have criticized this as having a similar negative ecological impact to concrete, which also uses cement (the carbon emissions from cement come during the heating of limestone to high temperatures).

Lake Flato and Snøhetta used stabilized rammed earth for durability, but the architects insist the proportion of cement used is very low. At Marfa Ranch, cement makes up approximately 6% of the material, explains Harris, which can be compared to an average of 10% to 15% in concrete.

Unstabilized rammed earth does not include any cement, thus eliminating those associated carbon emissions and becoming a circular material, but it subsequently requires techniques to prevent erosion when exposed to the elements.

Tuckey explains that using a base and topper of more waterproof material—in the case of Rammed Earth House, he used bricks—protects the rammed earth walls from water damage. Meanwhile, to protect from rain, he placed slim horizontal lines of trass lime rock that project away from the external surface, allowing rainwater to fall off.

“As long as you understand how the material is used, the challenges fall away,” Tuckey says. But it is this in-depth knowledge of building with rammed earth that can be hard to find. “It has become a lost form of construction,” says Tuckey, who collaborated with Martin Rauch, a rammed earth expert from Austria.

“Expertise is a challenge,” agrees Lake Flato partner Andrew Herdeg, who oversaw the practice’s Horizon House project in Nevada, which also used rammed earth. There, the architects brought in a consultant from northern California.

The process can be a slow one, too—especially for those new to the technique. The earth is compressed down within tightly confined formwork (wooden supporting structures that are removed at the end of the process); ramming it by hand is a “grueling process,” says Herdeg—though it is possible to use pneumatic tampers.

“It’s very labour intensive,” agrees Harris. “It takes quite a long time to construct [the] walls.” Because of that labour, he adds, “it can be costly.” The architects estimate that compared to concrete, there is a roughly 12% cost uplift when building with rammed earth.

Built for the right climate

Perhaps most important is to use rammed earth in the locations and climates that make most sense. “We wouldn’t want to drive earth around the country, just to use it for the sake of it,” says Tuckey, explaining that it’s best if the clay soil needed is found locally.

Lake Flato advocates it as “a dry climate response,” says Herdeg; best in a context where there’s low humidity and high diurnal swings. “It really excels in those environments.”

Snøhetta’s Dorf echoes the sentiment: “You have to build it in the right location. And I think forcing it into the wrong climate isn’t going to work very well.”

Still, the architects seem to believe that when those right conditions align and the challenges are navigated, rammed earth has a positive impact across multiple aspects. “We think of our work as a tool to connect people to place, to context, to the natural environment,” says Herdeg. For him, rammed earth can reflect “a literal mission of building responsibly,” but also a philosophical mission, encouraging others to care about that responsibility.

Lake Flato is currently planning an extension to Horizon House, and though contractors advocate poured concrete, Herdeg is keen to continue using rammed earth. “The reality is you can do just a coloured concrete wall and it looks quite similar to rammed earth and costs significantly less,” he says. “But at the end of the day, the carbon footprint of the concrete is significantly higher—and you don’t get that real material texture.”

Meanwhile, many are looking to intersect new technologies and engineering with the ancient building method to make it more practical or affordable to use. Tuckey cites one company that produces prefabricated timber frames infilled with rammed earth, and engineers in Australia recently developed modular blocks of rammed earth in cardboard cylinders.

Inspired by using the material for Rammed Earth House, Tuckey’s studio is now working on a project of terraced houses using prefabricated rammed earth blocks. The aim is to establish a factory near to the site in Gloucestershire, in southwest England, to make the prefabricated elements, using local construction waste as the aggregate in the rammed earth mixture.

The solar-powered charging station project class is an integral part of NEET’s decarbonization-focused Climate and Sustainability Systems (CSS) “thread,” one of four pathways of study offered by the program.
The project team included students majoring in chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, mechanical engineering, and nuclear science and engineering.

Positioned in a quiet campus courtyard, the station provides the MIT community with climate-friendly power for phones, laptops, and tablets.

Its installation marked the “first time a cross-departmental team of undergraduates designed, created, and installed on campus a green technology artifact for the public good, as part of a class they took for credit,” says Amitava “Babi” Mitra, NEET founding executive director.

The project was very on-brand for the NEET program, which centers interdisciplinary, cross-departmental, and project-centric scholarship with experiential learning at its core. Launched in 2017 as an effort to reimagine undergraduate engineering education at MIT, NEET seeks to empower students to tackle complex societal challenges that straddle disciplines.

The solar-powered charging station project class is an integral part of NEET’s decarbonization-focused Climate and Sustainability Systems (CSS) “thread,” one of four pathways of study offered by the program. The class, 22.03/3.0061 (Introduction to Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping), teaches the design and fabrication techniques used to create the station, such as laser cutting, 3D printing, computer-aided design (CAD), electronics prototyping, microcontroller programming, and composites manufacturing.

The project team included students majoring in chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, mechanical engineering, and nuclear science and engineering.

“What I really liked about this project was, at the beginning, it was really about ideation, about design, about brainstorming in ways that I haven’t seen before,” says NEET CSS student Aaron De Leon, a nuclear science and engineering major focused on clean energy development.

During these brainstorming sessions, the team considered how their subjective design choices for the charging station would shape user experience, something De Leon, who enrolled in the class as a sophomore, says is often overlooked in engineering classes.

The team’s forest-inspired station design — complete with “tree trunks,” oyster mushroom-shaped desk space, and four solar panels curved to mimic the undulation of the forest canopy — was intended to evoke a sense of organic connectivity. The tree trunks were crafted from novel flax fiber-based composite layups the team developed through experiments designed to identify more sustainable alternatives to traditional composites.

The group also discussed how a dearth of device charging options made it difficult for students to work outside, according to NEET CSS student Celestina Pint, who enrolled in the class as a sophomore. The desk space was added to help MIT students work comfortably outdoors while also charging their devices with renewable energy.

Pint joined NEET because she wanted to “keep an open approach to climate and sustainability,” as opposed to relying on her materials science and engineering major alone, she says. “I like the interdisciplinary aspect.”

The project class presented abundant interdisciplinary learning opportunities that couldn’t be replicated in a purely theory-based curriculum, says Nathan Melenbrink, NEET lecturer, who teaches the project class and is the lead instructor for the NEET CSS thread.

For example, the team got a crash course in navigating real-world bureaucracy when they discovered that the installation of their charging station had to be approved by more than a dozen entities, including campus police, MIT’s insurance provider, and the campus facilities department.

The team also gained valuable experience with troubleshooting unanticipated design implementation challenges during the project’s fabrication phase.

“Adjustments had to be made,” Pint says. Once the station was installed, “it was interesting to see what was the same and what was different” from the team’s initial design.

This underscores a unique value of the project, according to NEET CSS student Tyler Ea, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major who joined the project team last year and is now a teaching assistant for the class.

Students “are able to take ownership of something physical, like a physical embodiment of their ideas, and something that they can point towards and say, ‘here’s something that I thought about, and this is how I went about building it, and then here’s the final result,’” he says.

While students only become eligible to join NEET in their second year, first-year students interested in the program were also able to learn from the solar-powered charging station project in the first-year discovery class SP.248 (The NEET Experience). After learning fundamental concepts in systems engineering, the class analyzed the station and suggested changes they thought would improve its design.

Melenbrink says student-built campus installations were once a hallmark of MIT’s academic culture, and he sees the NEET CSS solar-powered charging station project as an opportunity to help revive this tradition.

“What I hear from the old guard is that there was always somebody … lugging some giant, odd-looking prototype of something across campus,” Melenbrink says.

More collaborative, hands-on, student-led climate projects would also help the Institute meet its commitment to become a leading source of meaningful climate solutions, according to Elsa Olivetti, the Jerry McAfee (1940) Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and strategic advisor to the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium (MCSC).

“This local renewable energy project demonstrates that our campus community can learn through solution development,” she says. “Students don’t have to wait until they graduate or enter the job market to make a contribution.”

Students enrolled in this year’s Introduction to Design Thinking and Rapid Prototyping class will fabricate and install a new solar-powered charging station with a unique design. De Leon says he appreciates the latitude NEET students have to make the project their own.

“There was never the case of a professor saying, ‘We need to do it this way,’” he says. “I really liked that ability to learn as many things as you wanted to, and also have the autonomy to make your own design decisions along the way.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202511/mit-NEET-students-installing-solar-station.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 20:02:07.412917

But as the industry cools, Morgan Stanley (MS) now warns that those flames are flickering into an “EV winter.” The bank anticipates U.S. EV demand slipping hard in 2026, with volumes dropping by double digits and consumers squeezed by affordability, credit tightening, and tariff-driven costs.

In that chilly backdrop, analyst Andrew Percoco has downgraded Lucid to “Underweight,” slashing its target price to $10. Lucid’s premium shine and battery tech still stand out, but the road ahead is steep as dilution risks loom, profitability sits far on the horizon, and its next major platform won’t ramp until 2027. The once-hot stock now faces a long, cold climb.

Let’s take a closer look.

About Lucid Motors Stock

Headquartered in Newark, California, Lucid Group is a Silicon Valley-born innovator redefining electric mobility. With the record-setting Lucid Air and Gravity SUV, the company blends cutting-edge tech, sleek design, and efficiency. Assembled in its advanced Arizona facility, Lucid is pushing the EV frontier for performance, sustainability, and global impact. Its market capitalization currently stands at $4.1 billion.

LCID stock has shed nearly 82.7% in three years, and 2025 alone has carved out another 58.36% year-to-date (YTD) drop. Volume has thinned on rallies and picked up on selloffs, signaling traders still lean toward caution. The 14-day RSI has been steadily drifting lower, now sitting at 36 and signaling continued weakness in buying momentum.

But the recent shift is interesting. The MACD oscillator just flashed a subtle change in tone, with the yellow MACD line crossing above the blue signal line, and the histogram turning positive. That usually indicates early bullish momentum or at least the slowing of downside pressure.

Lucid’s shares may be drowning in red this year, but its valuation sits in a curious middle ground, priced at 3.16 times sales, richer than its peers yet cheaper than its own historical average. It is a tightrope valuation, balancing between fading hype and hidden potential, offering investors both caution and a whisper of comeback possibility.

A Closer Look at Lucid’s Q3 Results

Lucid’s Q3 earnings report landed on Nov. 5, with revenue of $336.6 million, a striking 68% year-over-year (YOY) jump and a signal that demand for its sleek, premium EVs is not evaporating. Yet beneath that headline sat a harsher truth – a per-share loss of $3.31. Though narrower than last year’s $4.10 loss, it was still far wider than Wall Street hoped, reminding investors that Lucid’s march toward profitability remains a long, uphill ascent. Plus, adjusted loss per share shrank by 4% annually to $2.65.

Costs continued to overpower gains. Lucid’s cost of revenue nearly doubled its revenue, resulting in a gross loss margin hovering near 100%. Adding in operating expenses, Lucid sank into a $942 million operating loss for the quarter, pushing nine-month operating losses beyond $2.4 billion.

Still, the company is not running on fumes. Lucid ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in liquidity, including a substantial undrawn credit line, and cash levels were steady at $1.6 billion. Management asserts that this war chest carries the company into the first half of 2027, buying time as it scales.

And scale, at least on the delivery front, is happening. Lucid notched its seventh straight quarter of record deliveries, handing over 4,078 vehicles, up 47% YOY. Production hit 3,891 units, an impressive 116% leap from last year.

Yet optimism was tempered by a second consecutive trim to annual production guidance, now narrowed to roughly 18,000 units. Capital expenditure guidance also eased slightly, with the low end reduced by $100 million.

Beyond the numbers, Lucid is shoring up its strategic foundations. The company secured an expansion of its delayed-draw term loan facility, boosted from $750 million to nearly $2 billion, from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, reaffirming deep-pocketed backing when it’s most needed. Lucid also welcomed a $300 million strategic investment from Uber (UBER), a partnership that tightens alignment in the premium EV and autonomous mobility world.

Operational momentum continues as well. Lucid delivered its first vehicles to Nuro’s robotaxi engineering fleet, laying groundwork for a 2026 autonomous rollout in San Francisco. Organizational changes were also announced to accelerate global expansion and sharpen execution.

Analysts tracking Lucid are optimistic, estimating fiscal 2025 losses to shrink by 24.9% YOY to $9.39 per share and further narrow by 22.7% to $7.26 per share.

What Do Analysts Expect for Lucid Stock?

Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Percoco is warning that the once-surging EV wave is slowing into a deep, uncomfortably cold “EV winter” in 2026, with light-vehicle sales expected to slip to 15.9 million units and EV volumes dropping nearly 20%. Battery-electric penetration, once climbing steadily, is now seen retreating to 6.5%.

He argues that consumers will face a triple squeeze, affordability challenges, tighter underwriting, and tariff-driven inflation. Hybrids and combustion models may get a slight lift, and pent-up replacement demand might soften the blow, but policy uncertainty and technology-driven adoption curves keep the outlook unusually wide.

Within that cooling backdrop, Percoco’s view on Lucid grows even more cautious. He downgrades the stock to “Underweight” from “Equal Weight” and cuts the target price to $10, marking a potential all-time low. Despite Lucid’s premium positioning offering some insulation from the loss of EV tax credits, the company remains heavily exposed to the sharp EV demand downturn.

The deeper concerns center on timing, scale, and capital. Lucid’s midsize, more affordable platform won’t begin production until late 2026 and won’t ramp until 2027, delaying its path to profitability. Percoco does not expect gross profitability until 2028, with losses persisting until 2031. Meanwhile, he flags significant dilution risk, estimating Lucid will need roughly $2 billion in equity by late 2026 relative to its $4.6 billion market cap.

Analysts are playing it safe with LCID, giving a consensus rating of “Hold.” Out of 12 analysts covering the stock, just one suggests a “Strong Buy,” eight recommend a “Hold,” one advises a “Moderate Sell,” and the remaining two analysts give a “Strong Sell” rating.

Still, there’s room to accelerate. The mean price target of $19.02 suggests the stock could surge by 51.9% from the current price levels. The Street-high target of $30 represents potential upside of 139.4%.",https://media.barchart.com/contributors-admin/common-images/images/Energy/Green%20Energy%20(EV%2C%20solar%2C%20etc.)/A%20Lucid%20Motors%20vehicle%20parked%20in%20front%20of%20a%20showroom_%20Image%20by%20Michael%20Berlfein%20via%20Shutterstock_.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 18:59:20.743102

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”

Texas A&M Forest Service recently conducted an economic study which revealed the Texas Christmas tree industry generated total economic contribution of $812.7 million, including direct, indirect and induced effects, while supporting 6,217 jobs in 2024.

“Real Christmas trees hold cultural, environmental and economic significance, but the scope of this study was focused specifically on the economic contribution of the real Christmas tree industry,” said Xufang Zhang, Ph.D., Texas A&M Forest Service Forest Resource Analyst.

Of the $812.7 million in total contributions, the Texas Christmas tree industry had a direct economic contribution of $430.0 million, employing 4,228 people with a payroll of $278.6 million.

The industry also contributed $2.2 million in county taxes, $13.4 million in state taxes and $82.8 million in federal taxes, totaling a tax revenue of $98.4 million.

Texas Christmas tree farms

Since the 2023 report, direct contributions to the economy have increased by over $32.8 million, an increase not possible without sustainable practices and a continued increase in land use for Christmas trees.

According to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, Christmas tree production acreage in Texas has increased substantially from 945 acres in 2017 to 3,565 acres in 2022.

“The increase in land area used for Christmas tree production and the increasing number of choose-and-cut farms highlights the industry’s potential for continued economic contribution,” said Zhang. “These findings underscore the importance of sustainable industry practices, investment in local production and policies that strengthen rural economies.”

According to the National Christmas Tree Association, the most popular Christmas tree species include Fraser fir, Noble fir, Douglas fir, Balsam fir, Scots pine, Virginia pine and White pine. For every Christmas tree harvested, one to three seedlings are planted the next year. The average Christmas tree takes about seven years to reach maturity.

Benefits of real Christmas trees

There are many benefits of purchasing a real Christmas tree over an artificial one that go beyond helping the Texas economy.

Artificial Christmas trees are a petroleum-based product, containing plastics that are not biodegradable and may contain metal toxins such as lead which create a long-term environmental burden upon their disposal.

Like any other tree though, Christmas trees growing on tree farms reduce soil erosion, improve water quality, provide habitat for wildlife, create scenic beauty and recreational opportunities, sequester carbon, emit oxygen and are renewable and compostable.",https://tfsweb.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ChristmasTrees_feature.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 18:59:47.345216

This is a hard moment for our country, and we're up against a lot.

But, despite it all, we also won some major victories to protect our future -- and they are worth celebrating!

Together, we protected public lands, held polluters accountable, expanded clean energy, defended our communities, and grew our movement into a force powerful enough to meet this moment.

As the oldest grassroots environmental organization in the country, the Sierra Club has spent more than 130 years fighting for clean air, safe water, thriving wildlife, and a livable climate -- all of which are only possible due to the support of members and advocates like you.

1. We stopped millions of acres of public land from being sold off in the disastrous budget bill.

Public lands are one of our country's best ideas, but they're under attack like never before. We helped stop one of the largest attempted public-lands sell-offs in U.S. history. After overwhelming public backlash and pressure from Sierra Club advocates, Congress withdrew a proposal that would have put millions of acres on the auction block.

2. We made polluters pay by passing the game-changing ""Climate Change Superfund Act"" in New York and introduced legislation in five states.

Coal, oil, and gas companies knew decades ago that fossil fuels would poison our communities and the planet, but they lied to protect their profits and passed the costs onto us. But not anymore -- it's time to make polluters pay! New York passed a landmark Climate Change Superfund Act following Vermont's legislation that passed in 2024. More bills have been introduced in California, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Maine. These victories mark a decisive shift toward accountability, justice, and community-driven climate action.

3. We safeguarded endangered species and wildlife like gray wolves, Colorado bison, and Rice's whales.

We celebrated major wildlife wins! Thanks to legal action by the Sierra Club and partners, Northern Rockies wolves are one step closer to Endangered Species Act protections after a federal judge found the Trump administration's denial unlawful. Colorado passed a groundbreaking bill recognizing bison as wildlife, ensuring herds can finally return to their historic range. In the Gulf, we stopped an offshore oil lease that posed severe risks to the fewer than 50 remaining Rice's whales. Together, we're restoring ecosystems and protecting species on the brink.

4. We secured energy affordability in Utah, Colorado, and California amid skyrocketing utility prices.

With utility bills soaring to higher and higher levels, we secured relief across the West. In Utah, we helped block Rocky Mountain Power's attempt to raise bills by more than 18 percent, protecting families from rising bills tied to fossil-fuel investments. Colorado adopted ambitious clean-heat targets that will cut pollution, deliver billions in climate and health benefits, and lower energy costs. And in California, cities are adopting forward-looking building codes that replace outdated AC units with efficient heat pumps, helping residents save money while cutting climate pollution.

5. We helped ensure that coal stays where it belongs -- in the ground -- in New England and Ohio.

Since its launch, the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign has successfully prevented one million asthma attacks and saved over 60,000 lives by retiring toxic coal plants. This year, we made even more progress. New England's final coal plant, Merrimack Station, officially shut down -- eliminating a massive source of air pollution and opening the door to clean energy. And in Ohio, we helped pass bipartisan legislation to repeal a massive ratepayer-funded coal plant bailout that would have cost residents nearly half a billion dollars. Together, these milestones move us closer to a cleaner, healthier, coal-free future.

6. We helped prevent the illegal firings of park and forest service staff.

We took DOGE to court to halt the unlawful mass firings of park and forest staff -- cuts that threatened visitor safety, wildlife, and wildfire prevention. Together with civil rights and science organizations, we organized protests with thousands of advocates and took legal action that halted Trump and DOGE's unlawful mass firings of National Park Service and Forest Service employees. By stepping in quickly, we defended the workers who maintain our parks, supported wildfire prevention, and kept our public lands accessible to all.

7. We won bold electoral victories in November's election.

In November's election, voters across the country delivered a powerful message: Our communities will fight back against attacks on our democracy and are tired of an economy that only works for corporations and billionaires. Voters showed up to demand fair energy prices, accountability, and a clean energy economy with major electoral victories in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia, Pennsylvania, California, Mississippi, Massachusetts, and more. Read the complete list here.

8. We grew our movement by the millions with a groundswell of participation in protests across the country.

Amid an increasingly hostile political climate, our movement didn't just grow -- it surged. National days of action like the Hands Off and No Kings protests drew massive participation. Attendance in mobilization events jumped from 3 million to 5 million to 7 million people in just six months. With more events in more and more towns, including places long considered ""Trump country,"" these record-breaking numbers show that our resistance is larger, more unified, and more determined than at any time in recent history.

9. We joined a coalition effort to generate 500,000 comments to protect national forests by defending the Roadless Rule

We delivered a powerful message: People across the country overwhelmingly support safeguarding our forests from logging, drilling, and development -- with over 40,000 Sierra Club advocates adding their voices to our broader coalition’s half a million comments. In the face of a rushed and limited public comment window, we stood up for clean water, wildlife habitat, and wilderness to keep 60 million acres of roadless forestlands intact for generations to come.

10. We won a lawsuit to block Commonwealth LNG, a dirty fracked-methane export terminal that would have emitted pollution equivalent to 16 coal-fired power plants.

A Louisiana court terminated the project's coastal use permit, ruling that state officials violated the Louisiana Constitution by failing to consider the project's disproportionate impact on nearby communities of color and low-income residents, as well as its destruction of wetlands and its contribution to climate pollution. This decision protects our environment, upholds community rights, and halts construction unless a lawful permit is issued.

11. We protected parks in Florida and Los Angeles and passed transit-to-trails legislation in Nevada and Illinois.

Grassroots advocates stopped a plan to sell Florida's 175 state parks to the highest bidder and turn them into private hotels, golf courses, and other forms of development. In Los Angeles County, long-term advocacy expanded local park access and launched new momentum to secure more green space in low-income communities. And Transit to Trails bills in Nevada and Illinois bring the states closer to ensuring everyone can enjoy outdoor activities without needing a car. Across the country, we're winning lasting land protections and increasing outdoor access for all.

12. We protected clean transportation by taking Trump to court.

Our lawsuit helped prompt a restart of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, unlocking $2.7 billion for essential EV charging infrastructure nationwide along highways. Now, every state has submitted NEVI plans under new guidance, and all are moving forward. This was a decisive legal victory for equity, pollution reduction, and climate resilience, restoring essential projects that communities have been waiting for. This program restart is the direct result of the litigation brought by the Sierra Club, our partners, and over a dozen states.

13. We won two lawsuits to create guardrails on data centers.

By securing major victories in Kansas and Michigan, we helped establish key protections to ensure data centers cover their true costs. The two lawsuits create guardrails against the unchecked growth of data centers, prevent shifting their costs onto ratepayers, and prevent higher utility bills for families. These rulings also require meaningful analysis of energy, water, and grid impacts to set a critical precedent for communities facing rapid data-center expansion.

14. We passed bold policies to increase renewable energy in Louisiana.

In a historic win for climate accountability, community members secured a $744 million jury verdict against Chevron, holding the company responsible for decades of pollution and coastal destruction. This victory advances funding for coastal restoration, reinforces our shift toward a cleaner, renewable energy future, and shows that communities can take on the oil and gas industry to demand accountability and win.

15. We helped advance climate-aligned investing in Oregon, New York City, Vermont, and beyond.

Oregon passed a landmark law backing climate-aligned pension management. New York City’s pensions adopted strong climate criteria to hold their asset managers accountable. And Vermont's pension strengthened its shareholder voting policies to push for climate action and curb harmful corporate behavior. States and cities are taking meaningful steps to protect workers' retirement savings and align public investments with a safer, more sustainable future.

16. We ensured increased nature access for veterans and youth by helping pass the EXPLORE Act.

Signed into law with unanimous bipartisan support, the EXPLORE Act expands equitable outdoor access nationwide -- funding new green spaces in underserved communities, strengthening outdoor recreation opportunities for veterans and servicemembers, guaranteeing free park access for every fourth grader and their family, and streamlining access for outdoor educators and nonprofits. This win means more communities can experience the healing power of our shared public lands and waters.

17. We helped Utah become the first state to legalize balcony solar, enabling people living in apartments to access affordable, clean, and healthy energy.

The new law in Utah allows small plug-in solar systems without utility approval, giving renters a simple, low-cost way to reduce reliance on the grid. This breakthrough is already inspiring similar legislation across the country and expanding solar to the people who need it most. In the face of skyrocketing energy costs nationwide, this win positions balcony solar as a growing solution for energy affordability and clean-energy access.

18. Sierra magazine won a 2025 CCNow Journalism Award for the article ""The Past, Present, and Contested Future of LNG Terminals Along the Gulf Coast.""

Written by Delaney Nolan, the Sierra article exposed how LNG export terminals have devastated communities in Texas and Louisiana -- and highlights the residents fighting back. This recognition from Covering Climate Now underscores the power of truth-telling in the climate movement.

19. We raised awareness to stop the disastrous Line 5 pipeline by setting the new World Record for the largest number of origami fish.

Thousands of people from across all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and more joined to send in more than 86,000 paper fish to break the world record. This origami art symbolizes our collective commitment to protecting the Great Lakes, honoring tribal sovereignty, and shutting down Enbridge’s Line 5 pipeline, which threatens our shared water, wildlife, and our future. This creative action is helping build the public pressure needed to decommission Line 5 once and for all.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-12/untitled-design-21.png.webp?itok=7O1pqhhh,N,,2025-12-09 20:02:45.673885

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump‘s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this [ruling] as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/12/Wind-Energy.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 22:58:48.391505

The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.","South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.

Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.

“Our customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It’s time they get some value out of that,” Staton said.

Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

President Donald Trump's administration wants the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years.

But watchdog groups said there are too many hurdles to put this project in the win column right now.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

Also, the type of reactors proposed have seen massive cost overruns even when successfully built. Brookfield took over the assets of Westinghouse Electric Co., which had to declare bankruptcy because of difficulties building them.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/52b4d36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+248/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F54%2F02%2F16300011466aa637b6eb59e6d2b0%2Fap25343597404158.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 18:59:53.695418

On day one of his second term President Donald Trump issued an executive order that froze permitting for offshore wind and asked for a federal review of the process. That order was challenged in court by seventeen states, including Maine, and Washington, D.C.

The states argued they would be harmed by the pause because of the investments their governments had already made into wind developments and the potential to jeopardize future energy supply.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the Massachusetts U.S. District Court said the states provided “ample evidence” showing that they would face negative consequences from the executive order..

In a statement Tuesday, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said he was grateful the court agreed that the Trump administration overstepped with the executive order.

“Whatever the federal administration’s position is on wind power, it does not have the right to arbitrarily ban development of this sustainable energy resource,” Frey said, adding that he and other attorneys general will continue to work to hold the federal government accountable.

Developing offshore wind as a power source has been at the crux of Maine’s clean energy and climate goals, though that planning has had several fits and starts.

In 2010, the state worked on a $120 million offshore wind pilot project that never came to fruition. But a decade later, Gov. Janet Mills signed a law that not only pumped new life into the effort, but did so with high labor and environmental standards, which she said would create quality jobs while building the infrastructure to produce three gigawatts of low emission energy — enough to power between 675,000 and 900,000 homes — by the end of 2040.

Last year, the state announced its preference to build a new port on Sears Island to support the budding industry, and the Maine Legislature took efforts to protect those plans. Under the Biden administration, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency within the U.S. Department of Interior responsible for managing energy resources on the outer shelf, outlined eight lease areas off the coast of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire for wind development.

But following Trump’s executive order, one of the project’s key developers paused talks in April, citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape.”

Republican legislators have thanked Trump for the executive order freezing permitting and asked him to go a step further to revoke existing leases and permits in the Gulf of Maine.

They argue offshore wind would put Maine’s fishing industry at risk. However, the lease areas avoid the vital fishing area known as Lobster Management Area 1, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden introduced legislation to codify those protections into federal law.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1407548865-2048x1349-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 18:59:23.487069

Gonzales,,,,,https://rollcall.com/2025/12/09/house-race-ratings-midterm-elections/,"The Dec. 2 special election had been rated Lean Republican, but now-Rep. Matt Van Epps’ 9-point victory is comfortable enough to warrant a Solid Republican race rating for the regularly scheduled election next year.

Two more Republican-held seats were added to the House battleground in the latest round of rating changes, moving from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.
The rating in all three races shifted from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic.
A handful of races have dropped off of the House battlefield altogether, with the rating shifting from Likely Democratic to Solid Democratic.","ANALYSIS — Despite a recent setback by the U.S. Supreme Court’s upholding of the new Republican-drawn map in Texas, the House majority remains within reach for Democrats.

From historical midterm trends that favor the party out of power to President Donald Trump’s mediocre job-approval rating to consistent Democratic overperformances in this year’s special and regular general elections, the current national political environment favors Democrats. And heading into the 2026 midterm elections, it’s clear the terrain is shifting toward the party at the district level as well.

As a result, Inside Elections has changed the ratings in 16 House races toward Democrats.

In the race for Tennessee’s 7th District, the rating got better for Republicans. The Dec. 2 special election had been rated Lean Republican, but now-Rep. Matt Van Epps’ 9-point victory is comfortable enough to warrant a Solid Republican race rating for the regularly scheduled election next year.

Still, the outcome was mixed news for the GOP as Democrats overperformed once again — in line with other elections this year — demonstrating a shift in the House battlefield.

Having to spend a few million dollars defending a district where Trump finished ahead of Kamala Harris by 22 points is just the latest piece of evidence that Republicans could have trouble defending seats carried by the Democratic presidential nominee last year, including Nebraska’s 2nd (which Harris won by 5 points). With GOP Rep. Don Bacon retiring, Democrats have a better shot this cycle at flipping this Omaha-area district.

Another is California’s redrawn 48th, which includes parts of San Diego and Riverside counties, and would have backed Harris by 3 points. It’s one of the most evenly divided in the country (D+0.1), according to Inside Elections’ Baseline metric, which captures a seat’s political performance by combining all federal and state election results over the past four election cycles into a single score. But Republican incumbent Darrell Issa’s private consideration to move halfway across the country to run in Texas is an indication of how confident he feels about running in the 48th next year.

Inside Elections shifted the rating in both races from Toss-up to Tilt Democratic.

Another trio of GOP-held seats moved from Likely Republican to Lean Republican.

Republican Rep. Bill Huizenga hasn’t officially announced whether he’ll run again, but southwest Michigan’s 4th District, which Trump carried by 6 points in 2024 and 4 points in 2020, is the type of seat that is likely to get more competitive as the cycle goes on.

GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is a proven winner in Southeast Pennsylvania’s 1st District. But Joe Biden finished ahead of Trump by 5 points here in 2020, and Fitzpatrick won reelection by just 2 points against a mediocre challenger in 2018, Trump’s first midterm.

Virginia’s 1st District went from a Trump +5 seat in 2024 (an improvement from four years earlier) to one Democrat Abigail Spanberger carried by 3 points in last month’s race for governor. It could also get redrawn by commonwealth Democrats next year to become bluer, so Republican incumbent Rob Wittman remains vulnerable.

Two more Republican-held seats were added to the House battleground in the latest round of rating changes, moving from Solid Republican to Likely Republican.

Trump finished ahead of Harris by a considerable 13 points in Florida’s 7th District, but Rep. Cory Mills has a growing list of legal and ethical problems that make the seat uniquely vulnerable. And in Tennessee’s 5th District, which is less Republican than the neighboring 7th, Democrats have a candidate with a more moderate reputation, and GOP incumbent Andy Ogles is apparently choosing to not raise much money ahead of a likely competitive race.

On the other side of the ledger, more than a handful of Democratic-held seats are looking increasingly out of reach for Republicans in the face of the national environment and some recruiting challenges.

The GOP hasn’t given up on central Michigan’s 8th District. But the race rating shifted from Tilt Democratic to Lean Democratic as Republicans work to bolster their challenger while admitting that Democratic freshman Kristen McDonald Rivet is a formidable foe, despite her brief time on Capitol Hill.

Another trio of races for Democratic-held seats have fallen out of the top rating tiers and the general conversation about competitive seats: Minnesota’s 2nd, where Rep. Angie Craig is running for the Senate; Nevada’s 4th, held by fifth-term Rep. Steven Horsford; and Ohio’s 13th. Republicans don’t even have a serious candidate in the latter contest after their 2024 nominee dropped out when the district unexpectedly got better for Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes under a new congressional map. The rating in all three races shifted from Lean Democratic to Likely Democratic.

A handful of races have dropped off of the House battlefield altogether, with the rating shifting from Likely Democratic to Solid Democratic.

While Republicans have no love for Democratic Rep. Eric Sorensen in northwest Illinois’ 17th District, they just don’t seem to have a clear plan to beat him in 2026. The party is also struggling to find credible challengers against Reps. Hillary Scholten (Michigan’s 3rd), Pat Ryan (New York’s 18th), John Mannion (New York’s 22nd) and Janelle Bynum (Oregon’s 5th).

Even with the latest rating changes, the fight for the House continues to look close on paper. Republicans have the advantage in 213 races (rated Solid, Likely, Lean or Tilt), while Democrats hold the edge in 212 contests. Remember, 218 is the magic number for a majority. There are 10 Toss-up races — eight seats currently held by Republicans and just two by Democrats.

But as election results align with historical trends, and the calendar creeps closer to Election Day, the House landscape is likely to skew toward Democrats.

If Trump can improve his job-approval ratings and there’s growing optimism about the direction of the country and strength of the economy, Republicans can regain some momentum in their quest to maintain House control.

For now, though, it looks like we’re headed for a traditional midterm in which the president’s party loses seats.

In September, the Trump Administration filed a lawsuit seeking to revoke the Maryland Offshore Wind Project’s permit.
Prior to Donald Trump’s assault on wind energy, the industry was one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country.
Because of the administration’s attacks on wind, at least 17,000 jobs are in jeopardy in the offshore wind industry alone.
“This ruling reopens the path for Maryland’s first offshore wind project to start powering homes as soon as possible.","BALTIMORE, MD. – Last night, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that Donald Trump’s executive order banning wind projects in the United States was unlawful and vacated the order.

Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his administration that paused all leasing, permitting, and approvals for wind projects, killing tens of thousands of jobs across the country. Since then, the administration has rescinded permits for offshore wind projects, halted projects that were 80 percent completed, and gutted tax credits allocated for wind energy projects—all to weaken the rapidly growing wind energy industry.

In September, the Trump Administration filed a lawsuit seeking to revoke the Maryland Offshore Wind Project’s permit. But last week, a federal judge in Maryland ruled against Trump’s action to remand US Wind’s permits. If completed, Maryland’s offshore wind project has the potential to power 718,000 homes and create 2,680 new, stable, well-paying jobs. The project is set to begin construction in 2026.

Prior to Donald Trump’s assault on wind energy, the industry was one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country. At the end of 2024, the wind sector employed nearly 150,000 Americans. Because of the administration’s attacks on wind, at least 17,000 jobs are in jeopardy in the offshore wind industry alone.

In May, the Sierra Club joined nine other environmental groups in an amicus brief arguing that “the administration's ‘Wind Directive’ is arbitrary and not based in science, lacks a clear purpose or timeline, and jeopardizes climate goals and public health.”

“We are glad to see federal judges agreeing that the Trump administration overreached in its attacks on offshore wind,” said Matt Sehrswenney, Climate Campaign Representative for the Sierra Club Maryland Chapter. “This ruling reopens the path for Maryland’s first offshore wind project to start powering homes as soon as possible. Offshore wind is among our state’s best options for reliable, homegrown energy that can lower electricity bills and reduce harmful fossil fuel pollution.""",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-09 21:59:28.127117

Under Ramirez’s guidance, his team developed a heat-sink design that could be manufactured using standard methods, building on a high-performance 3D-printed version created earlier for the COOLERCHIPS project.
“Seeing in real time how fast the field is developing—AI, cooling, data centers—it’s something that will only keep growing.
“They taught me to think critically, persevere through trial and error and step confidently into leadership roles I never imagined,” Ramirez said.","When Jachin Ramirez started at The University of Texas at Arlington during the COVID-19 pandemic, he never imagined he’d help develop next-generation data-center technology for a major Department of Energy initiative—and join a research team gaining national attention.

Set to graduate Friday at Globe Life Field, Ramirez is at the forefront of a global technological challenge: developing energy-efficient cooling systems for massive AI data centers that are rapidly multiplying and taxing local water and power supplies.

“Looking back now, it still feels surreal,” Ramirez said. “If the stars ever aligned once in my life, this is definitely it.”

During his senior year, Ramirez led an undergraduate team contributing to UTA’s work on the U.S. Department of Energy’s ARPA-E COOLERCHIPS program, a major effort to reduce data-center cooling energy to less than 5% of the IT load.

Currently, cooling systems can consume up to 40% of a data center’s total energy, putting increasing strain on water and electricity resources as new facilities are built. UTA’s COOLERCHIPS project, led by Presidential Distinguished Professor Dereje Agonafer, partners with Austin-based Accelcius, which provides the two-phase, direct-to-chip liquid cooling technology that makes such reductions possible.

Under Ramirez’s guidance, his team developed a heat-sink design that could be manufactured using standard methods, building on a high-performance 3D-printed version created earlier for the COOLERCHIPS project. Their goal was to make a design that was easier and cheaper to mass-produce while still boosting cooling performance.

Their work resulted in Ramirez and his team winning the Nasser Grayeli Best Poster Award at the 2025 ASME InterPACK Conference in Anaheim, California, an international gathering of researchers and industry experts in electronics packaging. There, Ramirez saw firsthand how rapidly data center technology is advancing. He valued the chance to collaborate closely with Dr. Agonafer’s team.

“We had a front-row seat to all this development that was happening in real time,” he said. “It honestly feels like a sort of industrial revolution, a once-in-a-generation kind of event.”

But more importantly, the work gave Agonafer and his COOLERCHIPS project a pathway to a heat-sink design that could be mass-manufactured.

“They were working with the same design constraints we did,” said Braxton Smith, Ramirez’s graduate mentor. “Their prototype showed far improved performance over current commercial offerings, opening a pathway to next-generation, higher-power memory modules.”

Ramirez, who grew up in Arlington and was homeschooled before coming to UTA, said he never imagined working on such an impactful project as an undergraduate.

“Seeing in real time how fast the field is developing—AI, cooling, data centers—it’s something that will only keep growing. Being part of the early work is pretty surreal,” he said.

He credits UTA faculty with guiding him throughout his time at the University.

“They taught me to think critically, persevere through trial and error and step confidently into leadership roles I never imagined,” Ramirez said. “They taught me that every mistake is also a discovery. They helped me realize that I could actually do this.”

As he prepares to begin his master’s degree at UTA and continue working in data-center cooling research, Ramirez sees this moment as the culmination of five years of academic, personal and professional growth.

“This project showed me what I’m capable of,” he said. “UTA gave me the chance to learn, to lead and to be part of something bigger than myself. I’m really grateful for that.”",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/df97395d-91b2-4401-b54e-6fe9a2b8e732/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-12-09 23:57:37.588159

New bills aim to modernize it with reforms aligned to today’s economic, environmental, and scientific realities.

The Clean Air Act (CAA) is now 55 years old—and shows its age. That’s not a critique of its legacy. The law, in conjunction with innovation and private investment in environmental improvement, has contributed to significant improvements in air quality, public health, and environmental protection. But its regulatory framework still operates like it’s 1970, often resulting in costly, inefficient regulations that stifle economic growth for little environmental gain. It’s time to modernize the Clean Air Act—not to abandon its ambitions but to upgrade its approach.

A Track Record Worth Celebrating

Americans today breathe far cleaner air than in the 1970s. National parks have clearer vistas. Acid-rain damage has declined. These environmental triumphs helped improve, save, and support economic growth.

When it comes to environmental quality, the data speak for themselves. The Yale Environmental Performance Index ranksthe United States among the top global leaders in air quality. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), between 1970 and 2020, US emissions of the six major “criteria” pollutants—carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, coarse and fine particulate matter, lead, and ozone precursors—dropped by 78 percent even as the economy, population, and energy use all grew.

Ambient air concentrations also fell dramatically. From 1980 to recent years, EPA data show carbon monoxide concentrations down ~73 percent, nitrogen dioxide (annual standard) down ~61 percent, ozone down ~25 percent, and sulfur dioxide one-hour standard down ~91 percent. For lead, concentrations fell by ~86 percent between 1980 and 2005.

The World Changed, But the Clean Air Act Hasn’t Much

Despite these successes, the regulatory machinery behind the Clean Air Act has often failed to evolve. The federal agency charged with implementing it—the EPA—continues to treat air pollution as though we still lived in an era dominated by coal-smoke chimneys, massive sulfur stacks, and heavy-duty industrial smokestacks.

That 1970s-style toolbox is now mismatched to a cleaner, modernized, and more innovative 21st-century economy. Compliance costs under CAA regulations have ballooned—sometimes with only marginal environmental or public-health gains to show.

Meanwhile, the EPA’s regulatory reach has expanded far beyond what most Americans traditionally think of as “air quality.” Through sweeping rules on greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy standards, the agency imposes regulations that reshape entire sectors of the economy—with little regard for costs, economic trade-offs, or whether they make air cleaner in meaningful, localized ways.

Adding insult to injury is the fact that different administrations ratchet up or down these regulations every four or eight years, not to mention the time and money spent in the courts. The regulatory whipsawing stymies investment, creates uncertainty, and fails to deliver meaningful improvements to the environment.

What Modernization of the Clean Air Act Should Look Like

Serious proposals are on the table for updating how America regulates air quality. In March, the Competitive Enterprise Institute released a report detailing how to modernize air quality regulations. The report offers guardrails to prevent and reign in regulatory overreach, including: explicitly limiting the agency’s power to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions under the CAA; abolishing technological “one-size-fits-all” mandates; clarifying that EPA cannot impose highly aggressive emissions standards without robust and transparent cost-benefit analysis; and giving more flexibility to states, communities, and local authorities to craft air-quality solutions tailored to their particular circumstances.

House Republicans are also thinking seriously about reform. On December 5, the Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee introduced four bills to update the Clean Air Act. The bills include:

The Reducing and Eliminating Duplicative Environmental Regulations (RED Tape) Act, which ends unnecessary “second-review” obligations by the EPA under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when another agency has already completed an environmental impact statement, thereby cutting redundant reviews and speeding up project approvals.

The Foreign Emissions and Nonattainment Clarification for Economic Stability (FENCES) Act, which states that emissions originating outside the United States (e.g., from wildfires, international pollution) do not count against a state’s attainment status—preventing states and industries from being penalized for pollution they did not cause.

The Fire Improvement and Reforming Exceptional Events (FIRE) Act, which updates how “exceptional events” (such as wildfires or prescribed burns) are treated under the Clean Air Act, gives states a more predictable, transparent way to exclude such events when evaluating air-quality compliance and issuing new permits.

The Air Permitting Improvements to Protect National Security Act, which advanced manufacturing and critical-mineral facilities (critical to US supply chains and defense) for exemption from certain Clean Air Act (CAA) emissions-offset requirements when offsets are unavailable, while still requiring compliance with all other environmental standards.

Modernization isn’t about loosening rules or providing giveaways to industry. Environmental policy will still hold polluters accountable. Instead, policy reforms will align regulations with current environmental conditions, scientific evidence, and economic realities. A modernized Clean Air Act can—and should—continue to protect the air we breathe while avoiding needless regulatory burdens that bring little additional benefit while stunting economic growth.

It’s Time for Congress to Act

Fifty-plus years after its landmark 1970 founding, the Clean Air Act has earned its place in American history. Its broad goals—cleaner air, healthier communities, environmental stewardship—remain as vital now as ever. But the methods by which we pursue those goals must evolve. EPA should embrace cost-benefit analysis, permit flexibility, realistic standards, and modern pollution-control technology. Sensible reforms can help guide air policy for the next half-century.

Many residents living in states that have welcomed data center development, like Virginia, are already experiencing a utility bill crisis.
Data centers are also major water-consumers.
“When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents,” NPR reported.
Indeed, resentment for data center development is becoming so widespread that it’s now one of the few issues that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on.","For farmers in the United States, concerns about too much clean energy production are quickly transforming into concerns about too little energy to go around. For years, rural America has been pushing back against the spread of utility-scale solar and wind farms competing for agricultural land. Now, they have a new sector to worry about as massive data center developments look to set up shop across the country, competing for land, energy, and water resources.

AI integration is becoming ubiquitous, with virtually no market sector untouched by its rapid spread. In October, Nvidia – the company that makes the advanced computer chips that power many machine learning platforms – became the first company to achieve $5 trillion in valuation. To put into perspective just how massive that number is, it’s higher than the entire gross domestic product of Germany, Europe’s largest economy.

The scale of this global transformation is hard to overstate, and is being felt in even the most unlikely of places, from Silicon Valley to the American heartland. In the rural United States, farmers are becoming increasingly worried about how developments in Big Tech could impact their daily operations, especially when it comes to energy prices, which are already soaring.

“As we see some of these big power users wanting to come into the state of Illinois, like data centers and those types of things, there’s some concern by our membership that there’s going to be an over-demand on power,” says Kevin Semlow, director of governmental affairs and commodities with the Illinois Farm Bureau. “As you see demand go up and supply stays the same, what changes? It’s the price.”

In an interview with agricultural news outlet Brownfield, Semlow went on to say, “Our members are concerned that as we see these higher-use facilities come in, we’re going to see prices increase, which then of course has a great impact on the bottom line.”

Farmers aren’t the only ones worried about footing the bill for AI’s massive energy needs. Many residents living in states that have welcomed data center development, like Virginia, are already experiencing a utility bill crisis. ""We are witnessing a massive transfer of wealth from residential utility customers to large corporations—data centers and large utilities and their corporate parents, which profit from building additional energy infrastructure,"" Maryland People's Counsel David Lapp told Business Insider back in July. ""Utility regulation is failing to protect residential customers, contributing to an energy affordability crisis.”

And energy prices aren’t the only concern. Data centers are also major water-consumers. In 2014, U.S. data centers used 5.6 billion gallons of water. By 2023, that had tripled to 17.4 billion gallons – and that number is going to keep rising at a rapid pace. Considering how essential water resources are for agriculture, and that agricultural demand is already placing undue stress on scarce water resources, added competition from data centers is on track to become a major concern, especially in drier climates. Even in climates with abundant freshwater sources, activists warn that these competing interests could cause shortages. A recent report from Sentient cautions that “without intervention, the Great Lakes could be strained past their limit.”

Moreover, data center developments are snapping up a lot of land in rural and agricultural zones, sparking pushback from local communities. In Indiana earlier this year, local residents won out in a heated battle against Google, which wanted to convert more than 450 acres in an Indianapolis suburb into a massive data center campus. “When a lawyer representing Google confirmed at a September public meeting that the company was pulling its data center proposal, cheers erupted from sign-waving residents,” NPR reported.

Indeed, resentment for data center development is becoming so widespread that it’s now one of the few issues that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on. And that’s saying something.

In his brief to the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Attorney General Jackson is challenging riders that PSNC wants to use to recover future costs from ratepayers. These riders allow PSNC to recover costs outside of the traditional ratemaking process.

“North Carolina families are already facing higher energy bills this winter, and PSNC is trying to include riders that add on costs that will not go through the comprehensive review of a general rate case,” said Attorney General Jeff Jackson. “I’m asking the Utilities Commission to reject these riders and protect North Carolina ratepayers.”

The Commission is expected to make its decision by January 26, 2026.

This case is part of Attorney General Jackson’s continued efforts to protect North Carolina’s ratepayers. Earlier this month, he intervened to review Duke Energy’s proposed 15 percent rate increase for ratepayers over the next two years.

Energy demand is rising today; modular reactors may not be prepared to meet it until well into the 2030s.","For years, Americans imagined the virtual cloud as abstract – floating somewhere beyond the limits of physical infrastructure.

In 2025, the demand for artificial intelligence stripped away that illusion, exposing the hard physical limits of a digital economy built on enormous quantities of power and land. There’s some evidence that data centers could make your electric bill go up by 70 percent.

The biggest tech companies broke ground on some of the largest industrial data center facilities ever constructed. Triggering states to enact emergency energy laws to keep pace with data-center load. Utilities asked for unprecedented spending increases to meet demand. And, communities began to question whether the benefits of hyperscale development justified the costs.

By early February, global energy analysts were already cautioning that artificial intelligence had pushed demand for electricity into uncharted territory.

International Energy Agency Director Fatih Birol told U.S. policymakers that nuclear power, long dormant in Western markets, was “making a comeback,” driven not by climate mandates but by the sheer scale of AI compute needs.

Tech giants, he noted, were becoming some of the most important investors in next-generation reactors, as traditional grids could no longer keep up.

On Capitol Hill, congressional hearings were openly discussing whether the United States had enough electricity to support its own AI ambitions. Industry groups warned that permitting delays for new generation were becoming a competitive threat. Economists testified that the hyperscale buildout of 2024 was only a preview of what was coming.

For digital infrastructure builders the strain was already evident. Fiber providers explained in March that data centers were no longer being built at traditional network crossroads. The crossroads themselves had run out of power.

""We've been dropping data centers in the metros where the long-haul fibers crisscrossed,"" said Dan Davis of Arcadian at the Metro Connect conference in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. ""Well, we've sucked up all the power where the fiber crossroads are.""

New facilities were being pushed into remote regions with available substations, forcing multiyear fiber builds and permitting fights in rural communities that had never seen this scale of industrial infrastructure.

A White House plan to rebuild the grid for AI

By midsummer, the White House made explicit that the United States could not maintain leadership in AI without a historic expansion of power generation, transmission, and data center capacity.

Trump’s AI Action Plan, released in July, reframed the hyperscale buildout as a national industrial imperative. It called to “create a strategic blueprint for navigating the complex energy landscape of the 21st century” and for “the interconnection of reliable, dispatchable power sources as quickly as possible.”

The plan ordered for streamlined permitting of data centers and energy infrastructure, along with a national buildout of grid capacity. It called for embracing new energy generation sources at the technological front, like enhanced geothermal and nuclear.

“The power grid is the lifeblood of the modern economy and a cornerstone of national security, but it is facing a confluence of challenges that demand strategic foresight and decisive action,” the plan states. “We need to build and maintain vast AI infrastructure and the energy to power it.”

The AI Action Plan followed a set of executive orders signed in May. Surrounded by nuclear startup CEOs in the Oval Office, Trump issued directives aimed at quadrupling domestic nuclear generation within 25 years.

“It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big,” Trump said.

From doctrine to implementation

If the Action Plan was the doctrine, the White House’s newly created National Energy Dominance Council became one of its war rooms.

Council Executive Director Jarrod Agen pointed to an ambitious target of bringing 10 new large reactors under construction by 2030, part of the president’s broader effort to revive the domestic nuclear sector.

Until getting to that point, Agen described a three-phase strategy to “stabilize, optimize, and expand” the electric grid in order to support AI and data center loads.

Stabilization, Agen said, meant using existing authorities to keep coal fired plants online during periods of grid stress. Optimization focused on upgrading substations and transmission lines to squeeze more capacity out of existing infrastructure. And, expansion centered on bringing new nuclear reactors online and building out long distance transmission to connect them to load.

Wind and solar fall out of favor

The administration’s priorities on nuclear sharply contrasted with those on solar and wind.

Days after Trump’s AI Action Plan was issued, the Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, an $11 billion transmission line designed to carry wind and solar power from Kansas to the eastern U.S.

The Energy Department said it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the project and criticized the loan commitment as one of several Biden era deals “rushed out the doors” after the election.

It was just one of many clean energy awards canceled by the Trump administration this year.

The nuclear acceleration begins

At the same time, the Energy Department was executing on one of the plan’s concrete directives: Identifying federal land for accelerated data center development.

Within months, the agency and other departments had matched candidate sites to national labs and legacy nuclear campuses, including Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, the Paducah complex in Kentucky, and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The four selected sites were to be developed in partnership with the private sector.

Across the country, states launched their own nuclear revival.

Several states, including Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming began reviewing proposals to repurpose former coal plants or dormant nuclear facilities into hubs for nuclear power. Others, like Wyoming, Utah, and Idaho inked regional nuclear pacts in an effort to align policies, attract private investment, and increase access to zero-carbon energy.

By mid-2025, nearly every major tech company had staked out its own nuclear strategy

Amazon announced a $20 billion investment in data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. Meta signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation Energy in Illinois to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google announced a partnership to build an advanced small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Critical obstacles to scaling nuclear remain

Still, it's unlikely the U.S. could quadruple its nuclear production in the time frame the White House specified.

Experts repeatedly warned this year that the country simply does not have the industrial capacity, regulatory structure, or supply chain needed to deliver reactors on the timelines the White House had laid out.

At a Broadband Breakfast summit on data centers and nuclear in March, Carol Lane of X-energy noted that the U.S. lacks domestic manufacturing capacity for nuclear grade graphite, large forgings, precision castings, and advanced fuels, all of which are essential for small modular reactors.

Today, she said, “we just don’t have domestic capability,” leaving deployment dependent on fragile international supply chains at a moment when geopolitical uncertainty is rising.

Even optimistic developers concede that SMRs remain five to ten years from meaningful commercial scale. Multiple experts warned that SMRs cannot solve the near term load crisis created by AI data centers. Energy demand is rising today; modular reactors may not be prepared to meet it until well into the 2030s.

That reality has pushed developers toward immediate options, including natural gas and coal, to help meet the demand for new power sources more quickly.

Calls for resiliency and new infrastructure solutions

By fall 2025, resilience had become the watchword across the infrastructure sector, triggered in part by a series of high-profile outages which took down thousands of websites and apps across the U.S.

At a Broadband Breakfast summit in September, executives from Equinix, X-energy, and DE-CIX warned that AI was pushing both the grid and the internet’s physical backbone into unfamiliar territory. Equinix’s Paul Brownell said the company would need to double its global capacity within five years just to keep up with compute demand.

Experts began calling for a ‘system-of-systems’ approach to boost resilience, arguing that this summer’s blackouts in Europe and past events in Texas, Pakistan, and South Africa have shown how quickly power failures can cascade into telecom outages, leaving millions without basic connectivity.

In an Expert Opinion for Broadband Breakfast, Uplink CEO Carlos Lei argued that the AI era calls for rethinking how connectivity itself is architected. Lei called for moving toward decentralized, community-driven networks that can ride through grid shocks rather than failing in lockstep with them.

“When the lights go out, our digital lives go dark, too,” Lei said. He warned that in an era of climate volatility and AI demand spikes, the grid has become a single point of failure for both electricity and broadband.

His proposed solution: Decentralized physical infrastructure networks. Community-built mesh networks, edge nodes, and microgrids capable of operating when centralized backbones fail.

Examples already exist, Lei said, including Red Hook, Brooklyn’s community mesh network relied upon after Hurricane Sandy. And, in India, Tibetan exiles, faced with chronically unreliable power, ingeniously patched together their own decentralized wireless network to stay connected.

A turning point for America’s energy future?

The events of 2025 made one reality impossible to ignore: The future of AI now hinges on whether the United States can build the energy system powerful, resilient, and expansive enough to sustain it.

The year’s developments forced policymakers to confront fragilities within the U.S. grid, decades of underinvestment in power and transmission, and the permitting bottlenecks that currently underpin America’s digital ambitions of AI dominance.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2025/12/New-chat-images-for-12-days--1024x366---1024-x-550-px---1024-x-576-px---2--1.png,N,,2025-12-09 17:01:43.678993

The Community CoLabs (Collaboration Laboratories) are an event format launched by Climate KIC in 2025, and were designed as a platform for multi-stakeholder dialogue and co-creation. The CoLab events reflect Climate KIC’s mission to orchestrate systemic change by connecting public and private actors across value chains, sectors, and geographies.

In 2025, four CoLabs took place, in Slovenia, Italy, Spain, and Poland, each advancing the sustainable transition through localised, thematic focus and collaborative innovation.

Beyond the legacy of the Slovenian Deep Demonstration

The Slovenian CoLab held in Ljubljana as part of the Circular Economy Hotspot Conference gathered startups, public agencies, SMEs, and research institutes to reflect on four years of circular economy progress under Climate KIC’s Deep Demonstration initiative in Slovenia.

The Slovenian Deep Demonstration is a multi-year partnership with the Slovenian government that aimed to develop pathways for a more radical transition to climate neutrality through a circular economy, using a systems innovation approach.

The event celebrated some major achievements such as the establishment of a Policy Lab and explored the challenges of scaling a portfolio approach for innovation.

Diverse stakeholders highlighted the impact of the Deep Demonstration and the importance of procurement as a lever for accelerating circularity in Slovenia. Ana Vele, representing the Slovene Enterprise Fund, an implementing body of the Ministry of Economy, Tourism and Sport, explained that the Deep Demonstration “allowed us to create internal sustainability policies, shifting our view of sustainability as an add-on to a principle that needs to be systemically integrated in every enterprise. We now aim to collaborate closely with the Ministries to design procurement calls for start-ups in the circular and raw materials fields that apply all learnings and methodology of the Deep Demonstration”.

Accelerating the blue and green economy in Europe’s coastal areas

The Italian CoLab convened local entrepreneurs, institutions, and innovators in Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy), to focus on actionable strategies for advancing the blue and green economy.

Such conversations are particularly relevant in regions such as Sardinia, where the economy related to maritime activities (trade, tourism, fishery, and more) and the protection of the environment need to couple with a focus on sustainability and innovation.

The event was hosted with local partner Sardegna Ricerche and Enterprise Europe Network and highlighted the importance of ecosystem collaboration and place-based innovation.

Participants discussed how to leverage Sardinia’s unique assets, such as its positioning in the Mediterranean and vibrant ecosystem of startups and SMEs among others, to drive climate resilience and sustainable growth in the region, creating a model that can then be exported to other coastal regions across Europe. The conversation highlighted the need to strengthen cross-sector partnerships between private businesses and public stakeholders to de-risk key innovations and design portfolios that allow us to experiment and learn in the maritime and environmental industry.

Community-led housing and sustainable transitions

Barcelona’s CoLab in Catalonia explored the transformative potential of community-led housing as a driver for circularity, equity, and climate justice. The event was purposefully hosted in the Can Batlló neighbourhood, an old industrial complex that turned into a vibrant hub of social innovation thanks to urban restructuring and the participation of the local community in the redefinition of spaces.

Participants visited La Borda, Barcelona’s first cooperative residential building, and BLOC4, one of Europe’s largest cooperative hubs, thus experiencing how cooperative construction and social innovation can embed sustainability and circularity principles in the built environment. After the visits, Expert from Lacol, Holon, and the Department of Urban Planning and Housing of the Barcelona City Council demonstrated the convergence of cooperative, institutional, and systemic approaches—framing housing as a catalyst for just transitions.

The event underscored Barcelona’s emerging model of public–community collaboration, where the choice of circular materials, consultations with the residents, and municipality-wide policies on pricing and energy retrofitting made the houses affordable and sustainable, embedding care, participation, and climate responsibility into urban development.

Advancing green public-private partnerships

The Warsaw CoLab, in Poland, was attended by government, business, academia, and civil society and aimed to understand how to unlock Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for climate innovation.

Through collaborative dialogues and expert panels, participants mapped the PPP landscape in Poland, identified key actors, and developed strategies for building trust, sharing risk, and fostering cross-sector innovation. As highlighted during the panel, PPPs can be crucial levers to scale decarbonisation projects as they combine public funding and private businesses resources to push innovation in strategic sectors.

As Aleksandra Goldys, Policy Innovation Lead at Climate KIC, put it, “Complex challenges require the combined expertise of public and private actors. For this purpose, understanding how to build and utilise PPPs is essential, not only as a specific procurement tool, but as an ongoing framework for cross-sector collaboration with a systemic approach.”

The 2025 Community CoLabs empowered local communities to come together to share knowledge and resources to achieve a just, resilient, and sustainable future, while fostering competitivity and entrepreneurship throughout Europe.

The company also closed a $300 million funding round led by Darsana Capital Partners, with participation from Altimeter Capital, ARK Invest, Bessemer Venture Partners, Robinhood Ventures and Y Combinator. Superpower is a 42 megawatt natural gas turbine that delivers reliable energy to AI data centers while accelerating the return of supersonic travel.

The same supersonic technology drives both the Superpower turbine and the Symphony jet engine: an all-new engine core designed for sustained and efficient high power output, even under challenging thermal conditions. Superpower accelerates AI data center development by providing gigawatts of new capacity and advances the development and certification of the Overture supersonic airliner by providing engine reliability data.

“Supersonic technology is an accelerant—of course for faster flight, but now for artificial intelligence as well,” said Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic. “With this financing and our first order for Superpower, Boom is funded to deliver both our engine and our airliner.”

Unlike legacy power turbines which lose generation capacity when it gets hot outside, Superpower leverages extreme temperature technology to maintain its full capacity—even in demanding locations. Superpower does not require water—a substantial advantage for AI data centers where water is often a constrained resource. Crusoe, an energy-first AI infrastructure leader, has ordered 29 Superpower turbines to power its advanced AI data centers.

“Boom’s innovative approach to power turbine technology builds on the company’s impressive breakthroughs in supersonic flight. At Crusoe we are continuously searching for new approaches to increase real-world performance and accelerate time-to-power across our portfolio of energy assets and operations,” said Chase Lochmiller, co-founder and CEO of Crusoe. “We’re proud to be partnering closely with Boom as the launch customer for Superpower, an initiative that aligns perfectly with Crusoe’s energy-first approach to building the AI infrastructure of the future.”

Boom’s total turbine production is planned to ramp to over four gigawatts annually by 2030. Leveraging its supersonic capability and advanced materials, Superpower achieves dramatically better real-world price performance when compared to other aeroderivative engines:

42 MW of ISO-rated power in a shipping-container-scale package

Full rated output in ambient temperatures exceeding 110°F

Waterless operation, enabling deployment in hot and arid environments

Runs on clean natural gas with backup diesel capability

The Series B funding round, led by Darsana Capital, fully funds Symphony engine development, and ongoing revenues from the Superpower business will finance certification and delivery of Overture. Darsana is a New York based investment firm with a concentrated portfolio of long-term public and private equity investments with exposure and expertise across aerospace and defense, space, AI and emerging technologies.

“Darsana looks forward to partnering with Boom to help develop state-of-the-art energy generation to power America’s AI revolution, all at supersonic speeds,” said Steve Friedman, Partner at Darsana Capital. “Boom has assembled an incredible team and executed with impressive discipline. Their focus on first delivering supersonic technology to create a high-performance power turbine business reflects a smart, capital-efficient path to building the next great American industrial company.”

Superpower will be built in the United States, supporting American reindustrialization. Today, 95% of the parts that make up Boom’s Symphony engine core prototype are in manufacturing, and testing is slated to begin in 2026 at Boom’s test facility in Colorado. Boom’s Overture order book stands at 130 aircraft, including orders and pre-orders from United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines.

About Boom Supersonic

Boom Supersonic’s mission is to make the world dramatically more accessible through a renaissance in supersonic flight. Boom is developing the Symphony supersonic engine, which powers the Overture supersonic airliner and the Superpower natural gas turbine for AI.

In a ruling on 8 December, Judge Patti Saris of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled in favour of 17 US states and the District of Columbia, who had filed a lawsuit against the sweeping ban on wind energy projects back in May, declaring section two of the “Wind Order”, issued on 20 January, unlawful, and to vacate the indefinite pause of wind energy permitting implemented by federal agencies following the order.

Section One of the executive action, which previously paused all wind energy leasing activities, is still in effect.

Judge Saris found the indefinite pause “arbitrary and capricious” because the agencies failed to explain why a total suspension was necessary or acknowledge the reliant interests of states and developers who have invested billions, noting it could not find a rational relationship between the “cursory” reasoning in the Wind Memo and the “immense scope of the moratorium”.

The Court also found the pause “contrary to law”, ruling that an indefinite halt on decision-making violates the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) requirement that agencies conclude matters within a reasonable time, stating “not acting at all is not a lawful option.”

”Today’s decision is welcome news, not just for the thousands of American workers and businesses across 40 states supporting offshore wind in the U.S., but also for the critical relief the wind industry will provide to lower skyrocketing electricity prices for millions of American families with reliable, affordable power,” Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said.

We thank the Attorneys General and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York for taking this case forward to protect American business interests against the politicization of our energy sector.”

Mexico’s updated NDC commits to a 50% GHG reduction by 2035 and reaffirms the 30% methane reduction by 2030, underscoring the critical role of PEMEX and the oil & gas sector.

Methane mitigation offers energy, climate, and public-health benefits and demands rapid deployment of technologies such as vapor recovery systems, advanced monitoring and the phase-out of routine flaring.

This month as negotiators met in the Brazilian rain forest for COP 30, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum’s administration announced a new emissions target under the Paris Agreement, called a Nationally Determined Contribution, to cut Mexico’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50% below the trend scenario levels by 2035. Importantly, the NDC also reaffirms Mexico’s goal of reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels, in accordance with national oil company PEMEX’s 2024 Sustainability Plan.

Mexico’s methane ambition on display at COP 30 Share on X

This move demonstrates Mexico’s firm commitment under President Sheinbaum to climate action, particularly methane reduction— one of the fastest and most cost-effective pathways to slow global warming. The oil and gas sector plays a decisive role in meeting these goals, contributing 8% of Mexico’s national emissions in 2024. These emissions stem mainly from hydrocarbon extraction, refining and transportation, where gas flaring and venting, leaks in pipelines and facilities, and the high energy consumption of refineries and processing centers remain critical pollution sources.

Methane reduction offers Mexico a triple benefit:

Energy efficiency: Capturing methane allows the recovery of natural gas currently being lost, improving the country’s energy performance.

Climate mitigation: Reducing methane emissions significantly contributes to slowing global warming.

Public health: Lower methane emissions help prevent respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, avoiding hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and reducing cases of asthma, lung cancer and heart-related illnesses.

In addition to an aggressive target, the NDC also lays out concrete actions to reduce fugitive methane emissions, curb natural gas venting and move toward eliminating routine flaring. The plan also promotes the adoption of key technologies such as vapor recovery systems, advanced monitoring and efficient flaring equipment, enabling faster, measurable and cost-effective mitigation.

The next steps will be critical to making these reductions a reality and nothing is more important than helping PEMEX access funding to implement solutions. Achieving these goals will require financial mechanisms that facilitate the adoption of technologies to reduce and capture methane emissions. Today, there are many sustainable finance alternatives form international markets and from multilateral banks that PEMEX can leverage to reduce emissions in line with its commitments. EDF is committed to working closely with leaders at PEMEX to help access this needed funding.

Realizing these methane reductions will take work but, through science, innovative solutions, and collaboration with organizations like EDF, Mexico can realize a safer climate and a more efficient energy sector.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Offshore-gas-flare-GettyImages-1282961342-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 16:00:20.611180

While the administration has not released the final details, the updated rules are expected to be less demanding than those enacted during the Biden administration.
Those earlier fuel economy requirements called for steady increases in efficiency through the next decade, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration targeting an average of 50.4 miles per gallon for passenger cars by the 2031 model year.
The Trump administration has long argued that such benchmarks are unrealistic and place excessive strain on automakers and consumers.
The administration has also warned that requirements tied to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system could threaten manufacturing jobs and lead to penalties that ultimately increase costs for buyers.","The Trump administration is preparing to announce revised fuel economy rules this week, signaling a major shift in federal policy as officials argue that current requirements are contributing to rising vehicle prices. According to reports from multiple outlets, senior White House officials and top executives from Detroit’s major automakers are expected to participate in the rollout of the new standards.

While the administration has not released the final details, the updated rules are expected to be less demanding than those enacted during the Biden administration. Those earlier fuel economy requirements called for steady increases in efficiency through the next decade, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration targeting an average of 50.4 miles per gallon for passenger cars by the 2031 model year. The Trump administration has long argued that such benchmarks are unrealistic and place excessive strain on automakers and consumers.

Regulatory rollback in the auto sector has been a central theme since Trump took office for his second term. Within days of his inauguration, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy ordered a full review of Biden-era rules, asserting that the existing fuel standards could push consumers away from affordable vehicles and limit the availability of traditional gasoline-powered models. The administration has also warned that requirements tied to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system could threaten manufacturing jobs and lead to penalties that ultimately increase costs for buyers.

Congressional Republicans have already taken steps to ease those pressures. A provision eliminating fines for failing to meet CAFE targets was included in a broad tax and spending package earlier this year, offering relief particularly to Detroit-based manufacturers. Stellantis and General Motors have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties in recent years for missing federal benchmarks.

The push to soften regulations comes at a time when new car prices remain historically high. Industry data shows the average transaction price hovering just under $50,000, a figure influenced in part by strong demand for high-priced trucks and SUVs. Analysts note that even as some automakers increase investment in gas-powered production, the market continues to reflect shifting consumer preferences and rising costs.

The administration is expected to outline its revised standards as part of its broader argument that easing regulatory burdens will help stabilize prices and expand consumer choice in a rapidly changing automotive landscape.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/B0jWoMnk9FiqwcymWCkY0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_auto_wire_articles_747/1a8057fbfe7c4a6e68f8a5839627595f,N,,2025-12-10 05:59:42.387505

-30- Washington’s Attorney General serves the people and the state of Washington.","Attorney General Nick Brown and a coalition of 18 attorneys general Monday won their lawsuit against the Trump administration’s unlawful order to freeze the development of wind energy projects.

In May, the coalition filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s decision to indefinitely halt all federal approvals necessary for the development of offshore and onshore wind energy projects pending federal review. Monday, a federal judge in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated those actions, ruling that they were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.

“We can’t unleash American energy by kneecapping some of the fastest growing, most innovative, and cleanest resources in the country,” Brown said in May upon joining the lawsuit. “Without a robust clean energy economy, we will see worsening climate change, more expensive energy from toxic fossil fuels, fewer jobs, and fewer solutions to our greatest challenges.”

Wind energy is a homegrown source of reliable, affordable energy that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, creates billions of dollars in economic activity and tax payments, and supplies more than 10% of the country’s electricity.

The indefinite halt on project approvals threatened Washington’s ability to meet its greenhouse gas emissions requirements and renewable energy commitments. It also threatened an increasingly important part of Washington’s economy. Washington has enacted multiple state laws encouraging the deployment of affordable, clean renewable energy like that from wind.

Wind power is the second largest contributor to Washington’s renewable energy generation after hydroelectric power. In 2024, Washington generated 8,421 Megawatt hours from wind power alone. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are often subject to volatile market conditions, wind power enhances Washington’s energy security and economic stability.

The coalition argued that federal agencies’ actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and other federal laws because the agencies, among other things, provided no reasoned explanation for categorically and indefinitely halting all wind energy approvals. The lawsuit also argued that the abrupt halt on all permitting violated numerous federal statutes that prescribe specific procedures and timelines for federal permitting and approvals—procedures the administration wholly disregarded in stopping wind-energy development altogether.

Brown was joined in this lawsuit, which was led by the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York, by the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Rhode Island.

The NYPA funding will support Stony Brook’s inaugural Power Pathways Workforce Readiness program, which is designed to train students in both trade-based and advanced technology disciplines. The program is designed to offer certification and training in areas such as solar energy, drone inspections, geothermal heat pumps and high-voltage direct current power systems.

“By investing in the advanced nuclear workforce and expanding access to affordable, hands-on training in AI and advanced energy systems, we’re preparing New Yorkers for the high-quality, high-demand jobs of tomorrow – and ensuring every community can share in the benefits of a cleaner, more equitable energy future,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a news release about the funding.

NYPA’s investment in clean energy workforce training is part of a commitment of up to $25 million annually, outlined in the 2023-24 state budget. The legislation directs NYPA to advance renewable energy projects that strengthen New York’s electric grid with a mix of diversified energy resources.

Clean energy jobs expanded at more than three times the pace of the overall U.S. economy last year, according to a September report by Economy + Environment, an environmental advocacy group. Still, uncertainty about policy and the economy has slowed that pace, although clean energy jobs remain critical to the U.S. economy, according to the organization.

In New York, beginning in 2026, the state’s power authority will partner with technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labor unions and other workforce development providers to use the $40 million over four years to create training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programs for workers in the advanced nuclear energy field.

That includes efforts at Stony Brook.

“Stony Brook’s mission centers on driving innovation, economic growth, and workforce development across Long Island, and throughout our great state of New York,” Stony Brook University President Andrea Goldsmith said in the news release.

The following are two different lists. The first is a list of some of the most important regulatory developments and the second list details some of the most important legislation.

Regulations to watch

Rule: Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards

Agency: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Status: The agency is reviewing comments. The final rule will likely be published in early 2026.

Comments: This will be one of the most important regulatory actions this administration and in recent memory. There are numerous legal arguments to undo the 2009 endangerment finding and to conclude that the EPA doesn’t have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. Hopefully, the EPA will include many of these arguments in its final rule. To learn more about the endangerment finding, please visit our endangerment finding web page. Here is CEI’s comment to the EPA.

Rule: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (would repeal aspects of the Biden 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule)

Agency: EPA

Status: The agency is reviewing comments. The final rule will likely be published in early 2026. Here is CEI’s comment to the EPA.

Rule: Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units

Agency: EPA

Status: The agency is reviewing comments. The final rule will likely be published in early 2026.

Comments: The EPA will likely finalize a rule that will make it clear that the agency doesn’t have authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. This would help put an end to the agency acting like the nation’s grid manager. Here is CEI’s comment to the EPA.

Rule: Updated Definition of “Waters of the United States”

Agencies: EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)

Status: The comment period is open for the proposed rule. Comments are due by January 5, 2026.

Comments: For decades, the EPA and Corps have tried to expand federal regulatory power to the point of regulating almost every water imaginable. In 2023, the US Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA finally helped to provide much-needed clarity on what waters are regulated under the Clean Water Act (what are “Waters of the United States” or WOTUS). The Trump administration must now develop a rule that is consistent with Sackett. Fortunately, the Sackett opinion, and the plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States(2006)that the Sackett court embraced, helps to provide some clear guidance for what a rule needs to look like. The current proposed rule is a decent step forward, but changes are needed to make it consistent with Sackett.

See my recent piece “Some minimum requirements for a proper WOTUS rule” and CEI’s comment to the EPA and Corps when they sought initial public feedback on how to define WOTUS.

Rule: Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification Improvement Rule

Agency: EPA

Status: A proposed rule is currently under review at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

Comments: The Clean Water Act gives a voice to states and tribes when it comes to protecting water quality. Before the federal government can issue certain permits and licenses, a state (or tribe) must either issue a certification or waive the certification requirement. Some states though have abused this process known as Section 401 certification by looking at issues that go well beyond water quality and other issues beyond the focus of the Clean Water Act. Any new proposed Section 401 rule should undo the Biden Section 401 rule and help to address Section 401 abuse. See CEI’s and the Pacific Legal Foundation’s comment to the EPA in response to the agency seeking public feedback prior to the pending proposed rule.

Rule: Visibility Protection: Regional Haze State Plan Requirements Rule Revision

Agency: EPA

Status: The agency is reviewing comments from this Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

Comments: The EPA was seeking comment on its Regional Haze Program. As CEI pointed out in our comments, “the Regional Haze Program, like most other decades-old programs administered by EPA, is now in need of significant course corrections if not outright repeal… No longer is the focus on improving visibility but rather to mandate the installation of costly control technologies on industrial facilities.” We concluded that the agency “should restore state primacy over the program as envisioned in the statute – up to and including respecting state determinations that no additional control measures are needed to address visibility” and urged it to “fully acknowledge the changed circumstances since 1977, and especially the declining emissions trends that undercut the case for further costly constraints under the program.”

Rule: The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks

Agency: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (Transportation)

Status: The comment period is open for the proposed rule. Comments are due by January 20, 2026.

Comments:The following comes from my colleague Marlo Lewis’s statement on the proposed rule, “CEI strongly supports the Department of Transportation’s proposal to reset the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. Under the Biden administration, industrial policy czar wannabes, regulatory rent seekers, and climate campaigners carjacked the CAFE program, turning it into a power boost for California and the Environmental Protection Agency’s unlawful agenda to ban gas-powered cars, restrict Americans’ freedom of vehicle choice, and price millions of consumers out of the new-car market.”

Rule: Notice of Availability of the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Draft Proposed Program: 1st Analysis and Proposal MAA104000

Agency: Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (Interior)

Status: The comment period is open for the proposal. Comments are due by January 23, 2026.

Comments: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a Secretary Order that would replace the Biden administration’s 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program with a new five-year offshore drilling plan that would greatly expand the number of lease sales. This new proposed 2026-2031 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program could include as many as 34 lease sales covering approximately 1.27 billion acres. Interior published its proposal on November 24 in the Federal Register. Here are CEI expert statements on this proposed plan.

Rules: Endangered Species Act rules

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations Pertaining to Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Interagency Cooperation Regulations

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Regulations for Designating Critical Habitat

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat

Agencies: US Fish and Wildlife Service (Interior); National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Commerce)

Status: The comment period is open for these proposed rules. Comments are due by December 22, 2025.

Comments: These suite of rules would help with species conservation. Among the rules is the proposed repeal of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s blanket 4(d) rule. This misguided policy treats threatened species as if they are endangered. Here are some PERC resources on problems with the blanket 4(d) rule.

Legislation to watch

Bill: SPEED Act (HR 4776)

Status: This bill was favorably reported out of the House Natural Resources Committee and is likely to be voted on by the full House this year.

Comments: This is a bipartisan National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reform bill. The bill codifies aspects of the Supreme Court case Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County. Among other things, the bill clarifies that NEPA is purely a procedural statute, states that when preparing an environmental document, an agency“may not consider effects that are speculative, attenuated from the project or action, separate in time or place from the project or action, or in relation to separate existing or potential future projects or actions,” and as explained by the Committee, “the bill requires that NEPA claims be filed within 150 days after the action is made public and must be filed by claimants who submitted a comment during the public comment period, have a claim related to their comment, and have been, or imminently will be, harmed by the proposed action.”

Bill: PERMIT Act (HR 3898)

Status: The bill is in the House Rules Committee. The bill could be voted on as early as this week.

Comments: This bill includes numerous Clean Water Act reforms, including reforms to the Section 401 process discussed earlier and eliminating what are known as preemptive and retroactive vetoes of Section 404 permits by the EPA. These issues are discussed in my piece “The PERMIT Act is an important step for permitting reform.”

Bill: State Planning for Reliability & Affordability Act (HR 3628)

Status: This bill will likely be considered in the House as early as this week.

Comments: This legislation would require state regulated electric utilities to ensure the availability of reliable electricity in their integrated resource planning. This entails getting electricity from reliable generation facilities. Central to the definition of such facilities is “the generation of electric energy on a continuous basis for a period of not fewer than 30 days.”

Big picture on legislation

In 2026, Congress will hopefully enact numerous energy and environmental reforms. One issue that is already getting attention and will continue to do so: permitting reform.

This year, the House will likely pass two permitting bills, the SPEED Act and PERMIT Act. This will help to get even more momentum for permitting reform.

Permitting reform could be sabotaged though if there are efforts to package misguided transmission reform into permitting reform efforts. Transmission reform shouldn’t be a way to connect unreliable electricity sources to the grid at the expense of consumers or the reliability and resilience of the grid.

Proper permitting reform will need to cover multiple statutes beyond just NEPA and the Clean Water Act. Some other statutes that need to be amended include the Clean Air Act and Endangered Species Act. My recent piece with my colleague Paige Lambermont “What permitting reform should and shouldn’t include” provides more perspective on permitting reform.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1413290008-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 15:02:18.072106

A new study led by researchers from the University of Rhode Island and University of North Florida has found that a significant portion of the organic matter measured in marsh sediments may not actually contribute to either long-term carbon storage or marsh elevation gain.

The core issue? Standard blue carbon accounting methods often treat all organic material in sediment samples as if it has the same impact on carbon storage and marsh stability. But according to the researchers, some organic matter—especially material dissolved in sediment porewater or bound within mineral structures—has negligible volume and does not help marshes build up elevation over time.

This gap in measurement practice matters because marsh elevation directly affects wetland survival as sea levels rise. If elevation is overestimated, the projected resilience of these ecosystems—and the climate mitigation projects built around them—may not match reality. That has downstream implications for restoration project planning, credit valuations in carbon markets, and climate adaptation investments.

Impacts on Carbon Markets, Project Risk, and Coastal Infrastructure

For sectors involved in carbon finance, coastal engineering, and environmental risk analytics, these findings point to a need for more precise carbon modeling. Overestimating carbon storage not only skews the performance of blue carbon credits but can also undermine the credibility of climate claims made by project developers or investors.

Models used in wetland restoration, offset crediting, and risk forecasting often rely on assumptions that now appear incomplete. If dissolved or non-volume-contributing organic matter is included in sediment data without correction, projections of marsh resilience and storage capacity may be inflated. The study suggests incorporating correction factors that differentiate between organic matter that adds to sediment structure and that which doesn’t.

This nuance could drive the next generation of verification protocols, monitoring technologies, and restoration strategies. It also opens new ground for service providers in consulting, measurement tech, and regulatory compliance to deliver more accurate, science-aligned solutions.

Rather than discard past datasets, the researchers advocate recalibrating them with updated methods—a path forward that balances scientific integrity with continuity for ongoing projects.

Overall, datacenters' water consumption increased by almost two-thirds over the past five years.
The datacenter industry is aware that it isn't entirely loved, as was revealed at an industry event in June.
The industry should get people to think of bit barns as vital utilities, like water and electricity.","More than 230 organizations across America have signed a letter calling for a moratorium on the construction of datacenters, claiming the current building boom represents a huge environmental and social threat.

The open letter [PDF], sent to members of the US Congress by campaign group Food & Water Watch, complains that the AI-driven wave of datacenter expansion is stoking demand for more energy, which in turn leads to further greenhouse gas emissions, straining water resources, and higher electricity prices for ordinary consumers across the country.

Organizations endorsing the letter collectively represent millions of citizens across all 50 US states, the group claims. It urges members of Congress to suspend the construction of new facilities until adequate regulations are enacted to protect communities and the environment from the damage it claims is already being inflicted.

Investment in datacenters has hit an all-time high, thanks mostly to the burgeoning requirements of training and serving AI. Analyst firm Omdia estimates global datacenter capex will top $657 billion by the end of 2025, almost double the figure of just two years ago, with the US dominating this spending.

In hotspots such as Virginia, hyperscale datacenter capacity is greater than the entire capacity of China or the whole of Europe, according to previous figures. This comes at a cost, as those facilities consumed nearly twice as much power in the second half of 2024 compared to the prior six months. Overall, datacenters' water consumption increased by almost two-thirds over the past five years.

Ordinary Americans will likely pay for all this extra power generating capacity and the grid infrastructure needed to carry it, with a report out last year warning that US consumers could face a 70 percent hike in their electricity bills by 2030.

In addition, it emerged last month that some states are keeping citizens in the dark about the subsidies they use to attract datacenter companies to their territory, which means many projects are being funded at the expense of taxpayers.

Even worse, all these new datacenters are causing greater greenhouse gas emissions, with hyperscale operators such as Microsoft and Google admitting their emissions have risen over the past several years, in spite of their commitments to reach net-zero by the end of the decade.

The demand for power has spurred a resurgence in coal-fired power generation, one of the dirtiest, most polluting ways of producing electricity. And datacenters generating their own energy on-site are also contributing to the problem, as demonstrated by the Colossus facility run by Elon Musk's xAI, which was accused of being one of the largest sources of smog-generating nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the Memphis area thanks to its fleet of gas turbines.

""At a time when millions of Americans are already struggling with soaring utility costs, the sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these datacenters inflict,"" stated Food & Water Watch executive director Wenonah Hauter.

""The only prudent action is to halt the unfettered expansion of this dangerous industry in order to properly examine all manner of potential harm before it's too late,"" she added.

Good luck with that.

As far as the Trump administration is concerned, the US is in a race with China for AI supremacy, and it can only win by investing more in compute muscle to underpin AI development.

US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum went as far to claim that: ""The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change. It's the fact that we could lose the [AI] arms race if we don't have enough power.""

Trump himself pledged to remove obstacles to connecting datacenters to the electricity grid at the federal level during a White House dinner held for tech industry oligarchs in September. And AI investment is the only thing keeping the America out of a recession right now, as economists disclosed in October.

The datacenter industry is aware that it isn't entirely loved, as was revealed at an industry event in June. A Microsoft exec complained there are ""communities that don't want us there."".

The consensus was not that the industry needs to change, more that the public should be better informed about what datacenters actually do and the applications and industries which depend upon them. The industry should get people to think of bit barns as vital utilities, like water and electricity. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2015/11/16/help_2.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 17:01:20.951340

The letter, which was led by Food & Water Watch and signed by more than 230 organizations, rails against the expansion of data centers across the country, fueled by a corporate-backed push for generative artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency products.

The organizations make the case that the “well-established” downsides of data-center expansion amount to “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation,” demanding immediate regulatory action.

“This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country,” it continues. “All this compounds the significant and concerning impacts AI is having on society, including lost jobs, social instability and economic concentration.”

The letter lists a litany of staggering environmental statistics linked to the U.S. data-center buildout, including skyrocketing electricity costs, the exacerbation of climate change and the “enormous” and “unsustainable” consumption of electricity and water.

According to the groups, a tripling of data centers over the next five years could lead to the equivalent electricity usage of 30 million households and as much water as 18.5 million households consume.

The letter also nods to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s prediction in an Axios interview that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next five years, and lead to a 10-20% jump in unemployment levels.

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter concludes. “We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

Congress has made some recent moves to address what appears to be a brewing public rejection of data centers due to surging energy demand and rising electricity bills. Last month, Sens. Chris Coons, D-Del., and Dave McCormick, R-Pa., introduced a bill that would task the Government Accountability Office with assessing the efficacy of liquid cooling systems for AI compute clusters and high-performance computing facilities. A bipartisan House bill, meanwhile, calls for a study from the departments of Energy, Interior and Agriculture into the impact AI data centers are having on rural areas.

Still, the modest progress Congress has taken to get a handle on the data-center movement pales in comparison to the Trump administration’s full-throated embrace of the facilities. The energy-focused agenda of the White House’s AI Action Plan focuses on cutting clean air and water regulations to accelerate permitting for the construction of data centers.

Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch, said in a press release that the “sudden explosion of the Big Data industry” poses an “existential threat” to communities already grappling with “soaring utility costs.”

A Nationwide Buildout Anchored in Digital Demand

NextEra Energy Resources and Meta have agreed to develop approximately 2.5 GW of clean energy capacity across 13 sites in the United States, one of the largest procurement rounds announced this year as hyperscale power demand accelerates. The package includes 11 power purchase agreements and two energy storage agreements that Meta will use to advance its commitment to source all operational electricity from clean energy

The bulk of the capacity will come from nine utility-scale solar projects totalling up to 2.1 GW across three major US markets: ERCOT, the Southwest Power Pool and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. The remaining segment will be delivered through four projects in New Mexico comprising 190 MW of solar and 168 MW of battery storage in Valencia and De Baca counties.

Urvi Parekh, head of energy at Meta, said: “We are proud to continue our collaboration with NextEra Energy Resources in advancing energy infrastructure and storage solutions. The integration of 2.1 GW across ERCOT, SPP and MISO, along with more than 350 MW from the three-way collaboration with PNM in New Mexico, to support our data centre operations, demonstrate how industry cooperation can drive technological progress and strengthen America’s energy infrastructure.”

New Generation and Storage Aligned With AI-Era Electricity Needs

All 2.5 GW of projects are scheduled to come online between 2026 and 2028, a delivery window that aligns with the expansion of Meta’s US data center footprint and a surge in industry-wide AI compute requirements. Construction is expected to support up to 2,440 jobs and generate new tax revenue for host communities, according to project estimates.

NextEra Energy Resources president and CEO Brian Bolster emphasised the intersection of grid infrastructure and digital expansion. “As one of America’s largest energy infrastructure builders, NextEra Energy Resources is powering America’s technology growth with new energy infrastructure. The company has actively engaged with hyperscalers to support their data centre operations and further drive America’s leadership. We are incredibly excited to grow our collaboration with Meta, one of America’s iconic companies. These agreements demonstrate our continued commitment to bring energy solutions to help grow the American economy, drive innovation and ensure the US wins the AI race.”

The partnership builds on nearly 500 MW of operational capacity Meta already procures from NextEra. It reflects a wider industry trend in which large corporate buyers are signing multi-regional portfolios rather than one-off PPAs, enabling faster deployment, greater certainty for developers and stronger alignment with corporate decarbonisation timelines.

Industry Context: New Energy Models for Hyperscalers

The Meta-NextEra collaboration arrives amid a rapid escalation in clean energy procurement by hyperscalers, driven by both climate commitments and the need to maintain cost-competitive electricity supply for power-intensive AI clusters. Google and NextEra announced an expanded collaboration earlier this year involving the joint development of several gigawatt-scale data center campuses and the associated generation capacity. The companies currently have around 3.5 GW operating or under contract.

Other buyers are also accelerating volumes. Treaty Oak Clean Energy signed long-term PPAs with Meta in October for two Louisiana projects: the 185 MW AC Beekman Solar site and the 200 MW AC Hollis Creek Solar facility. These agreements illustrate how regional grids in the Southeast, Gulf Coast and Midwest are now receiving new market signals from corporate offtakers that historically focused on the Southwest and Texas.

What Corporate Leaders Should Watch

The Meta-NextEra package reinforces a central theme for global sustainability and energy executives: large digital companies are becoming structural actors in US electricity markets. Their procurement decisions influence interconnection queues, regional clean energy deployment patterns and state-level energy planning. For investors and utilities, the scale of these agreements provides clearer demand visibility at a time when AI load projections are volatile and unevenly distributed across grids.

It also highlights the importance of pairing solar with storage capacity, particularly in regions facing congestion or steep evening demand curves. The New Mexico projects offer a template for three-way collaboration among utilities, developers and hyperscalers in locations where new data center investments require both firm clean energy and local economic benefits.

As grids across the US absorb the next wave of data infrastructure growth, the Meta-NextEra agreements preview the type of long-term corporate contracting that is likely to shape the national energy mix through the end of the decade.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Meta-NextEra-Agree-2.5-GW-Clean-Energy-Buildout-To-Power-Expanding-US-Data-Infrastructure.webp,N,,2025-12-09 17:01:40.480234

TRENTON – The Rutgers University Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT) in the School of Engineering is preparing to deploy and demonstrate hydrogen fuel cell technology as part of an innovative pilot project funded by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA).

Joined by project partners Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), the Center for Transportation and the Environment (CTE), Hyundai Motor Company, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Rutgers CAIT will lead this initiative that has the potential to enhance supply chain efficiency, invest in American infrastructure and jobs, and position New Jersey as a hub for advanced transportation technologies.

“Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey continues to make impactful investments into proven clean energy technologies like hydrogen, promoting innovation, creating jobs, and improving quality of life for New Jerseyans,” said NJEDA CEO Tim Sullivan. “With support from the NJEDA, this pilot project will leverage expertise from academia, government, and the private sector to explore the potential of hydrogen-powered trucks, keeping New Jersey on the forefront of innovation and strengthening our long-term economic competitiveness.”

Hyundai’s XCIENT Fuel Cell Trucks will be used for this demonstration. The trucks will operate at Port Newark, a significant component of the Port of New York and New Jersey and the principal container ship facility for goods entering and leaving the Northeastern United States. The facility is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

“This pilot is another step in the Port Authority’s broader effort to look at every viable pathway toward a cleaner future for our critical infrastructure and operations,” said Christopher Diamond, Director of the Office of Sustainability at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. “Our ambitious commitment to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 brings with it a responsibility to help chart the course toward greater sustainability across our vast network, including the East Coast’s busiest seaport. We’re eager to take advantage of the region’s innovative spirit to examine emerging technology and accelerate the transition to a more sustainable future.”

Supporting existing drayage operations and supply chain logistics, the trucks will transport shipping containers short distances from the port to warehouses, rail yards, and the next leg of the longer freight journey. Today, this drayage, or short-distance transport of goods, is conducted by fuel-intensive, combustion engine trucks that are typically single-purpose for drayage, serving the same short distance for their useful life.

The project will proceed in phases, beginning with procurement of the trucks and hydrogen supply and the design of the fueling site.

Truck deployment and testing are expected to start in the beginning of 2026.

“It’s about making New Jersey an R&D and workforce training hub for hydrogen-powered transportation,” said Ali Maher, director of Rutgers CAIT and principal investigator. “We’re demonstrating how hydrogen can be integrated into real-world transportation and logistics operations, and we will investigate its potential to drive down costs, improve performance, and support long-term economic growth. This type of applied research is critical to proving the use cases of innovative technology and paving the way for its implementation.”

Rutgers University will manage the project and lead the research, workforce development, and performance validation efforts. CAIT will engage experts from the Rutgers School of Engineering and the Office for Research to identify and document opportunities to build on the successes and lessons learned from this pilot.

PSEG will manage the fueling operations of the six hydrogen-powered trucks.

“PSEG’s expertise in hydrogen across industrial settings well positions us to partner in this initiative at Port Newark,” said Jeffrey Stokes, Senior Director of Renewables Engineering & Technical Support at PSEG. “We’re proud to bring that experience to the forefront as we support truck fueling operations for the project. PSEG aims to drive reliable energy infrastructure while also supporting the state’s efforts to drive economic development.”

CAIT will work with project partner CTE to collect service data on existing drayage operations to establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks for the hydrogen trucks.",https://nj.gov/governor/library/facebook_card.png,N,,2025-12-09 15:02:09.662480

Despite actions in Washington targeting clean energy, solar and storage account for 85% of all new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump Administration.

According to the U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2025 report released today the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie, 73% of all solar capacity installed this year has been built in states won by President Trump, including 8 of the top 10 states for new installations: Texas, Indiana, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Utah, Kentucky and Arkansas. Utah surged into the top 10 solar states this quarter with two utility-scale projects coming online totaling over 1 GW of capacity.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DOI) July memo and other federal actions to impede utility-scale solar and storage projects in the pipeline have created significant business uncertainty. In the absence of clarity from DOI on permitting timelines or project approvals, the report’s forecasts for utility-scale solar deployment through 2030 remain virtually unchanged from last quarter.

“This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “Remarkable growth in Texas, Indiana, Utah, and other states won by President Trump shows just how decisively the market is moving toward solar. But unless this administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable, and reliable solar and storage will be frozen by uncertainty and Americans will continue to see their energy bills go up. America’s manufacturing surge, our global competitiveness, and billions of dollars in private investment are on the line.”

With the opening of two new solar module manufacturing facilities in Louisiana and South Carolina totaling 4.7 GW, the United States has now added 17.7 GW of new module manufacturing capacity in 2025. With a new wafer facility opening in Michigan in Q3, the United States can now produce every major component of the solar module supply chain.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,"" James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.""

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,'' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits.

Air Products estimates the project would store approximately five million tons of CO₂ per year through a third-party sequestration agreement.","NEW ORLEANS – Modern carbon capture and storage (CCS) is reshaping Louisiana’s industrial landscape, moving from pilot projects to a fast-expanding statewide buildout. The technology works by capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities and injecting it deep underground for long-term storage.

Energy and petrochemical firms say Louisiana is particularly well suited for rapid CCS expansion and Louisiana Economic Development (LED) has positioned the technology as a pillar of the state’s industrial strategy, arguing it will attract major investment and diversify the economy. Several of the state’s largest planned industrial expansions, backed by ExxonMobil, CF Industries and Air Products, utilize carbon sequestration.

Safety Record Raises Local Alarm

Louisiana and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are currently in court over whether the state should be allowed to take over permitting authority for Class VI wells — the federally regulated injection wells used for long-term underground storage of captured carbon dioxide. The lawsuit centers on whether the state’s proposed oversight program meets federal safety and environmental standards, a requirement before EPA can transfer that authority.

Separately, Livingston Parish residents, including members of the community group Save Our Water, have sued to block Air Products’ proposed Class VI injection wells there, arguing that the parish and state approved early stages of the project without adequate environmental review or public notice.

These legal battles reflect a wider concern about whether Louisiana’s CCS framework can protect public safety. Critics often point to two recent high-profile failures as evidence that CCS infrastructure is unsafe, but both incidents stem from the nation’s legacy CO₂ pipeline network—a system that spans roughly 5,000 miles and was built decades ago for enhanced oil recovery. In Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, companies such as Denbury and ExxonMobil operate more than 900 miles of these older lines.

In 2020, a pipeline rupture near Satartia, Mississippi released an estimated 31,000 barrels of compressed CO₂ after heavy rains triggered a landslide that stressed the buried line. Roughly 300 residents were evacuated and dozens were hospitalized. Federal investigators later found that pipeline modeling failed to predict how dense CO₂ could accumulate in low-lying areas, and regulators issued one of the largest civil penalties in the history of the federal pipeline safety agency.

A similar alarm sounded in Southwest Louisiana on April 3, 2024, when an ExxonMobil-owned CO₂ pipeline leaked near Sulphur in Calcasieu Parish. Residents, not company sensors, first reported a dense white plume of CO₂ and water vapor, prompting a shelter-in-place advisory. Analysts estimated the release at just over 2,500 barrels, and it took more than two hours to fully shut down the line.

Supporters of CCS argue that these failures reflect the age and design of older pipelines and methods, not the safety of modern climate-oriented CCS projects.

Community Pushback Intensifies

The rapid pace of CCS development is also prompting vocal community opposition. Although a Dec. 3 LED rules hearing was not convened specifically to address carbon capture, residents used the public-comment session to press for transparency and stronger safeguards.

“This is moving too fast for me,” said one Ascension Parish attendee. “All I see now is pipes, pipes, pipes. It’s something we’ve never had before. My question is, who is going to be the one to ensure the safety of this? Who is going to let the people know what is going on? How is this going to be safe when y’all are rushing CCS?”

Louisiana’s Expanding CCS Network

Even with the pushback, Louisiana is advancing one of the country’s most aggressive CCS buildouts. More than 40 CCS or carbon-removal projects have been announced statewide since 2024, including ammonia and hydrogen plants, LNG facilities, power-sector projects and emerging direct-air-capture systems.

CF Industries has begun capturing CO₂ at its Donaldsonville complex. In Ascension Parish, an Air Products–led $4 billion joint venture aims to build what developers describe as the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia plant, with millions of tons of emissions routed for permanent storage.

Air Products

Air Products has also proposed a major blue hydrogen and ammonia complex in Ascension Parish designed to capture most of its CO₂ output, though the company has since indicated it may restructure parts of the project. Occidental’s 1PointFive subsidiary and Enbridge are advancing a regional sequestration hub north of Lake Pontchartrain to receive CO₂ from multiple industrial sites.

In a separate initiative, Air Products is developing an $8–9 billion low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia complex in Louisiana capable of producing more than 750 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen per day while capturing up to 95 percent of the CO₂ generated. Yara International plans to acquire and operate the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities, integrating them into its global distribution system. Air Products estimates the project would store approximately five million tons of CO₂ per year through a third-party sequestration agreement. Final investment decisions are expected by mid-2026.

Sempra Infrastructure

In Cameron Parish, the state approved Louisiana’s first Class VI carbon-storage well this year for Sempra Infrastructure, which plans to inject CO₂ beneath Black Lake near Hackberry. Meanwhile, Denbury—one of the region’s largest CO₂ pipeline operators—is developing storage sites in St. Charles Parish and proposing a multibasin transport network linking emitters across the state.

Heirloom Carbon Technologies

Heirloom Carbon Technologies, part of the federally supported Project Cypress direct-air-capture hub, is building two facilities in Northwest Louisiana designed to remove CO₂ directly from the atmosphere.

Woodland Biofuels

At the Port of South Louisiana, Canada-based Woodland Biofuels plans a carbon-negative renewable gas and hydrogen plant projected to remove up to 660,000 tons of CO₂ annually when fully built.

As the state’s CCS portfolio expands, residents and advocates say their central question is whether Louisiana’s regulatory framework, public-notification processes and emergency-response systems are equipped for the scale of what comes next.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/12/Louisianas-Fast-CCS-Expansion-Sparks-Local-Pushback.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 15:03:19.261958

December 9, 2025 (Concord, NH) – Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) is appealing the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) issuance of a permit that allows the Manchester Wastewater Treatment Facility to continue discharging toxic PFAS chemicals, also known as “forever chemicals,” into the Merrimack River. The appeal, submitted to the Environmental Appeals Board, argues that EPA failed to comply with the law and its own policies when issuing the final permit.

“Everyone deserves safe, clean water – it’s that simple,” said CLF Associate Attorney Jillian Aicher. “By ignoring clear evidence that PFAS discharges threaten our waterways, our ecosystems, and our health, the EPA is failing in its most basic duty – to protect our communities and our natural resources. It’s essential that EPA step up and fulfill this duty by reducing toxic PFAS pollution.”

The EPA finalized the Clean Water Act permit for the Manchester facility without properly considering whether it should set limits for PFAS under the state’s water quality standards. The agency also failed to follow its environmental justice policy, which is meant to protect communities overburdened by pollution. The city-owned wastewater treatment facility burns sewage sludge, which contains PFAS, and is not designed to remove PFAS from its air emissions. It also discharges PFAS into the Merrimack River, an important ecosystem and source of drinking water for downstream communities.

CLF is asking the Environmental Appeals Board to find EPA violated the law and its policy in granting the final permit and send the permit back to EPA to properly consider PFAS and environmental justice.

PFAS are known as forever chemicals because they do not break down in the environment or in our bodies. These toxic substances are linked to a growing number of health harms, including cancers, fertility issues, child development disorders, hormonal dysfunction, and damage to the thyroid, liver, and kidneys. A recent study has raised concern about elevated cases of kidney cancer in Manchester, based on data from 2013 to 2021, and recommends further study.

PFAS are found in wastewater from industrial users sent to Manchester’s Wastewater Treatment Facility, the largest wastewater treatment plant in northern New England, and the only one in New Hampshire that incinerates its sewage sludge.

This appeal follows CLF’s state-level challenge filed in June with the New Hampshire Water Council.

The appeal can be found here.

CLF experts are available for further comment.

Another great transformation is underway in China. The world’s factory is fast becoming its first electro-state, with an economy increasingly built on clean energy, AI, advanced manufacturing, and control of key strategic materials. This new model is full of promise, though it faces major challenges.

China has established itself as the world’s undisputed leader in clean-tech manufacturing. It now controls roughly 60% of all solar, wind, and battery-equipment manufacturing capacity, and over 80% of global solar-module output. The scale of these activities has contributed to a sharp decline in costs, with solar-module prices, for example, falling by around 80% in the past decade.

Reinforcing this dominance, China has also gained a stranglehold over rare-earth minerals – vital to the manufacture of a wide range of high-tech products, such as electric vehicles, wind turbines, and AI-enabled sensors. Today, China controls over 40-50% of global rare-earth reserves and almost 70% of rare-earth production and refinement.

Meanwhile, China’s massive investments in strengthening its innovation capacity, particularly in AI, are paying off. China now boasts more than half the world’s AI researchers and some 70% of its AI patents, and has cracked the top ten in global innovation indices, such as that produced by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

All of this amounts to an astonishing feat of long-term strategic positioning. Every element of the unfolding global economic transition – from the supply of key inputs to the manufacture of high-tech goods to the design and financing of new industrial and energy systems – now depends significantly on China. Whether you are the United States seeking access to rare earths, or a developing economy in need of clean-energy infrastructure, you turn to China.

At least that is the plan. As powerful as China may seem as a leading exporter of critical minerals and technologies, its position perpetuates the dependence on external demand from which it has been trying to escape. At a time when rising protectionism and national-security concerns are reshaping global supply chains – often away from Chinese suppliers – this may turn out to be a serious vulnerability.

China’s looming demographic crisis compounds the risks. The working‐age population is shrinking, the old-age dependency ratio is rising, and the fertility rate has fallen to well below replacement levels. With fewer workers, income and consumption growth may slow, undercutting the government’s efforts to shift the economy to a consumption-led growth model.

Recent housing-sector developments do not help matters. In recent decades, real-estate prices soared in China, owing to factors like rapid urbanization, local governments’ dependence on land sales for revenue, and robust growth expectations. Housing thus became the primary engine whereby Chinese households increased their wealth.

But a combination of weak demand, overcapacity, and high leverage has caused China’s real-estate sector to tumble, destroying household wealth and eroding consumer confidence. The decline in prices may have resulted in more than CN¥3 trillion ($424 billion) in foregone household spending since 2021. Add to that slowing productivity growth and high youth unemployment (around 17.5% for people aged 16-24), and China’s middle class may struggle to serve as the consumer base and innovation engine the country needs.

China has thus reached an inflection point. It has built the machinery of an innovative, low-carbon industrial economy – one that could lead the global net-zero transition and the unfolding AI revolution. But if this electro-state is to be sustainable, China must make progress in three critical areas.

First, productivity must increase, not through more robots or factories, but through continued innovation, skills-building, effective management, and service-sector upgrading. Research-and-development intensity matters here: a 10% increase in R&D expenditure as a share of GDP could deliver a 7% boost to manufacturing productivity.

Second, China must find ways to accelerate the economy’s rebalancing toward domestic demand. To this end, efforts must be made to bolster household incomes and wealth, consumer confidence, and job creation, such as by fostering service industries – including care activities (elder-care, health) – and shifting labor from manufacturing and real estate into consumption-oriented sectors.

Lastly, China must manage external dependencies wisely. While greater self-reliance is essential, so are strategic partnerships, predictable trade relationships, and transparent frameworks for cooperation.

Whatever happens next, the implications for the rest of the world will be far-reaching. On the upside, China’s transformation is lowering the cost of renewables, expanding the supply of clean tech, and delivering new infrastructure investment across Asia and Africa. Already, China is playing a critical role in helping developing economies to leap-frog fossil fuel-based systems.

But China’s “electro-state” strategy also gives it considerable leverage over other countries, which, as its recent imposition of export restrictions on rare-earth minerals showed, it may weaponize. China’s techno-industrial advancement will always be viewed through a geostrategic lens. As the country tightens its grip on raw materials and high-tech manufacturing, others must decide whether to double down on cooperation with China, diversify their supply chains away from it, or risk being locked out altogether.

For Hong Kong and the wider Asia-Pacific, the message is clear: the era of low-cost manufacturing arbitrage is ending, and AI, green infrastructure, and digital hardware are the new frontiers of economic growth and prosperity. With China positioning itself as a supplier, designer, and powerhouse of this new economy, countries across Asia and beyond will need to adapt, engaging with China, hedging against bottlenecks, and re-working their own industrial models.",https://www.chinausfocus.com/d/file/202512/a204872865f76d6cce4b12102898bd14.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 16:00:16.714564

(AP) — South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.

Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper's debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at Monday's board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.

“Our customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It’s time they get some value out of that,” Staton said.

The deal terms include $2.7 billion in cash to Santee Cooper should the parties reach a Final Investment Decision (FID) and commit to constructing the nuclear units, plus a targeted 25% ownership share for Santee Cooper, with proportional capacity, once the units begin commercial operation. The ownership benefits could be adjusted depending on the final cost of completing the units.

Santee Cooper is the state-owned public power utility in South Carolina.

“Santee Cooper has negotiated a strong deal for our customers, including a cash payment that will significantly reduce the debt our customers have been paying, and future electric capacity they will receive from these units at no additional capital cost,” said Santee Cooper President and CEO Jimmy Staton. “Customer relief was one of two top goals when we began this process in January, with the second being optimized value to South Carolina. In addition to enabling completion of units that will generate over 2,000 megawatts in reliable, carbon-free electricity here, this deal also puts South Carolina at the front of the nation’s nuclear resurgence.”

Santee Cooper and Brookfield have been negotiating the MOU terms in accordance with a letter of intent approved by the Santee Cooper Board on Oct. 24, providing a six-week initial project feasibility period.

The MOU establishes a path to FID, estimated to take 18 to 24 months.

Additional provisions in the MOU are:

• A Feasibility Committee, comprised of two members each from Santee Cooper and Brookfield with Santee Cooper appointing the chair, will oversee the diligence process.

• Brookfield will meet certain milestones throughout the feasibility period and will provide monthly progress reports to Santee Cooper during this period.

• By June 26, 2026, Brookfield must determine initial feasibility and establish a target date for its FID.

• Brookfield will develop a draft economic development plan, also by June 26, that considers a commitment to using South Carolina companies and labor force, partnerships with K-12 and higher educational institutions, investment in workforce development, working with Veterans Affairs to provide opportunities, and engagement with communities and stakeholders, including Fairfield County.

• Santee Cooper will work with Brookfield on actions needed to evaluate feasibility, as well as actions related to detailed construction planning and analysis, needed to reach FID.

With surging residential and industrial customer demand, and with the support of state leaders, last year Santee Cooper recognized a potential opportunity to identify a third party who would complete the unfinished nuclear units.

The utility launched a competitive bidding process in January 2025, receiving initial expressions of interest from over 70 potential bidders and 15 formal proposals. Working with industry experts, Santee Cooper developed key financial, risk mitigation and execution criteria by which the final proposals were measured.

Completion of the two units could generate thousands of temporary construction jobs and hundreds of highly skilled, permanent operational jobs.

Michael Bennet wins his campaign for Colorado governor, his administration would support a climate strategy that’s struggled to gain traction under Gov. Jared Polis:

A statewide “cap-and-invest” program.

Bennet released the brief policy outline through his gubernatorial campaign on Monday. The platform calls for a market-based policy built around a declining cap on climate-warming emissions. Colorado already has established climate targets, which require the state to eliminate its contribution to global warming by 2050.

The state would then issue or sell a limited number of permits each year, allowing companies to release a certain amount of planet-warming pollution. Revenue generated in the process could help cut utility bills and support clean energy technology, priorities specifically cited in the platform published by the Bennet campaign.

“I believe Colorado can be a leader in building a future that protects our environment, makes life more affordable for our families and supports our businesses,” Bennet said in a new statement announcing the proposal. “To do that, we need to move beyond the status quo and embrace new, proven and innovative strategies.”

A potential shift in Colorado’s climate strategy

The platform hints at how Bennet could harness climate policy as one part of an affordability agenda, offering discounts on energy bills with revenue generated through a cap-and-invest program.

Along with other parts of the country, Colorado residents could soon face rapidly rising energy costs as AI data centers, all-electric buildings and electric vehicles contribute to skyrocketing electricity demand. The dynamic could lead utilities to rush to reinforce the electricity grid — and pass the costs along to households.

Meanwhile, Colorado power providers like Xcel Energy are already moving forward with a rapid transition to wind and solar. Those investments could improve air quality and insulate ratepayers from volatile fossil fuel markets, but they also set the stage for repeated rate hikes for residential customers over the next decade.

Bennet’s new climate plan also offers a sharp contrast with Gov. Polis, who has pushed back against a “cap-and-trade” or “cap-and-invest” strategy as governor. In 2021, for example, Polis issued an executive order claiming the approach could work on a federal or international scale, but insisted Colorado should focus on incentives, voluntary agreements and tailored regulations to cut emissions.

Since then, his administration has approved a limited carbon trading program to cut climate-warming emissions from the state’s biggest industrial polluters. Meanwhile, it’s attempted to shift other parts of Colorado’s economy away from fossil fuels with incentives, such as generous tax credits to cut the cost of EVs and all-electric home heating systems.

“They’ve tried to keep it at arm’s length,” said Pam Kiely, an associate vice president for the Environmental Defense Fund who’s pushed Colorado to enact a cap-and-invest policy. “We think that’s been a missed opportunity.”

Kiely said she’s glad Sen. Bennet has adopted a different view of the policy scheme. Her organization, however, hasn't endorsed any candidate in the Colorado governor’s race.

The official announcement included supportive quotes from Kiley as well as the owners of a solar-powered Pueblo steel mill and the business manager for IBEW Local 68, a union representing electrical workers in metro Denver.

It’s unclear if the broader business community supports the policy outline. Cynthia Eveleth-Havens, a spokesperson for the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, said her organization needed more time to review the proposal before offering an official comment.

An initial play for Colorado climate voters

Bennet faces Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser in the upcoming Democratic primary for governor.

Weiser’s climate platform doesn’t specifically endorse cap-and invest, but calls to continue aggressive efforts to invest in low-carbon energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal.

In a written statement, Anna Huck, Weiser’s campaign manager, said Bennet’s plan leaves a lot of “open questions.” She also honed in on the senator’s support for nominees now leading President Trump’s efforts to roll back federal climate policies, such as Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, a former fossil fuel executive who insists climate change doesn't amount to a global crisis.

""Any plan to address our climate challenges does not justify his votes to confirm Trump cabinet picks like Doug Burgum, Chris Wright, Sean Duffy, and Brooke Rollins, who are now dismantling climate protections and threatening our public lands,” Huck said.

Washington and California are the only U.S. states with cap-and-invest policies covering their entire economies.

The company seems to be crossing off its last handful of things before it plans to unveil the vehicle on April Fool’s Day, just about four months away.

Tesla published three new positions for the Roadster this week, relating to Battery Manufacturing, General Manufacturing, and Vision Engineering. All three are located in Northern California, with two being at the Fremont Factory and the other at the company’s Engineering HQ in Palo Alto.

Technical Program Manager, Battery Manufacturing

Located in Fremont, this role specifically caters to the design of the Roadster to factory operations. It appears this role will mostly have to do with developing and engineering the Roadster’s battery pack and establishing the production processes for it:

“You will foster collaboration across design engineering, manufacturing, quality, facilities, and production to align with company priorities. Additionally, you will understand project opportunities, challenges, and dependencies; translate scattered information into concise, complete messages; and communicate them to every team member. As the business process development lead, you will develop, maintain, and implement tools and processes to accelerate battery manufacturing execution, achieve cross-functional alignment, and deliver highly efficient systems.”

Manufacturing Engineer, Roadster

Also located in Fremont, this role also has to deal with the concept development and launch of battery manufacturing equipment. Tesla says:

“In this role, you will take large-scale manufacturing systems for new battery products and architectures from the early concept development stage through equipment launch, optimization, and handover to local operations teams.”

Manufacturing Vision Engineer, Battery Vision

This position is in Palo Alto at Tesla’s Engineering Headquarters, and requires the design and scale of advanced inspection and control systems to next-generation battery products:

“You’ll work on automation processes that directly improve battery performance, quality, and cost, collaborating with world-class engineers in a fast-paced, hands-on environment.”

Developing and deploying 2D and 3D vision and measurement systems from proof-of-concept to deployment on high-volume battery manufacturing lines is part of the job description.

Roadster Unveiling

Tesla plans to unveil the Roadster on April 1, and although it was planned for late this year, it is nice to see the company put out a definitive date.

Musk said on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast in late October:

“Whether it’s good or bad, it will be unforgettable. My friend Peter Thiel once reflected that the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don’t have flying cars. I think if Peter wants a flying car, he should be able to buy one…I think it has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.”

Production should begin between 12 to 18 months after unveiling, so we could see it sometime in 2027.

Tesla expanded its new Full Self-Driving program, which gives people the opportunity to experience the company’s suite, in Europe.

Tesla recently launched an opportunity for Europeans to experience Full Self-Driving, not in their personal vehicles, but through a new ride-along program that initially launched in Italy, France, and Germany back in late November.

People could experience it by booking a reservation with a local Tesla showroom, but timeslots quickly filled up, making it difficult to keep up with demand. Tesla expanded the program and offered some additional times, but it also had its sights set on getting the program out to new markets.

It finally achieved that on December 9, as it launched rides in Denmark and Switzerland, adding the fourth and fifth countries to the program.

Tesla confirmed the arrival of the program to Denmark and Switzerland on X:

The program, while a major contributor to Tesla’s butts in seats strategy, is truly another way for the company to leverage its fans in an effort to work through the regulatory hurdles it is facing in Europe.

Tesla has faced significant red tape in the region, and although it has tested the FSD suite and been able to launch this ride-along program, it is still having some tremendous issues convincing regulatory agencies to allow it to give it to customers.

CEO Elon Musk has worked with regulators, but admitted the process has been “insanely painful.”

The most recent development with FSD and its potential use in Europe dealt with the Dutch approval authority, known as the RDW.

Tesla says Europe could finally get FSD in 2026, and Dutch regulator RDW is key

Tesla said it believes some regulations are “outdated and rules-based,” which makes the suite ineligible for use in the European jurisdiction.

The RDW is working with Tesla to gain approval sometime early next year, but there are no guarantees. However, Tesla’s angle with the ride-along program seems to be that if it can push consumers to experience it and have a positive time, it should be easier for it to gain its footing across Europe with regulatory agencies.

Tesla Full Self-Driving performance and statistics continue to impress everyone, from retail investors to Wall Street firms. However, one analyst believes Tesla’s driving suite is “very close” to achieving unsupervised self-driving.

On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said that Tesla’s recent launch of Full Self-Driving version 14 increased the number of miles traveled between interventions by a drastic margin, based on data compiled by a Full Self-Driving Community Tracker.

The data shows there was a significant jump in miles traveled between interventions as Tesla transitioned drivers to v14.1 back in October. The FSD Community Tracker saw a jump from 441 miles to over 9,200 miles, the most significant improvement in four years.

Interestingly, there was a slight dip in the miles traveled between interventions with the release of v14.2. Piper Sandler said investor interest in FSD has increased.

Full Self-Driving has displayed several improvements with v14, including the introduction of Arrival Options that allow specific parking situations to be chosen by the driver prior to arriving at the destination. Owners can choose from Street Parking, Parking Garages, Parking Lots, Chargers, and Driveways.

Additionally, the overall improvements in performance from v13 have been evident through smoother operation, fewer mistakes during routine operation, and a more refined decision-making process.

Early versions of v14 exhibited stuttering and brake stabbing, but Tesla did a great job of confronting the issue and eliminating it altogether with the release of v14.2.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk also recently stated that the current v14.2 FSD suite is also less restrictive with drivers looking at their phones, which has caused some controversy within the community.

Although we tested it and found there were fewer nudges by the driver monitoring system to push eyes back to the road, we still would not recommend it due to laws and regulations.

Tesla Full Self-Driving v14.2.1 texting and driving: we tested it

With that being said, FSD is improving significantly with each larger rollout, and Musk believes the final piece of the puzzle will be unveiled with FSD v14.3, which could come later this year or early in 2026.

Piper Sandler reaffirmed its $500 price target on Tesla shares, as well as its ‘Overweight’ rating.

The shorter days and colder nights, which demand reliable heating even in temperate latitudes, arrive amid increasing concerns about the country’s energy security.

The need for power has never increased this rapidly, as tech giants plan for metropolis-scale electricity to train their artificial intelligence models.

Data centers in the U.S. will make up almost half the growth in electricity demand between now and 2030, says the International Energy Agency (IEA). Driven by AI use, the U.S. economy is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminum, steel, cement and chemicals, according to the IEA. OpenAI’s data center plans alone will demand as much or more power than New York City and San Diego combined.

Add the reindustrialization of America, the electrification of transportation, and the retirement of aging and carbon-intensive generation facilities, and energy demand is increasingly threatening to outstrip supply.

Outage risk grows

“If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy,” U.S. Dept. of Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in July.

Without timely replacement of retired energy generation sources, annual outage hours could increase from single digits today to more than 800 hours per year by 2030, according to DOE calculations. Outage risk in several regions would rise more than thirtyfold, even if there are no retirements.

Power generation is only part of the energy security challenge. Transmission is another. Interregional transmission is sorely needed, says the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). Significant interconnection queues and extended permitting timelines are creating challenges for the timely deployment of new clean energy. One common issue: the remote places that are favorable for wind or solar simply lack the transmission capacity to carry the energy into the grid.

China is actively focusing on transmission development. The New York Times recently detailed the nation’s 2,000-mile-long ultra-high voltage transmission line – equivalent to the distance between Idaho and New York. It’s one of 42 transmission lines in the country, reflecting a broader global trend toward building higher-capacity infrastructure to support clean energy. The transmission line is credited with helping accelerate China’s renewable energy transformation, cutting air pollution, and even adding nearly two years to citizens’ life expectancy.

Learning from the Texas Freeze

This February will mark the fifth anniversary of the Great Texas Freeze, a powerful combination of unusually cold temperatures and power grid vulnerability. Boilers failed, roofs collapsed and pipes burst in a deep freeze driven by a polar vortex that brought Arctic temperatures as far south as Mexico. At peak, millions of people were without power, mostly in Texas, unable to get heat or cook food. Damage and economic losses exceeded $130 billion in Texas.

“During the power grid crisis, all sources of electricity struggled during the frigid temperatures,” wrote the Texas Tribune. “The inability of power plants to perform in the extreme cold was the No. 1 cause of the outages.”

The challenges have been associated with a range of factors, including deregulation and privatization. Another factor was the Texas grid’s self-reliance in a country with regional grids.

The crisis could have been worse. Officials determined that Texas was less than five minutes away from complete grid failure, which could have taken weeks or more to recover from. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) ordered rolling blackouts to avoid it.

At this point, many readers are asking how the South can get so cold as the planet is warming. It’s a paradox, but with a rational explanation. The polar vortex disruption that contributed to the freeze may have been exacerbated by disruptive warming at the North Pole. Given that possibility, it’s smart to prepare for more instability.

Securing our needs

Regardless of causal factors, widespread freeze is a possibility this winter, and energy security could be at risk under any scenario.

My co-workers and I partner with companies to prepare for resilience during extreme weather and power spikes. We encourage leaders to ask themselves, Where does my business’s power come from today, and where will I obtain what I need to succeed in the future? What steps can I take to ensure resilience against potential shortfalls, grid strains and occasional utility failures?

For some companies – especially AI data center operators, the answer to these questions is colocation, shorthand for producing the power you need on the same site where you’ll be consuming it, thereby helping to mitigate the transmission issues. You may even sell some power back to utilities.

Colocation often leverages renewable energy as the power source. (In the future, small modular nuclear reactors or even smaller microreactors, with their passive safety designs, could be part of the mix.)

Additional recommendations for companies who are intent on securing their energy security could include:

Plan: Quantify your energy needs today and over the long term, accounting for growth, new power demands and expected energy efficiencies.

Back up: Design and install adequate power backup at both the local facility and central enterprise scale. Safely store energy from colocated renewables for times when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.

Anticipate hazards: Understand and mitigate the risks of fire, flood, freeze, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail and drought. Use hazard maps in your planning.

Invest in quality: Identify and only use products with third-party certification to ensure quality and reliability, such as solar panels that can resist hail damage and equipment that doesn’t have common design flaws.

Plan early and practice. Develop a detailed response plan for power interruptions, freeze and other hazards well in advance of an incident. Run the plan as a drill, at least on a tabletop.

Watch the weather. Meteorologists can predict vortex disturbances. Advance warnings give you time to execute your freeze plans. Make sure weather monitoring is part of your winter plans.

Our world is on the cusp of dramatic transformations in computing, clean energy and electrification. With demand putting immense pressure on supply, business leaders need to make sure their energy needs are quantified, their electricity sources defined and reliable, and plans for all contingencies – including Arctic weather as far South as the Mexican border – are thoroughly developed and practiced.

The developers’ decision to withdraw the application comes ahead of Monday’s Howell Township board meeting, where a hearing on the data center and a rezoning vote were scheduled.
Howell Township resident Cory Alchin told Planet Detroit the developers’ decision to withdraw the application is a victory for his many neighbors who oppose the data center.
Ryan Van Gilder, whose family owns property within the footprint of the data center, did not respond to a request for comment.
Over 3,700 people signed a petition to “Stop the Construction of Michigan’s Largest Data Center in Howell” as of Monday morning.","The developers of a $1 billion data center in Howell Township withdrew a rezoning request for the project following months of pushback from residents concerned about the facility’s water use and impact on energy costs, among other issues.

The applicants are withdrawing the conditional rezoning application “after listening carefully to the community and giving this decision a great deal of thought,” according to a statement on the project’s Facebook page posted late Sunday.

“We believe the right thing to do now is to honor the current moratorium, which will give the township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers,” the Facebook post said.

The Howell Township board passed a six-month moratorium on data center developments Nov. 20.

With the moratorium in place, the township could have voted on rezoning land, township attorney Christopher Patterson told Planet Detroit Monday — but the site plan for the data center couldn’t have moved forward unless the applicant requested a waiver.

The developers’ decision to withdraw the application comes ahead of Monday’s Howell Township board meeting, where a hearing on the data center and a rezoning vote were scheduled. The agenda items have been removed, according to a statement posted Monday afternoon on the township website.

The developers may return when the moratorium ends, Township Treasurer and Zoning Administrator Jonathan Hohenstein told Planet Detroit.

“‎The communication from the applicant makes it sound like once the regulations are complete, they will resubmit their application; time will tell,” Hohenstein said in a Monday email.

Howell Township resident Cory Alchin told Planet Detroit the developers’ decision to withdraw the application is a victory for his many neighbors who oppose the data center.

More work is needed to ensure that data center ordinances “protect the health and safety of the township and its residents,” he said.

Howell Township resident: ‘We are setting a precedent’

The Howell Township project, from developers Stantec Consulting Michigan Inc. and Randee LLC, was planned for a 1,077-acre site of largely agricultural land north of I-96, roughly 54 miles from Detroit.

Stantec spokesperson Trevor Eckart declined to comment when asked whether the developer plans to move forward with the data center when the moratorium ends.

Ryan Van Gilder, whose family owns property within the footprint of the data center, did not respond to a request for comment.

Hundreds of residents attended a Sept. 23 Howell Township Planning Meeting that lasted for seven hours, with many raising concerns about potential impacts to water resources, electricity costs, and environmental impacts, WDIV reported.

Over 3,700 people signed a petition to “Stop the Construction of Michigan’s Largest Data Center in Howell” as of Monday morning.

The Howell Township Planning Commission voted not to recommend rezoning land for the project on Sept. 23, and the Livingston County Planning Commission voted against it Nov. 19. The township board has final say over the rezoning decision.

Data centers’ often massive water and energy needs have stoked fears in other Michigan communities over how the facilities could harm drinking water wells, pass on costs to other electric ratepayers, and jeopardize state climate goals.

The facilities’ electricity demands risk triggering an “off ramp” provision in the state’s climate law, allowing fossil fuel generation to stay online if there’s a capacity shortage.

Howell Township Assessor and Deputy Supervisor Brent Kilpela said in a Sept. 4 email to property owner Van Gilder that the project “is like winning the Power Ball for the local municipalities. Roads could be paved etc.”

Kilpela previously told Planet Detroit the data center could increase tax revenue by a factor of six or seven.

Township resident Alchin said people from 10 communities across the country have been in touch with Howell Township residents, sharing similar experiences of data center developers going into rural townships with ordinances that aren’t well designed and trying to rush through projects, Alchin said.

“We are setting a precedent for people to follow and have faith in, across the country,” Alchin said. “The key was that people kept showing up and kept showing up.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HowellRendering-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 15:02:33.318134

Restoring Proper Scope The PERMIT Act reforms Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which governs state water quality certifications for federally permitted projects.
The PERMIT Act narrows that authority to its proper scope by restoring clearer limits on federal jurisdiction.
The PERMIT Act does not eliminate environmental protections.","The Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today Act (“PERMIT” Act, H.R. 3898) reforms the Clean Water Act’s permitting process to reduce delays while still ensuring adequate impact analyses are performed. This bill aims to restore predictability, timeliness, and accountability to a permitting system that has become ineffective and lead to reduced energy supply and higher costs for Americans.

Ending Permitting Legal Limbo

One of the core problems with the Clean Water Act permitting structure is that agencies face few meaningful deadlines and projects can be stuck in the courts for years. Energy pipelines, power plants, transmission lines, ports, and manufacturing facilities can sit in agency review for years with no final decision. Even when permits are issued, litigation often resets the process entirely.

The PERMIT Act responds by setting clear limits on when and how court challenges may be brought. For approvals of state permit programs, for individual or general permits, and for verifications that an activity is covered by a general permit, any lawsuit must be filed within 60 days of the approval, permit issuance, or verification. Only parties that submitted sufficiently detailed comments during the public comment period may sue, and the suit must relate to those comments. In response to a successful lawsuit, courts may not vacate a permit unless there is an imminent and substantial danger to human health or the environment and no other equitable remedy is available.

By providing certainty to the timelines in permitting, the bill reduces the financial risk of infrastructure investment and lowers the cost of capital for building new projects. These lower financing costs on projects can be passed along to consumers through lower utility bills and lower prices for goods produced using that energy.

Restoring Proper Scope

The PERMIT Act reforms Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which governs state water quality certifications for federally permitted projects. This Section has been used to halt projects such as natural gas pipelines or power plants due to the overly broad application of water quality standards. The PERMIT Act keeps the existing outside limit that a certification decision may not take more than one year, but it breaks that period into concrete steps so developers can track where their project is in the pipeline and ensure that their investment does not sit idle.

Further restoring the scope of the federal government to a more reasonable level, the PERMIT Act also reforms how federal jurisdiction over water is defined. Interpretations of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) by the Biden and Obama Administrations allow expansive federal control over isolated wetlands, seasonal streams, roadside ditches, and dry land that may only hold water part of the year. This overreach forces otherwise local projects into years of federal review even when environmental impacts are minimal.

The PERMIT Act narrows that authority to its proper scope by restoring clearer limits on federal jurisdiction. This ensures that truly navigable waters remain regulated while preventing the federal government from federalizing nearly every construction project in the country. When fewer projects are dragged into duplicative federal review, infrastructure moves faster and costs fall.

Demolishing Duplicative Processes

The PERMIT Act streamlines duplication between state and federal regulators. When a state assumes authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the bill requires Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to act on that request within fixed timelines. The bill also requires the EPA to revise its regulations to encourage more state assumption. This reduces the problem of applicants being forced through layered permitting systems where multiple agencies review the same environmental impacts under different frameworks.

By limiting the ability of agencies to run endless studies after an application is submitted and ensuring that once regulators formally identify what information is required within the defined early windows, they cannot keep resetting the process with new demands later, the PERMIT Act reduces regulatory burdens while still ensuring that the necessary studies to issue the permit are completed.

The PERMIT Act does not eliminate environmental protections. It restores balance, predictability, and accountability to a system that has drifted far from its original mission. By breaking the government-imposed logjam on energy and infrastructure development, H.R. 3898 helps unlock America’s energy supply, lower prices, and reduce costs for American families.",https://epicforamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/getty-images-AqZTVnZZ3xQ-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:01:51.796688

Governor Henry McMaster and other top state leaders are scheduled to attend the South Carolina Nuclear Summit on Tuesday, which will focus on the state’s future nuclear landscape.

The summit will feature a series of fireside chats and panels discussing the potential for the state’s nuclear sector. Organizers describe this year’s event as a celebration of South Carolina’s emergence as a proving ground for America’s next nuclear era.

Key State Assets

The state’s nuclear prominence is anchored by several major assets, including the V.C. Summer site, the Westinghouse Fuel Fabrication Facility, the Savannah River Site, the Savannah River National Laboratory, and Joint Base Charleston.

These institutions collectively position South Carolina as the state most capable of advancing the national agenda for securing energy dominance, enhancing national security, and improving global competitiveness in the nuclear field.

King",,,,,https://www.dbusiness.com/daily-news/fords-new-european-strategy-includes-ev-partnership-with-frances-renault/,"A key element of the strategy is an electric vehicle and commercial vehicle partnership with France-based Renault Group.
While leveraging shared architecture for efficiency, Ford will lead the design and driving dynamics to ensure these vehicles are distinctly Ford.
“Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” says Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe.
Ford’s strategy for Europe is designed to navigate Europe’s evolving CO2 emission regulations, providing customers with a range of affordable, multi-energy options during the transition to electrification.
Aggressive CO2 targets on commercial vehicles unfairly penalize the small and medium-sized businesses that generate more than 50 percent of Europe’s GDP.","Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn today announced the next phase of its European strategy, reinforcing its commitment to the region for both retail and commercial customers with a strategy focused on agility, cost efficiency, and a sharpened brand promise.

A key element of the strategy is an electric vehicle and commercial vehicle partnership with France-based Renault Group.

The agreement includes jointly developing two Ford-branded electric passenger vehicles on Renault’s Ampere platform, arriving in showrooms in 2028. While leveraging shared architecture for efficiency, Ford will lead the design and driving dynamics to ensure these vehicles are distinctly Ford.

The companies also signed a letter of intend to explore the joint development and manufacture of Ford- and Renault-branded light commercial vehicles, leveraging common platforms to drive industrial scale.

“Our plan is about unleashing the Blue Oval,” says Jim Baumbick, president of Ford Europe. “We are leveraging strategic partnerships to ensure competitiveness, but we are obsessing over the product. These will be fun-to-drive, fully connected vehicles that stand out from the crowd.”

In addition to the collaboration with Renault, Ford’s strategy for Europe includes further strengthening its Ford Pro commercial vehicle division and optimizing its industrial system to drive scale and cost efficiencies.

Building toward a sustainably profitable business in Europe, Ford’s next chapter will see a new product offensive driven by the introduction of new multi-energy, affordable cars, and commercial vehicles designed to support customer choice on their journey to electrification and boost the company’s competitiveness in an aggressive market.

The planned new vehicles will enhance Ford’s existing product range and are expected to arrive in showrooms in 2028.

“As an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,” says Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford. “How we compete here — how we innovate, partner, and invest — will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.”

Ford Pro, according to the automaker, continues to be the engine of the company’s European business. The division is moving beyond hardware to offer a comprehensive ecosystem of software and services. By turning billions of vehicle data points into actionable intelligence, the Ford Live Uptime system delivered an estimated 820,000 additional days of vehicle uptime to European businesses in 2024 alone.

Ford says it’s evolving its industrial operations in Europe, designed to support the shift to multi-energy vehicles and deliver customer choice. Ford’s Valencia plant is expected to continue to play a critical role in realizing Ford’s plan for an enhanced passenger vehicle portfolio in Europe.

Ford’s strategy for Europe is designed to navigate Europe’s evolving CO2 emission regulations, providing customers with a range of affordable, multi-energy options during the transition to electrification. The current share of electric vehicles in Europe is steady at 16.1 percent, far below the required 25 percent of new vehicle registrations required to meet Europe’s strict CO2 targets by 2025.

“We need to enable everyone to benefit from electrification and letting customers choose – whether that’s fully electric or hybrid vehicles,” says Baumbick. “It is about making the transition more attractive and more affordable for all consumers and businesses, stimulating demand rather than stifling it.”

Ford proposes three steps to ensure a successful transition:

Align Targets with Reality. We must align CO2 targets with actual market adoption and provide automakers with a realistic and reliable 10-year planning horizon. This includes giving consumers the option to drive hybrid vehicles for longer, bridging the gap rather than forcing a leap they aren’t ready to take.

Incentivize the Transition: European manufacturers have invested hundreds of billions in EVs. Governments must match that commitment with consistent purchase incentives and a charging infrastructure that extends beyond wealthy urban centers into the rural heartland.

Support the Working Economy: The current approach to commercial vehicles is an economic tax on the backbone of Europe. Only 8 percent of new vans are electric. These vehicles are tools for plumbers, florists, and builders. Aggressive CO2 targets on commercial vehicles unfairly penalize the small and medium-sized businesses that generate more than 50 percent of Europe’s GDP.

“With nearly half a million sales under the Maverick’s belt, Ford is updating the hardware and software in ways that make it both a better truck and a friskier, more fun commuter,” MotorTrend wrote.

“Over two weeks of intensive truck testing, the Ford quickly distinguished itself amid our field of two new and three revised contenders against our six key criteria: performance of intended function, engineering excellence, advancement in design, efficiency, value, and safety.”",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/12/FordInEurope800.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:02:44.473030

Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his administration that paused all leasing, permitting and approvals for wind projects, killing tens of thousands of jobs across the country. Since then, the administration has rescinded permits for offshore wind projects, halted projects that were 80 percent completed, and gutted tax credits allocated for wind energy projects—all to weaken the rapidly growing wind energy industry.

Prior to Donald Trump’s assault on wind energy, the industry was one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country. At the end of 2024, the wind sector employed nearly 150,000 Americans. Because of the administration’s attacks on wind, at least 17,000 jobs are in jeopardy in the offshore wind industry alone.

In May, the Sierra Club joined nine other environmental groups in an amicus brief arguing that “the administration's ‘Wind Directive’ is arbitrary and not based in science, lacks a clear purpose or timeline, and jeopardizes climate goals and public health.”

In response, Sierra Club Senior Advisor Nancy Pyne issued the following statement:

“The decision from the Federal Court is a victory for everyone who pays an electricity bill, is part of the clean energy workforce, and breathes air. Americans need cheaper and more reliable energy that does not come at the expense of our health and futures. We are glad to see this illegal order get vacated, and we will continue to advocate for more wind energy projects across the country to lower the cost of energy and create stable, union jobs in our communities.

The Court left in place another finding by EPA that allows Michigan to avoid some of the Clean Air Act’s other nonattainment requirements.
For nearly a decade, ozone pollution in Detroit has been above the air quality standard.","DETROIT, Mich. -- Detroit area residents will be able to breathe easier as Sierra Club’s latest win for clean air will result in stronger pollution standards at a time when asthma rates in the region are rising. The legal victory [link to opinion] comes after the Sierra Club and the Great Lakes Environmental Law Center sued EPA in 2023, challenging two EPA rulemakings under the Clean Air Act that allowed Michigan to move the Detroit area from “nonattainment” with ground-level ozone standards to “attainment” -- a label that allowed the state to avoid stricter air regulations and more robust permitting for new sources of pollution. The Detroit area has long suffered from bad air days caused by high ozone pollution levels, along with disproportionate levels of asthma and other health harms associated with ground-level ozone.

“Without this victory, EPA’s decisions would have let Michigan avoid the rules needed to reduce pollution and keep the air we breathe safe. At a time when asthma rates are rising in Detroit, especially in Black communities, that’s unacceptable. With the backing of this federal court decision, our community will continue to push the state of Michigan to take much-needed action to relieve ozone pollution in this area,” said Dr. Dolores Leonard, Sierra Club member and longtime advocate for Detroit environmental justice causes.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit agreed with Sierra Club that EPA acted unlawfully, and struck down EPA’s decision that the area could be redesignated to attainment. As a result, stricter air rules for sources of ozone precursor pollution will need to be put in place for the area, and stricter permitting rules will apply for new major sources of air pollution seeking to locate in the area. The Court left in place another finding by EPA that allows Michigan to avoid some of the Clean Air Act’s other nonattainment requirements.

Elena Saxonhouse, Managing Attorney, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program and counsel in the litigation said, “The decision puts Southeastern Michigan back on a path towards cleaner air and better health outcomes. It also closes an EPA-created Clean Air Act loophole, which made it easier for states to avoid the stricter requirements that come into play each time an ozone nonattainment area misses a deadline to attain federal health standards. ”

Nick Leonard, Executive Director, Great Lakes Environmental Law Center and counsel in the litigation said, “This ruling holds Michigan and EPA accountable for their failure to follow the Clean Air Act and take action to lower ozone pollution in Southeast Michigan. For nearly a decade, ozone pollution in Detroit has been above the air quality standard. Many residents impacted by this pollution struggle with extremely high rates of asthma. This decision is an important step forward for public health in Detroit and Southeast Michigan.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-09 12:02:25.547878

Still, Jones says his group is talking with members of Congress, and he expects a bill for a data center moratorium soonish.","A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

More than 230 groups have signed on to a letter calling for a national pause on new data centers that power AI. They cite the risk of higher utility bills and environmental concerns. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady.

JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: The group Food & Water Watch drafted the moratorium letter to members of Congress as communities grapple with proposals to build the large energy-hungry campuses. Mitch Jones with the group says the country needs to pause and let regulations catch up.

MITCH JONES: And let's figure out if it's possible to do this in a way that is going to be safe for the environment, that is going to preserve water for communities, that is not going to drive up people's already increasing electricity prices.

BRADY: Jones argues Congress could regulate data center construction by giving the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, more oversight. Data centers use a lot of water for cooling. He says that's another possibility for regulation. Or, he says, data center construction could be made subject to existing federal environmental laws. Other groups signing the letter include Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Physicians for Social Responsibility. The industry group Data Center Coalition says halting construction would jeopardize digital infrastructure that's essential to contemporary life and risk U.S. economic competitiveness.

Much of the fight over data center construction is before state and local governments. President Trump wrote on social media Monday that he plans an executive order to curb state laws limiting data center development, but that likely would be challenged in court. This call for a national moratorium on new data centers echoes a Food & Water Watch campaign from a generation back against hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas.

JONES: Well, we called for a national ban on fracking as well, actually, and had legislation introduced in Congress to do that on multiple occasions.

BRADY: That effort failed, and gas drilling is booming. Still, Jones says his group is talking with members of Congress, and he expects a bill for a data center moratorium soonish.

The report said that 85% of all new power generation capacity from January through September of this year was solar power and energy storage.
The SEIA/WoodMac said the top states for new solar installations include Texas, the nation’s leader in renewable energy capacity.
Utah enters the list after bringing two utility-scale solar projects online totaling more than 1 GW of capacity.
“But the U.S. solar industry has more potential.","The U.S. solar power industry installed 11.7 GW of new generation in the third quarter of this year, according to a report from Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). It’s the third-largest quarterly gain on record, and moves total solar installations in 2025 above the 30-GW level.

The groups’ U.S. Solar Market Insight Q4 2025 report released December 9 (read the executive summary here) noted that 73% of all new solar capacity installed in the U.S. has been added in so-called “red states,” those won by Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election. That’s notable because the Trump administration has supported fossil fuels, and taken actions to limit renewable energy, since starting his second term in January.

The report said that 85% of all new power generation capacity from January through September of this year was solar power and energy storage.

The SEIA/WoodMac said the top states for new solar installations include Texas, the nation’s leader in renewable energy capacity. Others on the list are Indiana, Florida, Arizona, Ohio, Utah, Kentucky, and Arkansas. Utah enters the list after bringing two utility-scale solar projects online totaling more than 1 GW of capacity. The other two states in the top 10 for new installations are California and Illinois.

A memo from the U.S. Dept. of the Interior (DOI) in July, along with several other actions by the Trump administration, have impeding utility-scale solar and storage projects, according to the report. The groups cited “significant business uncertainty” due to “the absence of clarity from DOI on permitting timelines or project approvals.” SEIA in November released an analysis of Energy Information Administration data that showed more than 73 GW of solar projects have permits pending, and are vulnerable to what it called politically-motivated delays or cancellations.

“This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper, who has announced she will step down from her post in January of next year. “Remarkable growth in Texas, Indiana, Utah, and other states won by President Trump shows just how decisively the market is moving toward solar. But unless this administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable, and reliable solar and storage will be frozen by uncertainty and Americans will continue to see their energy bills go up. America’s manufacturing surge, our global competitiveness, and billions of dollars in private investment are on the line.”

The groups on Tuesday said that with the opening of two new solar module manufacturing facilities in Louisiana and South Carolina, totaling 4.7 GW of production, the U.S. has now added 17.7 GW of new module manufacturing capacity this year. The recent opening of a new wafer facility in Michigan means that domestic manufacturers can now produce every major component of the solar module supply chain.

“We expect 250 gigawatts of solar to be installed from 2025—2030,” said Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie and lead author of the report. “But the U.S. solar industry has more potential. Wood Mackenzie is tracking substantial increases in power demand across the nation. The solar industry would be well-positioned to meet more of this new demand if existing constraints were alleviated, presenting upside to our forecast.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bechtel-is-adding-900-megawatts-of-new-renewable-power-to-mammoth-solar-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:04:04.794591

Funding will help address homes that are unable to benefit from weatherization programs because of pre-existing health and safety issues

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are awarding $125,000 in microgrants to South Carolina nonprofits that will help bolster existing programs that help make the necessary repairs that enable households to become eligible for energy efficiency improvements and long-term cost savings.

Why it matters: Many homes across the Palmetto State are unable to benefit from weatherization programs because of pre-existing health and safety issues, such as roof leaks, electrical hazards, mold, pest infestations or structural deficiencies that must be addressed before energy efficiency upgrades can occur.

Where the money goes: Qualified nonprofit organizations that prepare income challenged households for participation in energy efficiency and weatherization initiatives applied for grants up to $20,000 through a request for proposals process launched in September:

Citizens United for Redevelopment and Economic Stability of Chester ($10,000)

City of Florence ($10,000)

Emmanuel’s Hammer ($20,000)

Habitat for Humanity Greenville County ($20,000)

Habitat for Humanity of York County ($10,000)

Helping Florence Flourish ($10,000)

Rebuild Upstate ($5,000)

Sumter United Ministries ($20,000)

United Way of Hartsville ($20,000)

Our view

Jerry Dudley, Planning Director, City of Florence, S.C.: “The Duke Energy Foundation grant will enhance the city’s Weatherization and Rehabilitation Program by funding critical home repairs for income-challenged households. Several homeowners are in urgent need of roof repairs. These grant dollars will help extend the reach of the city’s program, allowing us to serve more families and address essential housing needs.”

John Lattimore, Chief Program Officer, Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County: “Habitat for Humanity of Greenville County is excited and honored to continue our partnership with Duke Energy and their commitment to providing a better quality of life for families in need. This specific funding will help provide warm, safe and dry conditions through critical home repairs for several deserving families. The need is great in our community and partners like Duke Energy allow us to meet more of that need.”

Tim Pearson, President, Duke Energy’s South Carolina: “Many homes in our state have underlying safety issues that prevent homeowners from participating in energy efficiency and weatherization programs that can significantly moderate energy bills and decrease the growing demand on the energy grid. Recent legislative efforts have made it clear energy efficiency is critical to our long-term efforts to respond to growth in our state, and Duke Energy continues to look at new ways of expanding energy saving opportunities for our customers.”

Saving energy and money: In addition to these grants, Duke Energy Progress launched a pilot program in South Carolina in 2024 offering free energy improvements to qualifying households based on income and energy use. And in 2025, Duke Energy increased incentives and eligibility for many of its energy efficiency and demand response programs in South Carolina, expanding ways customers can save money and energy.

Click here for previous votes.

Michael Lawler (R), District 17 (including Philipstown)

Lawler, 38, was elected to Congress in 2022 and re-elected in 2024. From 2021 to 2022, he was a Republican member of the state Assembly from the 97th district in Rockland County. A graduate of Suffern High School, he holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting and finance from Manhattan College. He is a former director of the state Republican Party and former deputy supervisor of Orangetown.

Pat Ryan (D), District 18 (including Beacon)

Ryan, 43, was elected to Congress in 2022 and re-elected in 2024. Formerly the county executive of Ulster, he grew up in Kingston and holds a bachelor’s degree in international politics from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and a master’s degree in security studies from Georgetown. Ryan served in the U.S. Army as a combat intelligence officer from 2004 to 2009, including two tours in Iraq. He is also a former technology executive.

Children and Social Security Cards

The House on Dec. 1, by unanimous vote, passed the Social Security Child Protection Act (H.R. 5348), sponsored by Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), to require the Social Security Administration to issue a new Social Security number to any child less than 14 years old if the child’s Social Security card was lost or stolen in the mail. Smucker called the change “a simple fix to protect our children and make the process of interacting with the Social Security Administration easier.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Loans to Burma

The House on Dec. 1, by unanimous vote, passed the No New Burma Funds Act (H.R. 4423), sponsored by Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.), to require the U.S. representative at the World Bank’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to press for the bank to continue its halt to financial aid for Burma, due to Burma’s military coup in 2021. Williams said “this legislation gives our country yet another tool to put financial pressure on the Burmese government.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Small Business Regulations

The House on Dec. 3, by a 223-190 vote, passed the Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act (H.R. 2965), sponsored by Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas), to require the Small Business Administration to ensure that its annual regulatory budget, which is the net cost of federal regulations for that year, is no greater than zero. Van Duyne said the bill “moves the needle toward empowering small businesses by reducing red tape.” A bill opponent, Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), said it “may sound good on the surface, but it will have the practical effect of limiting the SBA from issuing any rules, even if the benefits outweigh the costs.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Hotline for Small Business Regulations

The House on Dec. 3, by a 269-146 vote, passed the Destroying Unnecessary, Misaligned and Prohibitive Red Tape Act (H.R. 4305), sponsored by Rep. Tony Wied (R-Wis.), to require the Small Business Administration to develop a communications hotline for small businesses to tell the SBA about regulatory compliance burdens. Wied called the hotline “a commonsense way to gather input directly from the people most harmed by overregulation to allow Congress to take meaningful action.” An opponent, Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-N.Y.), said: “The bill lacks adequate reporting mechanisms to identify who is making the submissions, leaving it vulnerable to abuse.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

China and Public Schools

The House on Dec. 3, by a 242-176 vote, passed the Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems Act (H.R. 1005), sponsored by Rep. David Joyce (R-Ohio). The bill would condition federal funding for a public school on the school not having taken funds from China’s government, and require public schools to inform the Education Department of their receipt of funds from any foreign source. Joyce said: “As China seeks greater influence in education across the globe, we should take commonsense steps to protect our children and maintain the integrity of the U.S. system of schools.” An opponent, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), said: “This bill would compel schools to implement new reporting mechanisms, monitoring procedures, and compliance structures despite the complete absence of any factual verified threats.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

The House on Dec. 4, by a 247-164 vote, passed the Promoting Responsible Oversight to Eliminate Communist Teachings for Our Kids Act (H.R. 1069), sponsored by Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), to block federal funding to public schools that, either directly or indirectly, have ties to China’s government. Hern said the ban was needed because China’s leaders were “succeeding in their mission to indoctrinate American students with their Communist ideals.” An opponent, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), questioned whether the bill addressed an actual problem, and said it “would create significant administrative burdens to our schools and chill community investment in our children.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Foreign Influence in Schools

The House on Dec. 4, by a 247-166 vote, passed the Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Contributions to Education Act (H.R. 1049), sponsored by Rep. Aaron Bean (R-Fla.), to condition federal funding to local school districts on the districts informing students’ parents of their right to request and receive information regarding foreign influence in schools. Bean said: “We cannot allow our students, the future of our great nation, to be corrupted by foreign adversaries who are systematically and aggressively attempting to influence our nation’s K-12 schools.” A bill opponent, Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), said it “burdens our already overstretched schools with new reporting requirements, new paperwork, and new bureaucratic hurdles, all without adding a single dollar to help them meet their obligations.”

Michael Lawler (R-17, including Philipstown) voted yes

Pat Ryan (D-18, including Beacon) voted yes

Along with roll call votes this week, the House also passed:

The SBA Fraud Enforcement Extension Act (H.R. 4495), to extend the statute of limitations for fraud under certain pandemic programs;

The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act (H.R. 4323), to provide for the vacating of certain convictions and expungement of certain arrests of victims of human trafficking;

Reviewing Slate of Nominees

The Senate on Dec. 4, by a 43-37 vote, rejected a cloture motion to end debate on a bill (S. Res. 520), sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), that would consider, en bloc, a set of 88 executive branch nominees, including ambassadorships, military posts, and about a dozen state-level U.S. attorneys. Thune said en bloc consideration would help the Senate nearly clear President Trump’s “nominations backlog by the end of his first year, in contrast to the situation, at this point, in President Trump’s first term and President Biden’s.” An opponent, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said: “This nominee package is a perfect symbol of what this majority has been about from Day One: bowing to Donald Trump, rubberstamping his unqualified loyalists, and chipping away at the Senate’s role as a check on a highly abusive executive.” A three-fifths majority was required.

Alaska Oil and Natural Gas Development

The Senate on Dec. 4, by a 49-45 vote, passed a bill (H.J. Res. 131), sponsored by Rep. Nicholas Begich (R-Alaska), to nullify a Bureau of Land Management rule issued in December that placed a majority of land in a specified portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off-limits for oil and natural gas production leases. A supporter, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), said: “This resolution will help people live longer. It will help our country be stronger in terms of American energy. It will vindicate the rule of law after Joe Biden and Secretary Haaland blatantly violated it.” An opponent, Sen.

EWG, through testing, research and advocacy, has for decades called for an end to the use of toxic flame retardants.
Health risks from flame retardants The study examined two major classes of flame retardants – PBDEs and OPFRs, or organophosphate flame retardants – that have been widely used since the 1970s to meet flammability standards.

Reducing exposure to flame retardants If you’re concerned about flame retardants, here are some tips.","Foam-containing furniture sitting in your home for years can be a hidden source of harmful flame retardant exposure. Removing these old sofas and chairs can lower the amount of one type of flame retardant in your body, finds a newly published study by EWG and others(link is external).

Levels of the flame retardant class of chemicals known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, or PBDEs, decreased two to four times faster in study participants who removed the furniture than in those who didn’t.

The study, led by the California Department of Public Health and partners, including EWG, supports the state’s decision more than a decade ago to revise its furniture flammability standards, reducing the reliance on toxic flame retardants.

In 2020, Congress adopted the updated state standard.

These victories help protect families from harmful chemicals in upholstered furniture.

They were possible only after years of work by advocates and researchers who exposed the health risks of flame retardants and challenged misleading industry claims justifying their use. EWG, through testing, research and advocacy, has for decades called for an end to the use of toxic flame retardants.

But even though the safer furniture standards apply to new sales, families may continue to be exposed to these toxic chemicals, since flame retardants remain widespread in furniture already in use, as well as car seats, electronics and more.

Health risks from flame retardants

The study examined two major classes of flame retardants – PBDEs and OPFRs, or organophosphate flame retardants – that have been widely used since the 1970s to meet flammability standards. These chemicals have been added to many everyday products, including upholstered furniture like chairs and couches.

These products can emit the chemicals in house dust, contaminating rooms nearby. Exposure to flame retardant chemicals has been linked to serious health harms, including cancer, neurotoxicity, thyroid disease, pre-term birth and decreased fertility, as well as deficits in motor skills, attention and IQ in children.

People can ingest flame retardants in dust, inhale them from the air and absorb them through skin. Infants and young children are especially at risk since they crawl and play on the floor, where contaminated dust settles, and then frequently put their hands in their mouths.

Benefits of removing older furniture

Could taking older furniture out of homes reduce the amount of PBDEs and OPFRs detected in people’s blood and urine? That’s what the study set out to find.

Researchers from EWG, among other groups, launched their collaboration in 2015. The California Department of Public Health, the California Environmental Protection Agency, Silent Spring, the Green Science Policy Institute, the Sequoia Foundation and the University of California, Davis, also participated in the project.

Focusing on a few dozen California households, the investigation tracked how removing furniture made before 2014 affected levels of flame retardants in study participants.

In 2013 the Golden State updated its furniture flammability standards, no longer requiring the use of chemical flame retardants.

Study participants collected household dust before and after removing a couch or couch foam. Results of the dust tests released in 2021 showed a drop in the amount of flame retardants in dust, both PBDE and OPFRs, found after the furniture was removed and replaced.

The study’s most recent published findings build on the 2021 results by showing that PBDE levels in participants’ blood also dropped much faster in those who had removed older foam-containing furniture made with these chemicals than in a control group who did not replace their furniture.

In the study, removing or replacing furniture did not significantly affect OPFR levels, since people are likely exposed to OPFRs from other sources, including electronics and vehicles, in addition to furniture.

Science backs safer policy

Ditching sources of flame retardant exposure may benefit health, according to the new findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Pollution.

A different study(link is external) found that during the approximately seven years after PBDEs were no longer used in furniture, levels of the chemicals detected in breast milk dropped by nearly 40%.

Furniture makers started using flame retardants following California’s decision, in 1975, to issue a flawed furniture flammability rule. Use of large amounts of flame retardants in polyurethane foam cushioning was one way to comply with the rule.

To avoid manufacturing products for California that were different from the rest of the U.S., national companies added flame retardants to items such as furniture and carpets.

Scientists warned about the health risks of flame retardant chemicals in furniture, urging a policy change to discourage the use of flame retardants because the chemicals didn’t lower fire risks or improve safety.

The state finally updated the rule in 2013 to end a requirement for using the chemicals in manufacturing furniture.

Furniture made today is less likely to contain harmful flame retardants. But older furniture continues to be a possible source of exposure, even years after it was manufactured.

Reducing exposure to flame retardants

If you’re concerned about flame retardants, here are some tips.

Buy products made without flame retardants, if possible. It’s easiest when shopping for couches, easy chairs and kids’ products, because flame retardants are no longer required in these types of furnishings.

It’s more difficult to avoid flame retardants in car seats and nearly impossible to avoid in cars and electronics. For car seats, look for flame-retardant-free products from Nuna, Clek (Mammoth or Railroad models) and Britax Grow, for example.

And take these simple precautions to minimize your exposure:",https://www.ewg.org/themes/custom/ewg/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-09 11:05:48.855836

However, recent federal policy changes have created near-term uncertainty, complicating permitting, procurement and supply-chain planning. Despite a 12% drop in module prices, elevated U.S. tariffs have pushed commercial and utility-scale system costs higher. These policy and tariff pressures are squeezing margins and heightening project risk. A few prominent players in this industry that solar investors may like to watch are Sunrun RUN, Canadian Solar CSIQ, FTC Solar FTCI and Tigo Energy, Inc. TYGO.

About the Industry

The Zacks Solar industry can be fundamentally categorized into two groups of companies. While one is involved in designing and producing high-efficiency solar modules, panels and cells, the other is engaged in installing grids and, in some cases, entire solar power systems. The industry also includes a handful of companies that manufacture inverters for solar power systems, which convert solar power from modules into electricity required by electric grids. Per a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (“SEIA”), published on Dec. 8, 2025, solar accounted for 58% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid through the third quarter of 2025, with more than 30 gigawatt (GW) installed. Hence, it remains the nation's dominant form of new generating capacity.

3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Solar Industry

Strong Momentum Lifts Outlook: Utilities, businesses, and households are increasingly adopting solar power — especially systems paired with battery storage — to advance decarbonization, strengthen energy resilience and protect against rising electricity prices. As reported by SEIA, the U.S. solar industry installed 11.7 GWdc of new solar capacity during the third quarter of 2025, reflecting a 20% year-over-year increase. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) reported that solar remains the fastest-growing source of new electric-generating capacity, driven by the rapid buildout of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) projects by utilities and independent power producers. The EIA reported improvement in project timelines — just 20% of planned solar capacity faced delays in the third quarter of 2025, down from 25% a year ago. EIA also stated that developers further expect to bring 32 GW of new solar capacity online between October 2025 and September 2026. Such strong growth indicators and declining project bottlenecks should bode well for U.S. solar stocks.

Regulatory Friction Rises, Yet Industry Fundamentals Remain Strong: The U.S. government has recently implemented several policy measures that may create near-term headwinds for the nation’s solar industry, with the most consequential being the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Signed into law in July, the OBBBA sharply curtails a number of federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act and introduces new Foreign Entity of Concern (“FEOC”) requirements that could restrict access to key components and supply chains. According to SEIA’s December 2025 report, the industry has spent the months following the bill’s passage adjusting to a policy landscape that remains fluid and far from settled. Developers continue to face uncertainty around federal permitting decisions, and detailed Treasury guidance on FEOC compliance is still expected to take months to materialize. As a result, planning and procurement have become more complex. Even so, SEIA’s base-case outlook for 2025-2030 suggests 246 GWdc of total solar installations, which effectively remained unchanged from its September 2025 projection. This indicates that long-term demand remains resilient despite the new challenges.

Rising Tariff Pressures Strain Solar Economics: The heightened U.S. tariffs on imported goods have been negatively impacting nearly all industries, and solar is no exception. As expected, these tariffs have increased manufacturing costs for solar companies, which were already grappling with raw-material shortages due to global supply-chain challenges. According to SEIA report, module prices fell an average of 12% year over year across all segments, caused by expanded manufacturing capacity and higher-output Topcon cell technology. Residential system prices declined 3%, as lower module and inverter costs offset increases in other categories.

SEIA also mentioned that commercial system pricing rose 9% in the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to a 50% year-over-year surge in balance-of-electrical-system and racking costs, which more than offset savings from cheaper modules. Utility-scale costs also climbed — fixed-tilt systems increased 9%, while single-axis tracking systems rose 10%. These increases stem largely from an 8% rise in balance-of-electrical-system costs tied to new commodity tariffs. Labor costs rose 15% year over year, and EPC overhead and margins jumped nearly 40%, reflecting greater project risk amid ongoing policy and tariff uncertainty.

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”) has public noticed a document titled:

Draft NPDES General Permit for Discharges from Data Center Facilities to State Waters (“Draft General Permit”).

See Public Notice No. 215991.

The document is a draft Clean Water Act General National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) Permit for statewide regulation of data center discharges.

A Clean Water Act NPDES individual permit is written to reflect site-specific conditions or a single discharger based on information submitted by that discharger in a permit application. It is unique to that discharger.

In contrast, an NPDES General Permit is written to cover multiple dischargers with similar operations and types of discharges. They are written based on the permit writer’s professional knowledge of those types of activities and discharges.

Individual permits are issued directly to an individual discharger but in the case of a general permit, it is issued with no particular facility in mind. In other words, multiple dischargers can obtain coverage under that general permit after it is issued, if consistent with the permit eligibility and authorization provisions.

Dischargers covered under general permits are informed of their applicable requirements before obtaining coverage under that permit. As a result, obtaining coverage under a general permit is typically faster than an individual permit with coverage under a general permit often occurring immediately.

The OEPA draft general permit for data centers covers facility operations that discharge to waters of the state. Both wastewater and stormwater from the data center facility are proposed for coverage under this permit.

Wastewater discharges are stated to include non-contact cooling waters (once through or re-circulated water that does not come into contact with the process operations of a facility and is used only to convey heat from the facility), low volume wastewaters (such as, cooling tower blowdown, boiler blowdown, and air compressor condensate yet excludes some waste streams like sanitary wastes) and stormwater associated with the industrial activities from the site.

Parameters addressed in the permit include:

pH.

Total filterable residue (i.e., Total Dissolved Solids).

Residual chlorine.

Residual Oxidants.

Key parameters monitored in the draft data center general permit include:

Flow volume.

Oil and grease.

Temperature.

A data center facility is defined by the general permit as including an establishment that provides computer processing and data preparation services, housing computing equipment that stores, processes, and distributes digital data. They are generally indicated to be defined by standard industrial classification code 7374-data processing and preparation.

OEPA notes that data centers can use a variety of cooling systems for the purpose of removing unwanted heat. These may include:

Air-cooled condensers.

Water-cooled condensers.

Evaporative cooling or a hybrid condenser with both air- and water-cooled modes.

Liquid-based cooling that uses coolants such as water or refrigerants.

Activities exposed to stormwater are described by OEPA as including:

Generators.

Fuel and chemical storage tanks.

Outdoor equipment storage.

Material loading/unloading areas.

Other operations where stormwater runoff may discharge pollutants.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:05:53.508663

If you look back years ago in the nineteen-twenties and the nineteen-thirties, they said, Global cooling will kill the world.
It would be easy, and accurate, to call 2025 the low point of human action on the climate crisis.
Here he is again, at the U.N., offering his definitive take on solar and wind power: “By the way, they’re a joke.
As the Times put it, “Countries like Brazil, India, and Vietnam are rapidly expanding solar and wind power.","Events now move at a pace so exhausting that it’s hard to remember that 2025 began with an epic climate-fuelled disaster: large portions of the nation’s second-biggest city, Los Angeles, burned in a firestorm that lasted days, after a record-dry autumn. A succession of such tragedies followed—for instance, the killer floods along the Guadalupe River, in Texas, where atmospheric moisture off an overheated Gulf of Mexico had hit record levels. Or Hurricane Melissa, where wind gusts reached two hundred and fifty-two miles per hour, faster than ever measured in a tropical cyclone at sea, thanks to the superheated waters of the Caribbean. The same day that Melissa hit Jamaica, a storm dropped five feet of rain on central Vietnam in twenty-four hours, the second-biggest deluge in recorded history, and the start of a truly sodden autumn across Southeast Asia which has left more than a thousand people dead.

The year 2025 seems nearly certain to enter the books tied with 2023 as the second-hottest ever measured, trailing only 2024. Since both of those earlier years were influenced by a strong El Niño event, this one will have the dubious distinction of being the hottest without such an extraneous force. This is apparently what business as usual looks like for a planetary climate carrying our atmosphere’s current load of carbon dioxide and methane. On the three-year moving average by which we measure such things, the Earth is now inching ever-closer to the 1.5-degree-Celsius increase in temperature set out as a goal to avoid just a decade ago at the Paris climate talks. And diplomatic events in 2025 did little to ease fears about what’s coming. The thirtieth Conference of the Parties (COP) global climate talks in Belem, Brazil—which no one from the Trump Administration attended—just concluded, and the Times described the final document in unusually straightforward terms as “a victory for oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia.”

None of this should shock anyone. International climate diplomacy, since its high-water mark at Paris, in 2015, has been besieged by the fossil-fuel industry and its proxy governments, which now include, of course, the United States, historically the Earth’s chief producer of CO2. I’m going to quote at some length from the speech the American President delivered to a silent U.N. General Assembly in September, because it sums up perfectly both his own imperviousness to fact and the assertiveness of the oil-and-gas world after his Inauguration this year.

2025 in Review

New Yorker writers reflect on the year’s highs and lows.

Describing, for instance, his understanding of climate science (invented arguably in its modern form in the United States, whose scientists first tracked the gases accumulating in the atmosphere and then built the computer models allowing us to predict our fate), Donald Trump said, “It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the nineteen-twenties and the nineteen-thirties, they said, Global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something. Then they said, Global warming will kill the world. But then it started getting cooler. It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion.” Then, with regard to modern environmentalism, one of America’s greatest contributions to the world—a consciousness that allowed our air and water to be cleaned up dramatically over recent decades—Trump said, “In the United States, we have still radicalized environmentalists, and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. We don’t want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows. They want to do things that are just unbelievable.”

In service to his vision of the world, the President has spent the year undoing every environmental law he can find. The zeal of his lieutenants—Lee Zeldin, at the Environmental Protection Agency; the former fracking executive Christopher Wright, at the Department of Energy; and others—has been remarkable. They’ve unleashed oil drilling along the coasts, opened up vast new stretches of the interior for coal mining, scrapped laws that attempted to staunch the flow of methane from gas wells into the air. Here’s Wright, on climate science, “Like, it’s a real physical phenomenon. It’s worth understanding a little bit. But to call it a crisis and point to disasters and say that that’s climate change, that’s to say, I’m not going to do my homework.”

Indeed, he and his colleagues are working hard to make it impossible for anyone to do their homework. They’ve shut down NASA’s upper Manhattan Goddard Institute for Space Studies, where James Hansen and other scientists first documented our plight, proposed to shut down the satellites that watch the climate changing, and even planned, in next year’s budget, to shut down the monitoring stations at Mauna Loa and elsewhere which keep track of how much carbon is pouring into the atmosphere. It is almost certainly the greatest collective act of scientific vandalism in recent American history. It would be easy, and accurate, to call 2025 the low point of human action on the climate crisis.

And yet, it’s at least possible that Trump and company’s assault on environmental norms is more shrill than confident. Because something else happened this year that gives at least some hope for the future: the remarkable rise in clean, renewable energy, which set every kind of record in 2025. In May, in a rush to get solar farms up before a subsidies-for-growth policy ended, China was installing an average of three gigawatts of solar capacity a day—the U.S. installed a total of twenty-one gigawatts in the first three quarters of this year. China, which is currently at the center of the renewable revolution, broke its own records with ease: after surpassing its 2030 targets in 2024, it set new targets for 2035 this year, including a renewable-electricity share exceeding thirty per cent. It’s not alone: India met a 2030 target early, too. As Reuters reported in July, fifty per cent of installed electric capacity in the world’s most populous country ran on something other than fossil fuels. That’s not the same thing as saying it generated half its power from the sun and wind, but India was definitely trending in the right direction: coal use dropped nearly three per cent in the first half of the year.

Similar transitions have been occurring almost everywhere: in November, the Energy Information Administration reported that California used seventeen per cent less natural gas to produce electricity than it had the year before. Pakistan, which has seen a rapid solar buildout in the past two years, reached an agreement with Qatar to divert twenty-four liquified natural-gas cargoes in 2026 after domestic demand fell—with Pakistan bearing the loss if Qatar sells the cargoes below contract price. They simply don’t need the imports anymore. All told, through September, we generated almost a third more energy from the sun this year than last.

All this flies in the face of Trump’s call for U.S. “energy dominance” from oil and gas. He’s tried, with some success, to build that dominance on the back of tariffs—when the E.U. and Japan agreed to buy hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of liquefied natural gas, he cut their threatened tariff rates substantially, in what could be described only as a shakedown. He’s also done his best to wreck the prospects of clean energy, not only gutting President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which was designed to help America catch up with China’s green-tech lead, but also trying to halt work on nearly completed wind farms off the Atlantic seaboard. Just weeks ago, he put the kibosh on what would have been America’s largest solar array, in Nevada. And he’s tried to take his case around the world, lecturing leaders about the folly of clean energy.

Here he is again, at the U.N., offering his definitive take on solar and wind power: “By the way, they’re a joke. They don’t work. They’re too expensive. They’re not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great. The wind doesn’t blow. Those big windmills are so pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate, and they have to be rebuilt all the time and they start to rust and rot. Most expensive energy ever conceived. And it’s actually energy. You’re supposed to make money with energy, not lose money. You lose money, the governments have to subsidize. You can’t put them out without massive subsidies.” And this is how he summed up the situation: “And I’m really good at predicting things. . . . I don’t say that in a braggadocious way, but it’s true. I’ve been right about everything. And I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from this green-energy scam, your country is going to fail.”

Or maybe it’s America that’s in trouble. When historians look back at 2025, I think the story they will tell is that, in the course of just a few months, the U.S. voluntarily surrendered technological and economic primacy to its theoretical chief adversary in the course of just a few months. China’s green-energy exports this year, through July, were one and a half times the size of American oil and gas exports in the same period. From Belem, the view seemed fairly clear. As the Times put it, “Countries like Brazil, India, and Vietnam are rapidly expanding solar and wind power. Poorer countries like Ethiopia and Nepal are leapfrogging over gasoline-burning cars to battery-powered ones. Nigeria, a petrostate, plans to build its first solar-panel manufacturing plant. Morocco is creating a battery hub to supply European automakers. Santiago, the capital of Chile, has electrified more than half of its bus fleet in recent years.”

Crucial to this global shift was China, which was selling the technology and often providing the financing. “Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time,” the Chinese Vice-Premier, Ding Xuexiang, told the COP 30 delegates. “We need to stay confident, balance such goals as environmental protection, economic development, job creation, and poverty eradication.” China is far from a benign world power, but countries that buy green tech from it will not depend on it going forward, as they would depend on a supplier of gas or coal. Instead, they’ll depend on the sun, which has an enviable record of rising most mornings.

Americans, too, are starting to worry about the domestic effects of relying on fossil fuels. Electricity prices are spiking around the country, up ten per cent as the Trump Administration simultaneously green-lights the endless expansion of juice-sucking data centers and constricts the supply of the cheapest forms of energy. Election results from last month—especially in New Jersey, where the victorious Democrat in the gubernatorial race, Mikie Sherrill, made a strong commitment to renewable power—suggest that voters have woken up to this economic reality. Expect Sherrill’s colleagues across the country to start making much of the new data indicating that some of the states with the lowest power rates, such as Iowa and North Dakota, can often be those with the most wind, sun, and hydropower.

None of this is happening fast enough. But there’s definitely a wild card in what has often seemed like a stacked deck, and it’s increasingly coming into play. Another year will give us a sense of how much the game has been changed. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69373112a32c6284427c9fa7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/02_R1-1.jpg",N,,2025-12-09 11:05:57.389831

The S&P 500 has increased 16% in that time. The two companies were supposed to be losers as they continued to lag behind the wounded Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market, and they have the most modest presence in China and the European Union. Tesla may be hurting, but it still has about a 45% EV market share in the United States. GM and Ford are closer to 10% each. In China, the world’s largest EV market, the two U.S. car giants have almost nothing at all.

The “win” for Ford and GM is that they are fossil-fuel kings in a fossil-fuel nation. The EV market has died, thanks mostly to the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. iSeeCars research says that EV sales as a percentage of total U.S. new car sales dropped from 8% in the third quarter to 4% in the fourth quarter. It will stay at that level through 2026, the research firm forecasts.

GM and Ford have spent billions of dollars on EV development, only to find their legacy businesses are extremely healthy. In fact, their lead products are full-sized pickups, symbols of America’s gasoline-loving drivers.

Among the reasons that GM and Ford were wrong about EVs was that buyers still worry about range (at 300 miles for most EVs) and the number of charging stations. Excess tire wear and engines that do not take a full charge in very cold temperatures are also concerns. Some Americans don’t know how EVs work, which is another drawback.

On the other hand, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline has dropped to $3. One of the selling points for EVs is that they save money on fuel. While that may be true, it is not as true as it was when gas was $5 a gallon, about the same time Russia invaded Ukraine. The world is awash in cheap oil, with prices falling toward $60 a barrel.

Add to the gas argument that there are, by some estimates, 175,000 gas stations in the U.S. (many of which have convenience stores). Filling a car with gas takes 10 minutes. EVs take longer to charge—if people can find a charger.

As a bonus, the dislike many Americans have for Tesla CEO Elon Musk has caused some people who might have bought Tesla cars to stick with combustion engine ones instead.

Gasoline-powered cars are the clear U.S. market winner. So much for gambling on EVs in America.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/imageForEntry7-EiV.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:06:10.979071

As demand for clean mobile power technologies accelerates, suppliers have a unique opportunity to gain a first-mover advantage by upgrading their fleets and positioning themselves as the preferred providers of clean, reliable power solutions.
There are three critical factors that will enable broader availability of clean mobile power: Increasing the variety of clean mobile power products offered in the market, allowing for optimizing clean mobile power product selection based on geographic, operational, and energy demand considerations.
At the same time, the industry should adopt baseline utilization standards for clean mobile power, for example, requiring clean mobile power quotes alongside diesel generators and/or mandating clean mobile power coverage of basecamp or catering loads where feasible.
Department of Energy Clean Hydrogen Production Standard (CHPS) Guidance,” US Department of Energy, https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/docs/hydrogenprogramlibraries/pdfs/clean-hydrogen-production-standard-guidance.pdf.","Film and TV productions are their own enclosed worlds. Often filming in temporary or remote areas, each production has to bring its own power to keep the lights, cameras, and everything else on. Here we explore the energy needs of a typical set, and how those needs can be met with clean mobile power solutions.

Production energy demands

Set: The filming location where the camera captures content, sets can be on a soundstage or on location. Soundstages often draw power from the electric grid to operate power lighting, cameras, and other equipment, though some require additional mobile power for other items, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). One study found that several soundstages in Canada’s Greater Toronto Area and Vancouver and in New York City rely on mobile power to meet all the energy demand needs of a production on a given day.[1] On-location filming requires all equipment, such as lighting, cameras, and HVAC, to be powered by mobile power, typically using one or more 1,400 ampere (A) (210 kilovolt-ampere [kVa]) generators for lighting and an additional one for HVAC.[2]

Basecamp: The central hub of production activity, often within one mile from the set. Power loads include trailers (with HVAC) for talent, hair, makeup, and costumes, as well as offices for production staff. When located on a soundstage, and in some instances on location, basecamps will rely on grid tie-ins for power. However, when filming on location, accessing grid power is usually either not possible or limited, and as a result, the basecamp will rely in whole or in part on mobile power.[3] Basecamp power is typically one of the larger needs on a production, and if not using renewable energy generation or grid tie-ins, will rely on one or two 1,400–1,600 A (210–240 kVA) generators.[4]

Transportation: Trucks and cars are used for a variety of purposes during film production. They can be used to ferry staff and talent to and from set and basecamp, run errands off-site, and move equipment around a site, including cameras, props, and grip, among other uses. Traditionally, internal combustion engine vehicles would be used alongside diesel generators to power any additional equipment within the vehicles.[5] As electric vehicles (EVs) gain in popularity, transportation will represent a growing energy demand for a production set because these vehicles will need to be recharged on-site using either clean mobile power or grid charging.

Catering: Catering trucks or lunchbox trailers are typically located near basecamp and are used to prepare meals for production teams. They usually include cooking appliances and HVAC equipment to ensure occupant comfort and air circulation. These trucks often use a 5–6.5 kVA (33–43 A) “putt-putt” generator and propane for stoves and refrigerators as well as up to a 70 kVA (466 A) generator for heating, cooling, and lighting.[6]

The basics: What we mean when we talk about clean mobile power

Two types of clean mobile power technology have emerged as the most widely deployed diesel alternatives for film and TV productions today: solar power generation on production trailers (in the United States and Canada) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Both have benefited from years of commercial development and falling costs outside the entertainment sector, making them relatively mature, reliable, and increasingly accessible for on-production use.

Solar generation, often installed on the roofs of modern, energy-efficient basecamp trailers, offers a proven method of generating clean electricity where sunlight is abundant, while BESS products serve as the storage and distribution backbone that allows renewable power to be used flexibly and reliably.

A third technology, hydrogen power units (HPUs), is also emerging as a promising complement to solar and battery systems. HPUs are at an earlier stage of deployment but have demonstrated strong potential to deliver high power outputs and rapid refueling capabilities. A deeper technical appraisal and practical considerations for their use on productions are discussed later in this section.

Benefits of clean mobile power for film and TV production

Clean mobile power offers a variety of industry-specific benefits, ranging from improving operational efficiency to providing health benefits and, in many cases, cost savings. Some specific advantages are explored below.

Health benefits from reduced pollution

During operation, diesel generators emit air pollutants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, which can result in poor air quality and adverse health impacts, including increased risk of stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease, in addition to worsening asthma symptoms. BESS and hydrogen fuel cells do not emit harmful particulates, so there are no adverse impacts on health related to local emissions. Hydrogen combustion units do emit some particulates during operation, though not to the same extent as diesel generators.[7]

Flexible use cases and operational efficiency

Diesel generators make noise, so they often must be placed far from the set to ensure they do not interfere with sound recordings. BESS units are quieter by comparison, which allows productions to use them in a broader range of use cases and locations compared with diesel generators. The more flexible placement for BESS units can also reduce cabling needs and leads to faster setup and teardown times, saving crews time.

While HPUs also vary in their noise levels, manufacturers that are early to market have shown that it is possible to make them quieter than equivalent prime-rated diesel generators. Hone’s fuel cell–based APS-GT100 produces 60 decibels (dB) at a 7-meter distance at its 100 kilowatt (kW) continuous power threshold, while the equivalent diesel MQ Power Whisperwatt 125 kVA/100 kW (833 A) model produces 66 dB at the same distance. This difference, approximately double the perceived sound pressure, is significant and is equivalent to someone speaking directly in front of a listener versus background noise in an average office. Due to various safety considerations, these solutions do have siting constraints that typically do not allow them to offer the same level of flexible location possibilities compared with battery solutions, and thereby savings in cabling or space needs.

Both BESS and HPUs can also support operational efficiencies through the avoidance of power breakdowns, which cause unexpected delays on production. These units can operate at a variety of loads, compared with diesel generators, which can fail if they are running at too low a load.

Improved community relations due to reduced noise and emissions

Diesel generators can be a contentious issue when filming on location in various communities due to the noise and the health hazards outlined above. The use of battery or hydrogen units can reduce air quality–associated complaints and noise complaints, keeping productions on schedule. Lower noise levels can also lead to cost savings as residents in neighborhoods adjacent to filming locations often need to be compensated for inconveniences associated with diesel generator use.

Increased creative freedom

Small battery units, when connected to small loads such as cameras or individual lights, can accommodate a broader range of cinematographic setups compared with diesel generators that are stationary and must be placed away from the set to limit noise disruptions. Furthermore, small battery units are flexible and enable expedited changes to a setup because they can be highly mobile (i.e., carried by one individual) and do not require long cable runs. Additionally, productions using near-silent power can capture content in locations previously unavailable due to restrictions on generator use or other sensitivities.

Image: Allye’s 300 kWh battery energy storage system provides clean, quiet, and reliable temporary power along the Thames — showing how on-location productions can move beyond diesel.

Operational cost benefits

BESS and HPUs are still relatively new, and as a result, their rental rates are typically higher than those of traditional diesel generators. However, when factoring in the full cost of mobile power (rental rates and fuel), batteries can offer potential cost savings, particularly in areas where the cost of grid tie-in electricity is low or when combining a battery unit with renewable energy generation, such as solar trailers. Battery units also require less maintenance compared with diesel generators, offering additional potential cost savings for owner/operators. Although the full cost of hydrogen and batteries is still higher in many cases today, our analysis in Section 4 indicates that projected total cost of ownership for BESS and HPU units are expected to decrease over time.

The case for action

The solution to the problem of noisy, polluting diesel generators already exists. Solar panels and batteries have been generating and storing power for decades, and the costs of those technologies have continued to fall. The technology is proven: scaling up industry-tailored products is now the only thing holding clean mobile power back.

By working together, industry leaders can accelerate the adoption and availability of clean solutions that power sets quietly, cleanly, and sustainably.

This opportunity comes as some government regulators and the industry as a whole are calling for cleaner solutions that generate low or no emissions, making a focus on clean mobile power not just a smart decision on production, but also one that sets up the industry to thrive in the long term.

For studios

Clean power technologies offer quieter, safer, and more efficient energy for on-production and basecamp operations, improving working conditions, providing production agility benefits, and enabling further electrification, such as charging for on-production EVs. Studios that move early will also benefit from incentive programs, lower long-term energy costs, and reduced exposure to tightening emissions regulations.

Embracing clean mobile power also helps studios meet sustainability goals. Diesel generators make up approximately 15% of emissions on a production, and as efficiency and electrification improvements are adopted across other major emissions sources on productions, the share of mobile power–related emissions will only increase over time with continued diesel use.

As major customers to equipment suppliers and rental houses, film and TV studios have a unique opportunity to shape the pace and scale of clean mobile power adoption across the industry. By setting clear standards for clean power use across their productions, studios can send a powerful demand signal that drives supplier investment, accelerates technology availability, and strengthens supply chains in key markets.

By taking decisive action, studios can establish a new industry standard, demonstrating that clean mobile power is not just an environmental imperative, but also a strategic and operational advantage for the future of entertainment.

For equipment suppliers and rental houses

Studios across the film and TV industry depend on equipment suppliers and rental houses to power their productions. As demand for clean mobile power technologies accelerates, suppliers have a unique opportunity to gain a first-mover advantage by upgrading their fleets and positioning themselves as the preferred providers of clean, reliable power solutions. By collaborating with manufacturers and studios, rental houses can help shape best practices for deployment, improve equipment utilization, and strengthen relationships across the production value chain.

Investing early in clean mobile power is also a strategic risk-mitigation measure. Governments worldwide are tightening emissions standards for diesel-powered equipment. For example, London’s low-emissions zone regulations and Metro Vancouver’s nonroad diesel engine program impose strict performance limits on diesel generators, while incentive programs such as California’s Clean Off-Road Equipment Voucher Incentive Project (CORE) help offset the cost of cleaner technologies. Transitioning fleets now allows suppliers to stay compliant, protect asset value, and avoid portions of their inventory becoming obsolete in key markets.

Beyond compliance, the shift to clean mobile power offers long-term financial and competitive benefits: reduced maintenance costs, access to incentive funding, alignment with studio sustainability commitments, staying relevant by providing the latest technology, and enhanced brand reputation. Early adopters will not only meet growing demand but also help shape the industry’s transition, turning clean mobile power from a niche option into the new standard for film production logistics.

For production executives, managers, and crews

Clean mobile power is not just an environmental upgrade, it enables creativity. Quiet, fume-free power systems allow productions greater flexibility in location choice, improved sound recording conditions, and a healthier, more comfortable on-production environment for both cast and crew. For directors and cinematographers, clean mobile power expands creative possibilities by delivering reliable energy to remote or noise-sensitive locations without compromise. For producers and managers, it reduces operational risks such as generator failure, fuel shortages, and community noise complaints, helping productions stay on schedule and on budget. And for talent and crew, it means a quieter, cleaner workspace that reflects the industry’s commitment to innovation and sustainability.

In addition to these creative and experiential benefits, clean mobile power technologies, such as grid tie-ins, solar photovoltaics (PV), BESS, and HPUs, offer practical on-production advantages. They eliminate harmful exhaust and noise, simplify cabling and site logistics, and improve safety by reducing exposure to emissions. Productions can also realize cost savings by reducing both equipment rental and fuel expenses.

Together, these advantages enhance efficiency, safety, and artistic potential — making clean mobile power not only a health and climate solution, but also a catalyst for better filmmaking.

For clean mobile power manufacturers

The film and TV industry represents a high-visibility opportunity for manufacturers to demonstrate performance, refine products, and accelerate adoption across multiple sectors. Productions require quiet, portable, and reliable power systems — precisely the characteristics driving innovation in the broader clean energy economy.

Demand for mobile, zero-emissions power is also expanding across adjacent industries such as construction, live events, and telecommunications. This diversification enables manufacturers to scale production, reduce market risk, and strengthen supply chains across use cases. BESS solutions now make up an estimated 25%–30% of global energy storage, while hydrogen-based systems remain at the earlier stages of commercialization (low-carbon hydrogen production represents less than 1% of hydrogen production globally; there are expectations for it to meet 13% of final energy demand in 2050).[8]

Despite this momentum, there are still significant market opportunities for technology expansion because diesel generators still dominate the mobile power industry (at approximately 65%–75% market share).[9] By engaging directly with studios, suppliers, and industry alliances, manufacturers can design fit-for-purpose units tailored to production needs, build brand recognition in a creative and influential sector, and help establish clean mobile power as the new standard for mobile energy generation worldwide.

Solar

Solar panels (PV cells) absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity for immediate use (e.g., for basecamp trailer lighting and HVAC) or for storage in a connected battery system. On film and TV sets, solar PV is most commonly installed on the roofs of basecamp trailers to power lighting, HVAC, and small equipment.

Solar panels are robust, inexpensive, and relatively available for productions in most major film and TV production hubs in Canada and the United States, and have been revolutionary in decarbonizing productions’ basecamps. The solar panel industry has experienced several decades of large-scale production and innovation, and the fundamental costs for solar panels have declined sharply as a result. Manufacturers of ultraefficient basecamp trailers have been incorporating solar panels into trailer roofs since at least 2014. More recently, solar combined with batteries and energy efficient trailers are helping decarbonize basecamps and reduce reliance on diesel for low-load power needs on film and TV productions.

Battery energy storage systems

BESS are energy storage systems, not energy generation systems. As such, they can be recharged in a variety of ways, including via the grid, on-site renewables, HPUs (see below), or diesel generators. There are a variety of battery chemistries that have been under development and are advancing quickly; however, most batteries manufactured for BESS use lithium-ion or sodium-ion technology.[10]

Batteries are nearly silent, emit no local pollutants, can be recycled at the end of their life, and are readily mobile. Batteries can also offer 100% carbon-free power solutions if charged with renewable energy generated on-site, with HPUs supplied with green hydrogen, or when plugged into a grid powered by renewable energy. Although meeting larger loads with batteries alone can pose some challenges, several available battery solutions could effectively replace small to midsized diesel generators. Many options in the general mobile battery energy storage solutions space now routinely offer maximum sustained loads of more than 100 kW, with a growth rate in maximum sustained load of around 25%–30% over the past decade.[11] For some productions with limited or no access to the grid, using batteries would require access to solar recharging, additional production planning to move batteries off-site for charging, or an energy-as-a-service (EaaS) model to deliver fully charged batteries each day to a production site.

Hydrogen power units

HPUs for clean mobile power applications generally fall into two categories: fuel cell–based energy storage systems and combustion-based generators. In contrast, combustion based hydrogen fuel cells combine hydrogen gas with oxygen in the air to create energy. They produce no climate pollution when powered by green hydrogen, emitting only water vapor. They also do not produce harmful toxins or particulate matter, which are particularly noxious and bothersome when using diesel power generators. Furthermore, they require minimal maintenance compared with diesel generators and can deliver high power (100 kW or more) output with reliable performance over an extended service life span.

Combustion-based hydrogen generators, in contrast, create energy in a similar fashion to diesel generators: hydrogen fuel is burnt, and this small explosion of gas pushes on a piston, creating power. Because the hydrogen reacts with all parts (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) of the ambient air when it burns, combustion hydrogen generators emit small amounts of nitrogen oxides (however, no carbon dioxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds [VOCs], carbon monoxide, and sulfur oxide), impacting health and air quality. These emissions can be mitigated to near-undetectable levels with proper catalytic converter design, removing the particulate pollutants and VOCs associated with diesel units.

The carbon intensity of hydrogen-powered systems depends on the feedstock used to produce the hydrogen fuel, its supply chain, and the indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of hydrogen due to leakage. Green hydrogen, generated via electrolysis (electrically splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen) powered by renewable energy, can provide a fully carbon-free solution to hydrogen fuel production, if also transported sustainably. However, there are still challenges with ensuring a completely zero-carbon transportation route and no leakage during transportation.[12]

Image: A behind-the-scenes look at Hone’s hydrogen generator and fuel supply setup, which support clean, efficient energy generation for field productions.

HPUs offer another balance of advantages and drawbacks distinct from those of diesel, solar, and BESS, but their adoption in film and TV remains at a much earlier stage than diesel, solar, or BESS technologies. Although batteries and solar are relatively mature, somewhat cost-competitive, and familiar to crews, hydrogen is still highly dependent on the development of new infrastructure, carries higher equipment costs, and faces an immature regulatory environment. These factors mean that film and TV tailored hydrogen systems historically have required greater demonstration, education, and de-risking before progressing into production pilots. However, HPUs also offer certain advantages over BESS-based designs: their theoretical refueling time from empty is closer to that of a diesel generator, and hydrogen stores much more energy by weight than an equivalently sized lithium battery unit. See Exhibit 3 for a view of how these technologies stack up against each other, depending on location.

Recommended technology combinations

There is no one-size-fits-all solution for clean mobile power. Each production has unique power demands, site conditions, and access to technologies. As a result, the most effective strategy is to combine grid tie-ins, efficient solar trailers, batteries, and hydrogen in ways that optimize reliability, cost, and emissions reductions for the specific context. Exhibit 4 illustrates how different technology combinations can be tailored to production needs.

Solar

Product offerings

New efficient basecamp trailers utilize roof-mounted solar arrays to offer independent power day and night through integrated battery storage. Reliability is increased by the ability of trailers to share power, and smart prioritization features can send energy directly to loads as they occur in real time. New, efficient trailer designs often consume just 20% of the energy of legacy trailer designs. When combined with batteries to store the solar energy generated by trailers, it has allowed some productions’ basecamps in regions where these trailers are available to go almost diesel-free. Productions have recently started to implement solar powered basecamps, which are increasingly available in major production hubs across the U.S. and Canada.

There are various solar basecamp products on the market. For example, Quixote by Sunset Studios offers the Verde series trailers that are equipped with roof-mounted solar arrays ranging from 2 to 5 kW. The trailers are designed to run entirely off-grid using a 40 kilowatt-hour (kWh) integrated battery for at least 10 hours at full load.

In North America, another example is BI Production Works who manufacturers trailers equipped with approximately 5–8 kW of solar generation capacity and onboard integrated batteries. BI also has a dedicated electric power microgrid storage system called the EPS 360, which combines a 360 kWh battery and 10 kW of solar generation capacity with the ability to receive and send power to solar trailers.

These offerings underscore the growing availability of sophisticated, solar-enhanced trailer solutions in major production hubs. Many other major production transportation vendors already offer or have begun converting their existing fleets of trailers to incorporate solar and BESS, increasing the availability of efficient solar trailers for productions in North America.

Pilots and commercial traction to date

Across the industry, leading studios are already proving what’s possible with clean mobile power. The following case studies show how solar technologies are delivering measurable carbon and cost savings while maintaining reliable on-production operations.

Disney Los Angeles feature production (summer 2024): A recent Disney production in Los Angeles used Lightnin Thunderbolt solar trailers that relied on solar and battery power 97% of the time from June to August 2024. This reliance on clean mobile power resulted in reducing diesel fuel consumption by approximately 4,900 gallons.

Disney New Jersey television series (summer/winter 2023): A Disney television series production in New Jersey, spanning both summer and winter seasons, saw more varied results. Although weekly percentage run time on solar and battery equipment was quite high in the summer (between 90% and 100% from April to June), the winter months experienced much less total cumulative diesel-free run time. This basecamp ran diesel-free around 50%–70% of the time and generated less than a third of its power from solar in most weeks. This indicates that these roof-mounted solar panels still struggle to keep pace with the high resistive heating loads experienced during peak demand periods in the winter in high latitudes. Even so, the production recorded 7,000 gallons of diesel fuel saved.

Netflix New Mexico television series Ransom Canyon (winter/summer 2024): The Ransom Canyon basecamp was Netflix’s first to be fully powered by solar products using Greenlite trailers and a BI Production Works EPS-400 battery microgrid storage system. The production reduced its diesel generator fuel usage across all power needs, including for set, work trucks and additional equipment, by more than 50% by using a mix of large mobile batteries, solar trailers, and solar battery systems, saving 8,000 gallons of fuel. From April to mid-June, this system powered the basecamp for almost all 12 weeks of production, with the basecamp generator running for only three hours.

Battery energy storage systems

Product offerings

There are already several BESS products marketed to the film and TV industry in various stages of development and deployment. Small systems, like Instagrid’s GO and Anton Bauer’s EDEN, are 2–3 kWh systems capable of supporting low (2–4 kW) loads while being portable by hand by a single person. These are meant to act as a mobile wall outlet and are an option for crews looking to use battery power for a few key pieces of equipment, often in locations or shots that do not permit the use of larger power equipment due to space or flexibility constraints. Other, slightly larger systems, like the Portable Electric Voltstack 5 kW electric generator and REON Technology’s Mobile Power Station, are designed to be packed on trucks and driven by personnel on film and TV sets and offer greater power and energy storage than the GO and EDEN while offering the same connection types found on traditional small gasoline generators.

Unlike their smaller counterparts, clean mobile power technologies at the larger end of the market need to deliver power and performance in a form factor similar to the large, trailer-mounted diesel generators used today. The nearly ubiquitous tow plant generator is often the standard for reliability, mobility, and power delivery by which large BESS unit options are compared. Currently, there are fewer large BESS systems available configured for film and TV production use compared with the aforementioned smaller systems.

Some manufacturers, like Viridi and ElectricFish, opt for midpower units in the 30–50 kW range, with a variable amount of storage between 90 and 550 kWh. Because the overall rated output of these units is lower than that of a tow plant generator, some manufacturers enable paralleling or daisy-chaining of the units to allow for higher-power delivery and longer duration of the energy storage system.

Other units opt for larger power and storage capacity to more closely replicate the capabilities, form factor, and feel of a 1,400 A (210 kVA) tow plant. These units, like RIC Electronics’s CleanGen J250, have outputs around 90–100 kW with 200–300 kWh of storage while remaining towable by light-duty vehicles. The CleanGen J250 is the most widely available large BESS product purpose-built for the film and TV industry in North America. It has developed a solid track record in various set power applications and has been successfully used in many Netflix and Disney productions to date. CleanGen systems are useful for a variety of applications in a diesel-free production, such as powering equipment trucks and providing power to rigging, catering, and basecamp.

Newer BESS manufacturers, like Allye Energy, have shown promise by using second-life EV cells in a similar towable trailer form factor to combine large amounts of power delivery (180 kW) and storage (300–1,000 kWh or more) while keeping costs relatively low for early adopters. Allye’s medium form factor battery, the Max 300 (180 kW, 300 kWh), has received positive feedback in early pilots in and around London, particularly in remote locations without grid access.

Beyond the systems mentioned above, other manufacturers have built and deployed large BESS products initially for industries like construction, defense, and disaster relief, which also have applicability in the film and TV industry. Though there are some growing pains concerning form factor (especially size and weight), mobility, and power specifications associated with using these products as-is in film and TV, newer iterations that consider industry feedback look promising. ElectricFish’s 350Squared, a 400 kWh BESS built primarily for mobile EV fast-charging and backup site and building power, can provide a total of 350 kW to EVs and is set to deploy with major automotive, live events, and defense customers. Ampd Energy’s product lineup, which started in Southeast Asian construction projects needing voltages higher than those required by film and TV, has grown substantially and has been piloted in very short film and TV scenarios. Other BESS manufacturers of note, like Joule Case, have found meaningful traction among defense and public transportation customers.

However, BESS power products specifically built for the film and TV industry in this high-power, high-storage segment are still relatively few, and suppliers and studios note a gap in the market. Weight and footprint constraints continue to be pain points for production crews seeking flexibility and portability. Other logistical considerations, such as charging times and compatibility between the BESS and the power distribution system, favor crews experienced in navigating the new advantages and drawbacks of BESS technologies.

Pilots and commercial traction to date

The majority of battery manufacturers developing products tailored to the film and TV industry have to date been located outside of the United States. Manufacturing location paired with new BESS systems in the United States, which requires UL9540 certification (a costly and time-consuming process), resulted in most BESS pilot activities being conducted in countries like the UK (Allye Energy) and Australia (Ampd Energy).

In a recent Netflix pilot of the Allye Energy Max 300 in the United Kingdom in 2025, a single battery was deployed for six days to serve a remote location without grid access. It powered a variety of basecamp equipment, including catering equipment, hair and makeup popup tents, EVs and small battery charging, and other basecamp trailers. During the entire six-day period, the battery ran for a cumulative 99.5 hours, and diesel generators on production were powered for only 16% of the time (during peak demand periods without solar generation available). Notably, the entire equipment stack ran silently using only battery power during the whole weekend period of relatively low demand. The Max 300 is seen as an especially promising product, and the users reported they “would happily use [the Max 300] in another production as-is.”

These early case studies highlight how some high-power, high-storage BESS products are already demonstrating market readiness with respect to power delivery, energy storage, and reliability. Positive feedback from pilots on both Netflix and Disney productions has been impactful — Allye has seen new interest from capital markets due to these successes and is in line to become another contender in the clean mobile power market at scale.

Hydrogen power units

Product offerings

Hydrogen products marketed to film and TV are generally positioned as mobile replacements for diesel generators, designed to operate with similar duty cycles and applications. They do not share the drawbacks of BESS units of long charging times at comparable energy storage capacities and can often be refueled within 30 minutes. There are a handful of HPU products currently available and tailored for film and TV use. H2 Portable Power Corp. is an HPU manufacturer in Vancouver, Canada. Its APS-GT100 delivers 100 kW of sustained three-phase power at 120/208 V, stores just over 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy onboard its fuel cell–based unit, and is capable of rapid (less than 30 minutes) refueling. Hone, a manufacturer and hydrogen provider based in Toronto, is developing a system that combines a hydrogen combustion generator and a fuel storage trailer and is designed to offer many of the same operational benefits as the APS-GT100.

Tests and pilots to date

Because HPUs are newer, less familiar, and face higher infrastructure and regulatory hurdles compared with solar or batteries, productions have chosen to not deploy them directly on production without first proving reliability. Through the Clean Mobile Power Initiative (CMPI), we found that structured de-risking tests are an essential step to validate performance, build crew confidence, and clear the path toward pilots.

To de-risk these technologies for use in the industry, in-person technology tests were held to validate pilot readiness of HPUs. The testing protocols were designed to showcase the power, refueling, and operational characteristics of the HPUs, and two such tests were held with H2 Portable Power Corp and Hone. These tests were jointly hosted and designed by partners in CMPI, and key participating personnel from production studios, rental supply companies, and local safety and regulatory agencies were invited to attend.

Both in-person testing events featured similar fundamental power delivery tests, designed to create stress-test scenarios at the limits of what would be expected of a generator providing power to a set, including:

A high inrush current test, where the unit powered a 72 kW array of set lighting to 100% from cold bulbs.

A dimming test, where a variety of low-light-intensity dimming patterns were run on the same lighting array to demonstrate the ability to handle difficult harmonics and imbalance loads.

An extended power threshold test, where the unit was connected to lighting, charging, basecamp trailer, and HVAC loads until the total load equaled 90 kW average for one hour, around two times the load of an average tentpole production load.

An additional “bump test,” where a 70 kW Lightning Strikes lighting unit was pulsed while power was simultaneously maintained to an 18k HMI, with the goal to not lose power to the HMI throughout (Hone only).

Although set lighting is not the primary use case for these clean mobile power products, the bump test scenario effectively showcased what is possible from a power delivery standpoint. Generator operators present at the Hone test, for instance, noted how 70 kW Lightning Strikes units are nearly always given their own power source because of the intensity of the load when the lighting unit is powered. To keep an additional 18k HMI powered was, in one attending crew’s opinion, “exceptional.”

Feedback sessions held with all attendees at each event uncovered potential barriers to adoption — direct and indirect — that must be addressed for these HPUs to succeed at scale. Many of these considerations, such as spatial footprint concerns, fire safety regulations, and labor/union constraints, will require further cross-industry collaboration and engagement with manufacturers and policymakers to resolve. These tests successfully addressed a key, early blocker for real-world deployments, providing core technical and operational validation for production-specific use cases. Furthermore, the events fostered collaborative conversations among manufacturers, studios, equipment suppliers, and crews on pathways for further product refinement and deployment.

Both H2 Portable’s and Hone’s HPUs demonstrated an ability to sustain required loads for film and TV production. Pilots took place following the events after studio representatives witnessing the tests unanimously noted their desire to move both units to pilots on real productions. Those productions included:

Netflix, British Columbia, Canada (2025): Importantly for H2 Portable Power Corp., these tests successfully unlocked pilot opportunities for its fuel cell–based HPU, the APS-GT100, on TV and film productions. Since completing its round of testing in February 2025, the manufacturer has participated in two direct pilots on Netflix productions in British Columbia. In these pilots, the APS-GT100 unit powered EV charging and basecamp power needs (battery charging, multiple trailers’ power) in remote locations without grid access, receiving overall very positive feedback. Additionally, Netflix and production crews noted the hydrogen power unit was “very safe for use on set” once the key fire code requirements, such as safety clearances, were taken into consideration. The same contacts noted that they would happily use the unit again, given that some of the bugs uncovered (low-voltage battery issues early on) could be addressed. However, some key challenges, such as the inability to refuel the unit in the field with existing equipment and the need to power down the unit before refueling, highlighted the importance of the overall infrastructure when considering hydrogen power for use in film and TV. Because these isolated pilots were reasonably close to a refueling depot, refueling was eventually successfully demonstrated on a more extended deployment of H2 Portable Power’s unit. However, the need for some kind of field refueling solution was noted as well.

Demand- and supply-side efficiencies

Energy efficiency is crucial to control costs and ensure no energy is wasted on production. Switching to clean mobile power solutions offers an inherent efficiency gain over diesel generators as battery systems convert stored energy directly to electricity without the losses (heat, noise) associated with combustion engines.

Beyond clean mobile power, further changes can improve energy efficiency. First, steps can be taken to reduce the overall energy (and peak power) demand, also known as demand-side efficiencies. These strategies, such as the use of superefficient trailers and equipment (i.e., HVAC, lighting, appliances), more efficient LED set lighting, and operational changes (i.e., controls and sensors to reduce wasted energy) reduce the baseline load of a production, making scaled utilization of clean mobile power solutions more viable. Second, once energy demand has been established, addressing supply-side efficiencies by rightsizing power systems to meet the projected demand can reduce the inefficiencies of using oversized systems.

Demand-side efficiency measures: reducing load on productions

Demand-side efficiency measures play an important role in reducing the total energy demand on a production and allowing clean mobile power solutions to be deployed more effectively. One prominent example is the use of the aforementioned modern, efficient basecamp trailers. These trailers are often equipped with solar panels and efficient HVAC systems for heating and cooling, making them particularly effective in reducing emissions at basecamp. They are now readily available and deployed in productions across many major film markets in North America.

Another efficiency-focused technology is the use of LED set lighting. Compared with legacy equipment, LED lighting drastically reduces power demands while offering greater and faster creative control. Although adoption is often framed as a creative decision left to individual productions, LED lighting is now broadly available, widely used, and relatively cost-competitive, and is therefore becoming the industry standard.

Efficiency improvements can also be achieved through operational changes and controls. For example, smart sensors and automated systems in trailers can minimize wasted energy by ensuring equipment only operates when required.

Taken together, efficiency strategies can play a significant role in reducing overall energy demands. Exhibit 6 demonstrated that a typical large production in a warm environment can achieve up to a 54% redution in energy demand from a combination of efficiency measures. This scenario offers the greatest efficiency gains for a production as overall energy demands are greatest due to high cooling needs in these environments.

Fleet electrification and future load and operations planning As studios advance their decarbonization strategies through the transition of vehicle fleets to electric models, on-production power needs may shift. Although electrification reduces tailpipe emissions and gasoline or diesel usage, it also creates new charging demands on a set that must be considered in overall power planning. This underscores the importance of combining demand reduction with accurate load forecasting to ensure clean mobile power systems are sized to meet both set and fleet requirements.

Supply-side efficiencies: rightsizing and transitioning to clean mobile power

After reducing load through demand-side measures, productions can flexibly adjust the size of clean mobile power systems to meet their actual projected energy demands. This allows productions to avoid the inherent inefficiencies caused by the current fossil fuel status quo: drastic oversizing of generators versus the actual equipment loads.

Many film production sets are currently powered by large (1,400–1,800 A or 210–270 kVA) generators with connected loads far below their nominal power rating to avoid voltage drops when new loads are activated during the day. Exhibit 7 outlines a case study of a Vancouver film production that used three-phase, 1,400 A (210 kVA) generators to meet its energy demand. The average load for the production was only 4% of the diesel generator unit’s nameplate capacity, and during periods of maximum load, it was only 16% of that capacity, demonstrating that these power units were substantially oversized for the day-to-day energy demands of the production.

Despite strong interest and early momentum, widespread adoption of clean mobile power technologies across the entertainment industry remains limited due to a range of persistent market, technical, and operational barriers. Such barriers are explored below.

Technical and infrastructure gaps

Technical and infrastructure limitations pose challenges that continue to inhibit adoption. The main technical barrier to the broader adoption of clean mobile power technologies is the lack of availability of units that meet the specific needs of the production industry. As previously discussed, there is a wide range of applications for clean mobile power generation and storage solutions, including backup power, live events, construction, disaster relief, telecommunications, and others. As a result, many manufacturers are developing cutting-edge solutions; however, they do not (yet) fit the required size, power, and mobility specifications to easily integrate into film and TV production.

Some of the technical specifications that require industry-tailored approaches include:

Mobility of the unit: Due to the nature of film and TV productions moving to different locations or needing units to be recharged off-site in remote areas, the industry requires clean power generation and storage solutions that are easily mobile and can be moved more than one time per day, either towed by a standard truck or mounted on a flatbed.

Physical size of the unit: Many production sets are working with constrained space, and as a result clean mobile power units need to be sized to fit within a standard parking space.

Power demand: Clean mobile power units intended to serve as drop-in replacements for diesel generators and function optimally with the existing production equipment must be capable of matching the power outputs of existing diesel generators, including power unit size (at least 90 kW), voltage (120/208 V for Canada and the United States, 230/400 V for the UK), and duration (up to 14 hours).

A survey across major production studios, suppliers, and producers found that the limited supply of industry-specific clean mobile power units, and the volume required for significant adoption, was a major barrier to moving away from relying on fossil fuels within their productions.[40] Yet, through a combination of industry-wide efforts, such as publishing product specifications and requirements and the work of CMPI, the production industry has seen an increase in the development of clean mobile power technology solutions that meet its operational needs.

The lack of supporting infrastructure to enable the use of clean mobile power units on productions has also slowed uptake, including plug-in locations as well as hydrogen power production and distribution.[41]

Labor complexities

Union and workforce rules to date have complicated the responsibilities around handling clean mobile power units and refueling. These rules, and the labor roles they govern, were created during periods where fossil fuel–based technologies and workflows were the only way to feasibly provide power to a set. As a result, clean mobile power technology manufacturers with ambitions of entry into film and TV have largely had to create products that fit into the existing workflows for roles in the industry. When products or business models that do not fit these existing paradigms are introduced, there is often uncertainty over who is authorized to operate or maintain the new technologies, which in turn can slow decision-making and adoption on production.

This challenge is compounded by a decentralized workforce. Crew members are often spread across different organizations and production companies, each with their own protocols and levels of readiness. This fragmentation makes it difficult to ensure consistent training, safety standards, and operational practices. Further, these crew members may even own existing power equipment — usually fossil fuel–based — that they rent to productions as owner/operators. This creates additional friction with adoption, because the end-user for many clean mobile power products may be actively disincentivized to vouch for their adoption since this switch may impact the crew member’s previous investments.

Many crew members, including electricians and gaffers, also often have limited familiarity with new technologies, safety protocols, or fueling/recharging workflows. These knowledge gaps can slow adoption, increase costs, and reinforce reliance on conventional diesel systems.

Complex stakeholder coordination

Complex coordination among stakeholders also poses a significant barrier. The adoption of clean mobile power solutions involves a wide array of stakeholders, including studios, producers, rental companies, equipment manufacturers, unions, and production crews such as electricians and gaffers. Aligning incentives and priorities across this fragmented ecosystem is difficult, especially when legacy practices are deeply embedded and traditional budgeting processes divorce fuel costs from equipment rental costs.

Existing diesel rental stock is spread across a diverse set of owners, including rental houses as well as individual owner/operators, making transitioning to clean mobile power a multitarget process. Each group faces different financial pressures, technical needs, and decision-making timelines, which complicates coordinated investment in new equipment and supporting infrastructure.

Higher capital costs and budget misalignment

Another constraint slowing clean mobile power adoption is the significantly higher capital costs of clean mobile power systems, particularly batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, compared with traditional diesel generators.[42] Based on our analysis, these premiums can be up to three times more than diesel alternatives for HPUs and up to two times more for BESS units, creating economic friction for productions that are incentivized to choose the lowest-cost option. Additional transportation accessories can add to these costs, with BESS unit premiums potentially increasing to up to three times more than a diesel alternative when including the trailer rental costs.[43]

Furthermore, the budgeting structure of most productions fails to capture the full value proposition of clean mobile power systems. Fuel costs, for example, are often categorized separately from equipment rentals, making it difficult to account for long-term savings in operational budgets. Even when clean mobile power solutions reduce total fuel usage or improve efficiency, these benefits may not be easily visible within conventional budget frameworks.[44]

Operational/financial risk and reliability perceptions

Beyond economics and technology, entrenched practices act as barriers. Producers, production managers, and crews are accustomed to established workflows, trusted vendors, and equipment they know will “just work.” This culture discourages experimentation, even when clean mobile power systems are available. The preference for business as usual slows adoption.

Clean mobile power technologies are often viewed by those procuring and operating these systems as unproven or risky, which leads to conservative behavior, such as renting backup diesel generators to limit or avoid any possible downtime on a production. This practice can be a useful backup solution in the earlier stages of clean mobile power technology adoption; however, as clean mobile power units are normalized on production, it can result in increased costs and continue to entrench the pattern of the use of diesel generators on productions. Owners of traditional equipment frame diesel as more reliable, further engraining legacy systems and discouraging experimentation with new clean mobile power products. Productions are effectively “zero-failure environments,” so even small uncertainties around run time, recharging logistics, or new workflows are magnified.

Operational barriers also persist. Clean mobile power solutions often require different workflows, footprints, and safety protocols than diesel. These new processes — including revised setup logistics, recharging schedules, and updated safety requirements — can feel cumbersome to crews accustomed to conventional operations. In some cases, external factors compound these challenges: for example, some insurance policies require productions using clean mobile power units to have backup diesel generators on-site. Together, these operational changes and institutional requirements reinforce the perception of clean mobile power technologies as complex or risky, further dissuading users from change. Additionally, many productions lack robust energy management systems (EMS) and real-time energy data, leading to chronic oversizing of generators and underuse of alternative clean mobile power solutions.

Policy and regulatory patchwork

Government policies (or lack thereof) can limit widespread adoption of clean mobile power technologies. The inherent global nature of productions, including filming in multiple international locations, can result in productions needing to coordinate between different restrictions, regulations, and operation requirements. Furthermore, this patchwork across geographies leads to a lack of, or reduced, centralized signal to governments for future regulatory directions. For example, many incentive programs for clean mobile power use on productions, as well as pollution restrictions for diesel generators, are implemented or enforced at the municipal or occasionally the state or province level. As a result, scaling operations across different jurisdictions for suppliers, studios, and manufacturers can be challenging.

Furthermore, given the novel and quickly evolving nature of some of the technologies available, regulators are still developing safety-related codes and standards for these units and their corresponding fuel supply (where applicable). Permitting processes for large clean mobile power products across North America still often rely on schemes developed for fixed, utility-scale energy storage products. In many jurisdictions in the United States, authorities having jurisdiction now require a mobile battery over 20 kWh (just under one-third the size of a Tesla Model Y battery) to have a UL9540 listing. The process for achieving this listing, which was originally developed for large, fixed BESS installed at utility sites, is arduous for nascent manufacturers, costing several hundred thousand dollars for several months of testing in which a full-scale unit must be destroyed.

BESS and HPUs are still nascent technologies for which regulatory bodies in many countries such as Canada, the UK, and the United States have not finalized all regulations around the movement of the power units or the transportation of fuel for unit refueling. This level of regulatory uncertainty can provide added risk for suppliers looking to purchase clean mobile power, and raises operational challenges for productions navigating different rules and permitting processes across geographies.

Weak and misaligned demand signals

Finally, and very importantly, a key barrier to clean mobile power adoption is the fragmented nature of how power equipment is purchased, maintained, and operated across the industry. Many studios do not own their own equipment and therefore rely on renting power units from rental houses for use on their productions. This structure places rental houses in a critical gatekeeping role for clean mobile power adoption.

However, many rental houses remain hesitant to invest in or stock these products due to unclear or fragmented demand signals from production studios. Without tangible commitments — such as minimum guarantee rental agreements from studios — rental houses face uncertainty about utilization rates and, consequently, the payback periods for new equipment. Rental houses must absorb the full up-front capital costs of these systems while relying on steady rentals to recoup their investment over time. With no assurance of repeat bookings or long-term contracts, clean mobile power units represent a higher-risk asset on their balance sheets. This risk is compounded by the steep price differential compared with diesel generators.

The lack of forward-looking commitments from studios limits the confidence of rental houses to invest in clean mobile power systems, and in turn deprives clean mobile power manufacturers of the market signals needed to justify ongoing R&D, production scaling, and hardware product modifications to meet the needs of the industry. Without visibility into guaranteed purchase volumes or future demand, manufacturers are less likely to invest in next-generation product advancements, build out dedicated production lines, or secure component supply chains. And for many of the manufacturers reliant on external funding such as loans and venture capital investment, lack of commitments — such as prepurchase agreements or letters of intent from rental houses — can inhibit further access to capital from external financiers.

These interdependent value chain dynamics result in a stalled innovation loop: manufacturers hold back on improving, scaling, or investing in clean mobile power technologies for the film and TV industry due to perceived market risk; rental houses delay procurement due to high costs and uncertainty; and studios continue relying on diesel due to constraints of clean mobile power product availability.

The transition to clean mobile power will not happen through technology development alone. To overcome the barriers identified in the previous section, the industry must align around a set of clear, measurable objectives that collectively create the conditions for clean mobile power deployment at scale. These objectives reflect both the demand- and supply-side shifts required for success: reducing the overall energy footprint of productions to ensure that clean mobile power solutions are available and affordable, driving the investment needed to scale, and fostering widespread adoption and literacy on productions. By articulating these outcomes, we aim to address what the industry needs to accomplish to achieve widespread adoption of clean mobile power as an alternative to diesel generators. Section 5 provides recommended strategies to achieve these industry objectives.

Reduce energy demand on productions to efficiently deploy clean mobile power solutions

As discussed in Section 3, demand-side energy reductions, or energy efficiency, are critical components of effective deployment of clean mobile power on productions. This includes taking advantage of new technologies and best practices to reduce the overall load, followed by rightsizing power provisions to meet the actual energy demand of a production. We estimate that efficiency measures can reduce overall energy demand on a production by approximately 49% on average across range of production sizes and temperature environments, bringing a remote production from 309.4 MWh down to 158.38 MWh. Efficiency measures would also reduce peak load by an estimated 63%, from 258 to 95 kW.

We estimate that efficiency measures could reduce energy demand by roughly 286 gigawatt-hours (GWh) across the United States, the UK, and Canada collectively, or 158.13, 66.8, and 61.1 GWh, respectively, in 2026. These savings are roughly equivalent to powering two midsize cities (approximately 100,000 inhabitants) for a month (electricity only).

Increase availability of clean mobile power solutions that meet industry power needs in critical markets

The availability of clean mobile power units tailored to film and TV production needs is still nascent globally. The volume and accessibility will need to increase to be deployed on productions at scale.

There are three critical factors that will enable broader availability of clean mobile power:

Increasing the variety of clean mobile power products offered in the market, allowing for optimizing clean mobile power product selection based on geographic, operational, and energy demand considerations.

Expanding manufacturers’ production capacity to meet growing demand for clean mobile power products.

Ensuring greater market access by increasing the volume of clean mobile power products purchased by suppliers and made available for rental to productions.

Based on current estimated available clean mobile power units, availability would need to scale by 25 times to meet a total energy demand of 360.1 GWh for productions in the United States, Canada, and the UK (based on 2026 projected estimates).

The industry will need to address all three critical availability pieces to deploy enough clean mobile power units at scale to meet energy demand on production sets today and in the future.

Decrease costs of clean mobile power units and services to be equal to or below diesel generators

Although the core components of clean mobile power are proven and benefit from mature supply chains, their application in film and TV is early stage, which keeps unit costs high due to low production volumes and custom, on-production requirements. The primary pathway to cost reduction will be economies of scale. The main, long-term cost driver of these units built for film and TV is still expected to be the underlying components generating and storing power (i.e., fuel cells, battery cells, inverters, and panels), which have relatively mature production processes and supply chains already established. However, the costs of power equipment built specifically for film and TV are initially very high because of the unique and specific needs of the industry, such as those developed with industry partners through CMPI.[45]

Even with additional premiums associated with the use of clean mobile power, it is important to contextualize this with the broader costs of a production. The spend on power and utilities represents an average of 0.8% of a film or TV production’s overall budget. If solar + BESS power is four times the costs of traditional diesel generators today (levelized basis), using BESS solutions would represent a 2.4% increase in overall budget. Similarly, if HPU units are five times the cost, it would result in a 3.2% increase in overall budget.

Drive investment into clean mobile power technologies to expand product offerings and propel product scale

Investment is a critical component to both expanding the range of products and companies that are developing clean mobile power products as well as supporting these companies to ramp up and scale their production lines. Targeted capital is needed not only for early-stage manufacturers, but also for commercial-scale manufacturing, deployment, and supporting infrastructure.

Over the past five years, we have seen just over $38 billion of investment globally into mobile battery climate technology startups and an additional $1 billion of investment in hydrogen power and storage system startups. Average investment round sizes within the past five years have been just under $33 million for battery companies and just over $13 million for hydrogen companies.[46] However, most of this investment has flowed to transportation and stationary power applications, rather than to portable or mobile applications like those needed for film and TV. Redirecting even a small portion of this momentum toward clean mobile power technologies could unlock significant progress for the industry.

Increased investment throughout the value chain can enable manufacturers to scale production, lower per-unit costs through economies of scale, and develop clean mobile power products tailored to on-location production needs. Sustained capital flows, directed not only to technology development but also to expanding shared charging and refueling infrastructure and low-to-zero-emissions fuel production, are essential to move clean mobile power from pilot projects to mainstream industry adoption.

Promote adoption, buy-in, and literacy on productions to remove usage barriers

Widescale buy-in is the linchpin to success in scaling clean mobile power within the film and TV industry. Even if the industry can successfully develop, invest, and scale clean mobile power technologies, if production managers and crews are not champions for using these products and if gaffers do not know how to integrate these products safely and effectively into their operations, then the industry will not see meaningful progress in the use of clean mobile power technologies on production sets, particularly over the next couple of years.

Exhibit 12 highlights critical components needed to enable a flywheel of clean mobile power adoption.

Although stakeholder-specific leadership is essential, from studios setting clean mobile power utilization requirements on productions, to suppliers bringing new technologies to market, to financiers unlocking capital, none of these efforts will be sufficient on their own. Achieving clean mobile power at scale requires cross-industry collaboration and alignment. The barriers to deployment are systemic: fragmented demand, perceived financial and operational risk, and business models that are misaligned with long-term adoption. Building on the objectives outlined above, the industry must pursue coordinated, multistakeholder strategies that create the certainty, trust, and momentum needed to establish clean mobile power as the new standard.

To deliver on these objectives, several priority pathways for collaboration stand out.

Demand and supply formation

Aggregate demand and execute advanced market commitments

Barriers addressed: Weak demand signals, limited supplier investment

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, decrease costs, drive investment

Today, the market signal for clean mobile power is fragmented: each studio or production makes purchasing or rental decisions independently, often for short project cycles. This scattered demand is too inconsistent and small scale to justify major investment in new manufacturing capacity, supply chains, or service infrastructure. The result is a “chicken-and-egg” problem: suppliers hesitate to scale without guaranteed demand, while studios face high costs and limited availability.

If studios act collectively, aligning on technical specifications, timelines for adoption, and clear commitments to transition away from diesel, they can transform this fragmented demand into a reliable, bankable pipeline of orders. Even a modest aggregation across a few major studios can create market certainty at a scale that fundamentally changes supplier incentives. Extending this approach to adjacent industries with similar temporary power needs, such as live events, construction, or sports production, would further amplify purchasing power and create cross-industry learning.

The benefits are clear. A coordinated demand signal reduces per-unit costs through economies of scale, encourages suppliers to invest in production capacity and workforce training, and accelerates the diffusion of new technologies. Aggregation also helps standardize equipment specifications and service requirements, reducing friction in deployment and making it easier for suppliers to serve multiple clients. In effect, the industry can create its own market transformation.

In other sectors, advance market commitments have successfully catalyzed investment into emerging technologies by guaranteeing future demand once products meet agreed-upon performance- and cost-based targets. Studios and adjacent industries can establish an advance market commitment–style commitment for clean mobile power, thus providing manufacturers with confidence to advance development and suppliers with confidence to invest in products. This aggregated, performance- and metric-based demand signal can unlock the supply chain and accelerate clean mobile power adoption.

Such an effort to leverage advance market commitments for an industry-wide demand signal can be executed in various pathways. However, a phased approach of implementation can entail the following: Studios and key suppliers can begin by quantifying near-term clean mobile power demand across productions, identifying the volume, size, and types of units they could realistically deploy over the next several years. In parallel, stakeholders can align on shared cost, reliability, and performance criteria that clean mobile power needs to meet to qualify for procurement, providing suppliers with clear targets for investment and fleet expansion. These demand parameters can then be formalized through multiparty commitments that give manufacturers bankable assurance of future orders. Finally, the industry can designate a neutral convening body or coalition to coordinate commitments, monitor progress, and communicate aggregated demand to suppliers and investors. Executing these steps can convert high-level intent into measurable, investment-ready demand, unlocking supplier confidence, lowering costs, and accelerating the transition from pilots to scaled clean mobile power action.

Flagship pilots

Barriers addressed: Risk aversion, crew and public perception

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, promote adoption, drive investment

Flagship pilots on high-profile productions can serve as powerful proof points to de-risk technology reliability, showcase performance capabilities, and highlight creative compatibility in real-world settings. Film and TV productions are global storytelling platforms; therefore, these pilots carry unique influence. Case studies, behind-the-scenes features, or short-form content can spotlight the practical benefits of clean mobile power while normalizing technologies across the industry (and beyond).[47]

Disney and Netflix have already begun to demonstrate the power of this approach. Publicizing their clean mobile power success stories through sustainability reports, video-based storytelling content, and written articles helps redirect conversations from “can this work?” to “when will this become the standard?” Directors, producers, talent, and crews — trusted voices with cultural reach — have the power to accelerate industry-wide adoption, and broader cultural acceptance. Publicizing and promoting outcomes from these pilots builds confidence, buy-in and excitement; demonstrates reliability; and accelerates adoption and investment.

Capital and cost

Coordinate joint procurement and long-term purchasing frameworks

Barriers addressed: Risk aversion, high costs, fragmented purchasing, limited supply

Objective advanced: Decrease costs, increase availability, drive investment

Once demand has been aggregated through mechanisms such as advance market commitments, joint procurement can offer a practical pathway to translate those signals into action. By pooling purchasing power, studios and rental houses can reduce costs, share risk, and accelerate investment. These collective procurement efforts can evolve into bulk purchasing agreements or frame contracts, which secure volume discounts and provide manufacturers with predictable order pipelines. Such agreements can be structured to include performance criteria, standardized technical specifications, and delivery timelines, ensuring the new clean mobile power products meet the shared industry needs.

Coordinating purchases across multiple suppliers, and potentially studios, increases negotiating leverage, particularly for large-format BESS and hydrogen units. This lowers per-unit costs, stabilizes production schedules, and ensures clean mobile power solutions are available when needed.

Negotiating collectively — rather than ad hoc, individual purchases — unlocks economies of scale and creates greater certainty for manufacturers and investors alike. In effect, this approach transforms fragmented studio interest into a coordinated purchasing body, an essential bridge between intent and implementation.

Develop innovative financing and insurance mechanisms

Barriers addressed: High up-front cost, financial risk aversion

Objectives advanced: Decrease costs, drive investment, increase availability

One of the biggest obstacles to wider adoption of clean mobile power is the perception — and in some cases, reality — of financial and operational risk. Studios are reluctant to take chances on technologies that may not perform as reliably as diesel, especially when production timelines are tight and downtime is costly. Suppliers, on the other hand, often struggle to access affordable capital to scale up manufacturing, maintain fleets, or invest in charging and refueling infrastructure. The result is a financing gap that slows the transition.

New financial structures and risk-mitigation tools can help close this gap. Performance guarantees backed by insurers could reassure studios that clean mobile power systems will meet agreed reliability and output standards. This type of guarantee has been crucial in other sectors: in the early days of solar and wind energy, warranties and performance bonds played a significant role in building buyer confidence. Similarly, credit enhancements or blended finance vehicles, developed in partnership with commercial lenders and development finance institutions, can lower the cost of capital for suppliers, making it easier to scale fleets and infrastructure without passing high costs on to studios.

Studios can also play a catalytic role. Just as corporate offtake agreements helped unlock renewable energy projects, forward commitments from major studios can underpin new financing models. For example, if studios committed to multiyear service contracts, financiers would have the certainty they need to back supplier expansion. Insurers can then step in with tailored products, such as operational risk coverage or revenue guarantees, ensuring that suppliers are protected if unforeseen performance issues arise. The EV sector offers a useful parallel. Battery performance warranties and residual value guarantees were essential in building trust with fleet operators and financiers. Once these mechanisms were in place, leasing and fleet financing models expanded dramatically. The same kind of risk-sharing tools can unlock the widespread adoption of clean mobile power.

Together, these mechanisms spread risk across the ecosystem instead of leaving it concentrated with a single stakeholder. Such collaboration would not only unlock the flow of capital into the sector but also build the trust and predictability needed to make clean mobile power a reliable, mainstream option for productions worldwide.

Secure government incentives and rebates

Barriers addressed: High up-front cost, policy patchwork

Objectives advanced: Decrease costs, drive investment, increase availability

Governments can help bridge the near-term cost premium for clean mobile power units. Targeted policies such as voucher programs (e.g., California’s CORE), tax rebates, and low-interest loans or grants can significantly reduce up-front costs and de-risk investment. Aligning permitting and regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions would also simplify adoption for productions that move between regions.

Studios, suppliers, and equipment manufacturers can help shape these policies by collectively engaging with national, state, and local agencies to align incentives with broader clean energy and film and TV production goals. For example, industry associations can advocate for inclusions of clean mobile power technologies in existing off-road equipment or clean-fleet rebate programs or establish dedicated production-based incentives tied to verified emissions reductions. Ensuring that rebates are designed to be available for all equipment owners, including both larger-scale rental houses as well as smaller independent owner/operators, is critically important.

Clear, consistent incentives and policies can not only drive down costs for early adopters but also provide predictable market signals and give manufacturers the confidence to expand production and drive innovation. Coordinated advocacy across the industry can enable clean mobile power solutions to be recognized as key components of forthcoming energy-, pollution-, human health–, and production-related policy measures, accelerating cost parity, adoption, and deployment.

Operations and workforce

Adopt Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) models

Barriers addressed: Misaligned incentives, operational/logistical risk

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, decrease costs, promote adoption

Traditional equipment rental models place the burden of operation, performance, and fuel management on productions, whereas EaaS offers a different path. Suppliers provide turnkey, reliable, clean energy services, and productions pay for energy delivered rather than for equipment rented. This reduces complexity for productions while creating recurring revenue streams for suppliers that can support reinvestment and growth.

However, for the film and TV industry, EaaS models must be designed in partnership with unions and crews. Current agreements define who can transport and operate equipment on production, roles that are critical for both safety and fairness. If structured collaboratively, EaaS can complement rather than replace these responsibilities, with suppliers managing back-end logistics like recharging or refueling, and crews maintaining their established on-production functions. With proper training and engagement, it can even create opportunities for new skills and roles as clean power systems scale.

EaaS works best for productions with sustained or complex power needs, where predictable service is more valuable than the lowest up-front rental cost. Its success depends on suppliers investing in infrastructure and logistical capacity, and on studios, financiers, and unions aligning early to shape fair, reliable service models. Paired with demand aggregation and financing tools, EaaS can become a cornerstone of industry-wide adoption.

The live events industry has already begun adopting EaaS approaches for portable solar and battery units. Instead of renting equipment, festivals and concerts increasingly contract for “clean power packages” delivered as a service, guaranteeing reliability while reducing operational hassle. For example, Greener Power Solutions offers delivery, setup, operation, monitoring, and takedown of its clean mobile power, including batteries, converters, power trailers, and mobile solar and wind turbines as part of its packages.[48] A similar approach can be adapted and scaled for film and TV production.

Establish efficiency and utilization standards

Barriers addressed: Inefficient generator use, cultural inertia, and lack of clean mobile power normalization

Objectives advanced: Reduce demand, promote adoption

Efficiency-first planning must also become standard practice. Productions should measure real energy loads rather than rely on oversized diesel generator norms. Suppliers can provide real-time monitoring tools, while studios integrate efficiency protocols for lighting, HVAC, trailers, and operations.

At the same time, the industry should adopt baseline utilization standards for clean mobile power, for example, requiring clean mobile power quotes alongside diesel generators and/or mandating clean mobile power coverage of basecamp or catering loads where feasible. Standardized clean mobile power utilization ensures these technologies become the default practice, reduces discretionary avoidance, and generates comparable data across projects.

System enablers

Build shared charging and refueling infrastructure

Barriers addressed: Infrastructure limitations, operational complexity

Objectives advanced: Increase availability, decrease costs, drive investment

Charging hubs for BESS and hydrogen fuel depots remain scarce, creating logistical hurdles and reliance on diesel backups. Studios, suppliers, and governments can coinvest in shared infrastructure at major production hubs. Shared facilities reduce downtime, enable more efficient fleet management, and spread capital costs across multiple users. Transparent governance and access agreements are needed to ensure fair use.

Create standards, interoperability, and data transparency

Barriers addressed: Technical fragmentation, risk perceptions, and knowledge gaps

Objectives advanced: Promote adoption, drive investment, increase availability

Interoperability standards allow suppliers to build flexible fleets without fear of stranded assets. A shared data platform, aggregating anonymized metrics like kWh delivered, uptime, costs, and emissions avoided, would provide transparency, support investment decisions, and accelerate learning across productions and technologies.

Taken together

These strategies form the backbone of a collective approach to industry transformation. Demand aggregation builds market scale, while financing and insurance tools reduce perceived risks, and service-based models realign incentives for long-term growth. Each pathway requires joint action among studios, suppliers, crews, financiers, insurers, and policymakers. But the payoff is clear: lower costs, higher confidence, and a faster path from promising pilots to industry-wide adoption.

No single intervention will deliver this transition alone. Success depends on a coordinated approach that increases demand, expands availability, lowers costs, drives investment, and builds adoption simultaneously. The good news is that the industry has already begun to test many of these solutions in practice. By scaling them through collective action, the film and TV industry can establish clean mobile power not as a niche innovation, but as the new baseline for production. The next step is clear: each stakeholder group must translate these pathways into concrete commitments and actions.

This report is a roadmap for the US, Canadian, and UK film and TV industry to meet a broad industry commitment of reducing generator or mobile power emissions on productions through the adoption of clean mobile power technologies.

Adopting clean mobile power will not only reduce the global production emissions footprint of the film and TV industry, it will also bring other welcome benefits, including reduced noise and air pollution, and, ultimately, operational cost savings. This added value offers a compelling alternative that aligns with environmental goals and production needs.

This shift comes as the clean mobile power market is on the cusp of transformative growth, with the entertainment industry uniquely positioned to lead this transition. Worldwide, the cost of renewable alternatives is falling, following a decades-long trend. There has never been a better time to explore and develop this market.

However, the specific needs of the entertainment industry in terms of size and scale are not currently being met. This is where the industry can take control: advance market commitments, joint procurement strategies, and better planning and standards can convince manufacturers and rental houses that significant demand exists for these technologies, creating economies of scale that drive down still-too-high up-front costs. Successful pilots can build trust among the industry’s essential workforce.

Outside the industry, government incentives, rebates, and innovative financing and insurance strategies can further tip the balance toward clean mobile power.

No single initiative can solve this challenge, but taken together, a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable production environment is possible.

The technology to provide clean mobile power exists today. In many cases, it is already in use. But in addition to scale, cultural barriers to change persist: oversized generators instead of energy efficiency planning, siloed studios instead of joint action, business as usual over improved systems.

All of these challenges have solutions, but it will take every stakeholder in the production process, from studio heads to rental houses and manufacturers, to the men and women who make production sets run, coming together in pursuit of a shared vision.

The industry is not beginning from a standing start; momentum has already grown from studios’ sustainability commitments to real action on the ground. We are now at the decision point of how to scale these technologies and practices even further.

This report demonstrates how to get there, but it will take the entire industry to implement. In working together, the film and TV industry has an opportunity to bring about the clean mobile power revolution. If successful, the result will not only be cleaner, quieter, and healthier productions, but also a film and TV industry that helps shape the clean energy transition worldwide.

Glossary of terms

Ampere (A): A unit of electrical current flowing through a circuit. Contrary to engineering convention, diesel generators in the film industry (especially in the United States) are often described by the number of amperes of current they can support across all their 120 volt (V) phases. This report provides these current “ratings” in keeping with this industry shorthand alongside the generator’s prime kVA rating.

Battery energy storage system (BESS): A rechargeable battery that stores electrical energy (often from renewable sources) and supplies it when needed. These are quiet, emissions-free alternatives to diesel generators.

Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. It expresses the impact of all greenhouse gases (like methane and nitrous oxide) in terms of the amount of CO₂ that would create the same warming effect.

Clean mobile power: Portable energy solutions that do not rely on fossil fuels to store and distribute energy. Clean mobile power may rely on charge stored in battery cells, or chemical energy stored in hydrogen to store and generate this energy.

Coulombic efficiency: A measure of the charge efficiency in batteries, representing the ratio of the total charge extracted during discharge to the total charge injected during a full charge cycle.

Diesel generator: A portable power source that burns diesel fuel to generate electricity. Common on film sets and a major source of climate and air pollution.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs): Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Key examples include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These are often emitted during fuel combustion on productions.

Grid tie-in/power drop: Temporarily accessing the electric grid to use for production power while filming on location, or at a studio or backlot that does not have sufficient power.

Hydrogen power unit (HPU): A generator that either uses hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen-fueled internal combustion to generate power. It emits only water vapor and heat, and (for hydrogen combustion) trace NOx particulates. When powered by green hydrogen, it is a zero-emissions alternative to diesel.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO): A type of renewable diesel made from waste fats and oils. It burns cleaner than fossil diesel and can be used in existing diesel generators with little or no modification.

Kilovolt-ampere (kVA): A unit of electrical power equal to 1,000 volt-amperes. Specifically, kVA refers to the apparent power of an alternating current system: both the power used for useful work (as in kilowatts) and the power not used for useful work. This report uses kVA to describe the prime rating of conventional generators alongside the ampere-based shorthand described above.

Kilowatt (kW): A unit of power equal to 1,000 watts. It measures the rate at which energy is used or produced. For example, a 5 kW power unit can supply 5 kW of power at any given moment. This report uses kW to describe the output of battery- and hydrogen-based power units with inverters.

Kilowatt-hour (kWh): A unit of energy equal to using 1 kilowatt of power for one hour. It is used to measure total energy consumption over time — like how much electricity a set uses during a shoot.

Load: The total amount of electrical power required by all equipment running at a given time on production. Managing load is key to choosing the right power source and avoiding overuse of generators.

Prime rating: In variable-power generator systems, the maximum amount of power a generator can produce when it is used as the primary power source for an application over an extended period. This report defaults to using a power unit’s prime rating when power figures are given, unless noted otherwise.

Renewable diesel: A drop-in fuel made from renewable feed stocks such as vegetable oils, meaning it can blend with regular diesel at any ratio, within a fuel tank. This type of diesel runs cleaner than regular diesel, and the industry standard is a typical 65% reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions.

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from sources a company owns or controls (e.g., from the perspective of a film production, fuel burned in on-production generators or vehicles).

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heating, or cooling (e.g., from the perspective of a studio, power used in studios).

Scope 3 emissions: Indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company’s value chain but are not directly controlled or owned by the company (e.g., from the perspective of a film production, the emissions resulting from building and shipping a generator to a production for use on production).

""We're in the middle of a generational rebuild of America's power system, and it's moving faster than anyone expected,"" said Vinnie Campo, Co-Founder and CEO of Haven Energy. ""Solar and home batteries have redefined power, delivering cleaner, cheaper, and more resilient energy than anything else on the market. Haven is scaling that transformation from the ground up by turning every home into the foundation of a smarter grid. Through partnerships with utilities and local installers, we're expanding faster than traditional infrastructure ever could. The future of power isn't years away. We're building it now.""

U.S. energy demand is projected to rise 15% by 2030, at a pace faster than new generation and transmission can be built. The result will be higher costs, more outages, and mounting strain on the grid. Haven is addressing this challenge by partnering with utilities to deploy home solar and battery systems to their customers. These distributed energy resources (DERs) give utilities flexible, local capacity that strengthens the grid and helps bring energy costs down.

Today, Haven has installed more than 10 MW of distributed capacity and has more than 50 MW in development for 2026, with over $75 million worth of projects in the pipeline. This capacity supports both Haven's growing VPP and the utility-run programs that Haven builds on behalf of its utility partners. Existing partners include the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Clean Power Alliance (CPA), San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE), Clean Energy Alliance (CEA), and Peninsula Clean Energy (PCE).

""Our utility partnerships will form the backbone of how we scale distributed capacity nationwide,"" said Jeff Chapin, Co-Founder of Haven Energy. ""The distributed generation sector has always been at odds with utilities, but we believe the future requires close collaboration to fully maximize the grid value of distributed assets, especially energy storage. Working with utilities isn't a nice-to-have anymore, it's a must. We've refined this model through multiple and successful collaborations, showing how quickly distributed capacity can scale when everyone is aligned. Haven is now building on that success, helping our partners lower costs and strengthen grid resilience faster than ever.""

The funding will also support the expansion of Haven's leasing model and Channel Partner Program. The program enables trusted local installers to offer Haven's solar and battery systems directly to homeowners and integrate the installations into the company's VPP. Haven manages financing, operations, and performance, allowing installers to focus on what they do best—installing.

""We're in the midst of one of the largest energy buildouts in a generation, and the companies that can scale quickly will define it,"" said Tommy Stadlen, Co-Founder of Giant Ventures. ""Haven is at the forefront of this shift, expanding grid capacity faster than traditional infrastructure ever could, leading with innovative models that expand access, and by bringing more individual homes into connected, intelligent energy assets.""

""Haven is demonstrating how quickly distributed energy generation and storage can scale when financing matches the realities of deployment,"" said Zeev Krieger, CEO of Turtle Hill Capital. ""Their approach is helping bring online resilient, reliable power at a moment when the grid needs it most.""

Some high-profile oil and gas industry leaders and organizations have objected to changes to long-standing government policy positions that give companies firm ground on which to make their plans.

And the financial picture around oil and gas drilling is moving against the Trump administration’s hopes. Though politicians may tout new opportunities to drill offshore or in Arctic Alaska, the commercial payoff is not clear and even unlikely.

Having worked in and studied the energy industry for decades, I’ve seen a number of discoveries that companies struggled to moved forward with because either the discovery was not large enough to be commercially profitable or the geology was too difficult to make development plausible. Market conditions are the prime drivers of U.S. energy investment – not moves by politicians seeking to seem supportive of the industry.

Market fundamentals trump policy announcements

The general decline in oil prices from 2022 through late 2025 has reduced the attractiveness of many drilling investments.

And opening the East and West coasts to drilling may sound significant, but these regions have unconfirmed reserves. That means a lot of subsurface work, such as seismic surveys, stratigraphic mapping and reservoir characterization – potentially taking years – would need to be done before any drilling would begin.

Offshore drilling also faces enormous opposition.

On the West Coast, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta have made forceful statements against any new California offshore oil drilling. They have said any effort is economically unnecessary, environmentally reckless and “dead on arrival” politically in the state.

California local governments, environmental groups, business alliances and coastal communities also oppose drilling and have vowed to use legal and political tools to block them.

There is opposition on the East Coast, too. More than 250 East Coast local governments have passed resolutions against drilling.

Governors on both sides of the aisle, including Democrat Josh Stein of North Carolina and Republicans Brian Kemp of Georgia and Henry McMaster of South Carolina, have spoken out against drilling off their coasts.

Arctic drilling is even harder

Drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Beaufort Sea off Prudhoe Bay in Alaska would be a massive undertaking. These projects require years of development and are subject to future reversals in federal policy – just as Trump has lifted long-standing drilling bans in those areas, at least for now.

In addition, Alaska is one of the most expensive and technically challenging places to drill. Specialized equipment, infrastructure for frozen landscapes, and risk mitigation for extreme weather drive costs far above other regions. These projects also face logistical challenges, such as pipelines running hundreds of miles through remote, icy terrain.

Natural gas from Alaska would likely be sold to Asian buyers, who increasingly have alternative sources of supply from Australia, Canada, Qatar and even the U.S. Gulf Coast. As production rises in those places, the entrance of Alaskan natural gas into the market raises the risk for global oversupply, which could depress prices and reduce profitability.

Despite political support from the Trump administration, the oil and gas companies would need financing to pay for the drilling. And those loans won’t come if the oil companies don’t have agreements with buyers for the petroleum products that are produced. Major oil companies have withdrawn from Alaska and signaled skepticism about attractive long-term returns.

Trump has helped some

In the first 10 months of the second Trump administration, the president has signed at least 13 executive orders pertaining to the energy industry. Most of them focus on streamlining U.S. energy regulation and removing barriers to the development and procurement of domestic energy resources. However, the broad nature of some of these orders may fall short of establishing the stable regulatory environment necessary for the development of capital-intensive energy projects with long time horizons.

Those efforts have reversed the Biden administration’s go-slow approach to oil drilling, reducing – though not completely eliminating – the backlog of requests for onshore and offshore drilling permits that accumulated during Biden’s presidency.

Delays in permit approvals increase project costs, risk and uncertainty. Delays can increase the chances that a project ultimately is downsized – as happened with ConocoPhillips’ Willow project in Alaska – or canceled altogether. Longer timelines increase financing and carrying costs, because capital is tied up without generating revenue and developers must pay interest on the debt while waiting for approvals. Delays also lead to higher project costs, eroding project economics and sometimes preventing the project from turning a profit.

Investment follows economics, not politics

Unlike in some countries, such as with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Norway’s Equinor or China’s CHN Energy, the U.S. does not have a national oil or gas company. All of the major energy producers in the U.S. are privately owned and answer to shareholders, not the government.

Executive orders or political slogans may set a tone or direction, but they cannot override the fundamental requirement for profitability. Investments can’t be mandated by presidential decree: Projects must make economic sense. Without that, whether due to low prices, high costs, uncertain demand or changing regulations, companies will not proceed.

Even if federal policies open new areas for drilling or relieve some regulatory restrictions, companies will invest only if they see a clear path to profit over the long term.

With most energy investments costing large amounts of money over many years, the industry likely wants a sense of policy stability from the Trump administration. That could include lowering barriers to profitable investments by accelerating the approval process for supporting infrastructure, such as transmission power lines, pipelines, storage capacity and other logistics, rather than relying on sweeping announcements that lack market traction.

Saris agreed and ruled on Monday that the order was ""arbitrary and capricious."" She also ruled that the freeze itself was ""contrary to law,"" saying that agencies are required to process permits within a reasonable amount of time.

Saris stated in her order that federal agencies failed to offer an explanation for halting the permits beyond the enforcement of the presidential memo. Additionally, she wrote that the agencies did not meaningfully analyze relevant issues before implementing the freeze.

""This scant administrative record makes clear, and the agency defendants do not meaningfully dispute, that the agency defendants have not 'reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the[ir] decision' to implement the Wind Order,"" Saris wrote in her ruling. She added that the defendants ""candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.""

Saris vacated the Wind Order in its entirety, effectively ending the nationwide freeze.

The White House defended Trump's order in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

""Under Joe Biden’s Green New Scam, offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said ""President Trump’s day one executive order instructed agencies to review leases and permitting practices for wind projects with consideration for our country’s growing demands for reliable energy, effects on energy costs for American families, the importance of marine life and fishing industry, and the impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns. President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.""

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has butted heads with the president in the past, celebrated the judge's ruling.

Even so, Carson’s team is evaluating a range of potential solutions, including heat-storing batteries and shallower geothermal networks, in case Earth Source Heat doesn’t work as well as hoped.","ITHACA, N.Y. — A faded-red wellhead emerged in the middle of a pockmarked parking lot, its metal bolts and pipes illuminated only by the headlights of Wayne Bezner Kerr’s electric car. He stepped out of the vehicle into the dark, frigid evening to open the fence enclosing the equipment, which is just down the road from Cornell University’s snow-speckled campus in upstate New York.

We were there, shivering outside in mid-November, to talk about heat.

Bezner Kerr is the program manager of Cornell’s Earth Source Heat, an ambitious project to directly warm the sprawling campus with geothermal energy pulled from deep underground. The wellhead was the tip of the iceberg — the visible part of a nearly 10,000-foot-long borehole that slices vertically through layers of rock to reach sufficiently toasty temperatures. Cornell is using data from the site to develop a system that will replace the school’s fossil-gas-based heating network, potentially by 2035.

“We can’t decarbonize without solving the heat problem,” Bezner Kerr repeated like a refrain during my visit to Ithaca.

The Ivy League university is trying to accomplish something that’s never been done in an area with rocky geology like upstate New York’s. Most existing geothermal projects are built near the boundaries of major tectonic plates, where the Earth’s warmth wells up toward the surface. Iceland, for example, is filled with naturally heated reservoirs that circulate by pipe to keep virtually every home in the country cozy. And in Kenya and New Zealand, geothermal aquifers supply the heat used in industrial processes, including for pasteurizing milk and making toilet paper.

Bezner Kerr and I, however, stood atop a multilayered cake of mudstone, limestone, sandstone, and other rocks — seemingly everything but water. To access the heat radiating beneath our feet, his team will need to create artificial reservoirs more than 2 miles into the earth.

America’s geothermal industry has made significant strides in recent years to generate clean energy in less obvious locations, and it’s done so by adapting tools and techniques from oil and gas drilling. One leading startup, Fervo Energy, is developing ​“enhanced geothermal systems” in Utah and Nevada to produce clean electricity around the clock. The approach involves fracking impermeable rocks, then pumping them full of water so that the rocks heat the liquid, which eventually produces steam to drive electric turbines.

Earth Source Heat plans to use similar methods to drill a handful of super-deep wells and create fractures near or within the crystalline basement rock, where temperatures are consistently around 180 degrees Fahrenheit, no matter the weather above. The project is also unique in that, among next-generation systems, it’s focused only on heating buildings — not supplying electricity — for the nearly 30,000 students and faculty. That’s because heat represents the biggest source of Cornell’s energy use, and its largest obstacle to reducing planet-warming emissions.

On the chilliest days, the campus can use up to 104 megawatts of thermal energy, which is more than triple its peak use of electrical energy during the year.

Such a ratio poses a big conundrum for not only large institutions like Cornell but also any cold-climate cities that burn fossil fuels to keep warm, as well as manufacturing plants that require lots of steam and hot water for steps as varied as fermenting beer, making oat milk, and sterilizing equipment.

Right now, one of the most immediate ways to cut emissions from thermal energy use is to replace gas-fired boilers and the like with heat pumps and other electrified technologies. But that can substantially increase a city’s or factory’s electricity use. In an ideal world, all the new power demand would be satisfied by renewable energy projects and served by a modern and efficient grid, helping limit the costs and logistical headaches of ditching fossil fuels.

In reality, though, the U.S. electricity system is straining to keep up with the emergence of data centers, new factories, and electrified buildings and vehicles. Utilities are pushing plans to build new gas-fired power plants and proposing higher electricity rates to cover the costs. New York, for its part, is failing to meet its own goals for installing gigawatts of new renewables and energy storage projects by 2030, in part because of barriers to permitting projects in the state. New York’s independent grid operator recently warned of ​“profound reliability challenges” in coming years as rapidly growing demand threatens to outpace supply.

Geothermal heating could provide a way to curb thermal-energy emissions without burdening the electric system even more, said Drew Nelson, vice president of programs, policy, and strategy with Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit that advocates for geothermal energy use.

“Electrification is great, but that’s a whole lot of new electrons that need to be brought onto the grid, and a whole lot of new transmission and distribution upgrades that need to be made,” Nelson said by phone. ​“For applications like industrial heat, or building heating and cooling, geothermal almost becomes a ​‘Swiss Army knife,’ in that it can help reduce demand.” Using geothermal energy directly is also far more efficient than converting it to electricity, since a lot of energy gets lost in the process of generating electrons.

Still, deep, direct-use geothermal systems like the one Cornell is developing are relatively novel, and many manufacturers and city planners are either unfamiliar with the solution or unwilling to be early adopters.

Sarah Carson, the director of Cornell’s Campus Sustainability Office, explained that Earth Source Heat is intended to reduce technology risks and costs for other major heat users that might benefit from geothermal, including the region’s dairy producers and breweries. We spoke inside her office, which is attached to the 30-megawatt gas-fired cogeneration plant that currently provides both electricity and heating for the campus.

“We’re working really hard to build a ​‘living lab’ approach into the ethos of how we approach things,” she said. ​“Can we not only take care of our own [carbon] footprint but also help develop and demonstrate solutions that could scale out?”

Inside the Lake Source Cooling facility, giant blue pipes intersect through pieces of equipment called heat exchangers. Since heat naturally flows from hotter objects to colder ones, the lake water acts like a magnet, pulling heat out of the campus-water loop. The lake-water loop then moves the heat down to the cold bottom of Cayuga, and the cycle repeats. Bezner Kerr said Earth Source Heat will do the same but in reverse, flowing hot water up to the surface and returning the cooled-off water underground, where the earth can continuously reheat it.

Initially, he said, the new geothermal system will connect to an existing underground hot-water loop that heats East Campus, including two energy-intensive research buildings. This first stage is expected to cost over $100 million and could be completed in the next few years. Depending on how Earth Source Heat performs, the university might expand the system to warm around 150 large buildings on the main campus.

The university’s approach is far more intensive than the geothermal systems that cities and high-rise buildings are increasingly deploying across the country. An underground thermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, consists of 90 holes drilled about 650 feet deep that heat 36 homes and commercial buildings; it also uses electric heat pumps to boost the temperatures coming out of the ground. Cornell’s home city of Ithaca has proposed piloting its own thermal network to heat and cool buildings on a city block.

Jefferson Tester, a Cornell professor and the principal scientist for Earth Source Heat, said these shallower geothermal systems aren’t as practical for heating the 15-million-square-foot campus.

For one, the university would need to drill north of 10,000 smaller wells to adequately warm all its buildings, instead of the five very deep wells it has planned. And digging deeper into the ground will allow Cornell to use the heat straight away, without adding heat pumps.

Tester joined Cornell in 2009 to help launch Earth Source Heat, which is part of the university’s larger plan to achieve a carbon-neutral campus in Ithaca by 2035. For over a decade, faculty and engineers gathered data and developed models to get a better sense of the region’s geology, heat resources, and potential for drilling-related earthquakes, often in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy.

But to fully grasp the subsurface’s conditions, they needed to drill. ​“And once you understand the geology well enough … you could go anywhere in this region” to harness geothermal energy, Tester said.

In 2022, the university drilled that first 10,000-foot-long hole, which is called the Cornell University Borehole Observatory, in the parking lot. ​“It was the same level of intensity as an oil-and-gas exploration rig,” Bezner Kerr recalled. ​“It was oil-and-gas workers drilling a well that produces knowledge instead of producing hydrocarbons.” Cornell received about $7 million from the Energy Department for the project, which cost around $14 million to deploy.

Now the team is ready to drill again, though the timing of the next phase is up in the air amid funding uncertainty.

Earth Source Heat wants to reopen the borehole, deepen it, and use fiber-optic cables and other tools to study how the rock responds to stress and high-pressure injections of water — data that will inform the design of the final system. In 2024, during the Biden administration, Cornell applied for over $10 million from the Energy Department for the project, with plans to line up drilling equipment this year. But the Trump administration hasn’t yet responded to the request.

If the team can finish the second phase of its borehole observatory, the next step will be to drill a demonstration well pair — two vertical spines with horizontal legs, and fractured rocks in between — to begin heating part of East Campus.

The drilling delays come as Cornell faces growing criticism from climate activists both on and off campus, who argue that the university isn’t reducing its emissions nearly fast enough to help limit global temperature rise. Cornell on Fire, a climate-justice group, has framed Earth Source Heat in particular as too big of a gamble, given the project’s tenuous timeline for completion and the risks involved with deploying a first-of-its-kind solution.

Carson said her office is feeling pressure from climate advocates to start replacing the current gas-fueled heating network with electrified technologies like heat pumps and electric boilers. But she and her colleagues believe that swiftly boosting Cornell’s electricity demand would require increasing gas-fired power generation off campus, reducing the school’s CO2 footprint on paper without lowering emissions overall. Even so, Carson’s team is evaluating a range of potential solutions, including heat-storing batteries and shallower geothermal networks, in case Earth Source Heat doesn’t work as well as hoped.

These tensions highlight the tricky reality of developing big and novel clean-energy projects. A well-designed, smartly managed geothermal system could help decarbonize heat for buildings and factories over the course of many decades. But finding the right locations and best ways to install those networks takes careful planning, patience, and significant upfront investment. That can be tough to stomach, both for project investors antsy to see financial returns and for citizens eager to dump polluting fossil fuels today.

One Republican, Sen. Greg Walker, voted with the committee’s two Democrats against moving the proposal forward.

It is unclear, however, if there is enough support from the full chamber to pass the new congressional map backed by Trump into law. A few state senators on the elections committee voted to advance the bill but indicated they may vote against it later this week.

State Sen. Greg Walker, an Indiana Republican who is against redistricting, spoke about multiple threats made against him. About a dozen Indiana lawmakers have said they received threats in recent weeks as the state Legislature debates redistricting, which is backed by Trump.

“I refuse to be intimidated,” Walker proclaimed in an impassioned speech during an elections committee meeting on the legislation. “I fear for all states if we allow intimidation and threats to become the norm.”

He said that while he was holding a baby the previous night, “I began to cry as I thought about the future of that child where we accept that intimidation is normal.”

Walker, who is not seeking reelection, choked up as he said he’s considering filing anyway.

The federal judge says the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Crockett told a cheering crowd in Dallas to “tune out” those who say she can’t win in the GOP-dominated state because she is Black, a woman or a Democrat.

“I want to be clear. I’m not running just to run,” Crockett said. “This is about winning.”

The event opened with a video of Crockett, with audio of President Donald Trump criticizing her playing over it.

“As a candidate who is constantly attacked and seen as a threat,” she said, “that’s because I am.”

“What we need is for me to have a bigger voice,” Crockett said. “We need to make sure that we are going to stop all of the hell that is raining down on all of our people.”

GOP Sen. John Cornyn says he is eager for the prospect of facing U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett as the Democrat joins the race for the seat he currently holds.

“I think that would be a lot of fun,” he told reporters at the U.S. Capitol. “She just says such inflammatory and crazy things.”

But to face Crockett, Cornyn would need to survive a competitive GOP primary, which he acknowledged may advance to a runoff in May.

“I’ve been through a lot of campaigns before,” he said. “I actually kind of like them and so I look forward to the competition.”

“We’re doing what we need to do,” he added, “and we’re following our plan.”

A federal magistrate judge on Monday rejected a bid by Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters to be released from prison while she appeals her state conviction for orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Peters argued that the magistrate judge should free her because she said the state judge who sentenced her to nine years behind bars violated her First Amendment rights. Peters claimed he punished her for making allegations about election fraud, but prosecutors argued that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed judges to consider people’s speech during sentencings if they deem it relevant.

President Donald Trump and other supporters have called for Peters to be released. In August, Trump warned he would “take harsh measures” if Peters wasn’t freed, posting on Truth Social that “she did nothing wrong.”

A federal judge investigating whether Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador wants to hear from a top Justice Department official and a whistleblower.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.

In March, Boasberg ordered the administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. Instead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe.

Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.

Reuveni filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport the migrants. The administration has denied those allegations and any wrongdoing.

Tucked into the National Defense Authorization Act that Congress is taking up this week is a provision that threatens to withhold money from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if the Pentagon declines to hand over “unedited video of strikes” against drug cartels in Central and South America.

The congressional committees overseeing the military have been pressing the Pentagon for more answers on a boat strike after a press report that one operation had fired on two survivors of an initial strike who were clinging to a partially-destroyed boat.

While lawmakers with leadership positions on those committees were able to review the video last week, it has not been provided to the full committee and stayed in the possession of the Department of Defense.

Is the president taking sides in what could become a competitive GOP primary for New York governor? Not just yet.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, one of Trump’s most stalwart supporters in the party, has already launched a bid. But Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman, similarly a Trump ally, is considering a run.

As a reporter on Monday asked about Stefanik, Trump interjected and said, “She’s great.” When the reporter continued about Blakeman, Trump added: “He’s also great.”

“He’s great, and she’s great. They’re both great people,” Trump said. “We have a lot of great people in the Republican Party.”

Stefanik was initially nominated to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but ultimately stayed in the House as to not risk the GOP’s narrow majority in the chamber.

Blakeman has been openly considering a run and last month announced a listening tour with stops across New York state.

Twelve former FBI agents fired after kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in Washington sued Monday to get their jobs back, saying their action had been intended to de-escalate a volatile situation and was not meant as a political gesture.

The agents say in their lawsuit that they were fired in September by Director Kash Patel because they were perceived as not being politically affiliated with President Trump. But they say their decision to take a knee on June 4, 2020, days after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, has been misinterpreted as political expression.

The lawsuit says the agents were assigned to patrol the nation’s capital during a period of civil unrest prompted by Floyd’s death. Lacking protective gear or extensive training in crowd control, the agents became outnumbered by hostile crowds they encountered and decided to kneel to the ground in hopes of defusing the tension, the lawsuit said. The tactic worked, the lawsuit asserts — the crowds dispersed, no shots were fired and the agents “saved American lives” that day.

“Plaintiffs were performing their duties as FBI Special Agents, employing reasonable de-escalation to prevent a potentially deadly confrontation with American citizens: a Washington Massacre that could have rivaled the Boston Massacre in 1770,” says the lawsuit, which was filed by attorneys with the Washington Litigation Group.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says the reason farmers need billions of dollars from the federal government is largely because of President Donald Trump’s “disastrous” tariff policies.

“Now Donald Trump’s patting himself on the back, acting like a hero to farmers while using taxpayer dollars to clean up the mess he created,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “It’s textbook Donald Trump incompetence.”

Trump announced $12 billion in economic assistance to farmers earlier Monday. Schumer said a one-time payment is “cold comfort” for farmers who have suffered anxiety and financial losses.

“Farmers do not want a handout. Ask them,” Schumer said. “They want markets. But Donald Trump’s policies have killed the markets our farmers rely on to make a living.”

The president backed away from his comments last week in which he said “No problem” when asked if he would release footage of the military’s strike on a boat in the Caribbean and a follow-on attack that killed survivors.

When asked by a reporter, he denied that he said, “no problem” last week. Instead, he said, “Whatever Hegseth wants to do is OK with me.”

But last week, Trump said, “Whatever they have we’d certainly release.”

The president on Wednesday also seemed to acknowledge that the boat was capsized when the survivors were hit.

“I saw the video. They were trying to turn the boat back to where it could float,” he said. “We don’t want to see that because that boat was loaded up with drugs.”

The White House says China has agreed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans by the end of the year under a new agreement made in October.

But so far, China has bought about 2.8 million metric tons. Trump boasted in his meeting that China has promised to buy more than $40 billion of soybeans.

He may be referring to China’s pledge — as claimed by his administration — to buy at least another 25 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028. Beijing, however, has yet to confirm those numbers.

The president remarked on how his Cabinet meeting last week went long — in fact it was more than two hours, with the president’s eyelids appearing to flutter shut and his budget director doodling as it dragged on.

“We’re gonna go a little faster,” Trump said.

He then gave the floor to one of his top economic advisers, Kevin Hassett, but pleaded: “Go real fast, Kevin.”

Hassett did not quite go fast, and he seemed to realize it. He reassured the room: “I’m going fast.”

The Trump administration’s bridge payments for farmers are scheduled to go out the door in February.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the payments will move by Feb. 28. An initial $11 billion will target farmers of row crops, while another $1 billion is still being sorted out for specialty crops.

Farmers who are eligible to apply for the aid will know more about what the numbers look like in “the next couple of weeks,” Rollins said.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says $1 billion of the farming aid is being held back initially, though it will eventually go to help cover specialty crop expenses.

Rollins said $11 billion would be released in the first phase of the aid program to farmers — not the $12 billion Trump announced mere moments earlier.

Trump tried to interrupt, saying the program was actually worth $12 billion. But that prompted Rollins to take the unusual step of talking over the president to say $1 billion would be held back.

The president said that the U.S. is taking in “trillions” of dollars from tariffs and other investments.

But the actual numbers are far less than that. Treasury Department data shows that revenue from tariffs in the last fiscal year was nearly $195 billion. In the current fiscal year, tariffs have earned around $31 billion so far.

Trump has boasted of additional income from investments in the U.S. by other countries and international companies. But the precise terms of these investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute or involve potentially fuzzy math.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he has divested from his North Dakota soybean farmland.

“I actually just divested it this week as part of my ethics agreement, so I’m out of that business,” Bessent said Sunday on the CBS program “Face the Nation.”

Bessent, a millionaire former hedge fund manager, had stated in October that he shared the concerns of U.S. farmers who bore the brunt of the trade war between the U.S. and China, telling ABC News, “I’m actually a soybean farmer.”

The move comes as he leads Trump administration negotiations with China over trade and tariffs.

The president said the $12 billion in economic assistance comes from “taking a small portion” of revenue from the steep levies his administration has imposed on goods imported from around the world.

Trump has imposed tariffs against top U.S. trading partners at rates unseen in nearly a century.

He has frequently suggested that tariff revenues could be used to cover federal spending — frequently bragging about directing federal officials to “check the tariff shelf,” without providing details on how much federal revenue has actually been taken in, or how it would be distributed.

Farmers appreciate the aid package, but they say it’s likely only a down payment on what’s needed. They also added that government aid doesn’t solve the fundamental problems farmers are facing, including soaring costs and uncertain markets for their crops.

During Trump’s first term, he gave farmers more than $22 billion in aid payments in 2019 at the start of his trade war with China and nearly $46 billion in 2020, although that year also included aid related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

But farmers want to make a profit off of selling their crops — not rely on government aid to survive.

“That’s a start, but I think we need to be looking for some avenues to find other funding opportunities and we need to get our markets going. That’s where we want to be able to make a living from,” said Caleb Ragland, the Kentucky farmer who serves as president of the American Soybean Association.

Habba gave up her fight to stay as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor after an appeals court said she had been serving in the post unlawfully.

In a statement posted on social media, Habba assailed the court’s ruling as political, but said she was resigning “to protect the stability and integrity” of her office.

“But do not mistake compliance for surrender,” she said, adding that the administration would continue its appeal. “This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”

Once a partner in a small New Jersey law firm, Habba was among Trump’s most visible legal defenders during the four years he was out of power, representing him in court and frequently appearing on cable TV news as his “legal spokesperson.”

But she had limited federal court experience, and New Jersey’s two Democratic senators indicated they would block her confirmation in the U.S. Senate.

Arriving arm-in-arm with Santa, the first lady met with children and military families at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia on Monday.

She told children that Santa’s reindeer were resting at the North Pole while he joined her aboard a V-22 Osprey aircraft: “Santa told me the Osprey floated through the air like a giant snowflake, but was way faster than a sleigh could ever fly.”

Flanked by boxes of toys and a helicopter, the first lady wished families a merry Christmas and thanked those with loved ones away from home. Later, she passed out toys and helped children with coloring projects while a brass band played Christmas songs.

Conservative Supreme Court justices are posing tough questions about why independent-agency board members should be protected from presidential firing without cause.

Chief Justice John Roberts asked a series of questions about how far Congress could go in assigning power to independent agencies. Agarwal acknowledged “competing dangers” but argued that the current system of independent agencies has worked pretty well for nearly a century.

Expanding Trump’s firing power, on the other hand, would put “everything on the chopping block,” he said.

Justice Samuel Alito pushed back hard on that argument, suggesting Congress could one day whittle more power from the presidency.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, sometimes considered a potential swing vote, also seemed dubious. While the system may have worked so far, she said it’s impossible to tell what might happen 20 years in the future.

The case before the Supreme Court today is over the firing of Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission.

But the court’s eventual decision has big implications for all kinds of federal agencies.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh brought up one of the biggest questions: If the court sides with the government, what would that mean for the Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy?

Kavanaugh is a conservative who’s considered receptive to the Trump administration’s position. But he told Sauer he was concerned about undermining the Fed’s independence.

In his answer, Sauer pointed to the Supreme Court’s previous order, calling the Fed a “quasi private, uniquely structured. He said it raises different issues.

The court has allowed many of Trump’s firings for now, but a rare exception was Lisa Cook, the Fed board governor he tried to fire. The high court is hearing arguments over her firing in January.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and their Australian counterparts held annual U.S.-Australia security talks, lauding decades of strong strategic cooperation between their countries and talking up a deal with Britain under which Australia will develop nuclear-powered submarines as key to Indo-Pacific stability.

Rubio, Hegseth, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles met at the State Department on Monday for discussions on their bilateral cooperation on critical minerals, defense production and the so-called “AUKUS” agreement, a Biden administration-era deal that will see the U.S. and Britain assist Australia with production of advanced submarines.

All sides said AUKUS was moving “full steam ahead” and Rubio is to meet later Monday with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.

None of the four made any reference to China and its increasing assertiveness in the region, including in the South China Sea and directed at Taiwan, but the annual AUSMIN meeting have for the past several years focused heavily on countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.

The Republican administration’s top attorney to the nation’s highest court is facing close questioning as he argues for expanded presidential power.

The liberal justices on the Supreme Court grilled Solicitor General John Sauer on the potential consequences if they win the case.

“You’re asking us to destroy the structure of government,” said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, “and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.”

The high court’s conservative supermajority is seen as sympathetic to the administration’s position that presidents should be able fire independent agency board members for any reason.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are meeting their Australian counterparts for annual U.S.-Australia talks expected to focus on Indo-Pacific security and countering China’s increasing assertiveness in the region, including in the South China Sea and directed at Taiwan.

Rubio, Hegseth, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles were gathered at the State Department on Monday with many eyes also on the Russia-Ukraine and Gaza conflicts along with U.S. military strikes against alleged narco-traffickers in the Western Hemisphere that have raised questions about the use of force there.

The four are also expected to discuss progress in the so-called “AUKUS” pact, a Biden administration-era agreement under which the U.S., Britain and Australia committed to building nuclear submarines for the Australians. Rubio is to meet later Monday with British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper.

President Donald Trump is planning a $12 billion aid package for U.S. farmers who have struggled to sell their crops while getting hit by rising costs after the president raised tariffs on China as part of a broader trade war, a White House official told the Associate Press.

Trump will unveil the plan Monday at the White House, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak ahead of the planned announcement.

Farmers have backed Trump politically but his aggressive trade policies and frequently changing tariff rates have come under increasing scrutiny because of the impact on the agricultural sector and because of broader consumer worries.

The aid is the administration’s latest effort to defend Trump’s economic stewardship and answer voter angst about rising costs — even as the president has dismissed concerns about affordability as a Democratic “hoax.”

Republicans in key battleground U.S. House districts are working to contain the political fallout that may come when thousands of their constituents face higher bills for health insurance coverage obtained through the Affordable Care Act.

For a critical sliver of the Republican majority, the impending expiration of what are called enhanced premium tax credits after Dec. 31 is a pressing concern as they potentially face headwinds in a 2026 midterm election that will be critical to President Trump’s agenda.

One of those is first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., whose victory for the Allentown-area seat last year was among the narrowest in the nation.

Mackenzie is part of a bipartisan group that’s been pressing for an eleventh-hour compromise, advocating for an extension of the tax credits that tries to fix perceived flaws and bring down health care costs. But the push is a long shot due to entrenched GOP opposition to the health overhaul known as “Obamacare.”

Former Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, is ending his U.S. Senate campaign in Texas and instead will attempt a House comeback bid.

Allred said he’ll run in a newly drawn district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which he previously represented in Congress before running unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2024.

Allred’s decision comes with Rep. Jasmine Crockett expected to make her decision on the Senate race on the final day of qualifying in Texas. State lawmaker James Talarico also is running for the Senate. Allred said in a statement that he wanted to avoid a Democratic primary battle and likely runoff.

Republicans also are expecting a hotly contested primary between incumbent John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt.

The Trump administration’s push to expand control over independent federal agencies comes before a sympathetic Supreme Court that could overturn a 90-year-old decision limiting when presidents can fire board members.

Lawyers for the administration are defending President Donald Trump’s decision to fire Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter without cause and calling on the court to jettison the unanimous 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor.

Arguments are taking place Monday.

The court’s six conservative justices already have signaled strong support for the administration’s position, over the objection of their three liberal colleagues, by allowing Slaughter and the board members of other agencies to be removed from their jobs even as their legal challenges continue.

Members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission also have been fired by Trump.

Trump is angry that Rep. Henry Cuellar is running again as a Democrat rather than switch parties after the president pardoned the Texas congressman and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case.

Trump blasted Cuellar for “Such a lack of LOYALTY,” suggesting the Republican president might have expected the clemency to bolster the GOP’s narrow House majority heading into the 2026 midterm elections.

Cuellar, in a television interview Sunday after Trump’s social media post, said he was a conservative Democrat willing to work with the administration “to see where we can find common ground.” The congressman said he had prayed for the president and the presidency at church that morning “because if the president succeeds, the country succeeds.”

Citing a fellow Texas politician, the late President Lyndon Johnson, Cuellar said he was an American, Texan and Democrat, in that order. “I think anybody that puts party before their country is doing a disservice to their country,” he told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”

Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors and praised Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, Michael Crawford and George Strait, the slate of honorees he helped choose, as being “legendary in so many ways.”

“Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,” Trump, the first president to command the stage, said to open the show.

The Republican president said the artists, recognized with tribute performances during the show, are “among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.”

Since returning to office in January, Trump has made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture.

Trump said Saturday that he was hosting “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted the broadcast scheduled for Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever.

Before Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term.

Trump said Sunday that a deal struck by Netflix to buy Warner Bros. Discovery “could be a problem” because of the size of the combined market share.

“There’s no question about it,” Trump said, answering questions about the deal and various other topics as he walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Honors.

The Republican president said he will be involved in the decision about whether the federal government should approve the $72 billion deal. If approved by regulators, the merger would put two of the world’s biggest streaming services under the same ownership and join Warner’s television and motion picture division, including DC Studios, with Netflix’s vast library and its production arm.

Asked if Netflix should be allowed to buy the Hollywood giant behind “Harry Potter” and HBO Max, the president said, “Well that’s the question.”

“They have a very big market share and when they have Warner Bros., you know, that share goes up a lot so, I don’t know,” he said. “I’ll be involved in that decision, too. But they have a very big market share”

Reg 52,498 (Nov. 20, 2025); Revising the Definition of “Waters of the United States”, ENV’T PROT.","The ephemeral meaning of what bodies of water qualify as “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) is once again changing, spurring a renewed focus on state programs. On 17 November 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) announced a proposed rule redefining WOTUS under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) in the newest campaign in the prolonged legal war over the term’s definition.1

WOTUS is a crucial concept that defines the bodies of water subject to regulation under the CWA. Among other things, it determines when developers or landowners must obtain federal CWA permits for actions that affect wetlands and waters. The inclusion (or not) of an area as WOTUS determines when American industry, farmers, states, and landowners are required to seek CWA permits for activities such as dredging, filling, or discharging that may impact such waters. Changes to WOTUS that may reduce the scope of federal coverage will place greater emphasis on corresponding state regulations, which vary significantly concerning how closely they follow the federal regulations and, in some cases, provide distinct grounds for state water regulation.

The Sackett decision cemented a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, and the final rule must conform with that framework. Still, ambiguities will remain, particularly in the definition and application of “relatively permanent” waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to such waters. Public comments on the proposed rule close on 5 January 2026.

Proposed Rule Highlights

The proposed rule is the agencies’ latest attempt to align the definition of WOTUS with the US Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA.2 The Sackett decision significantly narrowed the scope WOTUS, holding that federal CWA jurisdiction reaches only “relatively permanent waters” (e.g., streams, river, lakes) connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to such waters.3

A key feature of the proposed rule is a new limiting concept of “wet season,” applicable to the proposed rule’s definitions of “relatively permanent” and “continuous surface connection.”4 The proposed rule requires that during the “wet season” surface hydrology must “be continuous,” otherwise the CWA does not apply.5 The preamble to the proposed rule describes the agencies’ interpretation of “wet season,” but the proposed rule itself does not define the term.

The rule also removes “interstate waters” as an independent basis for CWA jurisdiction. Interstate waters must fall within the enumerated list of WOTUS (e.g., “relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water” (such as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes) and wetlands that are connected and indistinguishable from such water bodies) to be covered under the CWA.

It also defines numerous terms such as “relatively permanent,”6 “tributary,”7 “continuous surface connection,”8 “excluded ditches,”9 excluded “prior converted cropland,”10 and excluded “waste treatment systems.”11

Although the rule attempts to add clarity about what kind of wetlands will be covered, the undefined term “wet season” will likely lead to more questions, challenges, and disparity in application between states. Ultimately, as federal coverage ebbs and flows, it will likely fall to the states to determine the level of protection granted to their waters.

Some States Fill the Gap, Others Roll Back Regulations

Many states rely on the CWA and its regulations as their only form of wetland protection for state waters. Others, such as California, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Virginia already have comprehensive regulatory programs. States have also responded to Sackett and the instability of the WOTUS rule by changing their laws: New Mexico and Colorado have responded by expanding protections and programs, while states such as Tennessee have rolled back their laws.

States Already Protecting Waters Beyond the Scope of CWA Jurisdiction

Many states already have comprehensive water protection and permitting schemes that apply to all waters within the state, including and beyond those covered by federal definitions.12 For instance, Pennsylvania’s “Clean Streams Law” extends protections to all “waters of the Commonwealth,”13 and its Dam Safety and Encroachments Act14 continues current wetland protection standards and permitting requirements without regard to whether wetlands qualify as WOTUS.

In Virginia, the State Water Control Law has implemented requirements beyond the CWA since 2000 with the goal of protecting and restoring the quality of Virginia’s waters. The law requires permits for actions affecting state waters and covers pollution control, water conservation, and management, with penalties for violations.15 Virginia defines “state waters” as “all water, on the surface and under the ground, wholly or partially within or bordering the Commonwealth or within its jurisdiction, including wetlands.”16 Where wetlands are defined as “those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.”17

Similarly, in California, “waters of the state” are defined broadly as “any surface water or groundwater, including saline waters, within the boundaries of the state.”18 Both waters of the state and wetlands are protected and regulated under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act by the State Water Resources Control Board and Regional Water Quality Control Boards, responsible for water quality protection and permitting activities that can affect water quality. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is responsible for permitting streambed alterations of state waters.

States Expanding Protections

Southwestern states were some of the most severely affected by Sackett; according to the New Mexico Legislature, approximately 90–95% of “waters” in the state lost protections, prompting the legislature to pass Senate Bills 21 and 22.19 The bills expand the New Mexico Water Quality Act to protect surface waters no longer covered by federal law. They also give New Mexico authority to seek the EPA’s approval to become the 48th state to gain authorization for surface water permitting,20 and address polluted groundwater that falls outside federal Superfund program jurisdiction.

Similarly affected, Colorado is also expanding state regulations to address gaps left by Sackett. The state legislature directed the Water Quality Control Commission to establish dredge-and-fill permitting and mitigation rules by 31 December 2025 to protect state waters not otherwise protected by federal law. The outcome will be Regulation No. 87, which is expected to be finalized by 31 December 2025.

The California Legislature is also considering additional regulations to further protect California state waters to address a perceived rollback in protections due to the Sackett decision and Trump administration policies.21 The proposed regulations would explicitly extend protections to state waters no longer covered under federal law.

States Rolling Back Protections

Tennessee has a robust state program but changed its wetlands protections during its 2025 legislative session in response to Sackett.22 These amendments to the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act establish new categories of wetlands with varying regulatory triggers for each. The thresholds for needing a state permit for altering isolated wetlands have been changed so that some isolated wetlands can be altered with no regulatory oversight as long as there is no water quality impact, and the trigger for needing a state permit for altering isolated wetlands has been limited.

conclusion

Comments on the proposed WOTUS rule are being accepted until 5 January 2026. The Final Rule will take effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register. The EPA and USACE will also hold two hybrid public meetings during the comment period. Information on the public meetings can be found here.

4 “The phrase ‘at least during the wet season’ is intended to include extended periods of predictable, continuous surface hydrology occurring in the same geographic feature year after year in response to the wet season, such as when average monthly precipitation exceeds average monthly evapotranspiration. As proposed, surface hydrology would be required to be continuous throughout the entirety of the wet season.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 52,518.

5 EPA and USACE state that they “intend to use the metrics from the Web-based Water-Budget Interactive Modeling Program (WebWIMP)” to identify “wet seasons,” but solicit comment on the most appropriate method to identify the “wet season.” Id. at 52,519.

6 Defined as “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.” Id. at 52,545.

7 Defined as “a body of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and banks, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow. A tributary does not include a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through a feature such as a channelized non-jurisdictional surface water feature, subterranean river, culvert, dam, tunnel, or similar artificial feature, or through a debris pile, boulder field, wetland, or similar natural feature, if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow. When the tributary is part of a water transfer (as that term is applied under 40 CFR 122.3) currently in operation, the tributary would retain jurisdictional status.” Id.

9 Defined as “[d]itches (including roadside ditches) that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.” Id. at 52,540.

10 Defined as “any area that, prior to December 23, 1985, was drained or otherwise manipulated for the purpose, or having the effect, of making production of an agricultural product possible. EPA and the Corps will recognize designations of prior converted cropland made by the Secretary of Agriculture. An area is no longer considered prior converted cropland for purposes of the Clean Water Act when the area is abandoned and has reverted to wetlands, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Abandonment occurs when prior converted cropland is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. For the purposes of the Clean Water Act, the EPA Administrator shall have the final authority to determine whether prior converted cropland has been abandoned.” Id. at 52,545.

11 Defined as “all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).” Id. at 52,546.

Reaffirms progress toward delivering £500 million in climate finance by 2026.

Investments will deliver an estimated 1.8+ GW of clean energy and avoid over 1.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution (DFI) announced it has committed £308 million in climate finance across South-East Asia during its current strategy period, advancing its ambition to invest up to £500 million by 2026.

BII’s investments are expected to deliver over 1.8 GW of clean energy capacity and avoid more than 1.6 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the region’s green transition.

South-East Asia is among one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, facing rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and significant threats to food and water security. The region is also heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with coal and natural gas still dominating its energy mix. To address these challenges, governments across the region have set ambitious decarbonisation targets including net-zero commitments by 2050, reflecting a strong policy push toward clean energy.

However, the region needs an estimated US$210 billion annually for green infrastructure to meet its climate goals. This is a gap that cannot be filled by public funding alone. As a committed partner to the region, BII is stepping in not only with capital but with a patient and flexible approach to de-risk projects, demonstrate their commercial viability, and encourage market participation.

Pictured left to right: Srini Nagarajan – Managing Director and Head of Asia, Leslie Maasdorp – CEO, Holger Rothenbusch – Managing Director, Head of Infrastructure and Climate

Leslie Maasdorp, BII CEO on his first visit to the region since joining the organisation said: “Our commitment in South-East Asia reflects our ambition to deliver climate finance where it matters most, supporting countries that are highly vulnerable to climate change and driving the transition to clean energy.

“By taking a patient and flexible approach to de-risk projects and demonstrate their viability, we’re helping accelerate the development of bankable projects that are essential for this transition. These investments not only reduce emissions but also create jobs, build resilience, and unlock private capital for sustainable growth.

BII is investing across the full capital spectrum in South-East Asia including through funds, equity, debt, and innovative platforms. Its first investment on re-entering the region was in the SUSI Asia Energy Transition

Fund (SAETF), which supports infrastructure projects across renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage, and has already built a pipeline of over 800 MW of solar and wind projects.

The DFI is also building platforms like Sustainable Asia Renewable Assets (SARA), a co-investment initiative with FMO and SUSI, designed to develop a 500 MW portfolio of greenfield renewable projects. SARA’s recent acquisition of a 39.4 MW wind project in Vietnam is expected to generate 110.9 GWh of clean energy annually and avoid more than 55,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

In equity, BII’s investment in Xurya is pioneering rooftop solar in Indonesia, targeting 600 MW by 2028 and creating over 6,000 green jobs. On the debt side, its first direct investment in Vietnam through VPBank will enable financing for climate-related projects and SMEs, further unlocking capital for sustainable growth.

In their final words, the Task Force argues that reparations are not a gift — they are a debt owed.","When voters overwhelmingly approved a reparations ballot initiative in 2021, they tasked the city with confronting deep-seated, long-standing injustices. In 2023, the Detroit Reparations Task Force — a 13-member body composed of Detroit residents and community leaders — began intensive work, gathering public input, reviewing decades of municipal decisions, and wrestling with the legacy of discriminatory policies.

Their final report, a 558-page report submitted at the end of October 2025, aims to do more than acknowledge past wrongs: it charts a comprehensive, city-wide plan for repairing harms inflicted on generations of Black Detroiters by systemic racism, neglect, and economic displacement.

At its core, the report makes a stark claim: the wealth and economic stability many enjoy today are directly tied to the exploitation of Black labor — from slavery to forced labor and discriminatory municipal practices. The report argues that municipal policies over decades not only favored downtown and corporate interests, but systematically eroded the foundations of Black communities.

According to the report, Detroit effectively split into “two cities”: one — largely downtown — thriving and investment-heavy; the other — neighborhoods home to Black Detroiters — neglected, under-resourced, and plundered.

With that diagnosis in hand, the Task Force delivers sweeping recommendations across housing, economic development, policing, water and utilities, education, environment, and culture — attempting to rewrite Detroit’s future with justice and equity at its center.

Who qualifies — and who might receive reparations

One of the first questions the report tries to answer is: who is eligible? The Task Force proposes three straightforward criteria for reparations eligibility:

Being a descendant of an African enslaved in the U.S. or the African diaspora.

At least 21 years old.

A current Detroit resident who has lived continuously in the city for at least 20 years.

These criteria are intended to focus reparations on those whose families experienced — or directly descended from — the generations of systemic disenfranchisement, redlining, displacement, environmental injustice, and economic neglect tied to municipal policy.

But the Task Force stresses that the recommended reparations aren’t limited to cash payments: many are structural — policies, programs, and investments designed to repair neighborhood wealth, infrastructure, community health, and quality of life.

What reparations could look like — The Recommendations

Below is a broad overview of the main recommendations, grouped by sector.

Housing & Land

The report calls for a dedicated “Reparations Administrative Office” to manage reparations programs. Among its tasks: distributing housing grants, overseeing housing policy reforms, and ensuring long-term accountability.

Under housing grants: up to US$40,000 per eligible recipient for down-payment assistance to buy a home in Detroit, or up to US$30,000 for home repairs.

Construction of at least 1,000 new affordable housing units for African American residents — priced for households earning ~50% of area median income (~US$35,350).

Implementation of rent control policies and conversion of vacant city-owned properties into shelters for unhoused residents.

Ending the practice of transferring city-owned land to the Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA), instead steering redevelopment programs to prioritize community residents.

Cancelling liens associated with delinquent water bills, and entirely eliminating sewage fees for eligible residents.

Refunding African American property owners who lost homes through tax foreclosure, using proceeds from auction sales.

For those previously over-assessed by the city, the report recommends freezing future property taxes.

These proposals seek to reverse generations of displacement, tax-foreclosure, overassessment, and the loss of generational wealth tied to homeownership — often a core path to intergenerational stability.

Economic Development & Business

The Task Force’s approach connects housing to broader economic renewal — offering support to families and local businesses alike:

Grants of up to $100,000 to businesses displaced by prior urban-renewal and development projects.

Creation of grants and low- or no-cost loans aimed at Black-owned co-ops, startups, small businesses, grocery stores, and community-based enterprises — to rebuild community wealth and ownership.

Plans to build ten new commercial strip malls that provide five years of rent-free space for eligible Black-owned businesses — with the hope that these spaces become hubs of neighborhood commerce and jobs.

Using tax increment financing (TIF) zones for these commercial areas, meaning tax revenues generated would get reinvested locally — supporting long-term economic sustainability.

Prioritizing Black-owned businesses in city contracts — a move toward equitable public contracting.

Providing free or subsidized post-secondary training for skilled trades, along with accessible online financial literacy courses — addressing both immediate economic mobility and long-term financial stability.

Through these measures, the Task Force envisions rebuilding a robust, community-rooted entrepreneurial base — one that provides jobs, builds generational wealth, and restores local control over commerce.

Policing, Justice & Public Safety

Acknowledging the long history of policing inequities, over-policing, dispossession, and distrust in Black communities, the Task Force makes bold calls for transformation:

Paying restitution to individuals (or their heirs) who were injured or killed by police — a move toward accountability and redress for past harms.

Ending “qualified immunity” for officers — opening the way for civil accountability for misconduct.

Terminating so-called “high-risk” officers (especially those who have a record of shootings, misconduct or who have shot unarmed citizens).

Hiring more Black officers and legal staff to reflect community demographics; institutionalizing more robust civilian oversight — including adding staffing to process community complaints, preserving body-camera footage in a permanent archive, and ensuring transparency.

Dissolving controversial policing initiatives like the command center monitoring schools, and ending the “One Detroit” anti-crime initiative (a partnership involving federal agencies) — which the Task Force argues function as layers of overlapping surveillance and militarized policing that disproportionately target Black communities.

Instead, investing in community-based violence intervention, mental-health co-response teams, and restorative justice programs — shifting focus toward prevention, support, and healing rather than punitive enforcement.

Through these policing reforms, the report seeks not just to curb abuse and violence — but to rebuild trust between the city, its institutions, and its Black residents.

Water, Sewerage & Utility Access

Utilities — often taken for granted — have been a flashpoint in Detroit’s history of inequality. The report spotlights how water shutoffs and unaffordable billing contributed to housing instability, unsanitary conditions, and displacement.

Key recommendations:

A moratorium on residential water shutoffs; ending the practice of turning unpaid water bills into liens on property.

Establishing an affordability program that limits water and sewer charges to no more than 3% of a household’s income.

Renegotiating the city’s existing lease with Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA), currently a $50 million annual lease, and restructuring the service agreement to reflect equitable cost distribution. The report cites that Detroit currently bears 83% of sewerage system costs, while suburban communities pay only 17%.

These reforms aim to remove systemic barriers to basic survival — ensuring access to utilities doesn’t become a tool for displacement or poverty.

Education & Youth Opportunities

The Task Force frames education as a critical pillar of reparations — one that can break cycles of disinvestment and restore opportunity to younger generations:

Establishing reparations-funded school grants to support: STEM fellowships, free high-speed internet access for students, athletic and mental-health programs, and other academic enrichment initiatives.

Repurposing shuttered or vacant school buildings for community use — to serve as centers for education, programming, or community services rather than letting them rot.

Lobbying the state legislature for additional funding to reduce class sizes, upgrade school infrastructure, hire more African American teachers, and integrate African-centered curricula.

By investing in education, the Task Force hopes to reverse the legacy of neglect and underfunding that has long plagued schools serving Detroit’s majority-Black student population.

Quality of Life, Health, Environment & Food Justice

Reparations, according to the report, must go beyond housing and money — to restore dignity, health, environment, food access, and long-term sustainability to neighborhoods that have borne the brunt of neglect and environmental racism.

Some of the flagship proposals:

Creating 100 acres of community-controlled agricultural land by 2035 — aiming to foster urban farming, local food production, and food sovereignty.

Establishing a “Food Sovereignty and Nutrition Equity Fund” — supporting Black-owned grocers, cooperatives, community kitchens, and food markets. Vacant city land could be repurposed into food distribution centers.

Designating “Environment Reparations Zones” in census tracts with high pollution, toxic air, or environmental hazards — enabling targeted environmental clean-up, monitoring, and remediation efforts.

For communities with high asthma rates or poor air quality, deploying in-home air filters, ongoing air quality monitoring, and establishing buffer zones between neighborhoods and industrial facilities. The Task Force aims to halve asthma-related emergency room visits within a decade.

These measures reflect an understanding that reparations are not just economic — they must restore health, environmental justice, access to food, stability, and community control over neighborhood destiny.

Arts, Culture & Legacy — Restoring Identity and Memory

To rebuild not only physical infrastructure but also cultural identity and heritage, the Task Force recommends the creation of a dedicated Office of African American Cultural Programs. This office would:

Fund historic preservation projects, galleries, studios, and community arts.

Lead efforts to rename public sites in honor of notable African American leaders — reclaiming public spaces and rewriting the city’s symbolic landscape.

Through cultural investments, the city can affirm the contributions, resilience, and identity of Black Detroiters — not as an afterthought, but as a central piece of reparative justice.

How the plan could be funded — and what’s next

The Task Force acknowledges that implementing such sweeping reforms will be expensive, and calls for creative — and city-anchored — funding mechanisms. Among the suggestions:

A downtown entertainment tax on events and venues.

An additional fee on casino revenues — redirecting profits from entertainment and tourism toward community reparations.

A new fee on city contracts, ensuring that city development and procurement contribute directly to reparative efforts.

Clawing back tax breaks or abatements from developers who fail to meet agreed-upon benchmarks — using those funds as reparations resources.

The core mechanism to oversee all this would be a proposed “Reparations Administrative Office,” run by an independent board of residents. Its responsibilities: distribute grants and benefits, coordinate programs, track outcomes, ensure accountability, and manage ongoing community input.

Importantly, the DRTF wrote the report — they do not have the power to implement it. That responsibility rests with the City Council, which must vote to adopt any portion of the plan. As of now, the report has been submitted. Some members may be asked to stay on, but the Task Force’s official term ended October 31, 2025.

Whether the City Council — or the next administration — acts remains open. As of November 2025, the incoming mayor’s team was reviewing the report.

Why it matters — beyond numbers and grants

What sets this report apart is its scope and ambition. Rather than offering narrow, piecemeal fixes, the Task Force is proposing a holistic blueprint — one that aims to reshape Detroit’s economic, social, and civic structure for decades to come.

For many Black Detroiters, these recommendations are not just about reparations — they are about reclaiming dignity, equity, and the possibility of generational stability. The housing grants and new affordable units address long-standing barriers to homeownership. Economic support for Black-owned businesses and co-ops could rebuild the local entrepreneurial class. Policing reforms could begin to restore trust in justice and safety. Water and utility reforms could eliminate a chronic cause of displacement and instability. Education and cultural investments could foster community pride, opportunity, and identity.

If implemented in full — or even partially — the plan could mark one of the most far-reaching municipal reparations efforts in U.S. history. And for a city like Detroit — one that has endured decades of disinvestment, deindustrialization, racialized policies, and population loss — the stakes are existential.

Yet, the report makes clear: this is not charity. It’s reckoning. It is not a favor — but a repayment. A restoration.

As the report states: for decades, the city surrendered its authority to corporate interests and external stakeholders — draining value from neighborhoods while letting downtown flourish. Now, the Task Force argues, it’s time to reverse course. To invest not just in buildings, but in Black Detroiters themselves.

What’s uncertain — what remains unsaid

While the recommendations are sweeping, there are some sharp questions — and important unknowns:

Cost: The report does not provide a firm estimate of how much all the proposals would cost. Funding ideas are outlined, but the real fiscal burden — and where that money would come from — remains uncertain.

Political viability: Implementation depends entirely on the will of the City Council, the mayor, and likely state-level cooperation — especially for reforms touching policing, school funding, and taxation.

Eligibility verification: While the eligibility criteria are defined, determining who qualifies — particularly tracing lineage to enslaved ancestors — could present legal, administrative, and evidentiary challenges.

Timing and scope: Even if adopted, realizing the full vision — building 1,000 homes, launching commercial centers, agricultural zones, environmental remediation zones — will take years, sustained investment, and vigilant oversight.

Community buy-in: Some residents (especially those without the specified ancestral lineage, or newer Detroiters) may object to or feel excluded by a reparations plan limited to descendants of enslaved Africans. The report does not deeply address how to navigate or reconcile such tensions.

The moral and symbolic weight — how Detroit frames reparations

At a deeper level, the 2025 DRTF report is as much about identity and memory as it is about infrastructure or grants. By explicitly tying Detroit’s contemporary inequalities — housing loss, environmental injustice, underfunded schools, policing abuse, economic displacement — to a legacy of slavery, segregation, redlining, and corporate-era neglect, the Task Force demands more than policy fixes.

This is a reckoning: a public admission that the city’s path forward cannot ignore the traumas and structural harms inflicted on Black residents. It is a demand that Detroit — as a municipal entity — accept responsibility. That it uses its power, resources, and governance to restore what was lost.

By combining financial reparations, community investment, structural reforms, and cultural recognition, the plan asserts that justice must be generational, systemic, and anchored in dignity.

In their final words, the Task Force argues that reparations are not a gift — they are a debt owed. It is not charity — it is restoration.

What happens now — and what’s at stake

With the report submitted to City Council at the end of October 2025, the next chapter begins — but its outcome remains uncertain. According to reports:

The incoming mayor’s team (at the time, reviewing the document) had not committed to adopting the recommendations.

The Task Force’s formal authority ended October 31, 2025 — meaning new leaders must decide whether to implement, modify, or discard the plan.

Community pressure, public input, and the political climate — including debates around funding, taxation, lineage, and equity — will shape what parts (if any) move forward.

What’s at stake is nothing less than the future of Detroit’s Black neighborhoods: whether they remain marginalized in favor of downtown development, or whether the city embraces a future where justice, equity, and community control are central.

If even a portion of the recommendations are acted upon — affordable housing, water access, small business support, school funding — it could mark a turning point for a city long defined by loss, disinvestment, and systemic neglect.

If ignored, it risks reaffirming that decades of harm — to neighborhoods, families, and generations — remain unacknowledged and unaddressed.",https://michiganchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Reparations.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:02:30.495136

In Canada, the fossil industry has dropped 38,000 jobs in the last five years, mostly in upstream oil and gas, even though production increased 35% for oil and 24% for natural gas over that period, the Centre for Future Work reported Monday.

“This long-term decline is set to continue for many reasons, not solely or mostly climate policy. New technologies, economic forces, resource depletion, and corporate outsourcing strategies are all eliminating fossil fuel jobs,” the Vancouver-based organization said in a release. The 95-page report concludes [pdf] that:

• The job transition out of fossil fuels is taking place in spite of any efforts in national climate policy, not because of them.

• The pace of the decline is consistent with a full phaseout of fossil fuels by 2050.

• Most of today’s fossil fuel workers will have reached normal retirement age by then.

• Interviews with workers showed that most of them expect to see the industry decline, but are reasonably confident the transition can be managed without mass displacement.

• Federal “just transition” efforts to date have been “long on aspiration and consultation, and short on implementation and effective guarantees.”

• Transition planning in Canada “is made even more nebulous by the fact that no general transition away from fossil fuel production and use is in fact occurring,” except for the 2030 federal mandate to phase out coal.

The research “confirms that an employment transition away from fossil fuel jobs is occurring, and occurring quickly,” said report co-author and centre director Jim Stanford. “Regardless of the twists and turns of climate policy debates, that decline will continue, driven by deeper economic and technological factors.”

But when it comes to just transition planning, “most policies emphasize consultation and dialogue, not binding agreements and entitlements,” the report states. “Instead of clear guarantees of employment and income for affected workers, workers are typically offered retraining subsidies and career counselling. In a labour market defined by chronic insecurity and fierce competition for decent work, this does not convince fossil fuel workers that their employment and incomes will be protected.”

Stanford added that a new oil pipeline megaproject, like the one envisioned in last month’s sweeping memorandum of understanding between Canada and Alberta, won’t reverse the trend. “Building a pipeline creates medium-term construction, he said—but no more than equivalent amounts spent on other energy investments” in renewable energy, transition, energy retrofits, or public transit.

On a global scale, many of those job categories are soaring, the International Energy Agency reported Friday, with the energy sector outpacing the global economy in 2024 for the third year in a row and increasing its work force to 76 million.

“Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2% rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy,” the Paris-based agency said in a release, with electricity surpassing fuel supply as the biggest industry employer for the first time.

The IEA reports that:

• Photovoltaic solar has been a “principal driver of demand, accounting for half of the job additions in the electricity sector since 2019.”

• Almost all the jobs in the power sector were in low-emitting power generation, grids, or storage, with only a small percentage in unabated fossil generation.

• Nuclear power, grids, and storage have provided 25% of the new power sector jobs.

• Offshore wind saw layoffs in turbine manufacturing and other “persistent challenge”, leading to a 6% job decline last year.

• Jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing grew by 800,000, with EVs and batteries now accounting for about 40% of automotive employment in China.

• Oil and gas has recovered most of the jobs it lost in the COVID-19 pandemic. But “it now appears that many firms are entering a new period of retrenchment in the face of lower oil prices and revenues, with a number of major oil companies announcing job cuts in 2025.”

• Coal jobs have increased in India, China, and Indonesia, growing 8% between 2019 and 2024.

Skilled worker shortages emerged as a key concern in the IEA’s annual Energy Employment Survey, with more than half of respondents reporting critical hiring bottlenecks and an aging work force compounding the problem.

“Most of the top energy occupations facing constraints within energy are considered applied technical roles, including electricians, pipefitters, electrical power line workers, and engineers, particularly in nuclear,” the IEA wrote. “Many of these broader categories are already in short supply across the wider economy.”

• Coal jobs have increased in India, China, and Indonesia, growing 8% between 2019 and 2024.

Skilled worker shortages emerged as a key concern in the IEA’s annual Energy Employment Survey, with more than half of respondents reporting critical hiring bottlenecks and an aging work force compounding the problem.

“Most of the top energy occupations facing constraints within energy are considered applied technical roles, including electricians, pipefitters, electrical power line workers, and engineers, particularly in nuclear,” the IEA wrote. “Many of these broader categories are already in short supply across the wider economy.”

The CEF report noted that since the start of 2023, China’s total overseas direct investment in clean technology has surpassed $180bn.
According to the report, South East Asia continues to be the primary destination for Chinese clean technology manufacturing investments.
At the same time, the Middle East and North Africa became the most rapidly growing region for Chinese clean technology investment, led by Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, following Trump’s election, the US Administration has reduced its climate and clean energy commitments, increasing support for fossil fuels.","China’s clean technology investment overseas has reached approximately $80bn over the past year, according to a report by Australian research group Climate Energy Finance (CEF).

According to the report, Chinese companies have been seeking new markets to address a surplus in supply, resulting in a significant increase in foreign direct investment in green technology since early 2023.

The CEF report noted that since the start of 2023, China’s total overseas direct investment in clean technology has surpassed $180bn.

This expansion has been partly driven by countries seeking to strengthen clean tech cooperation with China, particularly following tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.

Chinese companies have established a strong presence in supply chains for critical minerals processing, solar panels and batteries.

Chinese foreign investment in clean energy infrastructure is also facilitating the creation of new markets for these products.

CEF China engagement lead and report author Caroline Wang noted that this trend offers opportunities for emerging economies aiming to decrease their reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Wang said: “China’s got a supply glut when it comes to green technology like solar panels and batteries, because of a structural supply-demand mismatch, so they need overseas markets to absorb their products,” according to Reuters.

According to the report, South East Asia continues to be the primary destination for Chinese clean technology manufacturing investments.

While new solar manufacturing investments in the region have declined due to US tariffs, Chinese investment in electric vehicles, renewable power and batteries has increased.

At the same time, the Middle East and North Africa became the most rapidly growing region for Chinese clean technology investment, led by Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

Together, these countries secured approximately $7bn in announced funding. These projects highlight how Gulf and north African nations are pursuing economic diversification by developing sectors beyond oil.

The report found that Chinese companies are increasingly favouring large-scale projects that integrate both upstream and downstream supply chains.

Notable recent projects include an $8.27bn green hydrogen project in Nigeria announced by Longi Green Energy and a $6bn battery factory under construction by CATL in Indonesia.

The report noted that the October 2024–25 period marked the consolidation of China’s position as a “dominant global investor in clean-energy manufacturing and infrastructure”.

During this time, nearly $80bn in new projects were disclosed across 26 nations, primarily driven by private companies.

According to the report, Chinese companies view the trade war initiated by US President Trump in March 2025 as having increased uncertainty and have responded by prioritising “long-term risk mitigation through market diversification, with a focus on countries not hit by Trump’s tariffs that offer favourable investment environments”.

The Chinese Government has encouraged companies to collaborate with local companies in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) nations.

The report read: “The clean-tech economy represents a flourishing form of South-South cooperation, where national development goals meet China’s techno-industrial might.

“While the US sees China’s rise as a threat, many developing countries are inspired by its success and aim to emulate it.”

According to statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce “Going Global” Service Platform, Chinese enterprises made 215bn yuan in non-financial direct investment in BRI nations from January to September 2025, a 24.7% year-on-year increase.

Meanwhile, following Trump’s election, the US Administration has reduced its climate and clean energy commitments, increasing support for fossil fuels.

Most clean-energy production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have been suspended or reduced, and new renewable energy investment in the US fell by 36% in the first half of this year.

Many global companies, including First Solar and Enphase, have paused or relocated projects to South East Asia and the EU, the report noted.

The US President has committed to increasing oil and gas drilling, exiting the Paris Climate Agreement and reversing environmental policies established by previous administrations.

“Drill, baby, drill” was Trump’s campaign pledge, and the administration has proposed widening the production of fossil fuels.

The Trump administration has proposed opening federal waters near the coasts of Alaska, Florida and California for oil and gas drilling, including regions that have not previously been explored.

While other Western countries are taking steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the US is moving in the opposite direction.",https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/12/shutterstock_2498872563.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 10:00:05.314493

Batteries as large as shipping containers are being connected to power lines and installed beside solar panels and wind turbines. They soak up power when it's plentiful and cheap and release it when electricity use soars, helping reduce the need for expensive power plants and lines.

American researchers invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and later showed that the devices could help the electric grid. But for a long time, batteries made little headway because grid managers and utility executives dismissed them as expensive and risky.

Advt

One of the first breakthroughs came about 15 years ago when engineers at a U.S. energy company installed one of the first lithium-ion batteries tied to a grid in a desert nearly 9,000 feet above sea level in Chile. Challenging conventional notions of how the electricity system should be run, that team helped prove that batteries could help make electric grids more stable and reliable.

The concept of storing energy was not new. Thomas Edison developed alkaline nickel-iron batteries largely for industry and early electric vehicles. Various companies tried other technologies like sodium sulfur, which have not gained much traction. And some utilities have long pumped water uphill so that later it could be sent back down to generate electricity.

But those systems were relatively limited. The kinds of lithium batteries installed in the Atacama Desert in 2009, by comparison, are now being used around the world.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand.

Consider California. In recent years, state officials have often asked residents to use less electricity on hot summer days to prevent power outages. But there have been no such alerts since 2022, largely because batteries have allowed California to use its abundant solar power well into the evening. Over the last seven years, the state added 30 times as much battery storage capacity as it had in 2018.

Advt

The rest of the world has also seen impressive growth, according to the International Energy Agency, a multilateral organization in Paris. The boom was made possible by a stunning 90 per cent drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come online. China is by far the world's largest battery manufacturer, but Europe, India and the United States have recently been increasing production, too.

""Batteries are changing the game before our eyes,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said recently.

A bumpy start

The use of batteries on the grid did not come easy.

A Virginia company called AES began testing grid batteries in Indiana, Pennsylvania and California as early as 2008, but U.S. energy suppliers did not use them commercially until two years later. The pace was plodding for a while.

""There wasn't the experience with battery storage,"" said Carla Peterman, a former member of the California Energy Commission and now an executive vice president at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility. ""It was a bit of a chicken or the egg, where there wasn't enough on there to really say that this could be a big part of the energy system.""

But some Americans clearly saw the benefits of batteries. One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.

He began to look into lithium-ion batteries when his bosses asked employees to pitch proposals for a ""billion-dollar idea."" Shelton said he thought batteries could reduce the need for power plants that utilities used only when electricity demand climbed to peak levels.

""Why would you build an asset that you weren't going to use more than 5 per cent of the time?"" Shelton said. ""We were saying batteries should be an alternative to peaker plants.""

He first installed battery cells at a nondescript electricity substation outside Indianapolis, a city known for its 500-mile car race. His company later connected one in Norristown, Pennsylvania, at an operations center of the nation's largest grid manager, PJM Interconnection. The Los Angeles area was connected next, followed by a larger battery for the Indianapolis grid.

While his tests were successful, they did not sufficiently impress many American utility executives. The reaction was typical of an industry that prides itself for sticking with what it knows best: large coal, gas and nuclear power plants. Anything else has generally been treated as a threat that may cause blackouts.

""Utilities have long been skeptical of new technologies,"" said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy politics and policy. ""They know how to make a widget, which is a giant fossil fuel power plant, so they keep doing that.""

Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization, disagrees with that assessment. ""The U.S. energy grid is the world's most important machine, and America's electric companies are quick to pilot and deploy new technologies once they become commercially viable and affordable for customers,"" he said.

But even now, U.S. utilities in many states are reluctant to add batteries. A lot fewer large batteries are being added in the Southeast, for example, than in California and Texas.

Utility executives are not the only ones who are skeptical. So are policymakers and many ordinary Americans.

Some local governments have banned big batteries because of safety concerns. In May and June, a large battery complex in Monterey County, California, was destroyed in a fire that spewed smoke and harmful chemicals.

Despite that disaster, energy experts say many risks have been addressed. The California fire happened in a type of battery that most companies no longer use. And those batteries were installed in a power plant building where the fire easily spread from device to device. Most batteries are installed outdoors to reduce the chances that fires spread.

Testing it on the moon

Not much beside the odd desert fox lives on the desolate plateau in Chile where AES set up its battery project. The site is several hours from the two closest airports, in Calama and Antofagasta.

After landing, visitors have to drive at least four hours to the salt flats of the Atacama Desert, where workers collect lithium -- a key battery ingredient.

The AES camp is another hour away. It sits on a rocky, unpaved path, lined with busted tires. Although temperatures during a late spring and early summer day can reach the 80s, the nights can be near freezing.

""It was like taking the battery and testing it on the moon,"" said Joaquín Meléndez, an engineer who led the AES project there under Shelton.

In the early 2000s, Chile had an energy crisis because Argentina, its main supplier of natural gas, couldn't provide enough of it. That left Chile, which has no domestic fuel sources, with too little energy for its people and its copper, iodine and lithium mines.

Chile was forced to rely on power plants that burned expensive imported coal. But those plants could not be easily turned up or down, and the needs of Chile's mining companies fluctuated a lot.

That was where the batteries came in. While it can take a coal plant about 12 minutes to get going, batteries can discharge power almost instantly. By pairing the two, engineers realized that batteries could deliver the electricity that mines needed while coal plants fired up.

Meléndez worked 16-hour days for six months to connect the first commercialized lithium battery to an electric grid. That device still stands, though most of its tasks have been taken over by newer, more efficient and affordable units.

The project was immediately successful, helping keep the electricity system stable when mining operations caused surges that had previously led to grid failures and outages.

AES executives back in the United States kept close track of what was happening in Chile. And in 2010, the company installed commercial battery systems in New York and Texas. Two years later, AES began adding more batteries in Chile, including next to big solar farms.

Over the last decade, batteries have helped Chile use less coal. Last December, the country got more than 40 per cent of its electricity from solar panels and wind turbines, up from 19 per cent five years earlier, according to Ember Energy Research, a nonprofit. Australia, Britain, China, India and other countries have also been adding lots of renewable energy and batteries.

Shelton said that even he had been surprised by the recent rapid growth of batteries. ""We underpredicted how far the prices would fall.""

The report added that federal actions to impede utility-scale solar and storage projects have created significant business uncertainty, with forecasts for deployment through 2030 remaining largely unchanged.

SEIA president and chief executive Abigail Ross Hopper said: “This record-setting quarter for solar deployment shows that the market is continuing to turn to solar to meet rising demand.”

She added that unless the administration reverses course, the future of clean, affordable and reliable solar and storage will be “frozen by uncertainty”.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken calls for a new approach to jointly tackle the most pressing environmental issues including climate change and biodiversity loss that threaten over 1 million plant and animal species with extinction.

The U.N. Environment Assembly — which the U.S. government didn’t attend — produced the new report this week by almost 300 scientists from 83 countries.

The issues, which also include land degradation and pollution, are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme’s Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. “You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.”

They’re “all undermining our economy,” worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven’t made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What’s more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn’t involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded, and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn’t measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren’t the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.”

International cooperation falters

Despite the report’s urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He’s promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn’t attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and “said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she’s confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

Even when Western miners produced rare earth concentrate, they still depended on China for metal-making and heavy rare earth preparation.

USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ: USAR) USA Rare Earth, Inc. is executing a strategy centered on the revitalization of the American magnet manufacturing sector, anchored by its new facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma.
To support this manufacturing capacity, USA Rare Earth is developing the Round Top Heavy Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Project in West Texas.","REAlloys, which is in the process of merging with Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX), has moved to the front of the rare earth sector with a new agreement that gives it control over the lion’s share of North America’s upcoming heavy rare earth production.

Its partnership with the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) brings commercial volumes of dysprosium, terbium, and high-purity NdPr into the region for the first time, directly targeting the largest bottleneck in Western magnet manufacturing.

Reuters described the transaction as a “rare earths tie-up with strategic implications for the North American supply chain” because policymakers have their eyes glued to this space in light of 2027 procurement rules.

As new U.S. sourcing laws tighten, REAlloys now holds the supply position that downstream defense and advanced-manufacturing buyers will depend on, the Globe & Mail heralding the SRC facility as “North America’s first vertically integrated rare-earth processing complex–capable of separation and smelting at commercial scale”.

This is the segment of the supply chain the United States has been trying to rebuild for nearly two decades.

Heavy rare earths are the performance elements. They dictate whether a magnet can withstand heat, acceleration, and EMI without losing stability. These are all capabilities that extend far beyond defense. They are central to electric-vehicle motors, high-efficiency industrial equipment, medical imaging, renewable-energy generation, satellites, aerospace controls, and precision manufacturing. In short, they sit at the core of technologies that underpin both modern economies and military readiness.

And until now, North America has had no commercial-scale ability to refine them.

A Midstream Capability the Region Has Never Had

SRC’s facility in Saskatoon is North America’s first rare-earth complex designed to integrate monazite processing, separation, and metal production at a commercial scale. That’s a capability the region has lacked for decades.

The new agreement with REAlloys accelerates that evolution by adding a full heavy rare earth line, transforming the site from an advanced separation plant into the continent’s only integrated source of dysprosium, terbium, and high-purity NdPr metals.

Under the partnership, REAlloys will invest approximately $21 million to expand SRC’s refining capacity, increasing heavy rare earth throughput by roughly 300% and boosting NdPr metal output by about 50%.

When the upgraded system enters production in early 2027, SRC expects to deliver 30 tonnes of dysprosium oxide, 15 tonnes of terbium oxide, and 400-600 tonnes of high-purity NdPr metal annually.

REAlloys has secured 80% of this expanded output under a long-term offtake arrangement, a position that gives the company the dominant share of the first commercial heavy rare earth production run in North America.

According to the announcement, the redesigned system will also include “AI-driven separation and smelting infrastructure,” enabling SRC to move directly into metal production rather than stopping at oxide, a step most Western facilities historically have been unable to achieve.

This changes where REAlloys sits in the market. It is no longer a magnet manufacturer with upstream ambitions. Instead, it’s the principal customer of the only heavy rare earth refining platform in the region, and one of the few companies globally positioned to supply high-performance magnet metals into compliant supply chains.

The timing is highly strategic.

Beginning January 1, 2027, the U.S. Department of Defense will be barred from sourcing rare earth metals, magnets, and components from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea. Federal buyers will shift procurement to domestic or allied suppliers. And for heavy rare earth metals, SRC’s upgraded facility–with REAlloys as its primary offtake partner–will be the only operation ready to meet that requirement at commercial scale.

Integrating the Chain From Source to Magnet

This agreement fits into a larger structure REAlloys has been putting in place across the rare-earth chain.

At the upstream level, the company anchors its plans in Hoidas Lake in Saskatchewan, a deposit with roughly 2.15 million tonnes of measured and indicated TREO and one of Canada’s most significant rare-earth resources. It gives REAlloys a defined long-term feedstock, supported by additional allied and recycled material sources that broaden the supply base.

The midstream is defined by the Saskatchewan Research Council’s separation and metal-making operation, now being expanded with AI-driven separation and smelting systems to create North America’s first commercial-scale heavy rare earth production line. Under the new agreement, REAlloys becomes the primary offtake partner for this upgraded capacity, securing 80% of the heavy rare earth output and effectively linking its upstream resource base to a domestic refining platform capable of producing dysprosium, terbium, and high-purity NdPr metals at meaningful scale.

Downstream, the Euclid Magnet Facility in Ohio forms the final step in the chain. Established in 2013 to serve U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Energy customers, the facility produces advanced alloys and magnet materials, holds SBIR status that permits sole-source federal procurement, and has earned multiple R&D 100 awards and associated materials-science distinctions. Together, these assets give REAlloys something Western operators have struggled to assemble: a vertically aligned system that spans ore, metals, alloys, and magnets inside a single continental corridor.

Adding to this structure is a clear signal from Washington.

The U.S. Export-Import Bank issued a $200 million Letter of Interest in support of REAlloys’ integrated mine-to-magnet strategy, underscoring federal recognition of the need for a domestic magnet industry as procurement rules tighten.

Piece by piece, the company has begun to build the architecture of a supply chain that has been missing from North America for decades and is now central to reindustrialization efforts on both sides of the border.

A Shift in Market Dynamics

Demand for high-performance magnets continues to accelerate across defense, electric mobility, automation, satellites, and clean energy. Still, the bottleneck has always been the same. Even when Western miners produced rare earth concentrate, they still depended on China for metal-making and heavy rare earth preparation.

That pressure point is now tightening under new procurement rules. Beginning January 1, 2027, the U.S. Department of Defense will be barred from sourcing rare earth metals, magnets, and components from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

This shift forces federal buyers to transition toward domestic or allied supply. Most manufacturers are not ready for that deadline.

REAlloys, through its partnership with SRC, is now one of the only groups positioned to supply dysprosium, terbium, and NdPr metals at the volumes required by the U.S. and Canadian industrial base.

Heavy rare earths remain the least substitutable inputs in magnet production. They determine stability under heat, acceleration, magnetic load, and environmental stress–all the things that define missile guidance accuracy, aircraft efficiency, EV motor durability, satellite maneuvering, and industrial automation reliability. For nearly 15 years, every Western supply chain assessment has identified heavy rare earths as the system’s most acute vulnerability.

With this agreement, that vulnerability lessens. REAlloys and SRC are establishing the first commercially scaled heavy rare earth production line in North America, and for the first time, a significant portion of that output is contracted directly to a domestic magnet producer.

Execution Will Define the Next Step

North America’s rare earth problem has never been about geology. It has always been the absence of a functioning midstream, the refining and metal-making steps that turn mined material into usable inputs. This gap has forced the United States and Canada to depend on offshore supply even when domestic or allied resources were available.

Heavy rare earths have been the hardest of all to source, leaving defense, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing exposed to single-country dependence for the materials that determine thermal stability, precision, and performance.

SRC’s expansion arrives as North America finally confronts the part of the rare earth chain it never built: the part rare earths are converted into usable critical materials. Beginning in 2027, U.S. defense buyers must shift away from Chinese supply, but the region has had no commercial-scale source of dysprosium, terbium, or NdPr metals, prompting Reuters to note that the SRC upgrade is the first step toward filling that gap.

The REAlloys agreement doesn’t close the loop, but it does create the first steady flow of heavy rare earth metals inside the U.S.-Canada system. For defense, auto manufacturing, and advanced industrial applications, it marks a shift from theoretical supply to material that can be contracted, scheduled, and built into production plans.

What happens next depends on execution. If SRC delivers its upgraded capacity on schedule and if downstream buyers adapt to the new procurement landscape, 2027 could mark the first time North America has had a functional heavy rare earth channel of its own. It would not eliminate vulnerability, but it would begin to narrow the exposure that has shaped every rare earth strategy discussion since the early 2000s.

Other companies to watch in the resources sector:

Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE)

Vale S.A. continues to aggressively decouple its base metals operations from its traditional iron ore business to capture higher valuations in the green energy market. The Brazilian mining giant has formally structured Vale Base Metals as a distinct entity tasked with managing its vast nickel and copper assets in Canada, Brazil and Indonesia. This strategic separation allows the unit to operate with the agility of a growth-focused company while leveraging the massive capital resources of its parent.

Vale is currently executing a $25 billion to $30 billion capital investment program aimed at increasing its copper production to 900,000 metric tons per year and its nickel output to 300,000 metric tons per year by 2030. The company’s operations in Sudbury, Ontario, and Voisey’s Bay in Labrador remain the linchpins of this strategy, providing low-carbon nickel rounds and pellets that Western automakers prioritize for their compliance with inflation-reduction incentives and ESG mandates.

Beyond simple extraction, Vale has deepened its downstream integration to secure its role as a direct supplier to the battery supply chain. The company is advancing joint ventures in Indonesia to process laterite nickel ore using high-pressure acid leaching technology, a method essential for producing the mixed hydroxide precipitate required for battery cathodes. Simultaneously, Vale has solidified long-term supply agreements with major automotive partners, including General Motors and Tesla, ensuring that a significant percentage of its high-grade Class 1 nickel is allocated directly to North American and European electric vehicle production.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU)

Energy Fuels Inc. has successfully transitioned from a pure-play uranium miner into a diversified critical minerals processor, leveraging its White Mesa Mill in Utah to bridge a critical gap in the U.S. supply chain. As of late 2025, the company is processing commercial volumes of monazite sands—a radioactive byproduct of heavy mineral sand operations—to recover both uranium and rare earth elements.

The White Mesa Mill is the only facility in the United States with the existing licenses and tailings capacity to handle the radionuclides associated with monazite, giving Energy Fuels a distinct regulatory advantage. The company has moved beyond producing a mixed rare earth carbonate and is now operating Phase 1 separation circuits to produce commercial quantities of separated neodymium and praseodymium oxides. This operational shift effectively bypasses the historical necessity of shipping American feedstocks to China for separation, creating a nascent but vital domestic pathway for magnet materials.

To secure sufficient feedstock for this expansion, Energy Fuels has aggressively acquired heavy mineral sand projects in the Southern Hemisphere, including the acquisition of Base Resources and its Toliara Project in Madagascar, as well as the Bahia Project in Brazil. These acquisitions provide the company with a vertically integrated supply of monazite, insulating it from spot market volatility. The company is utilizing its ""crack and leach"" capacity to extract the rare earths while simultaneously recovering uranium for the nuclear fuel market, creating a dual-revenue model that lowers the effective cost of production for both commodities.

MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP)

MP Materials Corp. has completed its multi-year strategy to restore the full rare earth magnet supply chain to the United States. While the company continues to maximize output at its Mountain Pass mine in California, its strategic focus has shifted heavily toward midstream and downstream manufacturing.

In 2025, MP Materials ramped up commercial production at its magnet manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas. This facility is now actively producing finished neodymium-iron-boron magnets, sourcing the metal alloy directly from the company’s own separated oxides. This vertical integration allows MP Materials to control every step of the process, from the open pit in California to the finished component in Texas, effectively insulating its customers from the geopolitical risks associated with the Chinese supply chain. The Fort Worth plant is designed to produce approximately 1,000 tonnes of finished magnets annually in its initial phase, with plans to scale significantly to meet demand from General Motors and other automotive partners.

MP Materials has secured substantial backing from the Department of Defense to refine heavy rare earths as well, acknowledging that a complete magnet supply chain requires dysprosium and terbium. The company is currently fulfilling a contract to supply rare earth materials to the Pentagon, underscoring the dual-use nature of its products. By successfully closing the loop between mining and manufacturing, MP Materials has established itself not just as a mining firm, but as the foundational industrial anchor for the American electrification and defense sectors.

Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML)

Critical Metals Corp. is advancing its ""trans-Atlantic"" strategy to supply strategic materials to Western markets through its flagship assets in Austria and Greenland. The company’s Wolfsberg Lithium Project in Carinthia, Austria, has moved through the definitive feasibility stage and is positioning itself as the first fully permitted lithium mine in Europe.

Located roughly 170 miles from major battery manufacturing hubs, Wolfsberg offers a logistical advantage that reduces transportation emissions and aligns with the European Union’s Critical Raw Materials Act. The project is designed as an underground mine to minimize surface disruption, a key factor in securing local community support and regulatory approval in an environmentally sensitive region. Critical Metals has signed binding offtake agreements with top-tier partners like BMW, ensuring that the lithium hydroxide produced at Wolfsberg has a guaranteed route to market as soon as commercial production begins.

In parallel, the company is developing the Tanbreez Rare Earth Project in Greenland, which hosts one of the largest known deposits of heavy rare earth elements and zirconium in the world. The Tanbreez asset differs from many competitors because its mineralization is hosted in kakortokite rather than carbonatite, which allows for different processing metrics and a potentially lower acid consumption profile.

USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ: USAR)

USA Rare Earth, Inc. is executing a strategy centered on the revitalization of the American magnet manufacturing sector, anchored by its new facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Unlike peers that focus primarily on extraction, USA Rare Earth prioritizes the downstream production of sintered neo magnets, the highest-performance category of permanent magnets used in electric vehicle traction motors and defense systems.

The Stillwater plant has commenced initial qualification runs, utilizing equipment and intellectual property acquired from former Hitachi Metals facilities in North Carolina. This approach has allowed the company to leapfrog the typical research and development timeline, deploying proven commercial-scale technology to meet immediate demand. The company aims to scale production to meet a substantial portion of the U.S. defense industry's annual requirement, reducing the Pentagon's exposure to foreign supply shocks.

To support this manufacturing capacity, USA Rare Earth is developing the Round Top Heavy Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Project in West Texas. Round Top is a unique geological deposit containing a wide suite of magnetic rare earths alongside lithium, beryllium and gallium. The company is piloting a continuous ion exchange processing method to efficiently separate these materials from the rhyolite host rock. While the mine development continues, the company has secured intermediate feedstock supplies to ensure the Oklahoma plant can operate independently of the mine’s timeline.

Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (OTC: LYSDY)

Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. remains the most significant producer of separated rare earth materials outside the People’s Republic of China, providing the global market with a proven non-Chinese supply of NdPr oxide. The Australian firm has substantially reconfigured its industrial footprint to mitigate regulatory risks and expand capacity.

The company’s new cracking and leaching facility in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, is now fully operational. This plant processes the lanthanide concentrate from the Mt Weld mine locally, removing radioactive waste material before shipping a mixed rare earth carbonate to Malaysia for final separation. This operational change was necessitated by tightened environmental regulations in Malaysia but has ultimately strengthened the company’s supply chain by retaining the most hazardous waste handling within the mining jurisdiction of Australia.

Simultaneously, Lynas is constructing a heavy rare earth separation facility in Seadrift, Texas, a project partially funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. This facility is designed to process heavy rare earth feedstock to produce separated dysprosium and terbium, materials that are currently sourced almost exclusively from China.

General Motors Company (NYSE: GM)

General Motors Company has fundamentally altered its procurement strategy to become an active participant in the mining sector, recognizing that raw material availability is the primary bottleneck for its ""Ultium"" electric vehicle platform. The automaker is investing directly in resource development to secure the lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese required for its battery cells. GM’s $650 million equity investment in Lithium Americas Corp. has facilitated the development of the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the largest known lithium source in the United States. This deal grants GM exclusive access to the Phase 1 production from Thacker Pass, ensuring a domestic supply of lithium carbonate that enables its vehicles to qualify for full consumer tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Beyond lithium, GM has forged a web of direct supply agreements for other battery metals, bypassing traditional intermediaries. The company has multi-year contracts with Glencore for cobalt and with Vale for low-carbon nickel sulfate from Canada. GM is also constructing a localized cathode active material supply chain through a joint venture with POSCO Chemical in Quebec, which will process materials sourced from GM’s mining partners. The automaker is heavily investing in a closed-loop battery recycling ecosystem through its collaboration with Li-Cycle, aiming to recover up to 95 percent of the critical minerals from end-of-life batteries and manufacturing scrap.

Southern Copper Corporation (NYSE: SCCO)

Southern Copper Corporation is leveraging its position as the holder of the world’s largest copper reserves to meet the structural supply deficit projected for the late 2020s. The company operates open-pit mines in Peru and Mexico that are among the lowest-cost producers in the industry, allowing it to generate robust cash flows even during periods of price volatility.

A major development for the company is the advancement of the Tía María project in the Arequipa region of Peru. After more than a decade of social and political delays, the company has commenced construction on the $1.4 billion greenfield mine. Tía María is expected to produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes annually using solvent extraction and electrowinning technology, which eliminates the need for a smelter and reduces the environmental footprint. The successful activation of this project signals a significant improvement in the company’s ability to navigate complex community relations in Peru.

In Mexico, Southern Copper is investing heavily to expand its Buenavista Zinc and Pilares projects, aiming to increase its total production capacity to over 1.2 million tons of copper per year. The company is also advancing the massive Michiquillay project in Cajamarca, Peru, a world-class deposit that is currently in the exploration and social baseline study phase. Southern Copper’s strategy focuses on organic growth through the development of its own extensive concession portfolio rather than through expensive acquisitions.

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (NASDAQ: PLL)

Piedmont Lithium Inc. is establishing itself as a multi-jurisdictional supplier of lithium hydroxide, balancing near-term revenue generation with long-term domestic development. The company’s Carolina Lithium project in Gaston County, North Carolina, has received its state mining permit, a crucial regulatory victory that clears the path for construction. This fully integrated project is designed to mine spodumene ore and convert it into battery-grade lithium hydroxide on the same site, minimizing logistics costs and carbon emissions.

However, recognizing the time required to build such a facility, Piedmont has executed a strategy to secure lithium units earlier through international partnerships. The company holds a supply agreement and equity interest in Sayona Mining’s Quebec operations, where production is already underway at the North American Lithium complex. This partnership allows Piedmont to sell commercial shipments of spodumene concentrate to the global market while its U.S. assets are developed.

Piedmont is also advancing the Ewoyaa Lithium Project in Ghana in partnership with Atlantic Lithium. The company is funding the development of this asset in exchange for a 50 percent interest in the project’s production. The Ewoyaa material is intended to serve as a primary feedstock for Piedmont’s proposed conversion facility in Tennessee, known as Tennessee Lithium. This merchant plant aims to process foreign concentrate into domestic lithium hydroxide, further expanding the U.S. refining base.

Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (NYSE: NMG)

Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. is nearing the completion of its ""ore-to-anode"" business model, aimed at providing a carbon-neutral alternative to Chinese synthetic and natural graphite. The company is constructing the Matawinie Mine in Saint-Michel-des-Saints, Quebec, which is notable for being the world’s first open-pit mine designed to operate with an all-electric fleet of mining equipment. This electrification strategy allows the company to produce graphite concentrate with a significantly lower carbon footprint than competitors. The extracted material will be transported to the company’s advanced manufacturing plant in Bécancour, Quebec, a dedicated battery materials industrial park. Here, the concentrate will be shaped and purified to produce the coated spherical graphite required for lithium-ion battery anodes.

The company has solidified its commercial viability through multi-year offtake agreements with anchor customers General Motors and Panasonic Energy. These contracts cover the vast majority of the company’s projected Phase 1 production, providing the revenue certainty needed to secure project financing. Nouveau Monde has also attracted strategic capital investments from Mitsui & Co. and Pallinghurst Resources, partners that bring both financial strength and logistical expertise.

Perpetua Resources Corp. (NASDAQ: PPTA)

Perpetua Resources Corp. has achieved a historic regulatory milestone for its Stibnite Gold Project in central Idaho, securing a Final Record of Decision from the U.S. Forest Service. This approval authorizes the company to proceed with the restoration and redevelopment of the brownfield site, which was abandoned by previous operators decades ago. The project is unique in that it contains one of the largest economic reserves of antimony not controlled by China.

Antimony is a federally designated critical mineral essential for the production of munitions, specifically as a hardening agent for lead in bullets and in the primers of small-caliber ammunition. It is also increasingly vital for large-scale liquid metal batteries used in grid energy storage.

Recognizing the national security implications of the project, the U.S. Department of Defense has awarded Perpetua Resources nearly $75 million in funding through the Defense Production Act and other initiatives to accelerate the project's development. This government backing effectively de-risks the permitting and construction timeline, validating the project's strategic necessity.

Perpetua’s plan involves reprocessing historical tailings to recover gold and antimony while simultaneously repairing the environmental damage left by World War II-era mining, including the restoration of fish passage for native salmon populations.

For the global community of hydropower engineers, the plan contains a clear signal: long-duration electricity storage (LDES), including pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), will be indispensable to meeting the country’s clean-power ambitions.
It also sets the stage for more than 10,000 jobs linked to clean-energy industries and support for over 1,000 community energy projects, expanding public participation in the energy transition.
By investing in clean power, supporting local projects, and unlocking British industry, Great British Energy will help deliver an energy system that works for everyone.” Energy Secretary Ed Miliband added: “We set up Great British Energy to be a national champion that allows us to reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources.

For the global community of hydropower engineers, the plan contains a clear signal: long-duration electricity storage (LDES), including pumped hydro energy storage (PHES), will be indispensable to meeting the country’s clean-power ambitions.

The plan details how GBE will deliver at least 15GW of clean generation and storage by 2030, mobilise £15 billion of private finance, and build an income-generating portfolio whose returns will be reinvested into new capacity. It also sets the stage for more than 10,000 jobs linked to clean-energy industries and support for over 1,000 community energy projects, expanding public participation in the energy transition.

Speaking on publication of the strategy, GBE CEO Dan McGrail said: “We are proud to be putting public ownership to work, unlocking investment, powering communities, creating jobs, and building an energy system that delivers for the UK.

“This Strategic Plan marks a major milestone in our mission to accelerate clean energy and the industries that support it.”

GBE Chair Juergen Maier emphasised the stakes for public benefit, saying: “This plan puts the UK public at the heart of our energy future. By investing in clean power, supporting local projects, and unlocking British industry, Great British Energy will help deliver an energy system that works for everyone.”

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband added: “We set up Great British Energy to be a national champion that allows us to reap the benefits of Britain’s natural resources.

“This plan shows what a publicly-owned energy company will deliver: an abundance of clean, homegrown energy for British people and thousands of good jobs across the country.”

Behind these political statements lies a technical message that will resonate strongly with engineers: the UK cannot reach its clean-power goals without a massive scale-up of long-duration storage. According to the Strategic Plan, system-operator modelling shows Britain will need 7–10GW of LDES by 2035, compared to around 2.7GW today, capacity largely provided by existing pumped storage schemes. Demand for short-duration batteries is also expected to triple, but the plan makes clear that only LDES can provide the multi-hour to multi-day flexibility required to manage periods of low wind and low solar generation.

GBE notes that while the UK’s new LDES “cap and floor” mechanism is designed to unlock projects such as new PHES, it will not alone overcome the high upfront capital costs, long construction times, and revenue uncertainty that have slowed progress. To address this, the company signals it will take a direct role as developer and equity investor, absorbing early-stage risk, anchoring project finance, and helping projects reach bankability. GBE frames this as a “public ownership with purpose” model, using public capital to crowd in private investment while retaining long-term value for consumers.

The plan also underscores the relationship between storage and the UK’s projected surge in renewable generation. Without intervention, onshore solar and wind could fall 6–15GW short of the levels required by 2035, and offshore wind – expected to reach as much as 86GW by the same year – could face a shortfall of up to 38GW. Deep-water and floating offshore wind, in particular, are expected to increase the system’s reliance on multi-day storage, heightening the importance of pumped hydro and other LDES technologies.

To support this build-out, GBE is also launching a £1 billion “Energy – Engineered in the UK” programme to strengthen domestic supply chains, including engineering capability relevant to pumped storage civil works, grid infrastructure, and major mechanical systems. The scheme is expected to help deliver the country’s industrial strategy while creating thousands of skilled jobs in regions transitioning from oil and gas.

Although the plan spans only the first five years of operation, GBE makes clear that long-duration storage will remain central as the UK’s electricity demand grows and renewables become its dominant power source.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-09-at-12.47.15.png,N,,2025-12-09 12:01:46.515973

- Solar Installations Peak (for Now) –

LONDON and NEW YORK and SINGAPORE, Dec. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global Energy today released its Top Trends report identifying the pivotal developments shaping clean energy technology, sustainability and growth in global energy markets in 2026. The report was produced by analysts of its Horizons team, which provides comprehensive energy expansion and sustainability intelligence, from big picture trends to asset level insights.

""In 2026, AI's surging power demand growth will be testing grid limits, revenue models and sustainability goals,"" said Eduard Sala de Vedruna, Vice President and Head of Research, Horizons, S&P Global Energy. ""The pace of progress will depend on unlocking new capacity and flexibility, with grid modernization a key constraint on energy security and competitiveness.""

S&P Global Energy Horizons Top Trends for 2026—tackling themes from AI's rapid growth, geopolitical realignments, and mounting climate risks—highlight how energy expansion and sustainability are necessarily interlinked.

""The interplay of AI-driven demand, grid bottlenecks, evolving procurement strategies, and rising climate risks highlights how energy expansion and sustainability are not parallel ambitions, but intertwined imperatives,"" said Leanne Todd, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Horizons, S&P Global Energy.

TOP TRENDS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT:

As AI uptake soars in 2026, energy supply and sustainability commitments face a breaking point. S&P Global Energy Horizon's high growth view shows global datacenter power demand increasing 17% to 2026 and 14% per year through 2030, reaching potential demand of over 2,200 TWh, equivalent to India's current electricity use. This surge is testing grid limits and sustainability goals, with 38% of assessed companies with datacenter operations lacking net-zero commitments. Major tech firms including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta are exploring new options to reconcile their power needs without compromising on their climate targets as aggregate US datacenter capital spending approaches $500 billion in 2026.

Solar growth peaks (for now): first annual slowdown in renewables additions in 2026. China's annual additions will fall from roughly 300 GW in 2025 to about 200 GW in 2026, triggered by a major policy shift from guaranteed pricing to competitive bidding. With China accounting for 50% of global additions over the past decade, this slowdown will have a deep impact. For the first time ever, new global solar installations are expected to decline year-on-year, albeit by less than 10%, as emerging markets take up some of the slack Despite this contraction, cumulative PV capacity is still expected to double over the next five years, supported by emerging markets and continued innovation, including faster deployment of battery energy storage.

Grid modernization becomes a key energy security, transition and competitiveness constraint. Decades of underinvestment have created a critical bottleneck as the world races to electrify and decarbonize. With 40% of EU grids over 40 years old, the European Commission estimates €584 billion in grid capital expenditure is needed by 2030 to support decarbonization. The US faces potential limitations on the ability to deliver needed power without investment to support explosive AI-driven datacenter growth, making grid modernization a national competitiveness issue.

Flexible Power Purchase Agreements become the new standard as price volatility reshapes how risks are managed. Increasing renewable capacity is leading to more zero- and negatively priced settlements, driving the evolution from traditional PPAs to complex hybrid structures that integrate multiple technologies and storage. The market is moving toward shorter contract terms and stronger downside protections as extreme price swings become more visible, particularly in Europe where PPA indices remain well below cost-based levels. Datacenters account for 27 gigawatts (GW), or 43% of total corporate power procurement in 2025 through October, continuing as a leading sector for clean energy procurement.

As the rest of the world slows down to consider, China gets serious about green hydrogen. Chinese projects will install about 1.5 GW of electrolyzers in 2025, nearly doubling the 1.7 GW installed globally at end-2024, with deployment projected to reach 4.5 GW in 2026. Electrolyzer stack prices have plunged from $250 per kilowatt (/kW) in early 2024 to under $100/kW due to oversupply and fierce competition. Unlike solar and batteries, Chinese firms aim to export energy as well as technology, with at least two Chinese green ammonia plants receiving EU certification for clean molecule exports, with indications of prices as low as $600 per metric ton on a free-on-board basis (FOB).

Global SAF capacity expands by one third in 2026—Asia leads, Europe pays. Global dedicated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity is expected to rise by about one third to eight million metric tons (MMt), though the speed of growth slows compared to the near doubling seen annually from 2022 to 2025. More than half of global SAF capacity will be concentrated in Asia despite modest regional demand, as producers target a European market facing supply shortfalls. Beyond 2026, capacity could increase eightfold to 42 MMt by 2030 if announced projects materialize, though only 7.3 MMt have reached final investment decision.

EV uptake continues as China has shown that EVs can be price-competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. China appears on track to become the first major ""EV majority"" market globally, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) representing about 50% of new light vehicle sales in the first three quarters of 2025. Europe shows renewed growth due to stricter CO2 standards, while the US faces its first test of organic consumer demand without tailwinds of federal EV tax credits in 2026. Emerging markets including Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Nigeria and Malaysia are identified as relatively ripe for Chinese EV adoption.

Global trade and climate policy is increasingly focused on harmonizing emissions reporting. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) takes effect January 1st, 2026, requiring accountability for carbon intensity of imported goods, while major revisions are proposed for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. Potential proliferation of carbon border adjustment mechanisms requires companies to report different emissions to different regulators, complicating global trade. The harmonization of product-level carbon accounting is increasingly seen as prerequisite for markets to differentiate products based on carbon intensity.

China leverages global clean energy leadership and further expands influence. China has consolidated its leadership in clean energy deployment, technologies and supply chains. With overall cleantech spending growing 30% over the next five years while upstream spending is expected to remain constant, new global energy investment is shifting eastward. Meanwhile, the US is adopting a more interventionist industrial strategy, featuring greater government involvement through equity stakes and targeted support for technologies like nuclear and advanced geothermal. Diplomatically, China continues active climate participation while the US challenges multilateral efforts, creating additional space for China to expand global influence.

As emissions could drive a 2.3°C rise by 2040, adaptation shifts from optional to essential in 2026. Extreme weather and climate hazards are creating escalating risks for infrastructure, physical assets, and operations. S&P Global Energy Horizons projects annual climate-related costs of ~$885 billion for large publicly traded companies in the 2030s. Climate risk assessments and adaptation planning show patchy uptake across sectors, with an evident adaptation gap even in industries where risk assessment is more common. The increasingly urgent question is no longer whether companies will adapt, but how quickly.

In twenty countries worldwide, renewable energy is now providing 20% or more of electricity, according to a new report by Zero Carbon Analytics. Ten years since the Paris Agreement was signed, the installed renewable electricity capacity has increased 2.4 times globally.

According to the report, wind and solar now power half of the Netherlands’ electricity needs, compared to 11% a decade ago. Chile has shown better progress, as renewables provide electricity to nearly three-fourths of homes and businesses now.

The report found that solar is nearly 80% cheaper, while clean-energy jobs have nearly doubled to 16.2 million. Annual clean-energy investment has climbed to $2.2 trillion—twice that of fossil fuels.

Considering that damages caused by climate change are increasing drastically every year, renewables growth is now more important than ever. The report cited that damages caused by the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies already exceed $28 trillion.

“One can say that Paris has already reduced future risks for people and ecosystems—fewer extreme heat events, lower sea-level rise, and less pressure on vulnerable communities than in a 3-4°C world. The 1.5°C limit and the net zero goal has shaped policy, finance, litigation and sectoral rules. Action has slowed in the last four years, as the impacts have grown, and we are still a long way from 1.5°C. So while the Paris Agreement has bent the curve and begun rewiring the system, our future now depends on whether governments will begin moving forward again at the rate and scale needed to finish the job,” said Bill Hare, CEO, Climate Analytics.

Electricity access through renewables

There are benefits to this renewable energy expansion as well through improved energy security and access. The report found that increased solar energy has reduced the dependence on fossil fuel imports in island nations like the Cook Islands, Kiribati and Martinique.

On the other hand, renewables accounted for 70% of new electricity capacity in Liberia. This helped people in the country gain access to electricity, and twice the number of people have electricity now as compared to a decade back.

“Ten years on, the Paris Agreement has already reshaped the global economy and set in motion a shift towards clean energy that no country can now ignore. This is opening new possibilities for development, energy security and more prosperous, healthier societies. Today the task is to protect the cooperative spirit that made Paris possible, because most countries still want to move forward – and they know the world is better for it,” said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, European Climate Foundation.

Rob Moore is the principal from Scioto Analysis – a group that studied the impact of the way the state is handing out energy permits.

“You have economic growth where we’re trying to make sure that we have enough energy to be able to support the needs that are happening in Ohio,” Moore said. “We recommended that the chamber and business leaders be talking to the legislature and making sure that there are restrictions on how long the process can be.”

The study found the faster the process – the better, because the longer they take, the more likely those projects will fall through.

The study is making several recommendations, including expediting public hearings and standardizing the timeline for their entire process.

Steve Stivers, the CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce – the group that requested the study – said some neighboring states have already been affected.

“Our goal is to make sure that Ohio can quickly and efficiently approve safe projects that will make sure that we can get energy online faster so that we can live the American dream and have an economic miracle here in Ohio,” Stivers said. “Indiana and the MISO region actually had some rolling blackouts about a year ago as a result of too much demand for electricity and not enough supply.”

Congressman Bob Latta (R – Ohio 5th district) said getting energy from one point to the other is a global issue.

This is why Latta said Congress is considering more than a dozen bills related to energy.

“Because our competitors, as I said, the communist Chinese, they’re moving forward and they’re putting the power on,” Latta said. “And again, if you don’t have the power and the grid security and the modernization of the grid out there, you’re falling way behind.”

This study comes as AEP is requesting to increase its rate. A request that company officials said is needed because of the high demand for energy.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is holding hearings regarding that request this week.

As for the impact on Ohioans, Moore said there’s always a tradeoff, but their research is aiming to find balance.

When presenting the Green Deal Industrial Plan in 2023, Ursula von der Leyen stated that “the race is on to determine who is going to be dominant in the clean tech market in the future”. In 2025, this race has shifted substantially: Europe’s clean tech producers are now hit by two powerful shocks. US tariff policy under Trump 2.0 is creating massive uncertainty for trade, while the rollback of clean industrial policy puts clean tech investments in the US on hold, dampening US demand for European clean tech exports. At the same time, China’s structural oversupply, combined with low manufacturing costs for many clean tech products – from electric vehicles to solar panels – has intensified. Additionally, US trade barriers have led to the redirection of cheap Chinese exports towards Europe, amplifying price pressure on EU-based manufacturers and deepening Europe’s dependency on Chinese tech. The immediate effect is a squeeze on European producers from weaker sales abroad and tougher competition at home.

The window for the EU to respond is narrow. Without timely action to shore up its industrial base, the current squeeze could harden into lasting dependency on a few foreign suppliers of critical clean technologies. Letting Europe’s clean tech base erode through inaction would be a serious strategic mistake, given that the global importance of these industries will only grow in coming years. Despite current challenges, the EU, with its strong industrial and technological base, has all the potential to be a leader in the clean tech race. The EU still has global leaders in wind equipment, heat pumps, next-generation batteries and electrolysers, as well as a large internal market that can create economies of scale. By building on these strengths the EU can claim a leading position – but only if it moves fast and decisively.

The EU therefore needs a short-term, sector-specific response to enable it to weather the immediate shock – protecting European clean tech industries from the impact of US tariffs and redirected Chinese exports – while laying the groundwork for longer-term competitiveness once global demand rebounds. An effective EU policy strategy for clean tech should encompass trade defences against Chinese overcapacity, EU-level production support to complement national state aid for clean tech, and regulatory stability to boost domestic demand for clean tech.

In this paper, we discuss how recent shifts in US trade and industrial policy are changing the prospects for Europe’s clean tech industry, focusing on equipment for wind and solar energy generation, batteries, EVs, electrolysers and heat pumps. We conclude with detailed policy recommendations to strengthen these key industries.

2. Tariffs up, industrial policy down: How US actions affect EU clean tech producers

This section examines how recent US policies are reshaping Europe’s clean tech industry in two distinct ways. Section 2.1 looks at the impact of trade turmoil on the EU market – how renewed US tariffs and Chinese overcapacity are redirecting low-priced Chinese exports toward Europe, intensifying price competition and import dependency. Section 2.2 then turns to the impact on EU exporters, analysing how the rollback of US climate support and weaker domestic demand under Trump affect European producers selling into the American market.

2.1 Trade diversion: ith new US trade policy, the EU market is facing greater inflows of cheap Chinese clean tech

For years, China has been providing ample industrial policy support to its clean tech sectors, including massive subsidies. The result is a persistent supply glut: despite record-high clean tech deployment at home, large parts of Chinese capacity remain underutilised. Facing a saturated home market, Chinese firms are increasingly exporting excess output. Thanks to their willingness to reduce export prices and accept the resultant losses,1 China’s market share in the global market for clean tech has been increasing quickly.

Past US tariff hikes increased the inflow of Chinese clean tech to the EU market. Under the first Trump administration, the US created widespread trade barriers to China. The Biden administration broadly maintained this protectionist strategy: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the post-pandemic stimulus package supporting climate and clean tech investments, largely excluded foreign producers, including EU ones. Moreover, the Biden administration kept high tariffs, especially on China. As a consequence, Chinese exports have been redirected away from the US and towards more open markets such as the EU. As shown in Chart 1, in 2023, around 40 per cent of China’s clean tech ex-ports across six major technologies went to Europe, up from 12 per cent in 2016. At the same time, the share of Chinese clean tech exports to the US stagnated. This indicates that the EU has absorbed some of the Chinese export volume displaced from the US market.

By 2024, about 73 per cent of the EU’s clean tech imports originated in China (Chart 2). This growing import concentration makes Europe highly vulnerable to tariff-induced price competition from Chinese firms, as new US trade barriers instituted by President Trump in 2025 continue to redirect low-priced Chinese exports into the EU market.

At the same time, it is important to distinguish between the share of EU imports coming from China for a given good and China’s market share in the EU: these metrics indicate different levels of dependency. For example, Chinese EVs make up about 60 per cent of EU imports, as illustrated in Chart 2, but EVs made in China only represented about 20 per cent of EV sales in the EU in 2023 (and 8 per cent if we consider Chinese brands only).2 Conversely, in 2024 the EU imported more solar panels from China than it installed.3

While clean tech products have not been a key focus for Trump, both country-specific and sectoral tariffs affect them heavily. In sectors where China has still been exporting large quantities of goods to the US, the EU will likely face an even greater inflow of cheap Chinese products than is currently the case. Simulations suggest that the scale of trade diversion under a renewed US–China tariff escalation could be substantial. In a severe scenario, EU imports from China could rise by 7–10 per cent, according to estimates by the European Central Bank (ECB).4

Trade diversion is highly uneven across sectors. In the short run, highly standardised goods, whose demand is highly sensitive to price, are most prone to redirection following a tariff shock.5 This includes goods like solar panels and batteries: China could increase its supply of these goods to non-US markets by nearly 30 per cent, according to estimates.6 Likewise, these sectors are also the most responsive to tariffs. In contrast, complex, regulation-intensive technologies are less sensitive to short-term price shifts, and hence less prone to rerouting. These products include electric vehicles, wind turbine systems and to some degree electrolysers. Their supply chains rely on certification, standards alignment, and high capital investment, which protect them from short-term shocks but also make them harder to rebuild once displaced.

A striking example of trade re-routing in the first US-China trade war was lithium-ion batteries. Batteries are the only clean technology where the US and the EU imported comparable volumes from China ahead of the 2018-2020 trade war. The US did not entirely close its market to Chinese batteries (unlike EVs), but introduced a series of harsher trade restrictions than the EU. As a result, Chinese import concentration in the US declined in 2019-2020 – showing that the US diversified its battery imports in response – while it continued to rise in the EU. Afterwards, import concentration from China picked up again in the US, though at a slower pace than in the EU (Chart 3).

This pattern appears to be repeating itself under Trump 2.0: since the start of 2025, US battery imports from China have fallen sharply while EU imports have continued to rise, hinting at a possible renewed diversion of Chinese supply from the US market towards Europe. As trade redirection towards the EU increases, Chinese export prices are bound to go down even further. There is already some evidence of this for batteries: unit prices of Chinese batteries imported into the EU (in US dollars per kg) declined by approximately 17 per cent between December 2024 and August 2025. While part of this decline reflects technological improvements and lower input costs, the fall was more than three times steeper than in the preceding eight-month period – suggesting that stronger price competition linked to market redirection also played a role.7

2.2 A turnaround in US industrial policy, while the EU slowly crafts its own

The second Trump administration is rolling back US climate policies and cutting down substantially on the industrial policy subsidies that boosted American clean tech manufacturing under Joe Biden’s presidency. This is exemplified by the shift from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to Trump’s signature budget bill, the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ (OBBB).

Adopted in August 2022, the IRA offered various types of financial incentives over a planned time horizon of 10 years. For manufacturing, this included tax credits for products such as solar energy components, power inverters, batteries and critical raw materials. To boost deployment, the IRA offered purchase incentives for consumers to adopt EVs and heat pumps, as well as subsidies for producing and storing clean energy with solar panels and batteries. These generous support schemes came with a large but hard-to-pinpoint fiscal cost, with overall manufacturing subsidies officially estimated at $72.7 billion for the years 2023-2027.8 This is substantially larger than the EU and member-states have been offering.

But Trump’s OBBB is now entirely stopping some IRA subsidies and is speeding up the phase-out of others.9 Additionally, the Trump administration is actively erecting investment barriers against some clean technologies, including by attacking individual projects in wind energy. The effect is substantial: for US electricity and clean fuels production alone, the OBBB is estimated to reduce cumulative capital investments by $500 billion in 2025-2035.10

Overall, the new US administration is creating substantial headwinds for EU exporters, as well as some limited opportunities. The new US policies have three key impacts on the US market: First, US demand for many clean technologies has started to fall, and is set to contract further. Second, future US supply of clean technologies will be lower than expected as well. However, the OBBB does not reduce most manufacturing subsidies significantly, so the supply reduction is likely to be less pronounced than the demand reduction (see Chart 4 below). Third, the new tariffs might squeeze China out of the US market in product categories where it is still exporting to the US, possibly providing some opportunities for EU exporters to capture its market share. If US demand for a given technology fell by less than domestic supply and Chinese imports combined, this would represent an opportunity for EU exporters – otherwise, exports to the US are likely to be reduced.

For some EU exports, such as EVs, reduced US demand is probably the dominant effect – and a key drag. US demand for clean tech was boosted substantially by the IRA. For example, the IRA offered an EV tax credit of up to $7,500, which was also available for EU-made EVs (although only for leased vehicles). Given that the US is a key export market for EU-made EVs (see Chart 5), the IRA would have provided crucial demand for EU car makers over the coming years. However, the OBBB has phased out EV tax credits, which will, it is estimated, result in 27-41 million fewer EV sales in 2035, a 20-30 per cent reduction from the current policy scenario.11 On top of that, Trump 2.0 has also used executive orders to reverse some of the supportive EV regulation of the Biden administration, like the vehicle emissions standards, as well as state-level policy initiatives, such as EV mandates in California.

At the same time, the potential for European substitution for Chinese EV exports is marginal. Because of prohibitive tariffs and regulatory restrictions, Chinese EV exports to the United States have already been negligible, at only $389 million in 2023 – barely 2 per cent of total US EV imports. Moreover, US policy has favoured reshoring and continental supply integration in North America (as part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement) rather than substituting imports from Europe for those from China.12 Additionally, the US is currently on track to double its production capacity to about 6 million EVs per year, while demand is estimated only at 4 million.13 Overall, the outlook for EU EV exports to the US market, relative to the baseline pre-Trump, has deteriorated sharply.

On the other hand, heat pump exports to the US are currently comparatively small, but could present a growing opportunity for EU producers in spite of the US phasing out heat pump subsidies. Because about 40 per cent of the US imports of heat pumps in 2024 came from China, tariffs on these goods would create tangible room for European manufacturers – provided they can match US price points and expand production. Chart 6 shows that European exports of heat pumps to the US rose sharply during the pandemic, after the previous US–China tariff rounds in the first Trump administration. This suggests that European suppliers could increase their export capacity again, especially if Chinese competitors retreated.

For clean energy generation components, the outlook for EU exporters is mixed. With the IRA, subsidies for wind and solar energy were around $30/MWh, totalling approximately $30 billion per year,14 which substantially boosted demand for wind and solar parks. Similarly, the 3 USD/kg unit subsidy for green hydrogen was sizeable. But the OBBB is phasing out solar, wind and hydrogen tax credits much earlier than planned, leading to estimated cuts in renewable energy investment in the US by at least $60 billion in 2028.15

Most of these changes in US subsidies affect EU manufacturers too. Solar panels are the exception, given that the EU does not export many of them anyway. While the market for electrolysers is quite small today, it is likely to grow substantially in the future, with EU producers well-positioned to capture parts of the US market.

On the other hand, EU exports of wind energy components to the US are likely to decrease in the short term. Wind energy is one of the few strongholds of EU clean tech industry, and EU-based manufacturers benefitted from and supplied products to power the IRA-driven surge of wind park projects in the US. However, the impact on wind energy of Trump’s policy reversal is already evident in the decline in demand for wind energy components. One striking example was the Trump administration’s unilateral halt to the $1.5 billion ‘Revolution Wind’ offshore wind project, for which EU manufacturers supplied most of the high value kit.16 While a federal judge’s decision has since ordered work to resume,17 getting permits for new wind projects will undoubtedly be much more difficult under this administration. Consequently, the export opportunities created by the IRA for wind are mostly gone for now. A silver lining might be that the US retrenchment causes some international wind project developers to shift their investments from the US to the EU, as indicated by recent investment figures for wind parks in Chart 7.

In the battery sector, EU companies will have to compete against the massive domestic production capacities being built in the US (Chart 8). While the evolution of US domestic demand is uncertain given the ongoing policy U-turns,19 the estimated battery production capacity in the US would be largely sufficient to satisfy it, indicating that EU exporters will face fierce competition on the US market. Even though US trade barriers against Chinese batteries are limiting their imports, it will be a challenge for EU producers to capture an increasing market share in the US.

In sum, Trump’s policy reversal has worsened the prospects for exports of key EU clean technologies to the US. This will hit exports of EVs and wind energy equipment particularly hard, because they benefitted from IRA provisions. US domestic capacity for bat-tery manufacturing is growing, so it will be difficult for EU battery producers to seize a large market share. Some smaller industries – such as heat pumps and electrolysers – could benefit from Chinese goods being largely excluded from the US market, however.

3. Policy recommendations

The EU lacks a clear clean tech strategy. In response to the IRA, in mid-2024 the EU adopted the Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA), which set targets for domestic clean tech manufacturing – some ambitious, others unrealistic. However, since then, the EU has continued to slip behind China, instead of catching up with it, in many clean technologies.20 With the Clean Industrial Deal (CID), the EU has correctly identified its problems and the right machinery to tackle them, such as ‘Buy European’ requirements to support the emergence of markets for clean tech, continued carbon pricing, a faster and less bureaucratic regulatory framework, as well as financial support. But whether these instruments are wielded in pursuit of a clear strategy, and with sufficient force, will only be answered in the next one to two years, once legislation is adopted. The medium-term picture is more positive: if a climate-ambitious administration came into office in the US after the 2029 election, US clean tech demand could rebound, to be partly satisfied by EU producers. But as emerging countries start considering tariffs on Chinese exports,21 more Chinese production could be diverted onto European markets.

What the EU needs today is targeted industrial policy to help its clean tech industry weather the current rough patch and position itself for a possible upswing. The Industrial Accelerator Act, to be proposed by the Commission in December 2025, can incorporate many of the necessary measures. This is how these policies should be structured:

1) Step up trade defences against Chinese overcapacity

Deploy tariffs where dumping destroys capacity, not where cheap inputs lower costs. Europe should target trade-defence measures to support sectors most exposed to Chinese price competition, such as batteries. Demand for this type of commoditised good is highly sensitive to price changes, and below-cost imports can quickly wipe out EU producers. By contrast, for solar panels, where global overcapacity is extreme and EU re-shoring would demand unmanageable subsidies, the EU should continue to benefit from low-priced imports to accelerate installation.

Expand European preferences in public procurement – but keep them open to allies. With Chinese exports increasingly redirected toward Europe, European preferences could raise returns and reduce risk for EU firms. This is important for wind and battery manufacturing equipment – technologies that are both central to Europe’s clean tech value chains and highly exposed to Chinese price pressure. Clean tech tenders should favour EU-based supply chains by weighting carbon footprint, recyclability and – for tackling import concentration on China – supply-chain diversification in award criteria. This would keep the EU approach to procurement open to partners meeting equivalent standards, while keeping non-allies – particularly China – out of tenders for selected products. The European Commission should activate the International Procurement Instrument when European businesses face unfair barriers abroad in procurement, allowing Europe to penalise or exclude bidders from countries that do not reciprocate market openness.

Introduce clear obligations for foreign investment in strategic sectors to protect critical capacities and avoid future dependency. Foreign direct investment (FDI) can help expand Europe’s manufacturing capacity, but it does not automatically create local jobs, technology transfer, or diversified supply chains. To ensure that it does, the EU should screen investments in strategic industries. Such FDI should be conditional on investments in local R&D, workforce training and knowledge sharing. This would ensure that foreign capital builds European capabilities rather than increasing dependency on a single supplier. These tools should complement anti-dumping and subsidies counter-vailing tariffs, including anti-circumvention measures, as well as decisive measures under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, helping to maintain a level playing field.

2) Offset the US demand shock in sectors in which Europe is competitive

Provide regulatory and demand-side stability in sectors of European industrial strength. A mix of policies could buttress EU clean tech production in the face of weaker US demand. In wind energy, such policies could include multi-year auction pipelines, predictable contracts for difference (CfDs) that guaranteed developers a fixed revenue and reduced exposure to volatile electricity prices, and accelerated permitting for wind parks. In the automotive sector, the EU should stick to the 2035 phase-out of internal combustion engines, harmonise consumer incentives across member-states, and accelerate the buildout of charging infrastructure for EVs. Policy certainty would give firms the confidence to invest through the current geopolitical turbulence.

For consumer-facing technologies like heat pumps, demand stability is equally vital. Stable regulatory frameworks, subsidies, accessible financing and predictable public-sector procurement – for schools, hospitals, and renovation of public buildings – is needed to create steady demand for these emerging technologies. The EU should also top up national subsidies with European funding, drawing on instruments like the planned European Competitiveness Fund and Horizon Europe, ensuring predictable resources and a truly common industrial effort rather than fragmented national initiatives.

3) Boost supply-side support for strategic emerging industries

Expand Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEIs) and simplify access for emerging technologies. IPCEIs are state-aid regulatory instruments that ena-ble member-states and firms to co-operate on large, cross-border industrial investments considered strategic. Yet complex approval procedures slow their impact, and so far they only exist for a limited number of sectors. To maximise their potential, the EU should: (1) continue its efforts to simplify access and reduce procedural burdens, enabling faster decision-making and project deployment; (2) broaden coverage, set by member states via the Joint European Forum for IPCEIs, to include technologies in which European producers can grow and lead – for example heat-pumps and emerging battery technology (such as sodiumion types); and (3) make IPCEIs eligible for addi-tional EU funding (via instruments like the European Competitiveness Fund) to achieve the size and scope needed for truly pan-European industrial scale. At present, projects rely mainly on national budgets, which constrains their scale and excludes countries with less fiscal capacity. EU co-financing could support larger projects where potential and European benefits are highest.

Complement national aid frameworks with EU-level production support. The EU’s new Clean Industrial State Aid Framework (CISAF) allows member-states to provide support to clean tech manufacturing, but it does not bridge differences in fiscal capacity between them. Moreover, it does not have the time horizon to deliver predictable, long-term support, and only allows investment aid, not production-linked subsidies. But the latter could help Europe’s battery and hydrogen industries remain competitive during ramp-up until uptake and learning curves reduce costs. This is particularly relevant for batteries, where high electricity and input costs have been important drivers behind the erosion of Europe’s cost competitiveness.

4. Conclusion

EU clean tech is facing a double shock – strong Chinese competition fuelled by technological innovation and overcapacities, and stagnating demand in the US due to an abrupt policy reversal. Combined with an uncertain policy outlook at home, these shocks threaten clean tech manufacturing, even though the EU starts from a strong industrial base.

Beyond short term impacts on EU exports, US retrenchment opens possibilities for the EU to position itself better globally. At least for the next few years, the US will be a less prominent player in the global race for clean tech. Yet this race will go ahead: the EU should seize this opportunity to position itself as a powerhouse in a growing market, as clean tech manufacturing is one of the few economic domains where the EU can surpass the US and resist China’s manufacturing take-over. As this paper outlined, the EU needs a coherent strategy to become a global clean tech leader: targeted trade defence measures, EU-level industrial support that complement national measures, and consistent climate policy signals.",https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/styles/spotlight/public/offshore_windpark_sl.jpg?itok=sHzb3eX-,N,,2025-12-09 10:00:09.267439

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,’' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,’' Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,’' she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.’'",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/73a6fa0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7891x4439+0+412/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F74%2Fa5%2Fb6fb46997120b6f9954f2c4d2e33%2F7a37973f9f0b4a87a19e757ec22f1242,N,,2025-12-09 14:03:31.194836

Further, the conductors and transformers affected are designed to handle overloads significantly greater than those caused by inadvertent export.

Continuing momentum on common-sense procedures This settlement marks a significant victory for clean, distributed energy in Michigan.","Michigan communities can breathe easier this winter knowing that the state just streamlined the process to connect affordable and reliable clean energy, thanks to an update to utility DTE’s interconnection procedures.

When a customer is seeking to connect a distributed energy resource (DER) such as rooftop solar to the grid, their electric utility’s interconnection procedures detail the steps to ensure it is done legally and safely. The procedures also govern requirements for DERs to be eligible for incentives such as net metering.

In April 2023, Michigan updated its statewide rules (the MIXDG rules) for the first time since 2009, requiring each utility to revise its procedures and submit them to the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) for review and approval. The MPSC found that each utility needed to make some changes—but especially DTE, the only utility whose application was converted to a contested case complete with expert testimony, cross-examination, and legal briefs.

UCS and our partners in Michigan intervened in the case, where I filed testimony focusing largely on how “export-limited” DERs, described below, are handled. Later, we worked directly with DTE on a settlement agreement to resolve the complicated technical issues of the case. In an MPSC ruling last week, the agreement was accepted, with DTE’s updated procedures taking effect immediately.

The approved procedures mark a major step forward for clean energy interconnection, making the process clearer, fairer, and more consistent with modern standards and technology, paving the way for more clean energy to come online.

In this blog, I’ll discuss export-limited DERs, how they’re addressed in the updated procedures, and what this means for distributed, clean energy in Michigan.

What are export-limited DERs?

An export-limited DER is a system where the maximum output to the grid is constrained to be less than the DER’s full capacity. This may be needed if the first step in the procedures, the “penetration screen,” indicates that the grid has insufficient hosting capacity for the proposed DER. Adding power to the grid above its hosting capacity could compromise the safety and reliability of the grid.

Historically, penetration screens have assumed a worst-case scenario, comparing the nameplate capacity of the DER (its maximum rated power) to the peak demand of the neighborhood electric circuit where it will connect. This made sense for DERs like fossil fuel generators that can provide their full output at any time, but it’s excessively conservative for solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, the predominant type of DER being connected today.

To understand why, consider a typical 50 unit apartment building in Detroit with 80 kilowatts (kW) of rooftop solar panels. On a sunny summer day, the highest output from the solar is about 60 kW—but at the same time, the building uses about 100 kW, meaning there’s no net export to the grid. In fact, the highest net output during the year is about 50 kW on a typical spring day, shown below.

While the nameplate capacity of this hypothetical system is 80 kW, in practice it almost never exports more than 50 kW to the grid, as the building’s own load is typically consuming everything above that amount. If the project faced a hosting capacity limit of only 50 kW, the building could still connect the 80 kW array (and get all the benefits of the larger system), by constraining (or limiting) what it exports to the grid to 50 kW.

Power control systems enable robust, affordable export limiting

Until about 10 years ago, most options for export limiting were expensive and complicated, and only made sense financially for the largest DERs. But by 2016, manufacturers of solar inverters had begun offering built-in export limiting using power control systems (PCS).

PCS technology has now been on the market for close to 10 years, with California being the first state to allow its use in 2016. The 2020 edition of the National Electrical Code introduced rules governing use of PCS, and was coordinated with changes to UL 1741, the safety standard for solar inverters. Several other states have since approved export limiting with PCS, including Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, and Nevada.

One challenge which PCS introduce is the risk of “inadvertent export,” the phenomenon when a PCS momentarily exceeds the export limit. If the load behind the PCS suddenly decreases (such as air conditioning cycling off) or if the connected generation suddenly increases (such as clouds parting above the solar array), it may take a moment for the PCS to measure and respond to the change. Without limits or safeguards against inadvertent export, this momentary spike in exported power can result in damage to grid equipment.

Fortunately, the MIXDG rules include two critical safeguards against this risk. First, consistent with UL 3141 (the relevant safety standard), any PCS must be certified to respond to inadvertent export within 30 seconds. Second, if any part of the PCS malfunctions, the DER must stop exporting any energy to the grid.

DTE sought to restrict the use of PCS

Despite these safeguards, in its original August 2023 filing, DTE sought to place three restrictions on PCS in its proposed procedures:

Penetration screens would be based on nameplate capacity, not export capacity, eliminating the principal motivation to use a PCS.

The time limit for a PCS to respond to inadvertent export would be 200 milliseconds, instead of the standard 30 seconds. This is excessively conservative and would make it challenging to find an approved PCS.

The nameplate capacity of a DER with PCS would be limited to no more than 20% above the export capacity. But in typical solar-plus-storage systems, the solar and battery are each sized to meet the building’s full load, making the nameplate capacity roughly twice the PCS-limited export capacity—far above the proposed limit.

In testimony, DTE’s witness did not provide evidence of the specific risks or why these restrictions are necessary.

DTE’s proposed limits were excessive and contradicted the rules

In my testimony, I argued that the actual risk of damage from inadvertent export is significantly lower than DTE assumed, making the proposed restrictions unnecessary.

I pointed out that because inadvertent export events are triggered only by sudden changes in load or generation, their impact is naturally limited, and simultaneous or repeated events are highly unlikely. Further, the conductors and transformers affected are designed to handle overloads significantly greater than those caused by inadvertent export. This means that the risk of thermal damage to equipment is essentially zero.

I did acknowledge that there is a minor risk of voltage fluctuations caused by inadvertent export. But rather than using the restrictions DTE proposed, I recommended that this risk be mitigated using a simple voltage screen like the one initially proposed in the BATRIES report. This definitive report was developed by a group of researchers and utilities to support standardization of interconnection procedures for batteries and solar-plus-storage DERs. And as the BATRIES report explains, because voltage issues precede other risks to grid equipment, it also effectively screens for those risks.

Further explanation of the minimal risk posed by inadvertent export is provided in a memo from IREC, included as Exhibit CEO-4 in my direct testimony.

Settlement discussions were long, technical, but productive

After briefs were filed in the case, DTE reached out to discuss a settlement. Over several months, we discussed the procedures point-by-point, hashing out the technical details. Ultimately, we settled on a nuanced approach to limited export DERs which eased the restrictions on PCS while addressing DTE’s safety concerns by adding the voltage screen I had proposed.

DTE agreed to base the penetration screen on export capacity and align the time limit on inadvertent export with the 30 second requirement in the MIXDG rules. DTE also agreed to ease the capacity limits, basing them on the rating of the utility infrastructure rather than the DER size. While I still believe these limits should be higher, they are unlikely to affect most conventional projects. I’ve summarized the (fairly nuanced) limits below:

In practice, on a typical residential feeder served by a 50 kVA transformer, the total nameplate capacity of all export-limited projects could not exceed 150 kW if each individual project was 20 kW or less.

DTE is the first Midwest utility to implement a voltage screen for inadvertent export

A key component of the settlement was the addition of the voltage screen that I had recommended, which addressed DTE’s concerns about the risks of inadvertent export.

The BATRIES team developed the screen to address a gap in the typical screening process that applies to export-limited projects. The limit for the initial penetration screen (15% of peak load) is set to account for the impact of DERs on grid voltage. But if some portion of the DER capacity is export-limited, it’s possible for voltage to rise above acceptable limits during an inadvertent export event, when the active capacity can momentarily exceed the 15% limit. The voltage screen for export-limited projects addresses this risk by estimating their impact on grid voltage, using the formula below. If the voltage change exceeds 3%, then the project fails the screen and must undergo further study.

We discussed this screen at length with DTE, who ultimately agreed to implement it with a few tweaks. As far as we are aware, DTE is the first utility in the Midwest to implement this screen, and one of only a handful across the US to adopt this sophisticated, rational approach to screening export-limited projects.

Other important wins in the settlement

In addition to this significant accomplishment for export-limited projects, there are several other notable settlement terms:

Unintentional islanding: DTE originally required costly direct transfer trip (DTT) for all risks associated with islanding, a safety risk occurring when DERs continue generating power during grid outages. The settlement replaces this with a screening process that triggers a study only when needed and allows more cost-effective mitigation options. DTE will also join workgroup discussions which will consider an updated screening approach developed by IREC.

IEEE 2800 applicability: DTE initially sought to apply the entirety of IEEE 2800—a standard for projects connecting directly to the transmission system—to any project which might impact the transmission system. The settlement narrows this to only the specific clauses relevant to certain projects, giving developers clearer, more appropriate requirements.

Incentive program eligibility: DTE will now account for solar panel orientation and tilt when calculating annual generation for distributed generation program eligibility, allowing many more projects to qualify for incentives.

Continuing momentum on common-sense procedures

This settlement marks a significant victory for clean, distributed energy in Michigan. Alongside the Environmental Law and Policy Center, the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, Advanced Energy United, and MPSC staff, we worked closely with DTE to develop procedures that comply with the MIXDG rules, provide clear guidance for DER projects, and robustly manage the risk of inadvertent export. The support of IREC, the lead author of the BATRIES report, was also critical early in the case.

It was encouraging to see DTE take up this challenge and implement solutions like the voltage screen. We hope to see the company continue to lead in this way, participating in the interconnection workshops and supporting other Michigan utilities seeking to implement this approach.

In the meantime, customers in DTE’s territory who are seeking to implement clean solar energy projects will have a clearer and more reasonable set of procedures to follow when doing so, resulting in more projects being approved more quickly.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blog-Thumbnail-rooftop-solar-in-Michigan.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 13:00:38.549581

The experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action.
There were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said.
Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.

Ending this harm was a key part of the global transformation of governance, economics and finance required “before collapse becomes inevitable”, the experts said.

The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) report, which is produced by 200 researchers for the UN Environment Programme, said the climate crisis, destruction of nature and pollution could no longer be seen as simply environmental crises.

“They are all undermining our economy, food security, water security, human health and they are also [national] security issues, leading to conflict in many parts of the world,” said Prof Robert Watson, the co-chair of the assessment.

All the environmental crises were worsening as the global population grows and required more food and energy, most of which was produced in ways that pollute the planet and destroy the natural world, the experts said. A sustainable world was possible, they said, but required political courage.

“This is an urgent call to transform our human systems now before collapse becomes inevitable,” said Prof Edgar Gutiérrez-Espeleta, another co-chair and the former environment minister in Costa Rica.

“The science is good. The solutions are known. What is required is the courage to act at the scale and speed that history demands,” he said, adding that the window for action was “rapidly narrowing”.

The experts acknowledged that the geopolitical situation today was difficult, with the US under Donald Trump, some other countries and corporate vested interests working to block or reverse environmental action. Watson, a former chair of leading international climate and biodiversity science groups, said: “The public have got to demand that they want a sustainable future for their children and their grandchildren. Most governments do try and respond.”

The GEO report is comprehensive – 1,100 pages this year – and is usually accompanied by a summary for policymakers, which is agreed by all the world’s countries. However, strong objections by countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, Turkey and Argentina to references to fossil fuels, plastics, reduced meat in diets and other issues meant no agreement was reached this time.

A statement made by the UK on behalf of 28 countries said: “We witnessed diversion attempts to question the scientific nature of this process. Our delegations fully respect every state’s right to safeguard their country’s national interests and rights, but science is not negotiable.”

The GEO report emphasised that the costs of action were much less than the costs of inaction in the long term, and estimated the benefits from climate action alone would be worth $20tn a year by 2070 and $100tn by 2100. “We need visionary countries and private sector [companies] to recognise they will make more profit by addressing these issues rather than ignoring them,” Watson said.

The report contained several “critical truths”, Gutiérrez-Espeleta said: environmental crises were political and security emergencies, threatening the social ties that held societies together. Today’s governments and economic systems were failing humanity and financial reform was the cornerstone of transformation, he said: “Environmental policy must become the backbone of national security, social justice, and economic strategy.”

One of the biggest issues was the $45tn a year in environmental damage caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, and the pollution and destruction of nature caused by industrial agriculture, the report said. The food system carried the largest costs, at $20tn, with transport at $13tn and fossil-fuel powered electricity at $12tn.

These costs – called externalities by economists – must be priced into energy and food to reflect their real price and shift consumers towards greener choices, Watson said: “So we need social safety nets. We need to make sure that the poorest in society are not harmed by an increase in costs.”

The report suggests measures such as a universal basic income, taxes on meat and subsidies for healthy, plant-based foods.

There were also about $1.5tn in environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuels, food and mining, the report said. These needed to be removed or repurposed, it added. Watson noted that wind and solar energy was cheaper in many places but held back by vested interests in fossil fuel.

The climate crisis may be even worse than thought, he said: “We are likely to be underestimating the magnitude of climate change”, with global heating probably at the high end of the projections made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Removing fossil fuel subsidies could cut emissions by a third, the report said.

The convergence of industrial scale production, chemistry innovations, and competitive pressures has created unprecedented cost dynamics that extend far beyond traditional supply and demand mechanisms.

What's Driving the Historic Battery Price Collapse to $108/kWh?

Lithium-ion battery prices fall 2025 has emerged as a defining trend, with pack costs reaching a record low of $108/kWh despite rising raw material expenses. This 8% annual decline represents a 93% reduction from 2010 levels, fundamentally altering the economics of energy storage across multiple applications.

Manufacturing Overcapacity Creates Unprecedented Cost Pressure

Chinese manufacturing facilities have generated substantial production surplus, driving intense price competition throughout global markets. China achieved the steepest regional price reduction at $84/kWh in 2025, representing a 13% real-terms decline from 2024 levels. This oversupply condition has created cut-throat competition that overwhelms traditional cost structures.

The facility utilization dynamics reveal how excess capacity translates into aggressive pricing strategies. Chinese manufacturers maintain production volumes despite margin compression, prioritising market share retention and meeting annual sales targets over short-term profitability.

Regional capacity distribution demonstrates significant concentration:

• China: Dominant production capacity with aggressive export strategies

• North America: Higher cost structures with 44% price premiums

• Europe: Import dependency driving 56% price premiums

Market dynamics show that manufacturing overcapacity has become the primary price determinant, overriding raw material cost fluctuations that would typically drive pricing increases.

Chemistry Shift Accelerates Cost Reduction Beyond Raw Materials

The widespread adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) technology has created substantial cost advantages across all market segments. LFP battery packs averaged $81/kWh while nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) systems cost $128/kWh, establishing a $47/kWh differential that drives strategic chemistry selection.

Cost differential analysis reveals strategic implications:

Chemistry Type Average Price Cost Advantage Market Penetration LFP Technology $81/kWh 37% lower cost Expanding rapidly NMC Technology $128/kWh Premium pricing Specialty applications Industry Average $108/kWh Benchmark All segments

Performance trade-offs have become increasingly favourable for LFP applications. Grid-scale storage and many automotive applications can accommodate the lower energy density of LFP chemistry while capturing significant cost benefits. China's dominance in LFP production has enabled nearly universal global supply, facilitating rapid market adoption.

Supply Chain Hedging Strategies Neutralise Commodity Volatility

Long-term contract structures have effectively insulated battery manufacturers from spot price volatility in critical materials. Despite rising lithium and cobalt costs due to supply constraints and new export quotas from the Democratic Republic of Congo, these increases did not translate into higher pack prices.

Financial hedging mechanisms enable manufacturers to stabilise input costs across multi-year periods. Vertical integration benefits throughout the value chain have allowed companies to absorb raw material cost increases while maintaining competitive pricing pressure on finished battery packs.

The industry deployed three primary mechanisms to offset higher metal costs: expanded LFP adoption, long-term procurement contracts, and sophisticated financial hedging strategies. Furthermore, the development of spodumene lithium extraction processes has helped improve supply chain efficiency.

Which Market Segments Are Experiencing the Steepest Price Declines?

Stationary Storage Achieves Lowest-Cost Position at $70/kWh

Battery pack prices for stationary storage applications reached $70/kWh in 2025, representing a dramatic 45% year-over-year reduction. This segment experienced the steepest decline among all lithium-ion battery applications and became the lowest-priced category for the first time.

The 45% price reduction transforms grid-scale deployment economics by crossing critical viability thresholds for multiple applications. Energy arbitrage opportunities, peak shaving strategies, and renewable integration projects now achieve economic returns without policy subsidies in many markets.

Grid-scale systems benefit from minimal space constraints, enabling wholesale adoption of lower-cost LFP chemistry without performance compromises. The cost structure at $70/kWh supports 4-hour energy storage systems at approximately $280/kW total cost, creating compelling economics for utility-scale deployments.

Competitive positioning analysis against alternative technologies:

• Pumped hydro storage: Geographic limitations but lower long-term costs

• Compressed air systems: Site-specific requirements with moderate costs

• Flow batteries: Higher upfront costs but extended duration capabilities

• Lithium-ion (stationary): Broad applicability with rapidly declining costs

Electric Vehicle Batteries Maintain Sub-$100 Threshold

Battery-electric vehicle packs reached $99/kWh in 2025, marking the second consecutive year below the critical $100/kWh adoption benchmark. This sustained positioning indicates market maturation and increasing competitive pressure in automotive applications.

The sub-$100/kWh threshold represents a psychological and economic milestone for consumer EV adoption. Battery cost contribution to total vehicle pricing continues declining, improving affordability relative to internal combustion engine alternatives when total cost of ownership calculations include fuel and maintenance differentials.

Regional market penetration correlates strongly with battery cost levels. Markets achieving the lowest battery costs demonstrate accelerated EV adoption rates, while regions with higher battery prices experience slower electrification progress. According to recent analysis, lithium-ion battery price predictions suggest continued downward trajectory.

EV battery pricing impact on market segments:

Vehicle Category Battery Size Cost Impact Market Response Compact EVs 40-50 kWh $3,960-4,950 Mass market entry Mid-range EVs 60-75 kWh $5,940-7,425 Mainstream adoption Luxury EVs 85-100 kWh $8,415-9,900 Performance focus

Consumer price impact accelerates as battery costs represent approximately 30-35% of mid-range vehicle total costs, compared to 40-50% when batteries cost $120-150/kWh. This structural shift enables competitive positioning against comparable internal combustion vehicles across multiple market segments.

How Are Regional Price Dynamics Reshaping Global Competition?

China's $84/kWh Benchmark Sets Global Competitive Floor

Chinese battery pack prices established the global competitive baseline at $84/kWh, reflecting optimal manufacturing costs and scale economies. This pricing represents a 13% real-terms reduction from 2024 and demonstrates the intensity of domestic competition within Chinese markets.

Manufacturing cost advantages stem from vertically integrated supply chains spanning mining, refining, cell production, and pack assembly. Chinese companies benefit from concentrated industrial ecosystems that minimise logistics costs and enable rapid technology transfer across value chain participants.

Scale economics provide decisive cost advantages as Chinese facilities operate at utilisation rates that drive down fixed cost allocation per unit. Export strategy implications focus on maintaining global market share through aggressive pricing rather than maximising per-unit margins.

Technology transfer and localisation pressures create strategic considerations:

• Intellectual property protection versus market access trade-offs

• Local content requirements driving investment decisions in target markets

• Government policy responses to Chinese competitive advantages

• Supply chain security concerns influencing purchasing decisions

North American and European Premium Persists Despite Convergence

North American battery pack prices averaged approximately $121/kWh, representing a 44% premium over Chinese levels despite a 4% year-over-year decline. European markets experienced $131/kWh pricing with a 56% premium over China, though prices fell 8% from 2024.

Tariff impact analysis reveals complex cost structure evolution as trade barriers influence pricing through multiple mechanisms. Import duties directly increase landed costs, while local content requirements force higher-cost domestic sourcing for battery components and materials.

Regional premium breakdown by contributing factors:

Cost Component North America Europe China Baseline Labour costs +15-20% +20-25% Reference Supply chain +10-15% +12-18% Integrated Import duties +8-12% +5-8% Domestic Facility costs +5-8% +8-12% Optimised

Local content requirements drive investment decisions as manufacturers balance compliance costs against market access benefits. In addition, developments in australia lithium industry innovations are helping to diversify global supply chains. These regulations create structural cost increases while fostering domestic supply chain development and technology transfer.

Trade Flow Redirection Intensifies European Competition

Chinese manufacturer export strategies pivoted toward European markets in response to shifting US trade policies and increased tariff barriers. This strategic redirection intensified competitive pressure in European markets, contributing to the 8% price decline compared to North America's 4% reduction.

Aggressive pricing tactics maintain volume targets as Chinese companies prioritise market share retention over margin optimisation. Export volume redirection created oversupply conditions in European markets, forcing domestic and other international suppliers to reduce pricing to maintain competitiveness.

Market share battles in high-value European segments demonstrate how trade policy indirectly influences regional pricing through supply flow modifications. The concentration of Chinese exports in Europe creates pricing pressure that exceeds what would occur through organic market competition alone.

Trade flow impact on market dynamics:

• Increased Chinese export volume to Europe following US policy changes

• Aggressive pricing to maintain global sales targets despite regional barriers

• European market oversupply creating competitive pressure on all suppliers

• Price convergence acceleration between Chinese and European markets

What Economic Thresholds Are Being Crossed in 2025?

Grid-Scale Storage Achieves Economic Viability Across Applications

The $70/kWh stationary storage price point crosses critical economic thresholds that enable unsubsidised deployment across multiple grid applications. Energy arbitrage strategies become profitable in markets with sufficient price spreads between off-peak and peak electricity pricing, typically requiring $40-80/MWh differentials.

Renewable energy integration benefits from cost-effective storage that smooths intermittent generation and provides grid services. Peak shaving applications achieve attractive returns as storage systems reduce demand charges for commercial and industrial customers while providing backup power capabilities.

Grid-scale deployment acceleration metrics:

• 4-hour storage systems: $280/kW total cost enables merchant revenue models

• Energy arbitrage: 10-15 year payback periods in competitive electricity markets

• Peak shaving: 7-12 year returns for commercial demand charge reduction

• Grid services: Additional revenue streams from frequency regulation and reserves

Utility-scale deployment acceleration reflects improved project economics as storage systems achieve competitive positioning against alternative grid infrastructure investments. Return calculations support storage deployment without requiring policy subsidies in most developed electricity markets.

Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership Parity Approaches

Battery cost contribution to vehicle pricing evolution approaches levels that enable TCO parity with internal combustion engine vehicles across multiple segments. Consumer adoption curve inflection points emerge as upfront cost premiums diminish while operating cost advantages become more pronounced.

Fleet electrification economic triggers activate as commercial operators recognise favourable TCO economics. The combination of lower battery costs, reduced maintenance requirements, and fuel cost savings creates compelling business cases for fleet conversion across delivery, transit, and corporate vehicle applications.

EV adoption economic analysis:

Vehicle Segment Battery Cost Impact TCO Comparison Market Response Compact vehicles 25-30% of cost Near parity Rapid adoption Mid-size vehicles 30-35% of cost Slight premium Accelerating sales Commercial fleets 35-40% of cost Favourable TCO Fleet conversions

The sustained $99/kWh pricing for the second consecutive year indicates market stabilisation at levels that support mass market adoption. Further cost reductions will likely require technological innovations rather than simple manufacturing scale improvements.

However, market participants must consider lithium market downturn insights which could impact future supply dynamics and pricing stability.

Battery cost reductions create transformative opportunities across the energy sector. Record-low pricing enables accelerated EV adoption while supporting grid-scale storage deployment for renewable energy integration worldwide. The industry has reached a critical inflection point where storage economics support widespread deployment without policy dependencies.

Strategic Implications for Energy Market Participants

Utility Investment Strategy Adjustments

Grid modernisation priorities increasingly emphasise storage integration as costs reach levels that support multiple revenue streams. Utility procurement strategies expand beyond traditional capacity planning to include storage as flexible infrastructure that provides generation, transmission, and distribution benefits.

Renewable energy project development economics improve substantially with cost-effective storage integration. Solar and wind projects paired with storage achieve higher capacity factors and provide dispatchable generation that commands premium pricing in many markets.

Peak demand management strategies evolve as storage costs enable economic peak shaving across residential, commercial, and industrial customer segments. Utilities develop new rate structures and programmes that optimise storage deployment while managing grid costs.

Industrial Energy User Opportunities

Behind-the-meter storage deployment accelerates as system costs support multiple value propositions including demand charge reduction, backup power, and energy arbitrage. Industrial energy users increasingly view storage as standard infrastructure rather than experimental technology.

Energy cost management strategy evolution incorporates storage as a tool for managing electricity procurement, power quality, and operational resilience. Large energy users develop sophisticated energy management systems that optimise storage operations across multiple objectives.

Grid services revenue opportunities enable industrial storage owners to monetise excess capacity through participation in wholesale electricity markets. This additional revenue stream improves project economics while supporting grid reliability.

Consequently, the continued trend of lithium-ion battery prices fall 2025 represents more than a simple cost reduction phenomenon. It marks a fundamental transformation in energy economics that enables widespread adoption of clean technologies across transportation, grid infrastructure, and industrial applications.

Despite countries agreeing to transition away from fossil fuels two years ago, the use of coal, oil and gas has remained stubbornly high - driving record carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Global Carbon Project compiled by scientists.

But this year also saw renewable energy expand, driven by solar power which grew by nearly a third in the first half of 2025, according to the think tank Ember Energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Renewables overtake coal for the first time

For the first time, solar power made up a larger share of the electricity mix than coal in the first half of this year, according to the Ember report, marking a key moment in the world's efforts to transition to clean energy.

More than half of the record growth in solar generation took place in China, followed by the United States and the European Union, the report said.

The surge helped to meet the world's growing energy demand in 2025, according to Ember.

But solar's share in electricity generation is still small - growing to 8.8% in the first six months of this year from 6.9% in the same period of 2024.

AI and geopolitics are transforming the energy outlook

While scientists say the world must transition to clean energy to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, 2025 has seen artificial intelligence and geopolitics make it more challenging.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects the energy demands of AI to more than quadruple by 2030.

Meanwhile, the global energy outlook is being shaped by geopolitical uncertainty as countries prioritise meeting surging energy needs over climate concerns, and consulting firm McKinsey predicts fossil fuels will keep a large share of the energy mix beyond 2050.

United States and Europe retreated on clean energy

After President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. government repudiated the clean energy policies of his predecessor Joe Biden, cutting subsidies for renewables projects while easing the way for new oil and gas licences.

Trump has issued executive orders to shore up his country's coal industry, particularly to address fast-rising electricity needs for new data centres to power AI tools.

While China and India saw fossil-fuel generation decrease in the first six months of 2025, the United States and Europe bucked that trend, according to Ember's report.

Elsewhere in the world, fossil fuel exploration continued in spite of scientific warnings, including in South America's vulnerable Amazon rainforest region.

Fossil fuels were kept off the page at COP30

Despite these trends, multilateral efforts for a deal to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels have faltered.

At last month's U.N. COP30 climate summit in Brazil, negotiators from Latin America and the EU demanded an accord with language on a transition, but the final text sidestepped it.

The United States did not send a delegation, and a coalition of other fossil oil producers, led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, said any mention of fossil fuels was off the table.

Clean energy transformation needs skilled workers

The energy sector has been a good source of jobs in recent years globally, employing 76 million people in 2024, up more than 5 million since 2019, according to a new report from the IEA.

Beyond the headline figures, the IEA said the sector is struggling to meet increasing demand for applied technical workers, who are crucial for clean energy development, including the construction of solar and wind farms.

This problem is being compounded as employees retire, including in critical jobs like grid-related professions - where for every one new entrant, 1.4 people are retiring, the IEA said.

North America on track for ICAO’s 2030 cleaner-energy target as other regions lag

IBA, the aviation market intelligence and advisory company, reports that North America is currently the only global region on track to meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) cleaner-energy goal for 2030: a 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions from international aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy sources.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% CO₂ reduction target unless substantial additional SAF capacity is developed.

IBA calculated these figures by combining ICAO’s latest SAF production capacity data with its own independent global fuel demand forecasts to assess whether each region is developing sufficient supply to remain aligned with a credible long-term decarbonisation pathway. The analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030, but when including facilities currently under construction, the region’s capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement. This reflects the impact of sustained policy support in the United States, including the federal SAF Grand Challenge, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and state-level measures such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which together have helped unlock financing for a diverse range of SAF technologies.

In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to achieve ICAO’s 5% benchmark. Although the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets progressively rising SAF blend levels from 2025, stringent sustainability criteria and high production costs continue to limit supply growth.

However, IBA notes that the European Commission’s newly announced Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to address this shortfall by mobilising around €100 billion across aviation and shipping to accelerate the deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels.

Regions including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East remain significantly behind the required levels, reflecting limited operational capacity and fewer advanced projects under development. IBA highlights that, for these regions to meet their long-term climate goals, rapid acceleration in investment and enabling policy frameworks will be necessary.

Globally, SAF facilities that are operational or under construction currently represent around 4.5% of global jet fuel supply in 2025, underscoring the substantial scale-up required as the sector works towards ICAO’s 2030 milestone and the broader 2050 net-zero commitments.

Industry: Chemicals

Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2800712/3-diversified-chemical-stocks-to-watch-amid-demand-headwinds

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry remains buffeted by persistent demand headwinds in certain markets, including consumer durables and building & construction. Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China is weighing on demand.

Industry players such as Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Albemarle Corp. and Avient Corp. are relying on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and price hikes, to navigate the challenging environment.

About the Industry

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building & construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture.

Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride) and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide). Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.

What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?

Subdued Demand in Key End Markets: Companies in the chemical-diversified space remain hamstrung by demand weakness in certain key markets. The sluggishness in the building & construction, and consumer electronics markets is the key concern. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building & construction.

Elevated borrowing costs and inflation have taken a bite out of the residential construction industry. The consumer electronics market, a key driver of demand for specialty chemicals and advanced materials, is among the hardest hit. Following the post-pandemic boom, global electronics demand has cooled amid high inflation, elevated interest rates and cautious consumer behavior.

Manufacturing activities have also softened amid weaker demand for goods and higher borrowing costs, while recovery remains tepid. Demand for chemicals in the industrial sector has weakened due to constrained industrial production. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes.

Slowdown in Europe and China: In China, a slower recovery in economic activities is hurting chemical demand. China is seeing slower economic growth and a sluggish real estate market. A weak property market and a slowdown in infrastructure investments have led to softer demand. The real estate sector has taken a hard hit amid a decline in new home prices, property investment and housing sales.

The slowdown in Europe, resulting from the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation and high interest rates, has also led to softer demand in that region. Energy and feedstock inflation has lowered industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The ongoing weakness in these key regions will likely adversely impact the demand for chemicals over the short term.

Self-help Actions to Aid Results: Companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to lower costs. The industry participants are also raising selling prices to counter cost inflation. Such moves are likely to help the industry sustain margins amid the prevailing challenges.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak Prospects

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #216, which places it at the bottom 11% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates a gloomy near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.

Industry Underperforms Sector & S&P 500

The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has underperformed both the Zacks S&P 500 composite and the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector over the past year.

The industry has lost 32.9% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 16.4% and the broader sector’s increase of 13.5%.

Industry's Current Valuation

On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing chemical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 11.06, below the S&P 500’s 18.73X and the sector’s 14.31X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 12.79X, as low as 5.56X and at the median of 9.87X.

Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale.","Yara and Air Products have advanced negotiations to partner on low-emission ammonia projects.

Yara has matured a project portfolio for potential investment in cost competitive US ammonia to diversify its energy position and increase competitiveness of its European nitrate production.

Air Products is developing the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the CO2 generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system.

About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

Additionally, the companies are planning to collaborate on the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia which is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe.

The model enables ammonia from the world’s first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara’s shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Yara is the world’s largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara’s 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand.

Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale.

The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-166149.png,N,,2025-12-09 12:04:31.960739
,Indiana and Evs,2025-12-09 11:09:45+00:00,CNN,Ford teams up with Renault to make EVs that can rival Chinese brands | CNN Business,Not Available,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/business/ford-renault-european-evs-intl,"Renault and Ford will jointly develop small, cheaper Ford-branded electric vehicles for the European market to fend off rising competition from Chinese rivals, the companies said Tuesday.
They will be smaller than any Ford plans for the US market and fill a gap in the automaker’s line-up, Farley said.
The two automakers will also jointly develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe.
Although there are few Chinese brand vans on sale in Europe, Farley said the two companies “compete with them directly every day” in emerging markets.
Ford already produces two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and makes vans with the German automaker.","Renault and Ford will jointly develop small, cheaper Ford-branded electric vehicles for the European market to fend off rising competition from Chinese rivals, the companies said Tuesday.

“We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry,” Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley told reporters in Paris Monday ahead of the announcement, when describing Ford’s response to the threat posed by cheaper Chinese competition. “There is no better example than here in Europe.”

Europe’s traditional automakers face an influx of Chinese rivals from BYD to Changan and Xpeng (XPEV).

As part of the Ford-Renault partnership, the first of two planned small EVs – to be produced at a Renault plant in northern France – will reach European car showrooms in 2028. They will be smaller than any Ford plans for the US market and fill a gap in the automaker’s line-up, Farley said.

The two automakers will also jointly develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe.

A ‘powerhouse’ for light commerical vehicles

“Together we can create a powerhouse of LCV in Europe that would be very difficult for the Chinese to compete with,” Farley said.

Although there are few Chinese brand vans on sale in Europe, Farley said the two companies “compete with them directly every day” in emerging markets.

Renault CEO Francois Provost also said: “The Chinese will come soon and that’s why I don’t want to wait.”

The partnership was formed after a Renault team visited Ford’s Detroit headquarters in March. Both Farley and Provost said the two automakers do not plan to merge.

Ford’s share of the European passenger car market has almost halved in Europe from 6.1% in 2019 to 3.3% in the first 10 months of this year as it has pulled back from passenger vehicle sales. As part of a series of restructurings, the company has cut jobs and this year closed its Saarlouis plant in Germany.

Given the withdrawal of EV support from US President Donald Trump’s administration, the No. 2 US automaker faces the dual expense of investing in combustion-engine models and expensive new EV technology.

Using Renault’s EV platforms with Ford designs should help the US automaker compete in Europe’s electric car market against traditional automakers such as Volkswagen, as well as the Chinese.

Ford already produces two EV models in Europe on a Volkswagen platform and makes vans with the German automaker. Farley said the Renault partnership will complement its existing one with Volkswagen.

Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker

Renault is Europe’s smallest mainstream automaker and does not sell vehicles in China or the United States – the world’s two biggest car markets – so the Ford partnership boosts its manufacturing scale to lower costs.

The French carmaker is actively seeking partnerships to make fuller use of its factories and reduce the burden of developing new EVs.

In 2026, Renault will produce two vehicles using platforms from China’s Geely in Brazil and is in talks with more automakers, including China’s Chery, to jointly produce and sell cars.

“Our ambition… is to show that in Europe we can produce EV cars in Europe as competitively as anyone, including the Chinese,” Renault’s Provost said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2147727783.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-09 07:59:29.460785

One key element is the 45Q carbon capture tax credits, which avoided the clean energy funding cull from the US government.
With an expected 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year expected to be captured, Air Products could bank over $460m annually from 45Q.

One key element is the 45Q carbon capture tax credits, which avoided the clean energy funding cull from the US government.

CEO Eduardo Menezes said the credit, which offers up to $85/tonne of carbon dioxide capture, stored or used in industry, would “skew” the plant for its first 12 years of operations, to deliver returns higher than a traditional grey hydrogen project.

“The EBITDA for the first 12 years should be higher than a normal EBITDA would be in an industrial gas project,” he explained. With an expected 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year expected to be captured, Air Products could bank over $460m annually from 45Q.

The company is still negotiating the carbon capture segment of the project. Air Products expects to announce a third-party carbon capture deal under a long-term agreement “later”. Currently, the sequestration scope is not included in the new capital expenditure forecasts of $8–$9bn – up from the original $4.5bn.

Under the deal with Yara, Air Products will offload the Louisiana project’s ammonia production, storage, and shipping elements – representing around 25% of that $8–$9bn.

Air Products plans to sell around 80% of its blue hydrogen to Yara under a 25-year offtake agreement, enabling the production of 2.8 million tonnes of ammonia per year. The remaining 20% would be fed into the industrial gas firm’s existing US Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system, where it moves over 1.5 bcfd of hydrogen, representing around 12% of total volume.

The Louisiana project, initially expected to be operational in 2026, is now due online in 2030 if final investment decision (FID) can be taken by mid-2026. News of the Yara partnership follows spending on the project pausing in May and last month’s earnings call in which the CEO confirmed “advanced negotiations” were underway.

He stressed that the transaction will only close once the project starts.

“We will have progress payments like we would have with any project, with the difference being that the final payment will be larger than what would be in a normal transaction of a sale of a project. This is something we are still finalising,” Menezes said.

Yara, the largest ammonia trader globally, has keen interest in developing renewable ammonia, both blue and green.

“It’s a good deal for Yara but also a very good deal for Air Products as we won’t need to have a sales force and marketing structure and so forth … personally, I have been working with Yara for 20 years,” added Menezes. “Having a partner like Yara, with its infrastructure [of] ships and terminals, really eliminates this volume risk that we have today.”

Menezes sounded off on a note of caution, underlining that negotiations remain at a critical stage.

“If we cannot get to a capital expenditure number that we can both live with, we will not have an FID,” he said. “We are making this announcement as we believe that we have a path to get there, but until we have these agreements with construction companies done, and we have a final picture, we will still need to make a decision on the FID.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/07/shutterstock_1873346731.jpg",N,,2025-12-09 10:01:11.022439

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The world needs a new approach to environmental crises threatening the health of people and the planet by adopting policies to jointly tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation and pollution, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.

Those issues are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme's quadrennial Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. ""You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.""

They’re “all undermining our economy,"" worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Almost 300 scientists from 83 countries contributed to this year's report — called the most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken — which was released during the U.N. Environment Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven't made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What's more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn't involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded; more than 1 million plant and animal species face extinction; and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn't measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren't the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.""

Despite the report's urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He's promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year's U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn't attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and ""said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she's confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

“Across the country, regional governments are demonstrating that bold climate action doesn’t have to wait for Washington,” says One Earth, a global network of climate researchers. “They are implementing policies that expand renewable energy, protect natural ecosystems, and promote regenerative agriculture.”

America Is All In, a coalition of climate-concerned states and cities, planned to send “more than 100 U.S. subnational leaders – including governors, senior state officials, nearly 40 mayors and dozens of city officials – to the climate talks known as Cop30 (November 10-21, 2025) and the UN Local Leaders Forum planned for the days before,” said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of the group and former EPA leader, according to The Guardian.

Another group, the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC), representing more than 180 U.S. House of Representatives members, “aims to deploy them in their ‘soft power’ role to promote climate action,” Earth.Org explains. “Although the 17 members of Congress who prepared to go to COP30 were forced to remain home to vote on the US government shutdown, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island did attend – the only U.S. federal representative in Belém,” Brazil.

“Whether the federal administration is in or out or lukewarm, the U.S. states have always been coming to the COP. And this year is no exception in 2025,” said Amy Holm, executive director of the Climate Registry, according to Earth.Org. “The U.S. states are here to tell their story of climate action, that they’re still implementing in their jurisdictions, whether it be clean energy, transportation, affordability, land use, all those things are going on in jurisdictions all across the United States.”

Some examples of states and cities leading the way include:

California

Chicago

Detroit

Massachusetts

New Mexico

New York

Vermont

Wyoming

California

California continues to lead climate change efforts. “[In] 2024, the state consistently generated more than 100% of its electricity demand from renewable sources,” One Earth notes.

The Golden State was also one of the first U.S. states to commit to the global 30×30 movement, which ensures data-driven, transparent conservation efforts. As One Earth explains, “California has allocated billions of dollars through conservation bonds and budget appropriations to support habitat restoration, wildlife corridors and Indigenous-led conservation projects.”

Chicago

The city has converted all 400+ of its municipal buildings to use renewable energy.

Chicago has also “established long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that guarantee stable electricity rates while supporting renewable energy infrastructure,” continues One Earth. “Moreover, workforce development programs funded through this transition provide training for local residents, ensuring equitable access to green jobs as part of the city’s energy transformation.”

Detroit

Detroit has achieved notice for its approximately 1,400 urban community gardens and farms. “These initiatives have been supported by progressive zoning policies that allow urban farming on vacant land, city-backed land banks that provide affordable access to property and local ordinances promoting community-led agriculture.”

Massachusetts

Massachusetts’ efforts have focused on reducing food waste.

“Since its initial implementation in 2014 and expansion in 2022, the state has increased its annual diversion of food waste from 100,000 tons to 380,000 tons, reducing emissions from food waste by 25%. By 2030, the goal is to divert 780,000 tons per year,” One Earth says. “The state’s success is attributed to clear regulatory requirements, accessible composting infrastructure, and strong enforcement mechanisms, including fines for non-compliance. The integration of food waste reduction into climate policy highlights how waste management reforms can be a key strategy for emissions reduction.”

New Mexico

New Mexico has “committed to an energy transition where we are a net zero carbon emitter by 2045, with a 50% reduction by 2035,” says Andrea Desiree Romero, a member of the New Mexico House of Representatives. “We’re doing a lot on the energy investment side, and we have a huge startup community in the advanced energy space. We have $1 billion in venture capital for new company investments in spaces that help us solve these problems.”

New York

New York has implemented a new law that decrees schools must be built far removed from high-pollution roadways and expanded “the state’s 10-year-old fracking ban to outlaw the process of injecting liquified carbon dioxide to pull gas from the ground,” according to a January 30, 2025, article in The Guardian. “Days after Trump’s election, [New York Governor Kathy] Hochul also abruptly resurrected a plan to enact a toll for driving in congested zones, and … pledged to allocate [$1 billion] to greening the economy.”

Vermont

Vermont passed legislation in 2024 that requires Green Mountain Power, the state’s largest utility, to provide 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2035 and places a 2035 deadline upon smaller utilities to achieve the same sourcing.

“This builds upon Vermont’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which mandates legally binding emission reductions to help the state achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,” One Earth explains. “To meet these targets, Vermont has prioritized investments in local renewable energy projects, including small-scale community solar and wind initiatives that keep energy dollars circulating within the state. Additionally, policies such as Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and tax incentives for residential solar installations have facilitated Vermont’s clean energy transition while ensuring affordability for consumers.”

Anaphite has developed technology that has the potential to make electric vehicle battery manufacturing cheaper and less energy intenstive.

The company was founded in 2018 by chemist Sam Burrow and physicist Alexander Hewitt after the duo met at the University of Bristol.

By 2021 the pair had applied their technology to lithium-ion battery cell electrodes and proven the application of their composites in dry coating feasibility trials with the University of Warwick.

The business has raised millions of pounds since it was established.

The latest cash injection is a combination of £700,000 in grant funding from Innovate UK Investor Partnerships: Clean Energy and Climate Technologies competition, alongside £700,000 of investment from climate-focused venture capital funds Elbow Beach and World Fund.

It is understood Anaphite will use the funding to expand its technology platform and further its commercial capabilities.

Anaphite’s chief executive Joe Stevenson said: “We're thrilled to have secured this grant support from Innovate UK and the matching investment from Elbow Beach, World Fund and other Anaphite investors.

""This enables us to attack one of the toughest technical challenges in dry coating – successfully manufacturing LFP electrodes. Once achieved at scale, it will be enormously valuable to the industry.""

Anaphite's existing DCP technology platform uses proprietary chemical compositing techniques to disperse difficult-to-mix materials such as binders and conductive carbons, attaching them to active material particles.

The company says the approach ""overcomes the limitations"" of other mixing techniques.

Craig Douglas, partner at World Fund, said: “Anaphite’s technology is broadly applicable across next-generation and established battery technologies alike.

""This investment will enable the company to significantly expand its commercial capabilities, accelerating the scale-up of its manufacturing processes and driving down manufacturing costs for the global battery industry.”

Jonathan Pollock, chief executive of Elbow Beach, added: “The future of driving is electric, so scaling up affordable, low-carbon battery manufacturing is essential.

""Anaphite’s technology has the potential to significantly cut both costs and carbon footprint for battery makers and EV manufacturers, and we’re excited to support them as they lead the way in this critical sector.”",https://i2-prod.business-live.co.uk/incoming/article30019175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRIHB_270924-anaphite.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 06:00:14.702484

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms.
Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.
“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.
Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax.","The most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken calls for a new approach to jointly tackle the most pressing environmental issues including climate change and biodiversity loss that threaten over 1 million plant and animal species with extinction.

The U.N. Environment Assembly — which the U.S. government didn’t attend — produced the new report this week by almost 300 scientists from 83 countries.

The issues, which also include land degradation and pollution, are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme’s Global Environment Outlook said.

“You can’t think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,” said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. “You can’t think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.”

They’re “all undermining our economy,” worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven’t made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

“What we’re saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,” Watson said. “It has to be done rapidly now because we’re running out of time.”

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What’s more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn’t involved in the report.

“If we don’t fix climate change, we’re not going to be able to fix these other issues too,” Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded, and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn’t measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren’t the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn’t involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

“We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,” Mann said. “The stakes are simply too great.”

International cooperation falters

Despite the report’s urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He’s promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

“International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,” Watson said, noting that this year’s U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to “move in the direction we needed it to move” with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn’t attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and “said they didn’t agree with anything in the report.”

“Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?” Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she’s confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

“It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we’re gone,” Hayhoe said. “The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.”

In the waning days of Governor Phil Murphy’s tenure, New Jersey officials unveiled an updated Energy Master Plan that calls for 100% clean electricity by 2035 and steep reductions in climate pollution by midcentury. Since 2019, the state has used the first version of the plan as the backbone of its climate strategy, promising reliable, affordable, and clean power.

The blueprint lands at a moment when delivering on all three goals is increasingly in doubt.

While the second Trump administration rolls back federal clean-energy support, PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states, struggles to manage surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.

“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. While not binding, it is the state’s official roadmap to attain its climate goals.

Miller’s office and the state Board of Public Utilities developed the plan with public input and help from outside consultants.

Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage. State modeling envisions total solar capacity climbing to about 22 gigawatts by 2050, which is four times today’s roughly 5 gigawatts of installed solar. On paper, it would be enough to supply nearly all the state’s current households over a year. To get there, the plan assumes adding about 750 megawatts of new solar each year from 2026, roughly double the pace of solar construction in 2024.

The plan’s release follows a governor’s race in which energy costs dominated, and voters chose U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who campaigned on preserving Murphy-era climate targets, over Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican who argued for a slower transition.

“Voters sent a clear message that clean energy is the most cost-effective path forward and the smartest long-term investment,” said Ed Potosnak, head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and a local council member in Franklin Township.

A grid tested by data centers

The plan lands as New Jersey enters what Miller calls the ​“load-growth era.”

For roughly two decades, electricity demand in PJM’s footprint, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, was flat or falling as aging power plants retired and efficiency improved. That trend has flipped because of data centers.

“What we saw in 2024 into ​’25, and I think what we’re going to see for the next 15 years, is a scenario where demand on the electric grid is growing,” Miller said.

For years, New Jersey spent billions subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and thousands of buildings to electrify. Now, Miller said, ​“some of the techniques for greenhouse gas reductions are going to have to kind of meet the moment,” by taking a more proactive role in engaging with PJM or by filling in the dearth in clean energy incentives caused by the Trump administration.

The recent PJM capacity auctions have added billions of dollars in costs for customers across the region. This showed up as a 20% jump in summer electricity bills in New Jersey this year, which became a hot campaign issue during its recent gubernatorial race.

“The wholesale price of electricity is determined by PJM and federal policy, and then also the price of natural gas,” said Frank Felder, an energy economist who has advised regulators. ​“New Jersey can’t do much about that.”

Participating in a fast-track rulemaking process that PJM initiated to address data center–driven demand, outgoing governor Murphy joined other governors in proposing that data center developers bring their own power generators in exchange for quicker permit processing.

PJM seeks to decide which proposals to pursue this month and file them with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year.

Federal headwinds and stalled offshore wind

Layered on top of PJM’s turmoil are decisions coming from Washington.

Experts repeatedly pointed to President Donald Trump’s second-term moves to strip away clean-energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and to impose new tariffs on imported solar panels and wind equipment. They say those steps have raised costs and driven off developers.

Potosnak called it ​“Trump’s clean energy ban” and said the administration’s opposition to offshore wind ​“derailed the best chance we had to get massive amounts of offshore wind going that would have begun lowering our utility rates this year.” Several major Atlantic projects, including those planned off New Jersey’s coast, have been canceled or delayed.

Offshore wind ​“was a big piece of trying to get to 100% clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said. With new contracts unlikely for several years, he warned that New Jersey could be ​“back at basically square one” by the end of the decade.

Even so, Felder and others urged caution against writing off renewables entirely. Robert Mieth, a Rutgers University researcher who studies power systems, noted that offshore wind is well established in Europe and that, with or without U.S. manufacturing, ​“there will be access to competitive and affordable renewable technology from other countries.”

In the meantime, state officials point to progress in areas they can influence more directly.

Miller noted that New Jersey has gone from roughly 20,000 plug-in vehicles in 2018 to about 270,000 today, after lawmakers set clear targets and funded incentives and chargers.

The state’s ​“nation-leading solar program,” he said, is ​“primarily state-incentivized, primarily state-funded,” and it can keep expanding — albeit more slowly now — even as federal tax credits expire.

“The cheapest energy is the energy you don’t have to make,” Potosnak said, citing efficiency programs, rooftop and warehouse solar, and batteries on parking lots that ​“drive down utility costs for families and businesses” while cutting pollution.

A guide, not a mandate

For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.

“The Energy Master Plan does not have the force of law,” Miller said. It has been ​“very informative,” he added, but ​“it is not a legal requirement that we follow it exactly.”

Gov.-elect Sherrill will determine how closely New Jersey hews to the map. Neither she nor her opponent had any role in shaping the modeling, Miller said, and the plan was not written with a particular ​“political future” in mind. Instead, Miller said, the Murphy administration hopes the incoming governor will treat it as ​“a very useful modeling exercise” or a guide.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/NJ-Sherrill-and-Murphy-GettyImages-2250639634.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=7a79690ec63c8cccc205e19d22b29703,N,,2025-12-09 06:59:14.882833

America’s energy future The environmental groups’ moratorium demand represents a pivotal moment that could determine whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a massive environmental burden.","Environmental activists just delivered Congress the most aggressive ultimatum yet against America’s AI revolution.

More than 350 pro-environment organizations from all 50 states coordinated a massive campaign demanding lawmakers immediately halt new AI data center construction or face the wrath of voters everywhere. Coordinated by major groups including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth, this represents the most organized environmental assault on Big Tech’s expansion plans in decades.

The coalition’s letter warns that data center expansion represents “one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation.”

With electricity bills already spiking 21% since 2021—largely driven by data center growth, Food & Water Watch reported—environmental groups demand “a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”

Their math is intriguing: if current construction plans proceed, these facilities could consume as much electricity as 30 million households and water equivalent to 18.5 million homes by 2030.

The numbers

Recent analysis reveals AI’s environmental impact has reached crisis levels that lawmakers can no longer ignore. By 2030, AI data centers could annually produce 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide—equivalent to adding five to 10 million cars to American roadways, Cornell researchers discovered last month. Water consumption would drain up to 1,125 million cubic meters annually, matching the household usage of six to 10 million Americans.

Power requirements for North American data centers nearly doubled from 2,688 megawatts to 5,341 megawatts between late 2022 and 2023, MIT confirmed in January. By 2030, electricity consumption at data centers is projected to surge 133% to 426 terawatt-hours, Pew Research documented two months ago. Some residents near data centers have seen their electricity bills jump 267% compared to five years earlier.

Local communities fight back

The environmental backlash is already reshaping American politics in unexpected ways. A remarkable $64 billion worth of data center projects faced delays or cancellations between May 2024 and March this year due to fierce local opposition. In Virginia, a Democrat successfully flipped a traditionally Republican legislative seat by campaigning specifically against the burden of data centers on local communities.

The opposition crosses unexpected political boundaries. In Michigan, OpenAI’s ambitious $7 billion Stargate project is encountering significant resistance from local communities concerned about farmland conversion.

Minnesota recently passed comprehensive legislation introducing strict oversight over data center energy and water consumption, while grid operators warn that most planned data center construction will occur in regions already at “elevated risk” for reliability issues, energy analysts confirmed three weeks ago.

America’s energy future

The environmental groups’ moratorium demand represents a pivotal moment that could determine whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a massive environmental burden. Current projections show most additional electricity for AI data centers will come from natural gas, requiring a 10% to 20% increase in overall U.S. gas production by 2030, energy researchers warned three weeks ago. The pressure on local grids could trigger winter blackouts similar to Texas’s 2021 disaster that killed an estimated 246 people.

The stakes extend far beyond environmental concerns. Virginia’s primary utility company warned that average ratepayers could see power bills increase 50% over 15 years, primarily due to new data centers, Atlantic Council analysis uncovered five months ago.

As Congress faces this unprecedented environmental ultimatum, the decisions made in coming weeks could reshape both America’s energy infrastructure and the global AI race for decades to come.",https://assets.eweek.com/uploads/2025/12/photo-1732027912131-3a10677b8449.jpeg.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 06:01:09.356077

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,"" James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.""

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,'' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,'' Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,'' she said, adding that the Trump administration ""should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.''",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r1AcF0zq6lMFTkxuV.qD.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/64c43bf30bddf885c382cbccd1a2fcab,N,,2025-12-09 10:00:58.871666

Calgary (Canada) / Geretsried (Germany) - In Geretsried, a commercial closed-loop geothermal system is feeding electricity into the German grid for the first time. With this, Eavor Technologies has reached a milestone and is positioning geothermal direct heat and power generation as a potentially scalable, baseload-capable option in the energy market.

The plant demonstrates the functionality of a closed drilling circuit that harnesses heat from deep rock layers. Investors and European institutions see it as a blueprint for scaling geothermal use. Initial operating data confirm high stability, technical maturity, and progress in drilling technology and system design.

Milestone for International Geothermal Development

With the commissioning of the Eavor-Loop, the Canadian company has been feeding electricity into the German grid since early December. “We are proud to announce the successful delivery of the world’s first electrons generated from closed-loop multilateral wells. With Geretsried now on-stream, we’re more confident than ever that our closed-loop geothermal system, designed for adaptability and suited to the world’s diverse regions, will secure its place as the leading solution for commercial geothermal applications,” said Mark Fitzgerald, President and CEO of Eavor. “We are especially grateful to our project partners for their confidence and early investment, which were instrumental in pushing the first-of-a-kind learning phase and advancing the project maturation,” added Fabricio Cesário, Head of Project Delivery and Operations, Eavor GmbH.

The project operates without natural geothermal water reservoirs and requires neither rock permeability nor reinjection. This significantly reduces subsurface technical complexity while keeping operations largely low-maintenance. Geretsried forms the foundation for a planned rollout across Europe and other markets.

Technology: How the Closed Loop Extracts Heat

The Eavor-Loop functions like a large underground radiator with completely sealed pipes. Two deep vertical wells are connected through horizontal laterals, forming a closed circuit. A working fluid circulates within the system, entirely isolated from the geological environment.

Circulation occurs largely without a pump through the thermosiphon effect: cooler fluid sinks, heats up in deep rock layers, and rises on its own. After about 30 minutes, the startup pump was able to be turned off. The system has also proven to be black-start capable, quickly adjustable, and able to operate in circulation mode without load for months.

The drilling phase was technically challenging: two vertical wells with six horizontally branched sidetracks each (12 total) were connected “toe to toe” underground using the Active Magnetic Ranging Tool (AMR). This created six pairs forming the underground heat exchanger. At 16 kilometers per pair, the wells are among the longest in the world. Accompanying data show a 50% reduction in drilling time per lateral and a tripling of drill-bit run times.

European Institutions Back New Geothermal Options

The commissioning has been met with strong interest from European institutions. EIB Vice-President Nicola Beer described the project as “a European success story in action: The first commercial Eavor-Loop plant shows that geothermal energy can be scaled up to deliver affordable, clean, and reliable heat and power to households and businesses - day and night, in every season. It cuts emissions and strengthens energy security.” The bank is supporting the facility with an InvestEU-backed loan of nearly €45 million. The Canada Growth Fund and Japanese utility CHUBU also view the project as an industrially significant technological leap.

Project partner OMV highlights its suitability for urban-proximate and baseload-capable use. The collected data will inform further development projects that Eavor is planning in Europe and worldwide.

Together, these renewable energy PPAs deliver more than 808 GWh of clean electricity, supporting high-impact suppliers responsible for manufacturing lab consumables, equipment, and materials.
Multi-buyer PPAs help bridge this gap by pooling demand from several pharmaceutical companies and enabling suppliers to access affordable renewable electricity.","As biotech and pharmaceutical companies look for credible ways to reduce their environmental footprint, many are turning their attention beyond internal operations to the suppliers that power laboratory and clinical work. My Green Lab’s newly released 2025 Carbon Impact of Biotech and Pharma Report details a significant step forward: a series of multi-buyer renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs)—long-term contracts that allow organizations to purchase electricity directly from new solar and wind projects.

These agreements represent one of the clearest examples of coordinated climate action across the life sciences. For lab managers, they signal an important shift—one that could influence the carbon intensity of lab consumables, reshape the lab supply chain, and strengthen long-term sustainability expectations for vendors.

New PPAs deliver substantial renewable capacity

Two major renewable energy PPAs are detailed in the report. The first agreement provides 563.7 GWh of renewable electricity each year and is estimated to avoid 393,795 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually. The second PPA supplies an additional 245 GWh of renewable electricity per year and extends clean energy access across North America, Europe, and Asia.

In the life sciences, PPAs serve as a mechanism for companies to lock in long-term renewable power at predictable rates—an approach that helps decarbonize upstream manufacturing for common lab products. Together, these renewable energy PPAs deliver more than 808 GWh of clean electricity, supporting high-impact suppliers responsible for manufacturing lab consumables, equipment, and materials.

Supplier engagement strengthens emissions reductions

Renewable-energy procurement can be challenging for smaller manufacturers that lack the scale to negotiate competitive long-term clean-energy contracts. Multi-buyer PPAs help bridge this gap by pooling demand from several pharmaceutical companies and enabling suppliers to access affordable renewable electricity.

According to the report, more than 750 suppliers have participated in renewable-energy or emissions-reduction initiatives across Energize, Activate, and Sustainable Markets Initiative programs. These collaborations support supplier emissions reductions by offering:

Lower barriers to entering renewable-energy markets

Improved emissions performance

More consistent carbon data

Stronger operational resilience

Implications for labs and procurement teams

As suppliers adopt renewable-energy commitments, lab managers may begin to see:

Lower-carbon product portfolios

More detailed sustainability documentation from vendors

Greater availability of Product Carbon Footprints

Updated supplier scorecards emphasizing emissions metrics

These changes can support more accurate Scope 3 reporting at the lab and institutional levels and improve visibility across the lab supply chain.

Why renewable energy PPAs matter for lab managers

The expansion of renewable energy PPAs across pharma supply chains offers tangible benefits for laboratory operations:

Reduced embedded emissions in equipment and consumables

Clearer sustainability data for purchasing decisions

Better alignment with organizational decarbonization goals

Reduced supply risk as clean-energy incentives evolve

As the sector accelerates its decarbonization efforts, renewable energy PPAs demonstrate a scalable model for supplier emissions reductions—one that additional scientific sectors may soon follow.

The new Charging Calculator flips the script, bringing the same pitch to shoppers before they buy.

The timing is no accident. With the $7,500 federal tax credit gone since September 30, Tesla needs fresh ammunition to close sales. Real-world data has consistently shown EVs beating gas vehicles on running costs, but many buyers still don’t trust the math. This tool puts hard numbers in front of skeptics. Whether it moves the needle in a post-subsidy market remains the real test.

Electric grids worldwide are being transformed by lithium-ion batteries. These large batteries store excess power from solar and wind sources. They then release energy during peak demand, reducing reliance on traditional power plants. This technology has seen rapid growth due to falling costs and increasing renewable energy adoption.

ANTOFAGASTA, CHILE: Lithium-ion batteries, which power everything from cellphones to cars, are increasingly saving electric grids around the world.

Batteries as large as shipping containers are being connected to power lines and installed beside solar panels and wind turbines. They soak up power when it's plentiful and cheap and release it when electricity use soars, helping reduce the need for expensive power plants and lines.

American researchers invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and later showed that the devices could help the electric grid. But for a long time, batteries made little headway because grid managers and utility executives dismissed them as expensive and risky.

One of the first breakthroughs came about 15 years ago when engineers at a U.S. energy company installed one of the first lithium-ion batteries tied to a grid in a desert nearly 9,000 feet above sea level in Chile. Challenging conventional notions of how the electricity system should be run, that team helped prove that batteries could help make electric grids more stable and reliable.

The concept of storing energy was not new. Thomas Edison developed alkaline nickel-iron batteries largely for industry and early electric vehicles. Various companies tried other technologies like sodium sulfur, which have not gained much traction. And some utilities have long pumped water uphill so that later it could be sent back down to generate electricity.

Live Events

But those systems were relatively limited. The kinds of lithium batteries installed in the Atacama Desert in 2009, by comparison, are now being used around the world.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand.

Consider California. In recent years, state officials have often asked residents to use less electricity on hot summer days to prevent power outages. But there have been no such alerts since 2022, largely because batteries have allowed California to use its abundant solar power well into the evening. Over the last seven years, the state added 30 times as much battery storage capacity as it had in 2018.

The rest of the world has also seen impressive growth, according to the International Energy Agency, a multilateral organization in Paris. The boom was made possible by a stunning 90% drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come online. China is by far the world's largest battery manufacturer, but Europe, India and the United States have recently been increasing production, too.

""Batteries are changing the game before our eyes,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said recently.

A bumpy start

The use of batteries on the grid did not come easy.

A Virginia company called AES began testing grid batteries in Indiana, Pennsylvania and California as early as 2008, but U.S. energy suppliers did not use them commercially until two years later. The pace was plodding for a while.

""There wasn't the experience with battery storage,"" said Carla Peterman, a former member of the California Energy Commission and now an executive vice president at Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility. ""It was a bit of a chicken or the egg, where there wasn't enough on there to really say that this could be a big part of the energy system.""

But some Americans clearly saw the benefits of batteries. One of them was Christopher Shelton, an executive at AES, which owns utilities and power plants across the world.

He began to look into lithium-ion batteries when his bosses asked employees to pitch proposals for a ""billion-dollar idea."" Shelton said he thought batteries could reduce the need for power plants that utilities used only when electricity demand climbed to peak levels.

""Why would you build an asset that you weren't going to use more than 5% of the time?"" Shelton said. ""We were saying batteries should be an alternative to peaker plants.""

He first installed battery cells at a nondescript electricity substation outside Indianapolis, a city known for its 500-mile car race. His company later connected one in Norristown, Pennsylvania, at an operations center of the nation's largest grid manager, PJM Interconnection. The Los Angeles area was connected next, followed by a larger battery for the Indianapolis grid.

While his tests were successful, they did not sufficiently impress many American utility executives. The reaction was typical of an industry that prides itself for sticking with what it knows best: large coal, gas and nuclear power plants. Anything else has generally been treated as a threat that may cause blackouts.

""Utilities have long been skeptical of new technologies,"" said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies energy politics and policy. ""They know how to make a widget, which is a giant fossil fuel power plant, so they keep doing that.""

Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade organization, disagrees with that assessment. ""The U.S. energy grid is the world's most important machine, and America's electric companies are quick to pilot and deploy new technologies once they become commercially viable and affordable for customers,"" he said.

But even now, U.S. utilities in many states are reluctant to add batteries. A lot fewer large batteries are being added in the Southeast, for example, than in California and Texas.

Utility executives are not the only ones who are skeptical. So are policymakers and many ordinary Americans.

Some local governments have banned big batteries because of safety concerns. In May and June, a large battery complex in Monterey County, California, was destroyed in a fire that spewed smoke and harmful chemicals.

Despite that disaster, energy experts say many risks have been addressed. The California fire happened in a type of battery that most companies no longer use. And those batteries were installed in a power plant building where the fire easily spread from device to device. Most batteries are installed outdoors to reduce the chances that fires spread.

Testing it on the moon

Not much beside the odd desert fox lives on the desolate plateau in Chile where AES set up its battery project. The site is several hours from the two closest airports, in Calama and Antofagasta.

After landing, visitors have to drive at least four hours to the salt flats of the Atacama Desert, where workers collect lithium -- a key battery ingredient.

The AES camp is another hour away. It sits on a rocky, unpaved path, lined with busted tires. Although temperatures during a late spring and early summer day can reach the 80s, the nights can be near freezing.

""It was like taking the battery and testing it on the moon,"" said Joaquín Meléndez, an engineer who led the AES project there under Shelton.

In the early 2000s, Chile had an energy crisis because Argentina, its main supplier of natural gas, couldn't provide enough of it. That left Chile, which has no domestic fuel sources, with too little energy for its people and its copper, iodine and lithium mines.

Chile was forced to rely on power plants that burned expensive imported coal. But those plants could not be easily turned up or down, and the needs of Chile's mining companies fluctuated a lot.

That was where the batteries came in. While it can take a coal plant about 12 minutes to get going, batteries can discharge power almost instantly. By pairing the two, engineers realized that batteries could deliver the electricity that mines needed while coal plants fired up.

Meléndez worked 16-hour days for six months to connect the first commercialized lithium battery to an electric grid. That device still stands, though most of its tasks have been taken over by newer, more efficient and affordable units.

The project was immediately successful, helping keep the electricity system stable when mining operations caused surges that had previously led to grid failures and outages.

AES executives back in the United States kept close track of what was happening in Chile. And in 2010, the company installed commercial battery systems in New York and Texas. Two years later, AES began adding more batteries in Chile, including next to big solar farms.

Over the last decade, batteries have helped Chile use less coal. Last December, the country got more than 40% of its electricity from solar panels and wind turbines, up from 19% five years earlier, according to Ember Energy Research, a nonprofit. Australia, Britain, China, India and other countries have also been adding lots of renewable energy and batteries.

Shelton said that even he had been surprised by the recent rapid growth of batteries. ""We underpredicted how far the prices would fall.""

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”

“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.

“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.

The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”

But as Josh Siegel writes, Republican leaders will be grappling with a new hurdle on top of those that thumped permitting talks of the past: President Donald Trump’s assault on renewables.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), one of the party’s key permitting negotiators, has advanced a bill that would overhaul the decades-old National Environmental Policy Act without favoring either renewables or fossil fuels.

The SPEED Act is bipartisan, with seven Democrats joining seven Republicans as co-sponsors. But some Democrats want the bill to go further to unravel Trump’s recent attacks on green energy projects, while hard-line Republicans insist on an anti-renewables bent.

The measure is a test of House Speaker Mike Johnson’s ability to navigate the administration’s priorities and manage his slim majority on major legislation with the midterm elections looming.

To win over Democrats, Westerman included an amendment to hamper presidents from canceling energy project permits. That’s a nod to Trump’s efforts to shackle wind and solar projects — and to Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, a move Westerman opposed in 2021.

But that could be a problem for the House Freedom Caucus.

Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) has said he wants the bill to be “amended to protect our communities from the harmful expansion of offshore wind.” And Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who once urged Trump to immediately end clean energy tax credits, has raised concerns about the SPEED Act, saying he doesn’t want to “fast-track any of the wind and solar.”

Some Democrats are also unpersuaded by Westerman’s proposal. They want language that would not just prevent the president from hobbling wind and solar projects in the future but also reverse Trump’s recent decisions attacking renewables.

Westerman told Josh he had consulted the White House about his compromise. But so far, the president has been mum on the SPEED Act publicly.

Former Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana who was involved in previous permitting negotiations, said Westerman had done as well as he could to keep the bill bipartisan.

“You can take a bill and you can write it in a way that only represents the views of the Freedom Caucus,” Graves said. “But we all know exactly what happens when it gets over to the Senate. They will end up shoving something down the House’s throat.”

More permitting fights loom, including a demand from Republicans for soften Clean Water Act rules to ease pipeline approvals.

Democrats will also be looking to boost electricity transmission, because a shift away from fossil fuels would need massive upgrades to the grid.

“I don’t understand how you can call something permitting reform and not deal with the main problem,” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) told Josh. “If we want electrons of all kinds to be flowing and we want prices to go down, we have to deal with the main bottle[neck], which is that we have a transmission and distribution system that is from the Dark Ages.”

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Benjamin Storrow breaks down the increasing volatility of power markets in the U.S.

Power Centers

More power to the president?

A majority of Supreme Court justices appear ready to limit the independence of agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, writes Niina H. Farah.

At oral arguments today in Trump v. Slaughter, the justices weighed whether the president has the authority to fire heads of independent agencies. The case centers on Trump’s decision earlier this year to remove Rebecca Slaughter from her position on the Federal Trade Commission.

The 1935 ruling Humphrey’s Executor v. United States only allows “for cause” removals for heads of such agencies. But the Trump administration is arguing that the president should have authority to remove agency heads who are exercising executive power.

Those arguments seemed to find purchase with the court’s conservative majority. But the court’s liberal wing warned against the risks of increasing presidential power.

Coal continues in ‘reliability pickle’

An older unit at a coal-fired power plant in Colorado is staying open past its planned retirement this year while a newer unit gets repairs, Benjamin Storrow writes.

The move has implications for Colorado’s goal of cutting 50 percent of climate pollution at 2005 levels by 2030. The Comanche Generating Station is one of the state’s biggest climate contributors. State regulators planned to gradually phase out the plant’s three turbines, and the first one closed in 2022.

When regulators approved the request to extend the unit’s life last week, they had harsh words for Xcel Energy, the unit’s largest owner, for failing to outline costs associated with fixing the broken unit.

“We are in the dark about what any of this costs. We are just in a real reliability pickle because once again Unit Three has broken in a catastrophic way,” said Commissioner Megan Gilman.

The mystery of data center water use

States facing drought are starting to worry about data center water use, writes Miranda Willson.

Lawmakers from at least eight states have introduced legislation this year to require data centers to report their water use. The push for transparency has scrambled traditional partisan alliances.

Democratic Govs. Phil Murphy of New Jersey and Gavin Newsom of California vetoed bills requiring data center water use reporting, while Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have authorized local governments to evaluate data center noise, water and land-use impacts.

Data centers gobble up massive amounts of electricity, but their water use is generally less clear and depends on the design of the facility. Federal laws like the Clean Water Act do not regulate water quantity, resulting in a patchwork of state policies for large water users.

The annual tutor-led event brings together professionals from across the country to share strategies that improve tutoring as well as academic coaching and student engagement.

STC’s CLE team helped lead that national conversation with sessions on topics like “Developing a Mistake-Friendly Session,” “From Crisis to Clarity: Planning for Emotional Regulation in Student Sessions,” “Fueling Student Motivation for Long Term Success,” and much more.

Presenters at the conference included Alejandro Benavidez, Josue Arandy, Cristian Hernandez, Emily Jimenez, Vanessa Garza, Brenda Mungia and Karla Ruiz.

CLE Director Lynell Williams, who also sits on the board of 4C as the organization’s technology liaison, said what viewers see on screen is the result of months of careful preparation behind the scenes.

“The CLE has a robust internal process to vet the presentation proposals before they are sent to the national reviewers,” Williams said. “The tutors, Supplemental Instruction (SI) leaders and academic coaches all invest a great deal of time and energy in researching and organizing their topics before submitting a proposal. This dedication shows in the high quality of presentations.”

Williams said two presenters have been nominated by conference organizers for selection as the 2025 “Exemplary Session.” In addition to the presentations, the conference also showcased student creativity. The official Growth, Planning, Success conference logo was designed by Gualberto Voidanova, a student learning assistant at STC.

For SI Leader Vanessa Garza, the conference became both a professional milestone and a personal homecoming. Garza first worked at STC as a student tutor more than a decade ago, before earning an associate degree in Biology from the college, a bachelor’s degree in Biology from the former University of Texas- Pan American and then a master’s degree in Kinesiology from the University of Texas in Austin.

Now returning to the CLE, Garza presented on educational technology tools that tutors, SI leaders and academic coaches can use to encourage collaborative learning in their sessions.

“It felt incredible to reach people at a national level and hopefully make learning more fun and engaging for our students,” Garza said. “Coming back to the Valley, I really felt a drive to give back to my community. Serving students academically is what I would consider my calling.”

Garza’s experience was echoed by Alejandro Benavidez, another Supplemental Instruction leader who recently earned his associate degree in Computer Science from STC and is now pursuing a bachelor’s degree at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. Benavidez’s presentation focused on the realities and challenges of being the only tutor available for certain subjects.

“When I first started here, I faced a lot of unique challenges,” Benavidez said. “Presenting at a national level let me connect with other tutors, share my experience and hear how they overcome similar situations. Exchanging strategies and resources reinforced that I know what I am doing and that I can help my community in the way I want to.”

Also presenting at this year’s presenter lineup were STC Academic Coaches Karla Ruiz and Brenda Mungia supervised by CLE Learning Support Manager Maria Bridwell and CLE Assistant Director Rosario Vazquez.

Ruiz co-presented “From Crisis to Clarity,” a session focused on common emotional challenges students face, including stress, academic pressure, depression and sleep deprivation.

The team shared tools tutors can use to support students experiencing these struggles.

“We never see the same situation twice,” Ruiz said. “Students come with different challenges, and being able to share strategies – especially with tutors who often only meet students briefly – helps everyone better support them.”

Vazquez said the 4C conference has become a signature growth opportunity for CLE staff since STC began participating in the conference in 2021.

The investment advances the company into its commercialization phase as it works to deliver safe, high-performance silicon solid-state batteries built for mobility systems and stationary energy storage.

As part of the funding announcement, Amazon Senior Vice President and Distinguished Engineer James Hamilton will join the company’s board of directors. Blue Current said the additional capital will accelerate efforts to scale its silicon composite battery platform, which the company designed from first principles to improve energy density, shorten charging times, enhance safety, and operate at low pressure without relying on flammable liquid electrolytes.

The company’s platform uses earth-abundant silicon and elastic polymer anodes paired with fully dry electrolytes. Its design approach supports multiple formulations and allows the batteries to be manufactured cost-effectively using widely deployed lithium-ion equipment. Blue Current emphasized that this combination of safety, performance, and manufacturability positions it to support both next-generation electric mobility and grid-scale energy storage.

The company noted that more than a decade of research and development has gone into creating batteries intended to reduce fire risk, increase cycle life, and improve charging speed. With new funding and Amazon’s participation, Blue Current is preparing for the next stage of commercial deployment and aims to address market limitations that have slowed the adoption of solid-state solutions.

Amazon’s participation signals continued interest in advancing domestic battery manufacturing and exploring technologies that can support longer-range electric vehicles and grid storage with improved safety. Blue Current’s headquarters and pilot line facility are located in Hayward, California.

The delegation argues that Indiana’s manufacturing power, military infrastructure, and academic research capabilities make it an ideal location for the expansion of the federal UAS Test Site Program.

Indiana Delegation Unites Behind FAA Test Site Bid

The support letter, signed by every member of Indiana’s congressional delegation including Congresswoman Erin Houchin, emphasizes that Indiana is positioned to help the FAA integrate drones into the national airspace system while advancing American-built drone technology.

Lawmakers highlighted Indiana’s central location, diverse testing environments, and strong state and federal backing as key advantages. They said the state could deliver the “best outcomes for American leadership in drone manufacturing and deployment.”

Their push builds on the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, which authorized two additional UAS test sites beyond the seven that already exist across Alaska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Texas, and Virginia.

Why Indiana Thinks It Can Lead America’s Drone Future

Indiana’s pitch is built on a mix of industrial capability, academic expertise, and military infrastructure.

The state already hosts the Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, a major hub where the military tests advanced UAS and counter-UAS technology. In 2025, the site demonstrated a system capable of neutralizing a swarm of forty-nine drones with a single electromagnetic pulse, a milestone in U.S. counter-drone defense.

Muscatatuck Urban Training Center offers additional restricted airspace for complex testing scenarios, while NSWC Crane continues to expand its role in counter-UAS development.

Purdue University brings deep academic strength to the proposal with the nation’s first university-owned airport, the world’s largest indoor motion-capture facility, and research programs dedicated to drone safety and airspace integration.

The Applied Research Institute, one of the state’s major consortium managers, supports projects that link industry, defense, and academia. Its involvement is expected to help coordinate large-scale drone R&D and manufacturing across Indiana.

At the state level, Governor Mike Braun’s recent executive order created the Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force.

The task force is developing a statewide strategy to strengthen drone manufacturing, improve public-safety drone operations, establish new aerial test corridors, and expand counter-UAS capabilities. Senator Young collaborated closely on the initiative and says it positions Indiana to match federal priorities.

What an FAA Test Site Would Mean for Hoosiers and the U.S.

If Indiana is selected, the state would become a central hub for drone research, testing, and manufacturing at a time when the U.S. is seeking to reduce its dependence on foreign-made drones.

Lawmakers argue that Indiana could help restore American drone dominance by supporting everything from defense applications to agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and public-safety operations.

The FAA would gain a new partner capable of testing detect-and-avoid systems, command-and-control links, beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations, airworthiness standards, and urban air-mobility technologies. Indiana universities and manufacturers would gain access to federal research grants, experimental airworthiness approvals, and expanded testing infrastructure.

The state also plans to create an aerial test corridor connecting Camp Atterbury, Muscatatuck, and NSWC Crane. New training pipelines would prepare Hoosiers for drone engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, and public-safety operations, supporting a share of the North American drone market, which could reach fifty-nine billion dollars by 2030.

Supporters say the effort aligns with President Trump’s executive orders on restoring American drone leadership and strengthening domestic airspace security. They argue that Indiana’s manufacturing workforce, military assets, and universities position the state to scale drone production and deliver new technology across the country.

DroneXL’s Take

Indiana is setting itself up as a serious contender for one of the two new FAA test sites. The combination of manufacturing strength, military testing ranges, and academic capability gives the state a compelling case.

If approved, the site could accelerate America’s move away from foreign-built drones and position the Midwest as a new center for U.S. drone innovation.

Offshore wind has been a crucial part of the Northeastern states’ plans to transition to renewables, due to their geography and the plentiful wind in the winter.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote that Trump’s executive order banning leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms is “arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.”

Attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, DC, filed a lawsuit in May against the memorandum halting federal approvals of wind energy development, which was supported by industry and public interest groups.

The Attorneys general claimed that the halt “harms the States’ efforts to secure reliable, diversified, and affordable sources of energy to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity; their billions of dollars in investments in supply chains, workforce development, and wind-industry-related infrastructure, including transmission upgrades; and their statutory- and policy-based efforts to protect public health and welfare from harmful air pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions.”

Because of Trump’s ban, at least seven offshore wind farms in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have been paused, as well as several others at earlier stages of development. Offshore wind has been a crucial part of the Northeastern states’ plans to transition to renewables, due to their geography and the plentiful wind in the winter. The region also heavily relies on natural gas, which is subject to price fluctuations.

Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel, US Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund, said, “We should not be kneecapping America’s largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity. Striking down this unlawful ban gives relief to the communities and workers who need affordable power, local investment and jobs from wind projects that have been stuck in limbo.”

As a result of the Trump administration’s “arbitrary” policies, BloombergNEF reduced its forecast of new offshore wind power coming online by 2035 by 56%. And while the ruling is good news for the wind industry, it doesn’t mean the federal government is required to approve projects. And let’s face it: Foreign renewable companies aren’t exactly going to come running back to the US to do business. (Just today, for example, Denmark’s Eurowind Energy announced it’s shutting its US office, citing “political uncertainty.”) But at least offshore wind is no longer banned.

Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said, “We thank the Attorneys General and the Alliance for Clean Energy New York for taking this case forward to protect American business interests against the politicization of our energy sector.”

National research effort to build Australia’s sovereign clean energy future

The University of Wollongong (UOW) will lead a new Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Renewable Fuels, a landmark national collaboration that will position Australia as a global leader in the clean energy transition.

The Centre will bring together world-class researchers from seven Australian universities with 16 industry and international partners to develop next-generation renewable fuel technologies and build Australia’s clean energy production capability.

Led by ARC Industry Laureate Distinguished Professor Gerry Swiegers (pictured above), the Centre will accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy powered by renewables including green hydrogen, green ammonia and green methanol.

“Our vision is to make Australia a world leader in renewable fuels, driving our transition from a major exporter of fossil fuels to the world’s leading exporter of renewable energy. This Centre will deliver the technologies needed to achieve that while training a new generation of researchers and engineers,” Professor Swiegers said.

The $72 million initiative will unite expertise in chemical and materials engineering, electrochemistry and energy systems to design and scale technologies for producing and processing renewable fuels. Economists, social scientists and community and policy experts will develop a roadmap for integrating the technology into industry and the Australian economy.

Its three research themes – Make It, Process It and Integrate It – will tackle the challenge from every angle, from large-scale production and processing to economic competitiveness, safety and community engagement to policy and regulation.

“Our research will underpin new industries and jobs, strengthen national energy independence and decarbonise sectors that cannot easily be electrified, such as steelmaking, shipping and aviation. It will enable Australia to export renewable fuels and green products, ensuring prosperity while reducing emissions,” Professor Swiegers said.

Judge Patti B. Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts wrote that the president’s sweeping executive order, which halted all leasing of public lands and waters for new wind projects, was “arbitrary and capricious,” violating federal law.

Judge Saris, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said the Interior Department had not provided a “reasoned explanation” of its decision to stop approving wind projects, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Instead, she said, the “agency defendants candidly concede that the sole factor they considered in deciding to stop issuing permits was the president’s direction to do so.”

Mr. Trump, a longtime critic of wind power, issued the executive order on his first day back in office in January. At the time, states like Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York had been planning to build more than a dozen large wind farms in the Atlantic Ocean to meet their renewable energy goals.

The order effectively put a stop to many of those efforts. At the moment, one offshore wind farm has been completed and five more are under construction in U.S. coastal waters. But developers have been unable to receive permits for additional wind farms, and some planned projects have been canceled altogether.

The directive also stymied wind farms on federal land. In particular, it prohibited the development of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, a large wind farm in Idaho that the Biden administration had approved.

Led by New York, a coalition of 17 states and the District of Columbia challenged the executive order in court in May. They were joined by the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Albany, N.Y.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, said in a statement that the decision was “a major victory for our state and the entire region” that would protect “thousands of good-paying jobs” supporting the offshore wind sector.

Asked about the ruling, Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an email that the Biden administration had given offshore wind projects “unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.” She said that Mr. Trump’s executive order, had it remained in effect, would have spurred federal agencies to study whether offshore wind projects were raising energy costs for American families.

Matthew Nies, a spokesman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on whether the agency would appeal the ruling.

But even if the decision withstands a challenge, it could have a limited impact, according to a research note by analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a consulting firm. That’s because the courts typically cannot compel federal agencies to approve new projects. Many wind developers could also be reluctant to submit additional projects for federal permits under Mr. Trump, the analysts wrote.

In addition to the freeze on new permits for wind farms, the Trump administration has sought to revoke permits that were issued by the Biden administration for wind farms off Maryland and Massachusetts. It has also attempted to halt construction of two wind farms that were already partly built, including Empire Wind off Long Island and Revolution Wind off Rhode Island.

Those efforts have also faced pushback from the courts: In September, a federal judge issued a preliminary ruling that construction could restart at Revolution Wind, saying that the administration’s stop-work order threatened “irreparable harm” to its developer. (The Trump administration has also allowed work at Empire Wind to restart after negotiations with Ms. Hochul.)

Mr. Trump has disparaged wind power ever since he failed 14 years ago to stop an offshore wind farm visible from one of his golf courses in Scotland. He has called wind turbines ugly, expensive and inefficient. He railed against renewable energy during his presidential campaign last year, when he also promised oil and gas executives that he would make policy changes that would help their industry, such as rolling back environmental rules.

In September, the White House took the extraordinary step of instructing a half-dozen agencies to draft plans to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry as it intensified its attack on wind energy.

U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston sided with a group of 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia in finding that agencies had failed to sufficiently explain why they had indefinitely paused all federal approvals of wind-energy projects.

Saris, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said an indefinite halt on issuing or denying all authorizations related to wind projects violates a statutory requirement that agencies proceed to conclude matters presented to them ""within a reasonable time.""

The Departments of the Interior and Commerce, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, had been implementing a directive Trump made on his first day back in office to halt offshore wind lease sales and stop issuing permits, leases and loans for both onshore and offshore wind projects.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat whose state led the legal challenge, called the ruling ""a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis"" in a social media post.

Interior Department and White House officials were not immediately available for comment.

An offshore wind energy trade group welcomed the ruling.

""Overturning the unlawful blanket halt to offshore wind permitting activities is needed to achieve our nation's energy and economic priorities of bringing more power online quickly, improving grid reliability, and driving billions of new American steel manufacturing and shipbuilding investments,"" Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock said in a statement.

Trump has sought to boost government support for fossil fuels and maximize output in the United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, after campaigning for the presidency on the refrain of ""drill, baby, drill.""

The states, led by New York, sued in May, after the Interior Department ordered Norway's Equinor to halt construction on its Empire Wind offshore wind project off the coast of New York. While the administration allowed work on Empire Wind to resume, the states say the broader pause on permitting and leasing continues to have harmful economic effects.

The states said the agencies implementing Trump's order never explained why they abruptly changed a longstanding policy supporting wind energy development. The agencies also departed from the government's findings that wind projects can proceed with minimal adverse environmental impacts, the states said.

Saris agreed, saying the policy ""constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies' issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects."" She said the agencies never provided a reasoned explanation for adopting the change.

Zoox, the robotaxi startup owned by Amazon, has expanded a bit recently, and it is ready to scale up enough that it has secured an EV battery supplier for more EV production.

Starting in early 2026, Zoox will be receiving batteries from Panasonic Energy. It will be using 2170 cylindrical batteries from the Japanese battery producer that was once Tesla’s exclusive battery supplier (and still supplies some of Tesla’s batteries).

The cells will initially come from Japan, but the plan is to eventually produce them in Kansas. Note that while the Trump administration has killed all of the EV subsidies for consumers, it has not (yet) touched the battery production tax credits Democrats and President Joe Biden passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Those include tax credits for producing battery cells as well as battery packs (and also battery mineral mining and processing if a company engages in those activities in the USA).

Note that Zoox recently started operating robotaxis in San Francisco, joining Waymo as the second robotaxi operator in The Golden City (unless you also count Cruise, which used to operate robotaxis there but no longer does).

The executive order had brought the nearly completed Revolution Wind project—one of the largest offshore wind initiatives in the country—to a standstill, threatening jobs, billions in investment and regional energy targets.

Trump has assailed wind farms and renewable energy sources in recent comments, while promoting reopening mines and other energy sources in the U.S.

The court vacated the wind order on the basis that it was unlawful.

Why It Matters

The federal ruling marks a pivotal moment for the U.S. renewable energy landscape. With electricity demand climbing and state governments racing to meet climate goals, the court’s decision not only preserves critical momentum for renewable energy but also signals potential limits on executive power to disrupt industry progress based on uncertain or unsubstantiated grounds.

What To Know

U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris on Monday ruled that the executive order issued by Trump in August was unconstitutional, opening the door for Revolution Wind and other offshore energy projects to move forward.

The decision came after U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth issued a preliminary injunction in September against the Trump administration's stop-work order for the nearly $6 billion Revolution Wind project—a joint effort by Danish energy company Orsted and partners BlackRock and Skyborn Renewables.

The project had been halted since August by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), which cited national security concerns without specifying details, PBS reported.

Lamberth found that the administration's action caused ""irreparable harm"" to the plaintiffs, with each day of delay costing $2.3 million and threatening the whole project's viability due to inflexible construction deadlines and limited vessel availability.

He described the government's justification for the halt as ""the height of arbitrary and capricious"" and noted that the shutdown could endanger over 1,000 union jobs, Engineering News-Record reported in September.

The Revolution Wind project, set to power up to 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, is intended to deliver approximately 2.5 percent of regional energy needs, splitting electricity between the two states. At the time of the halt, about 70 percent of turbines had been installed, and developers had invested or committed about $5 billion.

Trump has long voiced opposition to wind power, describing wind turbines as unsightly, noisy and environmentally harmful in public statements and on the campaign trail.

He has repeatedly criticized offshore wind developments, claiming they drove up energy costs, killed wildlife and caused other environmental issues—a stance at odds with the Biden administration’s earlier emphasis on renewables.

Trump used his position to pause construction on multiple wind projects and attempted to revoke or freeze federal funding and permits for the sector, positioning fossil fuels as the preferred energy source for the U.S.

What People Are Saying

Saris, in the court decision Monday: ""Given that the Wind Order constitutes a change of course from decades of agencies’ issuing (or denying) permits related to wind energy projects, the Agency Defendants were required, at minimum, to “provide a reasoned explanation for the change” and to “display awareness that [they were] changing position.”

Trump, on Truth Social in August: ""Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS.""

Trump, at a July meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland: ""Wind is the most expensive form of energy. And it destroys the beauty of your fields and your plains and your waterways. And look, look out there—there's no windmills. But if you look in another direction, you see windmills. If, when we go to Aberdeen, you'll see some of the ugliest windmills you've ever seen. They're the height of a 50-story building. And you can take a thousand times more energy out of a hole in the ground ... It's called oil and gas.""

What Happens Next

Revolution Wind partners aim to resume construction immediately to meet their timeline and avoid additional costs. The U.S. Interior Department and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management may still appeal Saris' ruling, which would move the dispute to the federal appellate court.

Despite possible new legal challenges, the court decision represents a major, if temporary, victory for wind developers, labor unions and states pursuing renewable energy jobs and targets.

Back in the 60s, electricity demand grew 7%, 8%, 10% a year, almost through the whole decade.
What solutions do they have to not only maintain their climate goals, but also to meet this demand for power?
“We have had periods when electricity generation grew pretty fast.
So by the time we get out to the point where we have really binding constraints on our ability to meet new energy demand, we’re going to have new options available.","Five years ago, Virginia passed a law that requires 100% renewable energy on the grid by 2050.

But Virginia is also home to more data centers than anywhere else in the country, and those new buildings require a whole lot of power.

“All through the 2000s, electricity demand in the state hardly grew at all,” said William Shobe, professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. “And then it really took off.”

5 questions with William Shobe

Are you able to quantify just how much the electricity demand has increased in the five years since the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed?

“We’re tracking it pretty closely. For the last couple of years, data center demand by itself has been growing 25% to 30% a year, and data center electricity use in the state is now bigger than all of our industrial demand, and it’s closing in on residential demand. In the next year or so, data center electricity use in Virginia will pass all use of electricity in homes around the state. So it’s growing pretty fast. It’s not unprecedented. We had growth like this back in the [1960s]. Back in the 60s, electricity demand grew 7%, 8%, 10% a year, almost through the whole decade. But it hasn’t been like that for a long time.”

Some people are calling Virginia the data center capital of the world. Is it really that much? What’s driving all this interest in this new infrastructure in Virginia?

“It really is that much. Part of it has to do with the history of how the internet started. It was a very good place for data centers to connect up to the internet. And I don’t think anybody really expects that to slow down anytime soon.”

With the cost of power going up, this is an issue that’s evolving politically. The incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger campaigned on energy affordability. Now, Democrats control the state government. What solutions do they have to not only maintain their climate goals, but also to meet this demand for power?

“We have had periods when electricity generation grew pretty fast. So that’s not unprecedented by itself, trying to do it without causing a lot of damage to the environment and a lot of health effects because of the generation. The emissions from the generation is the new challenge because we’d like to have the added generation to support the data centers, but without all the health effects and environmental effects of those data centers.

“The modeling we’ve done indicates we can get there. It’s possible to do, but we just have to give the right incentives for generating clean energy and expanding the supply without the emissions that used to go along with the expanded supply.”

Do you think there’s any way to meet that demand without more natural gas?

“It depends on whether you’re talking about the short run or the long run, because sales of electricity have been going up so fast. It may be that we need to expand the use of natural gas in the short run, but Virginia generates almost 10% of its electricity from solar energy now, and that percentage is growing.

“From year to year, we’re adding quite a lot of generation. Next year, we have a big new wind farm that’s going to be coming online, and we have a pretty strong offshore wind resource that we can tap. Plus, there are plans to add new types of nuclear generation to the mix. The answer to your question is that, in the longer run, it does seem to be possible. We just have to have the right incentives in place.”

When you look at this broadly across the country, what do you think it means for efforts to slow down climate change now that the cost of energy is becoming such a major political issue?

“In Virginia, non-emitting energy resources like solar, for example, that’s our cheapest new source of energy. So if we were just picking new sources of energy along that cost continuum, we want to build plenty more of that solar.

“Now we need a mix of different types of generation. We need the intermittent renewables; we need some base load power. But the development of new technologies, especially new nuclear, and people are talking about developing directional drilling technology that gives us the ability to tap geothermal power. In the short run, we have good technologies we can use in the longer run. There are new sources coming along that can substitute for what we’ve been using.

“We have the development of a fusion energy power plant in central Virginia, a proposed one. So by the time we get out to the point where we have really binding constraints on our ability to meet new energy demand, we’re going to have new options available. So I think it’s really partly a matter of making sure that we’re open to those new technologies as they become available, and we’re ready to incorporate them in our energy mix.”

Why it matters: The January memo is among the most direct of the Trump administration's directives or policies hindering renewable power — but it's not the only one.

Trump officials have been especially aggressive in targeting offshore wind projects, including ones already approved or even under construction.

Driving the news: Judge Patti Saris, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, ruled Monday that Trump's Jan. 20 order is ""arbitrary and capricious"" under administrative law.

The ruling came in a case brought by New York and other states, and the nonprofit Alliance For Clean Energy New York.

Saris, a Clinton-era appointee, found that federal agencies did not provide a ""reasoned explanation"" for their actions under the order.

While projects planned for federal lands and waters are most directly affected, onshore projects on private lands also rely on various forms of federal approvals.

Yes, but: The effects of the judge's ruling are unclear as federal officials rely on several overlapping orders and agency policies to justify restrictions on renewables.

ClearView Energy Partners said in a note last month that if Saris ruled against the administration, it ""could reject any pending permits and/or pursue a de facto pause of project reviews and lease sales since the courts cannot 'force' agencies to issue permits.""

What they're saying: ""Striking down this unlawful ban gives relief to the communities and workers who need affordable power, local investment and jobs from wind projects that have been stuck in limbo,"" Environmental Defense Fund attorney Ted Kelly, whose group participated in the case.

Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.

Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell hailed the ruling as a victory for green jobs and renewable energy.

“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell said in a statement.

“This critical victory also preserves well-paying green jobs and access to reliable, affordable energy that will help Massachusetts meet our clean energy and climate goals,″ she added.

The coalition that opposed Trump's order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.

The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.

A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.

Wind is the United States' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association. The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C.

The Interior Department and the White House didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, but the White House previously accused the Democratic attorneys general of using lawfare to stop the president’s energy agenda.

Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation's electric grid.

Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,'' she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”

Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.

“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,'' Kennedy said.

The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,'' she said, adding that the Trump administration ""should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.''",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/4ffd6e7d-e13f-4ba8-8df5-e858218c9d63/20251209T001504/4ffd6e7d-e13f-4ba8-8df5-e858218c9d63.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 20:00:18.511902

Rob Moore is the principal from Scioto Analysis – a group that studied the impact of the way the state is handing out energy permits.

“You have economic growth where we’re trying to make sure that we have enough energy to be able to support the needs that are happening in Ohio,” Moore said. “We recommended that the chamber and business leaders be talking to the legislature and making sure that there are restrictions on how long the process can be.”

The study found the faster the process – the better, because the longer they take, the more likely those projects will fall through.

The study is making several recommendations, including expediting public hearings and standardizing the timeline for their entire process.

Steve Stivers, the CEO of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce – the group that requested the study – said some neighboring states have already been affected.

“Our goal is to make sure that Ohio can quickly and efficiently approve safe projects that will make sure that we can get energy online faster so that we can live the American dream and have an economic miracle here in Ohio,” Stivers said. “Indiana and the MISO region actually had some rolling blackouts about a year ago as a result of too much demand for electricity and not enough supply.”

Congressman Bob Latta (R – Ohio 5th district) said getting energy from one point to the other is a global issue.

This is why Latta said Congress is considering more than a dozen bills related to energy.

“Because our competitors, as I said, the communist Chinese, they’re moving forward and they’re putting the power on,” Latta said. “And again, if you don’t have the power and the grid security and the modernization of the grid out there, you’re falling way behind.”

This study comes as AEP is requesting to increase its rate. A request that company officials said is needed because of the high demand for energy.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is holding hearings regarding that request this week.

The challenge was brought by Attorneys General from 17 states and Washington, D.C., and supported by industry and public interest groups, including Environmental Defense Fund.

In their challenge, the Attorneys General claimed that the halt on federal permitting approvals “[creates] an existential threat to the wind industry,” and could erase nearly $100 billion in investments and cost 40,000 jobs if left in place throughout the President’s term.

“For nearly a year, the Trump administration has recklessly obstructed the build-out of clean, affordable power for millions of Americans, just as the country’s need for electricity is surging,” said Ted Kelly, Director and Lead Counsel, U.S. Clean Energy at Environmental Defense Fund.

“Electricity prices are climbing, and our grid is facing rising demand from data centers, industry and homes. Wind, solar and battery storage – when allowed to move forward – offer the most affordable ways to get more reliable power onto the grid.

“We should not be kneecapping America’s largest source of renewable power, especially when we need more cheap, homegrown electricity.

EPA “confesses error,” urges court to vacate Soot Rule. In a motion filed on November 24 in Commonwealth of Kentucky et al. v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency et al., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ended its defense of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5, commonly called the Soot Rule, and urged the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit to vacate it. In essence, the agency is siding with the plaintiffs in the case, a coalition of business associations and the Attorneys General from 25 Republican-led states who argue that the rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities, and consumers and could hamper the construction of new factories. The rule was finalized in February 2024 and put in place tougher limits on emissions of fine particulates. The agency’s November 24, 2025 motion stated that the rule was finalized “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and that the “EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule.” Eliminating the rule would revert the fine-particulate standard to levels set in 2012.

One-year tariff exclusions extended to additional products. On November 26, certain industrial and medical products manufactured in China received a one-year extension of tariff exclusions as part of the November 1 US-China trade agreement between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. The renewed exclusions affect 14 categories of solar manufacturing equipment, as well as 164 diverse categories, such as automotive air compressors, printed circuit boards, pump components, and electric motors. Tariffs on those products had been extended several times this year and would have expired on November 29.

FDA withdraws proposed rule requiring cosmetics makers to test talc for asbestos. On November 26, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew a proposed rule that would have required manufacturers of talc-containing cosmetic products to test their products – or the talc components of those products – for asbestos, and to maintain records showing their compliance with the rule. An FDA spokesperson told The New York Times that the agency intends to submit a new, more comprehensive proposed rule, but did not provide further details. Talc is widely used in many industrials processes – for instance, to reduce friction and improve ink adhesion in paper manufacturing – but, with the FDA’s move, attention is turning to its use in products intended for human ingestion, such as pharmaceuticals, candies, dried beans and fruits, and dietary supplements. Starting in 2027, the European Union will ban all uses of talc in cosmetics under the Cosmetics Regulation. The United Kingdom is exploring the possibility of a similar ban.

CBP forced labor enforcement continues. US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has issued its fifth Withhold Release Order (WRO) for 2025, directing the detention of garments, apparel, and textiles manufactured in Mauritius by Firemount Group Ltd., based on information that reasonably indicates the use of forced labor in violation of 19 U.S.C. § 1307. WROs are a powerful tool that can immediately disrupt shipments and merchandising plans, with downstream impacts on inventory, retail operations, and brand commitments. Currently, CBP is overseeing 54 WROs and nine Findings under § 1307.

Eleview settlement highlights US enforcement of export control rules on Russia. A freight forwarding business based in Virginia, as well as its owner, chief executive officer, and an employee, have pled guilty to conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act over schemes to transship more than USD6 million worth of sensitive United States technology to Russia through third countries and to provide false information on export control documentation submitted to the US government. The outcome underscores the US government’s intent to investigate conduct that threatens US national security and economic interests while also serving as a case study in cargo risk detection and control.

Another legal challenge for NESE pipeline. In mid-November, a coalition of environmental groups asked the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation's November 7 decision that granted a crucial water quality certificate for the Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline project. The 37-mile NESE pipeline would route gas from Pennsylvania through New Jersey and New York, passing in part beneath the ocean floor near Staten Island to deliver natural gas to 2.3 million New York City households. The controversial project has faced years of permit rejections from both New Jersey and New York, and was cancelled by its developer, the Williams Companies, before New York Governor Kathy Hochul supported it earlier this year. In a statement on November 7, Governor Hochul stated that the pipeline is one aspect of New York's ""all-of-the-above approach"" and pointed to the “continued commitment to renewables and nuclear power to ensure grid reliability and affordability.” The new lawsuit follows earlier legal challenges brought by the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC): one charging that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission improperly reissued a certificate for the pipeline in September and a second disputing both New York and New Jersey’s permit approvals in federal court. Last month, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill expressed skepticism about the value of the NESE project, stating that it “does nothing to lower electric bills for New Jersey residents.” Separately, the Williams Companies have withdrawn the water permit application for the Constitution Pipeline, a USD1 billion underwater project intended to move natural gas from Pennsylvania to Albany, New York for routing via extant pipelines to New England.

Germany calls on EU to soften the 2035 internal-combustion engine phaseout. In a November 28 letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz asked that the European Union (EU) ease its 2035 deadline for registering new internal-combustion vehicles, arguing for “a reconciliation of competitiveness and climate action” and warning of risks to Germany’s auto industry. The letter is the latest step in a broader push by the European auto industry and its supporters for greater flexibility in ICE reductions and deadlines. Earlier this year, European automakers urged the EU to make allowance for internal combustion engines running on CO2 neutral fuels; in September the EU fast tracked a review of the policy, with details due December 10. On November 26, EU Executive Vice President Stephane Sejourne said the coming update will bring greater “flexibility” to European automakers, adding that “Europe is ready to activate all levers to make the European automotive industry successful.”

Russia turned away from UN shipping council. On November 28, for the third straight year, Russia did not receive enough votes to rejoin the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent pollution from ships. One hundred thirteen votes are needed to join the Council; Russia received 47. The IMO election results, Reuters Maritime observed, reflect the “continued global stance against Russian maritime practices.” Norway, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, opponents of Russia’s candidacy, all pointed to concerns about Russia’s so-called shadow fleet – oil tankers often sailing under flags of convenience to circumvent economic sanctions.

FDRE marks an important shift in India’s clean energy procurement.
The report stresses that FDRE is not meant to replace all other clean energy solutions.
Beyond Energy Costs: Health, climate, and jobs The report also highlights that comparing FDRE and coal solely on energy costs ignores coal’s full societal costs.
Our current work is anchored in the grand challenges of our time, namely, Clean Energy Transition, Clean Air for All, and Sustainable and Secure Future for All.","December 9, 2025, New Delhi—India can secure reliable, round-the-clock clean power at costs competitive with new thermal plants by 2030 under realistic market conditions, with the possibility of achieving cost parity as early as 2025 under more favourable circumstances, a new report found.

The study, Budgeting for Net Zero: Powering India’s Reliable Clean Energy Future by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy, finds that firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE)—hybrid projects combining solar, wind, and battery storage—can match or undercut the cost of new thermal power plants when developers are able to monetize both a portion of surplus electricity generated by oversized renewable sources and additional storage capacity.

FDRE projects install slightly more renewable and storage capacity than required for their contracted supply; selling this surplus power plays a critical role in lowering overall costs. FDRE—one of several types of tenders for firm clean energy—is already much cheaper than new coal when the full social costs of thermal power plants are considered.

Without accounting for social costs, the study identifies three cost-parity timelines, depending on how much surplus power developers can sell into the market:

2025 when 100% of surplus power is monetized,

2030 when 50% of surplus power is monetized, and

2047 when only 30% of surplus power is monetized.

“Firm and dispatchable renewables are not just a clean alternative—they are an increasingly competitive source of reliable power. With thoughtful tender design and market reforms, India can tap into FDRE to meet rising electricity demand, cut long-term costs, and build a power system that is both resilient and future-ready,” said Sunil Mani, policy advisor at IISD.

The study examines when and under what conditions FDRE can compete with new thermal, whether government support is needed to accelerate deployment, and the macroeconomic impacts of scaling FDRE. It also evaluates how tender design, developer strategies, and electricity market reforms influence FDRE’s affordability.

FDRE marks an important shift in India’s clean energy procurement. Instead of simply adding variable renewable energy to the grid, FDRE tenders require developers to supply clean electricity at specific, often peak hours aligned with distribution companies’ (discoms’) demand patterns. This is becoming increasingly relevant as India’s power needs rise and discoms face higher costs from managing variability through short-term markets and limited access to flexible supply. FDRE offers one pathway to scale renewables while maintaining reliability and cost predictability for both discoms and consumers.

Although early FDRE tenders have faced challenges—such as uncertainty around the optimal renewable–storage mix and the monetization of surplus power—9.7 GW of FDRE capacity is already under construction, and bid prices closely match the cost projections in the study.

The report stresses that FDRE is not meant to replace all other clean energy solutions. Because FDRE guarantees firm delivery, it is naturally more expensive than standalone solar, wind, or storage when round-the-clock supply is not required. The authors of the report highlight that a balanced approach—deploying FDRE where demand profiles justify it and expanding lower-cost clean energy and storage elsewhere—will deliver the most efficient outcomes for India’s evolving power system.

“FDRE can play an important role alongside standalone renewables, storage, and smarter grid management to support India’s clean energy transition,” says Dr Anasuya Gangopadhyay, senior associate in the Climate Change Mitigation team at CSTEP.

Beyond Energy Costs: Health, climate, and jobs

The report also highlights that comparing FDRE and coal solely on energy costs ignores coal’s full societal costs. When air pollution and climate damages are included, the effective cost of new pithead coal rises from INR 4.65/kWh to INR 13.19/kWh, making FDRE immediately cheaper in all scenarios.

In addition, FDRE provides energy security advantages: it reduces exposure to fossil fuel price volatility and can be deployed in 2–2.5 years, compared to 5–7 years for new coal plants.

Beyond costs, scaling FDRE would raise India’s GDP by 1.8% by 2050, create 64,000 net new jobs, and reduce public health costs linked to air pollution while strengthening energy security by lowering dependence on fuel imports.

The study identifies several policy options to strengthen FDRE tender design and create market conditions that support deployment, including more flexible demand-fulfilment ratios, capacity payments for storage, improved penalty structures, expanded revenue opportunities, and enhanced resource adequacy planning at the state level.

The company is also playing a role in the nation’s clean energy transition.

Harder Mechanical is leading critical projects in battery recycling and lithium mining. “These efforts not only support sustainability goals but also strengthen the domestic supply of key materials for electric vehicles, making this both a profitable and nationally strategic market for us,” says Harder.

The company is also growing its presence in the data center sector. “These projects require speed, precision and innovation, areas where Harder Mechanical’s off-site manufacturing (OSM) capabilities give us a major advantage,” says Harder.

“These markets are hot because they sit at the intersection of technology, energy and sustainability, the three most transformative forces shaping modern industry,” he says. “Harder’s combination of scale, technical depth and advanced [offsite manufacturing] fabrication allows us to meet the high demands of these projects safely, efficiently and with industry-leading quality.”

A key driver of efficiency and success for the firm has been moving more fabrication and modular work to its offsite manufacturing shop. This strategy has improved safety, productivity and cost control while allowing field crews to focus on higher-value tasks.

“Harder Mechanical’s focus on continuous improvement—from upgrading safety policies, adopting Revit companywide and achieving ISO 9000 certification across all fab shops—shows a company committed to evolving and excelling,” says Harder.

Harder was part of the team on the Portland Airport’s Terminal Core project that redeveloped the main terminal.

Harder has been a key part of the Portland International Airport’s $2.15 billion, 860,000-sq-ft Terminal Core Redevelopment (TCORE) project, which is currently under construction and slated to complete in 2026. As a key trade partner on this transformative effort, Harder is working on security screening areas, baggage handling systems, office spaces and presecurity concessions, all while keeping airport operations running smoothly.

To meet the project’s ambitious schedule and minimize disruptions, Harder implemented an innovative modular construction strategy, designing and building 41 modular pipe racks off site—21 dedicated to utility systems and 20 to hydronic systems. This approach maximized prefabrication opportunities, enhancing both efficiency and worker safety in one of the most complex active airport construction environments in the Pacific Northwest.

“Harder Mechanical’s collaboration during the pre-construction phase of the Portland Airport expansion project was instrumental in shaping a cost-effective and constructible design,” says Bob McGinnis, senior preconstruction director at Skanska USA Building. “Their proactive approach to budgeting, value engineering and system coordination ensured seamless integration of complex mechanical solutions for this landmark project.”

Buffon Decker, senior project manager for Hoffman Skanska JV, says Harder was integral to the success of the project.

“They worked closely with the JV and the other trade partners in the initial planning and were responsive and quick with solutions when we hit the inevitable challenges on such a complex project,” Decker says. “They helped us to make sure that the airport provided the passenger experience and comfort that PDX is known for.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/08/Harder-001.jpg?height=635&t=1765229732&width=1200,N,,2025-12-08 21:58:04.969879

People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success.
In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers.
In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center.
Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid.","More than 200 environmental organizations signed a letter to Congress supporting a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter, sent Monday, highlights these centers’ impacts on water resources, electricity rates and greenhouse gas emissions.

Data centers often suck up large amounts of water to cool their computers. They require a lot of electricity to run their servers, often leading to higher regional utility rates and upgrades to the electricity grid to accommodate them. Some utilities are planning to build natural gas plants to serve the new load, while some data-center companies are even building their own plants, increasing local greenhouse gas emissions.

It is near-impossible to paint a complete picture of the energy and water use of data centers, and the corresponding climate impacts, given the limited data that companies provide. A November study in the journal Nature Sustainability predicted that, depending on the speed of expansion, the artificial intelligence industry could emit as much carbon dioxide each year as 10 million cars, Inside Climate News reported.

People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success. The letter states that environmental groups want to stop these developments until “adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”

In a prepared statement, Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch, said: “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”

Data-center boosters have touted the economic benefits of new construction, including tax revenue increases for local governments and new jobs for residents.

In October, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, told NPR that companies are trying to reduce their water consumption, and to ensure they pay “the full cost of service for electricity.”

In New York, state leadership has taken a mainly supportive stance on data center development—Gov. Kathy Hochul recently told Bloomberg News that she wants to “let the tech industry know this is the place you want to be.”

But some communities in upstate New York have opposed data center development, particularly cryptocurrency mines that consume large amounts of energy to create bitcoin for profit. More recently, a potential AI data center in Lansing, a town near the state’s Finger Lakes region, has residents concerned about rising electricity costs and environmental problems.

“These slick corporations come into unsuspecting communities with the promise of job creation and tax revenues,” said Yvonne Taylor, the vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, an organization that fights data centers near the Finger Lakes, and president of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which opposes them across the country.

Both organizations signed the letter. “The fact of the matter is that all of these machines … they’re all fully automated, and it doesn’t require a lot of people, so there aren’t a lot of jobs that are created, but the community is left with the consequences, including increased energy bills,” she said.

In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers. In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center. This decision has divided the community, which is concerned about electricity rates, water use and potential air pollution from the on-site backup diesel generators.

Data centers use up so much power in certain states, like Virginia, that the regional electric grid operator will need to upgrade the transmission system that is essentially the backbone of the grid, according to Eric Gimon, an independent consultant who works as a technical expert and policy adviser with Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank.

Consumers usually subsidize those changes. A 2024 report from Virginia’s legislative watchdog agency found that households there could see their bills increase by an estimated $14 to $37 monthly by 2040 as a result.

Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid. This can also affect household electricity rates.

“For all these things, there are solutions,” said Gimon. “It’s just a question of demanding the solutions get implemented.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2214908695-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 19:01:50.085082

EV charging TRUMP: ""We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.""
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers' new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

READ MORE: Proposal Could Weaken Mileage Rules That Limit Air Pollution

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies ""forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.""

THE FACTS: It's true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers' growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden's policies were ""a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: ""We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.""

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren't evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers ""safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.""

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle's cost.

""If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,"" Edmunds' Caldwell said. ""However, it's unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.""

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

""This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,"" said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. ""This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.""",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/cars.jCorcCnsSf.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.55&fp-y=0.44&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-08 19:02:30.209147

The energy contracts submitted for the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, she said.
Whitmer released a letter in support of DTE’s data center plan just minutes before Wednesday’s hearing.","The Michigan Public Service Commission declined to take up DTE Energy’s power contracts for the Oracle and Open AI data center in Saline Township Friday, despite the utility’s statement that the project could be canceled if not approved by Dec. 5.

“When cases before the Commission are ripe for a decision, cases are put on the agenda,” MPSC spokesperson Matt Helms said in a Friday email.

The massive, $7 billion, 1.4-gigawatt data center planned for 575 acres of farmland south of Ann Arbor is a political flashpoint.

The MPSC has received over 5,000 online comments on the case and over 800 people attended a virtual hearing on the data center Wednesday night.

An additional virtual hearing will be held at 6 p.m. on Dec. 18 on a permit application for the Saline data center’s proposed wetland, stream, and floodplain impacts, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy announced Friday.

When asked about the passing of DTE’s deadline, DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said the company “will continue to follow the regulatory process and wait for the MPSC’s decision on these contracts.”

Wilmot did not say whether the status of the project is affected by the missed deadline, and deferred questions on the matter to developer Related Digital and Oracle.

The utility’s contracts with the data center customer allow it to terminate the agreement within 30 days if the deal is not approved by Dec. 5, or if the customer does not agree to extend this date to Dec. 19, according to a DTE regulatory filing. The MPSC’s next regular meeting is Dec. 18.

Related Digital spokesperson Natalie Ravitz said the Saline Township data center is an exceptional opportunity for job creation and building digital infrastructure.

“The project is structured to ensure a responsible development plan that protects ratepayers, preserves Michigan’s natural resources and water, and delivers a positive impact on the local economy,” Ravitz said in an email.

Oracle did not respond to a request for comment on this story.

Data centers are statewide issue that demands oversight, residents tell regulators

During the public comment portion of the MPSC’s Friday meeting, around 20 Michiganders spoke against the data center or in support of a contested case.

Ayat Al-Tamimi, a public health researcher and member of the grassroots group Michiganders Against Data Centers, held up a copy of the heavily redacted contracts DTE submitted to the MPSC as evidence of what she said is DTE’s failure to be a good partner to the people of Michigan.

“They’re able to circumvent clean energy commitments, if their power demand exceeds their ability to meet their clean energy commitments,” Al-Tamimi said, referring to an off ramp provision in Michigan’s 2023 clean energy law that allows fossil fuels to stay online if there is insufficient capacity to meet demand.

Saline Township resident Tim Bruneau said he has difficulties with outages and long restoration times and is concerned the data center could increase electric costs, referencing a September Bloomberg report that showed dramatic increases in ratepayers bills. The story said data centers increased electricity costs by as much as 267% over five years in some areas.

“The people of Michigan deserve a say in what happens to our power grid, to our land, and to our water,” said Christian Alvarado, a Plymouth resident and organizer with the nonprofit Detroit Action. The data center has the potential to impact ratepayers statewide, and the project “must be carefully and transparently vetted,” he said.

Nessel, lawmakers call for data center oversight

DTE Energy, which applied for ex parte approval of the data center electricity contracts without official hearings, has said a contested case is unnecessary because the project will not increase the cost of service for other customers.

Residents and some lawmakers say a contested case with Michigan regulators is needed to ensure the data center doesn’t increase utility bills, decrease energy reliability, undermine Michigan’s climate law, or leave ratepayers to pay for stranded costs if the facility uses less power than anticipated or ceases operation.

A contested case would enable parties representing businesses, environmental interests, ratepayers, and other groups to submit testimony on the electric contracts for the Saline Township data center.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and some union representatives and lawmakers support the project, and say it will create thousands of temporary construction jobs, hundreds of permanent jobs, and bring tax dollars to local communities.

Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel faced off on opposite sides of the data center issue this week.

DTE failed to show how it will supply power for the facility and protect residents from covering project costs, Nessel said in a Thursday statement.

Among the deficiencies Nessel said she found in DTE’s request for approval of the contracts are “unjustified redactions and rushed deadlines.”

“DTE continues to push for a rubber-stamp approval of a secret deal, but time and again, my office has contested their filings – and time after time, the utility has shown it is not a trustworthy partner, routinely filling cases with unjustified costs,” Nessel said, adding that a case involving hundreds of millions of dollars in energy infrastructure costs should be contested.

When asked about Nessel’s statement, DTE’s Wilmot said the company has an obligation to serve any business or residential customer. The energy contracts submitted for the data center will not increase rates for existing customers, she said. Whitmer released a letter in support of DTE’s data center plan just minutes before Wednesday’s hearing. The project will create jobs, she said, adding that her office reviewed the project’s environmental and ratepayer protections to ensure residents are not negatively impacted.

“Can Michigan benefit from these jobs and build data centers in a smarter way while upholding our strong environmental laws to protect our precious natural resources? We have an opportunity to do both,” Whitmer wrote.

Twenty-eight Republican and Democratic lawmakers signed a Dec. 2 letter that urges the MPSC to hold a contested case.

The lawmakers said the project could be a major economic opportunity, but that it also represents the “largest energy consumption increase in Michigan history,” and the MPSC will be unable to make an informed and fair decision on the matter without a contested proceeding.

Robust public input and feedback is needed to ensure existing customers don’t pay more for energy if “the energy usage overtaxes infrastructure, impedes Michigan’s clean energy goals, or because the companies proposing the data centers go bankrupt or otherwise do not fulfill their promises,” the letter said.

During Friday’s meeting, Augusta Township resident Wendy Albers said residents of Michigan townships are often left in the dark while data center deals are negotiated, with developers pushing a rushed timeline for approval once the proposals are made public.

“Please end the secrecy and protect the people of Michigan,” Albers told the commission in her request for a contested case.

“This is your chance to provide some equality between big tech, government, and the people.”

Antares, an advanced nuclear energy startup, announced the close of its $96 million Series B funding round.

The round was led by Shine Capital, with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and other investors.

The round consists of $71M in new equity capital and $25M in debt for equipment, factory build-out, and uranium procurement.

Antares CEO Jordan Bramble said the new capital will fuel the company’s mission to deliver safe, reliable, and scalable nuclear power solutions.

“This funding marks a major milestone for Antares,” Bramble said. “We’re months away from our first reactor demonstration, which will validate our control systems and neutronics models, develop our testing facility, and fabricate our fuel ahead of our upcoming full scale electricity producing prototype in 2027.""

Bramble added, ""We’ve raised the capital we need to mobilize to provide resilient energy for our partners at the Department of War (DoW) and NASA.”

Founded just over two years ago, Antares has made rapid progress in technology maturation.

The company has raised over $130M in funding to date and put those resources to work building out a 145,000-square-foot facility in Torrance, California, capable of producing 10 units per year.

Antares has also secured contracts with the United States Air Force, Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), and NASA to advance its technology.

With operations in Torrance, California; Idaho Falls, Idaho; and Aiken, South Carolina, and a team of 60, Antares is working to demonstrate a low-power test reactor before July 4, 2026, and to test its first-of-a-kind electricity-producing demonstration unit in 2027.

Production units will be deployed as early as 2028.

Over the summer, Antares conducted an electrically heated demonstration of its reactor in partnership with NASA at their Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

In April, Antares was selected by DIU under the Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program to provide nuclear power to DoW installations.

In August, the company received an allocation of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) fuel feedstock from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and was selected for DOE’s new reactor pilot program, which creates a fast-track pathway for reactor demonstration and licensing.

In October, the U.S. Army announced the establishment of a program of record for advanced nuclear energy, called JANUS, targeting reactors from kilowatt class up to 20MWe.

With this new funding, Antares plans to compete to provide the Pentagon with resilient energy for critical assets and infrastructure.

Antares’ will also propose on NASA’s Fission Surface Power program, which aims to deliver 100 kWe of nuclear power on the lunar surface by 2030.

Middleburg, a leading developer and operator of rental housing throughout core Southern markets, has closed a $39.1 million refinance of Vesta Creeks Run, a workforce and affordable housing community located at 4640 Forest Hills Drive in North Charleston, South Carolina.

Newmark arranged the Freddie Mac financing on behalf of Middleburg.

Throughout the course of its ownership since acquiring the asset in 2021, Middleburg implemented several operational and capital. The property is 97 percent occupied.

“Our partnership with Capital Solutions and Affordable Communities of America, a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving affordable housing throughout the country, enabled us to come up with creative strategies to help us continue to provide and maintain high-quality attainable housing stock in markets like Charleston,” said Michael Bediones, vice president of Asset Management at Middleburg.

Vesta Creeks Run is part of Middleburg's Vesta brand, the firm's workforce and affordable housing platform serving residents across the Southeast.

Officials said the property features attainable rents and area median income (AMI)-restricted units, addressing growing workforce housing needs in the Charleston region.

Under the leadership of Founder and CEO Chris Finlay, Middleburg continues to expand its attainable housing platform across three brands: Mosby, its marquee Class A multifamily product; Vesta, its workforce and affordable housing brand; and Hamlet, its purpose-built single-family rental product.

With over two decades of multifamily sponsorship, Middleburg has acquired, developed, and financed more than 32,000 multifamily units, exceeding over $4.5 billion in transactions since 2004.",http://locable-assets-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource/file/1261312/antares_20logo.jpg?timestamp=1765245556,N,,2025-12-08 20:59:19.028008

The National Grocers Association petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last Thursday to revise its hydrofluorocarbon management rule, citing unrealistic timelines, excessive compliance costs and regulatory requirements that exceed what Congress mandated.

NGA argued that the HFC Management Rule imposes impractical and overly burdensome requirements on food retailers. These include a drastic expansion of the number of covered refrigeration appliances and a leak-rate limit that does not reflect real-world system performance. The association also said the rule’s repair, testing and retrofit deadlines are unrealistically short, especially given national shortages of technicians and parts. It is requesting additional time to comply with automatic leak-detection system mandates.

“Independent grocers are committed to environmental sustainability and responsible refrigerant management,” said Max Wengroff, NGA senior manager of government relations. “But the EPA’s rule places unrealistic obligations on retailers that simply cannot be met under the imposed timelines and thresholds. These unnecessary obligations will raise costs for businesses and families.”

In the petition, NGA stated that it supports reducing HFC emissions by limiting production and use. However, it argued that compliance with the rule would increase operating expenses, forcing grocers to pass those costs on to consumers.

According to NGA, the EPA’s new leak-rate threshold for repair is unworkable. The agency set the threshold at 20%, despite industry data indicating that the typical food-retail refrigeration system leaks about 25% of its refrigerant each year. The association is requesting that the threshold be raised to 30% or that the agency adopt a phased schedule that starts with a higher rate and becomes more stringent over time.

The independent grocery sector represents nearly one-third of all U.S. grocery sales—more than $250 billion annually—and supports over 1 million jobs. NGA contended that without reasonable revisions to the rule, many independent grocers will face costs they cannot absorb, which will ultimately be passed on to customers.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-12/background/Cooler%20in%20a%20grocery%20store.jpg?VersionId=kTiLZPbN8c2AFMfIrK6VRA0K1E9KebLJ,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:05.240052

Technically, you could fit a couple of them in the same space as a single 500X, so inventory headaches might be minimal. But sarcasm aside, Fiat really has announced it’s bringing the bite-sized model to the States.

The company will share more details next year, but the Topolino is a small two-seat electric vehicle that has a front-mounted motor developing 8 hp (6 kW / 8 PS) and 32 lb-ft (44 Nm) of torque. It’s powered by a 5.4 kWh battery pack, which provides a range of 46 miles (75 km) under the World Motorcycle Test Cycle.

The European model has a top speed of 28 mph (45 km/h) and it can accelerate to that number in ten seconds flat. This would make it ideal for use in neighborhoods, where golf carts have exploded in popularity.

We’ll learn more about the US-spec model in the coming months, but the European Topolino rides on 14-inch wheels. The ultra-compact EV is also sold in Europe as the Citroen Ami and Opel Rocks, though those variants won’t be making their way here. Unless Dodge or Jeep get any weird ideas.

That’s 43.1 inches (1,096 mm) shorter than the slow-selling 500e, which starts at $30,500 before a hefty $1,995 destination fee. Just imagine this thing next to an Escalade or an F-150.

Under direct pressure from Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency was pushed to go beyond rolling back climate protections and weaken long-standing public health safeguards as well. Documents reveal that the Office of Management and Budget leaned on EPA this summer to not only repeal a foundational climate policy underpinning most federal emissions rules for cars and trucks, but also to loosen limits on deadly non-climate pollutants like soot and smog-forming chemicals.

While EPA officials resisted parts of this pressure, the exchange—made public after the proposed rollback was released in July—lays bare the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign to dismantle environmental regulation across the board, not just climate rules. Current vehicle standards, finalized in 2024 under the Biden administration, target both greenhouse gases and so-called “criteria pollutants” that cause asthma, heart disease, and premature death. But as Trump’s EPA moves to gut those protections, the White House budget office has simultaneously pushed to weaken rules on toxic air pollution itself—showing that this rollback is not only about climate denial, but also about abandoning basic public health protections.

The climate crisis is here and now. The fossil fuel industry knew, lied, denied, and sabotaged action on catastrophic climate change for decades, all while raking in billions in profit every year.

The paper argues that a U.S. Strategic Lithium Reserve (SLR)—modeled on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve—could provide the price stability needed for private capital to finance new lithium mining and conversion projects across the Western Hemisphere.

A Market-Based Alternative to Subsidies and Price Floors

Lithium prices have swung 10–15× in recent cycles—far beyond what most long-term capital can withstand. Much of this volatility stems from China’s dominance of lithium chemical conversion, where oversupply and subsidized lepidolite production exert sustained downward pressure on global prices. The result: U.S., Canadian, and allied projects struggle to reach Final Investment Decision (FID) even when resource quality and management execution are strong.

“A Strategic Lithium Reserve is the simplest, fairest, and fastest policy tool available,” said Howard Klein, Founder of RK Equity.

“It doesn’t pick technologies or subsidize risky projects. It neutralizes volatility so private capital can back the best projects.”

How the SLR Works

The SLR would operate as a rules-based reserve of lithium carbonate, purchasing material when prices fall below incentive levels—typically around $20,000–25,000 per tonne—and releasing it during extreme price spikes, supply disruptions, or export restrictions.

Establishing a 170,000-tonne reserve today would cost approximately $3.4–4.25 billion. A fully built-out 300,000-tonnereserve by 2030 would cost $6.0–7.5 billion. These sums are modest compared to existing U.S. industrial policy initiatives such as:

DOE Loan Programs Office: >$100B

Inflation Reduction Act clean energy incentives: >$400B

CHIPS Act: ~$50B

Immediate Strategic Impact

The white paper highlights that the Americas—particularly Chile and Argentina—are already the largest non-China producers of lithium carbonate. Redirecting a portion of these flows away from China and toward a U.S. reserve would provide immediate strategic supply security.

“Unlike permitting a new mine or building a U.S. refinery, which takes years, the SLR can begin stabilizing the market within months,” Klein added.

“It is the lithium-age analogue to the SPR.”

Complementary Industrial Strategy

In addition to the SLR, the paper recommends:

Continued use of the 45X Production Tax Credit, a broad-based, non-distortive incentive

Targeted LPO, EXIM Bank, or Department of the Navy’s Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) support for nationally significant, long-lived strategic projects

Limited, performance-linked incentives for companies with demonstrated ability to build and operate large-scale conversion capacity

The white paper also presents a three-phase implementation roadmap, beginning with authorization and early purchases, followed by hemispheric project alignment, and culminating in a fully operational SLR capable of dampening market extremes across cycles.

Welch’s parents both worked as park rangers at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and as she grew older, her mom took on seasonal work at other parks during the summer months.

“From living in Yellowstone to New River Gorge National Park, I was always outside and knew I wanted to have a similar career to my parents,” Welch said.

Welch volunteered at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in high school and later served as a rafting guide, experiences that reinforced her aspirations to work outdoors.

As she was preparing for college, Welch focused on finding academic programs that would align with her goal of working in conservation.

That’s when she discovered the College of Natural Resources at NC State, where she enrolled as a fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology major with a minor in applied ecology.

Inspired by a dendrology course taught by Steph Jefferies in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources, Welch decided to double major in plant biology.

“Dr. Jefferies made the class so engaging, and I use what I learned almost daily, or whenever I see a tree,” Welch said.

Welch also enrolled in the University Certificate in Field Botany program, which provides students with the opportunity to develop skills in vascular plant identification.

This interdisciplinary path has provided Welch, who is graduating this fall, with a unique perspective on conservation, allowing her to fully realize the interconnectedness of plants and wildlife.

“In an ecosystem, plants and wildlife are so connected, and learning about the parts of a system helps us understand the entire ecosystem,” Welch said.

Reconnecting with Her Indigenous Roots

While at NC State, Welch’s studies also deepened her connection to her ancestral roots, as she is an enrolled member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (ECBI).

“Growing up, I didn’t know that much about Cherokee culture. It wasn’t really taught in schools, and I didn’t search it out,” Welch said.

Welch didn’t expect to miss her cultural background when left home for college, as it hadn’t been a significant part of her identity at that time.

But the longer she was away, Welch’s desire to reconnect with her culture grew, leading her to participate more in events focused on Cherokee traditions and heritage back home.

In August 2024, Welch joined the James Buzzard Leadership Development Program, through which she learned about the Indigenous Conservation Corps (ICC).

The ICC is a partnership between Conservation Corps North Carolina, the U.S. National Forest Service and the ECBI to promote environmental stewardship and cultural preservation through collaborative conservation efforts.

Last summer, Welch served as an assistant crew lead for the ICC alongside her sister Rebecca, learning about Cherokee ecological knowledge and EBCI Natural Resources Department’s efforts to restore their relationship with the land.

“I’m so thankful that I participated in this program with my sister,” Welch said. “It helped me realize that I want to combine what I’ve learned at NC State with honoring Cherokee land stewardship and deepening my understanding of the culture.”

Exploring, Learning and Gaining Experience

Reflecting on her journey, Welch emphasized that her experience with the ICC was made possible in large part by the College of Natural Resources’ emphasis on hands-on learning.

As part of the fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology curriculum, all students are required to complete an experiential learning opportunity, such as an internship or field practicum, to graduate.

“The college sets students up for success by providing internship opportunities, supporting clubs and offering events,” Welch said. “One of its greatest strengths is enabling students to learn beyond the traditional classroom.”

Welch specifically highlighted the 6-week field practicum, known as Summer Camp, as being crucial to preparing her for fieldwork. The practicum allows students to gain practical experience in wildlife management and conservation practices.

“This experience was my first real introduction to wildlife management, and I’ve used so much of what we learned in just two internships,” Welch said.

In addition to her experience with the ICC, Welch also completed an internship with Discover Life in America at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 2024.

Through these internships, Welch gained invaluable firsthand research skills, immersing herself in the complexities of fieldwork and learning to navigate logistical, environmental and organizational challenges.

Looking ahead, Welch plans to work seasonally before pursuing a master’s degree. Eventually, she hopes to return to her home in western North Carolina to pursue a career in conservation or a related field.

Welch expressed gratitude for the support and guidance she received throughout her time at NC State, specifically thanking her advisor, Lara Pacifici, and Kaly Wall, an academic services specialist.

When asked for advice to current students, Welch encouraged them to embrace every opportunity, stressing that hands-on experience is key to career success and building professional connections.

Additionally, Welch highlighted the importance of flexibility in fieldwork, noting, “Things won’t always go as planned, but a positive attitude makes all the difference.”",https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/12/julianna-welch-wolf-plaza-katherine-griffey-1146x600-1.png,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:32.940620

Congress Preps Hegseth’s Trillion-Dollar War Chest

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Lawmakers on Sunday released the compromise defense policy bill for FY 26, which would authorize a more than $900 billion Pentagon budget. If passed, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would bring total U.S. military spending to well over a trillion dollars annually, thanks to the GOP-led Big Ugly Law passed in July, which included $150 billion in additional Pentagon funds. Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, released the following statement:

“The last person who should be entrusted with an even bigger budget is the dangerous and lawless Pete Hegseth.

“As Hegseth illegally targets civilian boats near Venezuela with expensive Hellfire missiles, wastefully and recklessly deploys the National Guard in cities around the country, and teases an unconstitutional and costly war, Congress should refuse to add a penny to his budget.

“The $8 billion bump proposed for the Pentagon budget is, thankfully, less than the $32 billion proposed by the Senate. But it’s still an unconscionable increase to a budget already overflowing with dangerous, ultra-wasteful line items like the President’s ‘Golden Dome’ grift and unchecked killer robot programs.

“It’s time for Congress to get its priorities straight and stop piling more money on the trillion-dollar Pentagon budget beset with fraud and waste, at the expense of priority human needs. The $8 billion in additional funds for the Pentagon are nearly enough to pay for SNAP benefits for the four million people who will lose them under the tax and budget reconciliation bill.

“Congress should unequivocally reject the bill and use this moment to voice its strong opposition to Hegseth’s reckless overseas killings, protracted domestic deployments of the National Guard, and countless other security and human rights breaches.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 17:02:00.802431

“Lithium occurs in small quantities,” Ted Pagano, CEO of MPSC, told Crain’s. “Those supply chains are complicated and depend on critical metals and refining capacity. Whereas the unique use of an industrial mineral that we already produce in mass can be used. We’re not just making pallets of material, but sending out giant bulk trucks. The difference is substantive and uses a stable U.S. supply chain.”

Group1’s project isn’t commercialized yet, so the project remains mostly theoretical at this point. Much like the potash mine itself.

MPSC’s development of a potash mine outside of Evart has been more than 15 years in the making.

MPSC was scheduled to break ground in mid-2022 to supply more than 650,000 tons of potash and 1 million tons of food-grade salt by this year. Potash is one of three critical macronutrients required to sustain plant life found in fertilizers.

But raising $1.3 billion in capital toward the project proved difficult, as well as concerns over the mine’s environmental impact.

“The fact is, an average lifecycle to get a facility up and running in this industry, from discovery to when production starts, is 28 years,” Pagano said. “We are in the position we are in today because we have a supply chain that’s ultimately threatened. But because of the type of capital we need in this space, those providing the capital tend to be less patient in the U.S. than in competing nations.”

Pagano is referencing that financiers usually want their return on investment much sooner than in 30-plus years, making investing in infrastructure projects like this difficult.

Potash is a limited natural resource. It's only mined in 13 countries and is extracted from deep within the Earth's mantle. Potash mining in New Mexico and Utah is running low on the mineral salt high in potassium, as both deposits have been mined since around World War I.

Then in 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey announced it had discovered the purest known potash deposit on earth — roughly 7,800 feet below the surface in Evart. The potassium-rich rocks are a relic from the drying up of the Devonian Sea, a salt-rich sea like the Middle East's Dead Sea that covered much of Central Canada and the Northern U.S. 350 million years ago.

The deposit spans more than 15,000 acres in Osceola and Mecosta counties and has a projected value of $65 billion, according to the federal geology agency.

The rock core samples from Evart were given to the USGS by Canadian potash mine company Kalium and were retrieved from the earth in the 1980s.

Pagano created MPSC and worked alongside the USGS to test the old rock core samples in 2012 and has worked to start a mining operation in Evart ever since.

MPSC owns the 500 acres over the deposit. but has mineral leases on 5,000 acres from 450 different land owners.

The mine project gained traction in 2022 after the price of potash shot up more than 166% in the wake of sanctions against Belarus for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than 40% of global production of potash comes from those two nations, and more than 96% of all potash used in the U.S. is imported.

The price of potash has since come down — $353.75 per metric ton last month.

But the project became a matter of national security under former President Joe Biden, whose U.S. Department of Energy authorized a conditional loan guarantee of up to $1.26 billion for the project late last year, solving its funding conundrum.

The mine project already had a $225 million bond from the state to lure investors, as well as inking a deal to sell its entire annual production to Chicago-based Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.

ADM is one of the largest food processors and commodities traders in the world. In 2024, the public company (NYSE: ADM) generated more than $85 billion in revenue.

The operation's slow start is also due to the potential environmental impact of the mining process. The company plans to drill holes to the deposit nearly 1.5 miles down and pump a brine solution to dissolve the potash, pump it back up to the surface, and then allow it to dry and re-enter a solid state.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy approved permits for the operation over the protests of environmental groups. But some permitting requirements do remain, Pagano said.

Pagano said he cannot provide a date for when construction of the mine will begin, other than to say “as soon as possible,” but when it does, it’ll take three years to complete.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/potash%20mine-main_i_1.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:31.720359

Every great river carries great stories in its flow.

Stories of exploration and commerce, yes, but also of connection and belonging, collective action and empowerment.

And so every great river also needs its story keepers.

For the past five years, the University of Michigan’s Detroit River Story Lab has been supporting local efforts to lift up river stories and amplify the voices of their tellers. David Porter, an English professor and founder of the story lab, says he became interested in this collaborative work when he recognized how often community leaders brought up the importance of place-based storytelling in the context of their relationships with the river.

What followed was the development of multiple story-centered projects combining humanities scholarship and community engagement. The lab emerged as a collaboration between an interdisciplinary group of U-M faculty and a variety of local partners. From the outset, Porter said, “the mission was about catalyzing ongoing narrative infrastructure work in river-facing communities. The lab’s initial grant focused explicitly on supporting community-based storytelling projects.”

Since it received that first internal funding in the fall of 2020, the lab has focused on developing three overlapping narrative channels along the Detroit River corridor: place-based education, community heritage, and local journalism.

Today the lab works with dozens of public schools, youth organizations, museums, government agencies, news organizations, and nonprofits to help research and share out a variety of river stories and to support residents’ engagement with the region’s defining waterway through educational programs, interpretive installations, and long-form media stories.

A great example is the Detroit River Skiff and Schooner Program, which was launched in 2021 and provides high school and college students with opportunities such as boat-building workshops and tall ship outings featuring conversations with community experts on the river’s cultural and environmental heritage.

The lab also works with Detroit partners to resurface submerged stories along the river, and to collaborate on site-specific projects at locations including Historic Fort Wayne and the new Gordie Howe Bridge. Oral histories, exhibits and public events all promote environmental stewardship and a greater sense of community. Some of the dozens of projects featured on the lab’s website include an Underground Railroad Research Guide, a Digital Mapping Project featuring historical maps of the Detroit River corridor, and a StoryMap called Lives of Leisure and Labor on the Detroit River.

Some of Porter’s favorite river stories include those about the local histories of Black journalism and Black boating along the river, historical figures like Sarah E. Ray and Thornton and Lucie Blackburn, and present-day community leaders like Hadassah Greensky, Tepfirah Rushdan, Bruce Ross, Jason McGuire, Taylor Mitchell, and Shakara Tyler.

The lab sponsors student internships with the nonprofit news organizations of BridgeDetroit and Planet Detroit to assist them in reporting community stories.

And through the Detroit River Stories Podcast, U-M students interview Detroit residents about their relationship with the river, offering insights on everything from the city’s buried creeks to climate and commerce along the river to the essential role the U.S. Coast Guard plays in the flow of the river.

Another student-led project features a collection of interview-based stories focused on Belle Isle – the swimmers, the walkers, the fishers and the boaters. Porter says: “It’s another important contribution, since for so many Detroiters, the isle is a sanctuary from the city sprawl, a place of peace and reflection and resilience and grounding.”

Units from across U-M have engaged with the lab’s work over the past five years, contributing research expertise, grant funding and program development support. That includes faculty from the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the School of Environment and Sustainability, the Marsal Family School of Education, and Taubman College.

Additional U-M partners have included Rackham Graduate School, the Vice Provost for Engaged Learning, the Museum of Anthropological Archeology, the Graham Sustainability Institute, Poverty Solutions, Wolverine Pathways, and the Great Lakes Writers Corps.",https://detroit.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-UofMLogo-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:03:37.986086

Apple’s lead environmental strategist, Lisa Jackson, is retiring in late January 2026 after 13 years on the job.

A direct replacement was not named. Instead, Jackson’s responsibilities as vice president for environment, policy and social initiatives will be split between two senior-level Apple executives after her departure.

Jennifer Newstead, who will join Apple as general counsel in March after serving in a similar capacity at Meta, will take over Jackson’s policy work. Apple’s environmental and social initiatives will now report to the company’s new chief operating officer, Sabih Khan, a mechanical engineer who has been closely involved with many of Apple’s green manufacturing and circular design initiatives.

Both executives report to CEO Tim Cook, as does Jackson.

Respected legacy

Jackson, a chemical engineer by training, joined Apple in 2013 after four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama.

Under her leadership, Apple has managed to reduce its emissions by more than 60 percent through deliberate investments in renewable energy in its supply chain and by transitioning to recycled and renewable options for 15 priority materials, such as aluminum, rare earths and lithium.

“She has also been a critical strategic partner in engaging governments around the world, advocating for the best interests of our users on a myriad of topics, as well as advancing our values, from education and accessibility to privacy and security,” said Cook in a prepared statement.

For example, Jackson spearheaded the company’s Racial and Equity Justice Initiative, launched in 2020 and focused on investing $100 million in diverse entrepreneurs and in programs aimed at reducing pollution in low-income communities.

“I have been lucky to work with leaders who understand that reducing our environmental impact is not just good for the environment, but good for business, and that we can do well by doing good,” Jackson said in a prepared statement. “I have every confidence that Apple will continue to have a profoundly positive impact on the planet and its people.”

Strategic continuity

Khan, Apple’s new COO, has been directly involved in delivering on many of Jackson’s strategies for the company’s supply chain, including the materials-replacements initiatives that helped the company avoid 6.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2024 alone.

Cook touted Khan’s work on advanced manufacturing technologies that have reduced emissions when he announced his promotion in July.

Washington – In a letter sent to Congress today, more than 230 national, state and local organizations from across the country called for a full national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter cites massive and unsustainable consumption by data centers of energy and water resources, and skyrocking utility costs for families and small businesses. The letter was facilitated by the national environmental group Food & Water Watch, and signed by organizations including Physicians for Social Responsibility, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Progressive Democrats of America, Our Revolution and Americans for Financial Reform.

The letter states, in part:

“The rapid expansion of data centers across the United States, driven by the generative artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto booms, presents one of the biggest environmental and social threats of our generation. This expansion is rapidly increasing demand for energy, driving more fossil fuel pollution, straining water resources and raising electricity prices across the country… We urge you to join our call for a national moratorium on new data centers until adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities, our families, our environment and our health from the runaway damage this industry is already inflicting.”

“At a time when millions of Americans are already struggling with soaring utility costs, the sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these data centers inflict,” said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. “The only prudent action is to halt the unfettered expansion of this dangerous industry in order to properly examine all manner of potential harm before it’s too late.”

Already, energy demand from data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase up to threefold between 2023 and 2028. And recent analysis from Food & Water Watch found that by 2028, AI-supporting data centers could consume:

720 billion gallons of water annually simply to cool the facilities — equal to more than 1 million Olympic-size swimming pools, or enough water to meet the indoor needs of 18.5 million American households.

300 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy annually — enough electricity to power over 28 million American households.

Meanwhile, this summer the Trump administration released an “AI Action Plan,” which outlines its priorities related to the advancement of so-called “artificial intelligence” and the industries supporting it – including massive energy- and water-intensive data centers. Among other things, Trump’s plan seeks to dismantle existing environmental and land use rules that it views as a hindrance to the unfettered growth of these industries.

Morgan Stanley on Tesla: The electric vehicle giant was named the top automotive stock by Jonas for 2025. The analyst had held an Outperform rating since 2023 and had been bullish on many aspects of the company, including the new pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Percoco has a different idea going forward, suggesting that the AI opportunity for the company is offset by automotive headwinds and a full valuation.

""With downside to consensus estimates driven by pressures in the auto business and catalysts for it non-auto business priced in at its current valuation, we assume coverage at Equal-weight with a $424 price target and wait for a better entry point,"" Percoco said.

The analyst said Tesla is a leader in electric vehicles, renewable energy, manufacturing, and real-world AI, which should give it a premium valuation.

""However, high expectations on the latter (AI) have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.""

The analyst sees challenging catalysts for Tesla going forward, which could provide downside to estimates.

""We believe it will be increasingly challenging to support meaningful upside to Tesla shares barring an improvement, or at least stabilization, within its auto business.""

Along with the base case price target of $425, Percoco has a bull case valuation of $860 and a bear case valuation of $145 on Tesla stock.

Morgan Stanley on General Motors: While Percoco sees Tesla stock less favorable than Jonas, the new automotive analyst for Morgan Stanley sees a brighter short-term future for General Motors.

""Over the course of the last year, GM made strides in realigning their capital allocation strategy with a more tempered EV and AV growth curve,"" Percoco said.

The analyst said General Motors could benefit from reduced policy uncertainty, the ending of EV tax credits, and reductions in emissions-related requirements.

""We expect GM to manage through with an appropriately re-aligned capital allocation strategy and refreshed product lineup highlighting strength in GM's core ICE trucks and SUVs.""

Percoco said investors could see a ""prolongation of ‘ICE is Nice' narrative"" for traditional automakers.

""As a result of easing compliance requirements, OEMs can leverage consumer preference for higher-value ICE and hybrid vehicles.""

A shift back to ICE vehicles by consumers in 2026 could be a tailwind for General Motors.

While neither company has completely abandoned its electric vehicle presence, changes to growth plans and focusing on ICE vehicles could pay off in the short term, according to Percoco.

Morgan Stanley on Auto Sector: The analyst expects electric vehicle volume to be down 20% year-over-year in the United States for 2026, painting a cautious outlook on the pure-play EV companies like Tesla, Rivian and Lucid.

The analyst forecasts ICE vehicle sales in the U.S. market to be up 1% year-over-year in 2026.

""Position your portfolio toward best in class operators that can navigate a slower industry outlook by allocating capital effectively with a strong execution track record (General Motors),"" Percoco said.

The analyst warned investors to ""be wary"" of companies facing industry headwinds, such as EV deceleration.

GM, TSLA Price Action: General Motors stock is down 0.5% to $75.69 on Monday versus a 52-week trading range of $41.60 to $77.00. General Motors shares are up 47.3% year-to-date in 2025.

But to fully leverage natural gas, we need a permitting system that lets pipelines and storage facilities come online faster.
Permitting review should focus on supporting businesses looking to build critical energy infrastructure in the United States, rather than hindering them with petty litigation, lengthy review processes, and convoluted standards.
To do this, the NPC recommends a massive permitting system overhaul, focused on standardizing and expediting the review process.
Data proves that a strong majority of voters support updating the permitting process to speed up energy development.","Reducing litigation backlogs, expediting critical project timelines, and standardizing processes are critical steps to overhauling America’s broken permitting system, says a new report from the National Petroleum Council (NPC), issued at the request of Energy Secretary Chris Wright. The report comes amid rising energy costs as AI data centers and increased U.S. energy exports have skyrocketed demand. The NPC’s findings serve as a collaborative roadmap for government and industry to work together on streamlining permits.

NPC’s analysis points out that current permitting pitfalls don’t merely cause logistical issues, they also cause a structural vulnerability to the nation’s energy system, causing regional price volatility, supply insecurity, increased prices, and job loss. America is at a tipping point: we either overhaul the permitting process to build the infrastructure needed to keep up with energy demand, or face serious economic consequences.

Energy Secretary Wright, who ordered the NPC report in June, welcomed its findings as an important step toward reform:

“The National Petroleum Council’s findings confirm what President Trump has said from day one: America needs more energy infrastructure, less red tape, and serious permitting reform. These recommendations will help make energy more affordable for every American household.”

As Energy in Depth has examined in previous analysis, outdated permitting rules have slowed the development of projects critical for energy security and reliability. But momentum is building for change. In September, a diverse coalition of America’s energy and business leaders sent letters to congress, urging them to act quickly to modernize the permitting system: streamlining the system so that projects can better develop and everyday people can reap the benefit quickly of new infrastructure construction.

Getting It Done

The NPC report illustrates how demand is outpacing the capacity of our energy infrastructure, particularly for natural gas. Between 2013 and 2024, U.S. natural gas demand increased by 49 percent, while pipeline capacity grew only 26 percent and storage capacity rose an incremental two percent from 2013 to 2023.

Natural gas will continue to play a vital role in powering business and homes for the foreseeable future, thanks to its abundance and affordability. It is also the perfect partner for renewables, ready to fill in when wind and solar output dips. But to fully leverage natural gas, we need a permitting system that lets pipelines and storage facilities come online faster. Permitting reform is key to optimizing natural gas delivery and ensuring reliable, affordable energy when and where it’s needed.

The NPC report outlined several major pitfalls in the current permitting process that must be addressed:

Litigation Risk: Lengthy environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) leave projects incredibly vulnerable to lawsuits. On average, nearly one-third of projects which are mandated to perform an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) face a court challenge, with 90 percent of cases alleging a NEPA violation. Lawsuits delay projects by one to two years and can even take four years if appealed to circuit courts.

Convoluted Review: The current permitting framework is overly complex and project-specific, lacking standardization and the ability to expedite proposals. Developers must navigate a maze of agencies and reviews, often duplicating efforts. This process-heavy approach makes it difficult to advance even the most critical projects.

Slow (and Reversable) Approvals: The vast majority of EIS reviews take more than two years to complete, and that’s before accounting for multiagency permit sign-offs. This process can take four to five years not including litigation delays. Furthermore, even if a project is approved, its permit can be revoked on the basis of policy, meaning political changes can undo years of planning and investment.

Permitting review should focus on supporting businesses looking to build critical energy infrastructure in the United States, rather than hindering them with petty litigation, lengthy review processes, and convoluted standards.

To do this, the NPC recommends a massive permitting system overhaul, focused on standardizing and expediting the review process. In the near term, some pitfalls can be remedied by amending NEPA to focus on environmental impacts within its purview and reducing backlog in the judicial review process. In the long term, federal and state governments should shift from case-specific to standardized reviews that allow for expedited approval based on clearly articulated standards. Predictable permitting for routine oil and gas activities and expedited approval of electric power infrastructure development will be crucial to match increased energy demand.

As it stands, permitting review is needlessly convoluted and bogged down by political agenda. A standardized system would reorient development to focus on transparency and efficiency: giving America the tools it needs to maintain energy dominance and technological innovation.

The Way Forward

Fortunately, permitting reform has attracted many allies pushing hard for action in recent months. On top of the calls from business and industry groups this fall, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are actively pushing for permitting reform legislation— such as the SPEED Act— and Secretary Wrigth have welcomed the NPC’s recommendations, viewing them as a blueprint for constructive action. NPC Executive Director John Dabbar emphasized the collaborative nature of the report’s findings:

“These studies show what’s possible when industry, government and stakeholders work together to address complex energy challenges with facts and forward-looking solutions.”

The NPC report is an important step forward, shining a light on concrete actions that the federal government, lawmakers and individual agencies must take steps to address permitting inefficiencies.

Data proves that a strong majority of voters support updating the permitting process to speed up energy development. Not only does overhauling permitting have public support, but it is also the key to enhancing domestic infrastructure that can keep up with technological innovation and booming energy demand. A modernized permitting framework would enable critical projects such as pipelines, power plants, refineries, and LNG export terminals to be built in pace with demand, ensuring energy supply and maintaining U.S. global competitiveness.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EID-NPC-120825.png,N,,2025-12-08 16:04:20.609629

Of the 11.7 GW of total capacity added, utility-scale solar and battery storage accounted for 91% of the total, said a quarterly report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

Solar provided 6 GW, representing 51% of quarterly capacity additions. Energy storage capacity accounted for 4.7 GW resulting in 40% of additions for the quarter, said ACP.

Developers connected 5,932 MW of utility-scale solar capacity to the grid during the third quarter of 2025. Quarterly solar additions were 4% higher than the previous quarter. However, installations were about 5% lower than the third quarter of 2024, the report said.

The cumulative operational solar capacity in the U.S. reached 146,228 MW at the close of Q3 2025. This capacity delivers electricity to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The sector has maintained a high rate of construction, with developers connecting more than 71 GW of new capacity since the start of 2023.

The largest utility-scale solar project phase brought online in Q3 2025 was Excelsior Energy Capital’s Faraday B Solar. Located in Utah County, Utah, the project added 525 MW of generation capacity. The project features 1.2 million solar panels. Construction was completed in a period of under two years. This project alone contributed significantly to Utah joining the top ten states for clean power additions in the quarter.

Battery storage capacity surpassed 40 GW of operational capacity in Q3 2025. The quarter ended with a total operational capacity of 40,321 MW, corresponding to 112,002 MWh of energy storage.

Developers commissioned 50 new battery storage projects during the third quarter. These projects added 4,686 MW of new capacity to the grid. The addition of 4.7 GW established Q3 2025 as the strongest third-quarter on record for new storage capacity installations. It ranks as the second-largest quarter for new storage additions in U.S. history. Installations increased by 32% year-over-year compared to Q3 2024 installations.

The largest battery storage project to achieve commercial operation in Q3 was Enel Green Power North America’s 359 MW GulfStar Storage. The project is located in Wharton County, Texas. GulfStar Storage is co-located with a 450 MW solar phase, GulfStar Solar.

Texas remained the top state for clean power additions in Q3 2025. The state accounted for 39% of total added capacity in the U.S. during the quarter. The 63% growth in clean power capacity added by Texas in Q3 compared to Q2 was largely due to the increase in storage capacity, which the GulfStar Storage project contributed to.

The total clean power project pipeline reached186 GW at the close of Q3 2025. Battery storage and solar accounted for 90% of pipeline growth over the last year. Solar made up the largest share of the pipeline, accounting for 53% with nearly 100 GW of capacity under development.

The solar pipeline has grown at an average pace of 2% each quarter over the last two years. Battery storage represents the second largest share of the pipeline at 24% The storage pipeline contains over 45 GW of capacity.

The group says it views the proposal as an environmentally responsible and fiscally practical solution to Binghamton’s solid waste management challenges.

“Implementing a system that diverts food scraps and other organic materials from the landfill will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane, and extend the operational life of the county landfill, as well as reduce tipping fees for Binghamton,” the Sierra Club says.

The group added that the proposed three-stream approach, separating recyclables, compostables, and residential waste, aligns with guidance from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and supports the intent of New York State’s Food Donation and Food Scraps Recycling Law.

According to the proposal filed with the Binghamton City council, the three-stream waste disposal system “provides the best solution to Binghamton’s blue bag concerns in an environmentally responsible way, addresses concerns raised by residents and financially benefitting both residents and the city.”

The proposed three-stream hybrid solid waste disposal solution would call for residents to use blue bags only for non-compostable waste in addition to the city addressing various issues of concern, recycling to remain as is and food scraps placed separately in a covered bin or a compostable bag.

In addition, garbage that does not fit in bags, like broken furniture, can be set out with or without stickers (as the council sees fit). The proposal notes that one of the reasons stickers were discontinued is because they were even less popular than the blue bags.

The news, of course, was not that Van Epps defeated Democrat Aftyn Behn, but that he only won by nine percentage points in a district that President Trump carried by 22 a year earlier.

You can read about the race here and here.

The Tennessee race, combined with last month’s elections in Virginia and New Jersey, have strengthened the Democrats’ belief they can take the House in 2026. (Democrats also did well in last month’s North Carolina municipal races.)

If Democrats can over-perform in Tennessee, can they flip a congressional seat in purpler North Carolina?

Let’s start with the state’s new congressional map, approved this year. The GOP further gerrymandered the map to bolster their chances of winning 11 of 14 seats instead of the 10 Republicans hold today.

The only changes were in the 1st and 3rd districts:

The Democrats now hold three safe seats: the 12th, 4th and 2nd. Don Davis also represents the 1st District in the northeast, but his district was redrawn this year and made more Republican. Despite the new map, he’s running for reelection.

Here are some of President Trump’s winning margins in 2024:

11th District (western NC/Asheville) Trump +9.5 (Republican Chuck Edwards)

1st District (northeastern NC/coast) Trump +11 (Democrat Don Davis in a redrawn district)

3rd District (Jacksonville) Trump +13 (Republican Greg Murphy)

7th District (Wilmington) Trump +14 (Republican David Rouzer)

14th District (west Mecklenburg/Gaston) Trump +15 (Republican Tim Moore)

Even before last week’s special election in Tennessee, national Democrats said they would invest in the 11th District, hoping to defeat Republican Chuck Edwards.

There are a few reasons for Democrats to have hope in the mountains.

The 2024 election represented a great year for Republicans. Almost every N.C. county shifted to the right compared to the 2020 election. But there were a few counties that bucked that trend, including three in the 11th: Henderson (suburban Asheville), Buncombe (Asheville) and Transylvania (Brevard).

Kamala Harris picked up about two percentage points more in each county compared to Joe Biden in 2020. Is that a sign of a real shift to the left?

Here is a New York Times map of the change in results from 2020 to 2024. Areas in blue didn’t necessarily vote for Harris, but they did become more Democratic:

The Democrats may have a good candidate in Jamie Ager. There are several people running in the March primary, but Ager is considered the leader.

His grandfather, Jamie Clarke, represented the district as a Democrat in Congress for three non-consecutive terms from 1983 to 1991. His father served in the state House, and his brother Eric Ager is currently a House member.

Moe Davis, who lost to Madison Cawthorn in 2020, left the race after a bitter dispute with party leaders about alleged favoritism toward Ager.

Finally, there is Hurricane Helene recovery. Are swing voters OK with the pace of reconstruction? Or do they punish Edwards and the GOP? President Trump named Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Whatley as the Helene “recovery czar” in January, and Democrats are going to hammer him for what they say is a lackluster recovery.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca3e3d6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6016x3158+0+543/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwfae%2Ffiles%2F201904%2Fvoting_stock_photo.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:02:48.610811

He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.
“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said.
The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants.
That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.","CRAIG — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the Colorado family’s new business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families in Craig, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope that Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant, it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”

In the US, modernization of central utilities integrates workforce training and operational research, linking infrastructure investment to knowledge creation.","Across the world, the energy transition is reshaping the Industrial landscape determining where and how the next generation of infrastructure will emerge. Governments are setting net zero goals, industries are recalibrating around cleaner inputs, and investors are chasing technologies and regions best positioned to deliver. For companies that power, produce, and manufacture, the question is no longer if but how fast the transition will redefine their footprint—and where to invest next.

With global energy investment surpassing three trillion USD, two trillion of it in clean technologies and infrastructure, industrial developers and tenants are rethinking how facilities are planned and built to evolve as technologies mature. Sites must be flexible, resilient, low-carbon, and future-proof for new processes, products, and partnerships. From energy hubs to advanced manufacturing campuses, architecture and engineering help to define and critically enable industrial competitiveness.

Different Pathways, Shared Direction

In the UK, government policy and public and private investments are accelerating low-carbon transformation. Frameworks such as the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy and Heat Network Transformation Programme are turning former industrial sites into low-carbon ecosystems. Our experience in consulting with one of Europe’s premier energy network and energy infrastructure leaders will result in two transformative, city-wide district heating systems, setting a new benchmark for sustainable urban energy. These energy centers are central to decarbonizing the large-scale heat networks and their ambitious net zero targets, translating policy ambition into built infrastructure—providing heating and cooling to a large portion of the city’s properties.

Canadian provinces are defining their own transition models. Alberta is leveraging its industrial base and infrastructure to pioneer clean hydrogen production, establish carbon-capture and storage hubs, and deploy modular clean-energy systems. Ontario is advancing electrification, grid modernization, and EV manufacturing, anchoring a corridor of innovation that connects utilities, manufacturers, and institutional users. Together, these efforts are reshaping Canada’s industrial landscape aligning investment, innovation, and infrastructure around a cleaner energy economy.

In the US, utilities and industrial operators are advancing clean-energy infrastructure through private investment. Companies in California have committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and a climate-positive system by 2050, aligning corporate strategy with long-term resilience goals. Organizations are modernizing central utilities by uniting operational efficiency and resilience within an integrated, low-carbon design.

Different starting points, one shared direction: decarbonization and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Urban-Integrated Energy Hubs: From Plant to Civic Asset

As compact, high-performance plants that distribute heat or power, urban energy centers are evolving from functional utilities into civic assets. They are now being designed as important landmarks integrated into the public realm. High-quality designs proudly demonstrating their positive, decarbonization values.

The UK embodies this shift. Borough councils are prioritizing new facilities that distribute low-carbon heat through rooftop air-source heat pumps, projected to cut emissions by more than 3,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually in a network’s first phase alone (equivalent to taking 2,000 cars off the road). Designed for tight urban sites, these energy centers balance technical precision with civic presence, integrating advanced systems within an architectural form that enhances its surroundings.

Design also activates impact at energy centers in retrofitted buildings. This approach preserves a building’s signature features while accommodating a new rooftop plant and acoustic screening. Air-source heat pumps are integrated into the existing facility, enabling measurable carbon savings while preserving the identity of an urban landmark.

Decarbonization, Efficiency, and Circular Energy Flows

Net zero requires more than cleaner fuels; it demands re-engineering how energy moves through systems. Circular energy models are creating closed loops where waste heat, renewables, and advanced controls work together to reduce demand and emissions.

The Bradford Energy Centre and regional data center show this integration in practice. The energy center generates hot water for the city’s district heating network. Adjacent to it, the data center captures waste heat from high-performance computing as heat energy to feed that network. It’s a symbiotic ecosystem linking digital and industrial infrastructure to decarbonize urban districts.

Beyond these new builds and energy or data centers, retrofit strategies are transforming other legacy assets. Modernized hospital systems are introducing low-carbon energy infrastructure even in remote island environments. In the Scotch whisky sector, distilleries integrating mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) technology now reuse process heat once lost to the atmosphere—an approach that is moving an energy-intensive industry toward lower-carbon production.

With integrated architectural and engineering design, efficiency is embedded from foundation to façade, reducing energy use, lowering emissions, and increasing resilience across the asset lifecycle.

Flexibility, Resilience, and Future-Proofing

Viability assessments, feasibility studies, and master plans are as critical to the energy transition as design. Technologies shift, markets adjust, and supply chains adapt, making flexibility a strategic advantage.

Our approach with energy centers incorporates water source heat pumps, electrolysis systems, and large-scale thermal storage in the design. Located at large power stations and manufacturing sites, the energy centers capture industrial waste heat from their cooling processes to provide heat, to support and further decarbonize the city-wide heat network.

The same principle is reshaping North America. For developers and operators, adaptable infrastructure hedges against both regulatory uncertainty and technological change, preserving asset value as markets evolve. Flexibility delivers continuity, resilience the return on investment.

Multi-Stakeholder and Community Value

Clean-energy infrastructure delivers more than carbon reduction. It creates shared civic and economic value. Collaboration across sectors is redefining how energy assets are financed, designed, and operated, reflecting the growing influence of ESG-driven investment priorities.

In the UK, operational energy plants merge with educational and exhibition spaces, connecting industrial innovation to workforce development and community engagement. Here, infrastructure inspires, informs, and strengthens regional economies—a growing priority for public funders and private investors.

Collaboration is also increasingly market driven. The path toward net zero and climate-positive goals includes partnerships with communities and suppliers to advance local resilience. In the US, modernization of central utilities integrates workforce training and operational research, linking infrastructure investment to knowledge creation.

Projects that deliver co-benefits (environmental, social, and economic) are not only more fundable, but they’re also more enduring. The infrastructure of transition succeeds when it serves both its operators and its communities.

Building the Infrastructure of Transition

Across regions, whether through retrofits that preserve identity or modular systems that scale with demand, design is both the expression and the engine of transition.

To make that transition real, our Industrial designers reflect occupancy behavior, schedules, and operating conditions to deliver systems that meet or exceed sustainability targets.",https://norr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IA-Clean-Energy-Infrastructure-Hero-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 16:02:42.892394

By Vallari Srivastava and Laila Kearney

Dec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. utility company NextEra Energy has expanded its partnership with Alphabet's Google Cloud to build new energy supplies for the company's operations across the U.S., the groups said on Monday.

NextEra and Google currently have ​3.5 gigawatts of electricity generation - enough to power about 2.5 million homes - in operation or contracted.

As part of the new deal, ‌the companies will develop multiple new large-scale data center campuses in the U.S. that will be built with new power plants. They did not specify how much extra capacity ‌would be added, or financial details of the agreement.

NextEra shares were down 1% by 1722 GMT, having risen in premarket trading.

The agreement comes as U.S. electricity demand reaches record highs from the proliferation of data centers needed to train and roll out artificial intelligence.

Without enough supplies readily available on the existing grid, giant technology companies are contracting to build new electricity sources to power their AI data center expansion.

""We are positioning our company around bring-your-own-generation, ⁠and we are uniquely positioned to win this,"" NextEra ‌CEO John Ketchum said at an investor conference.

NextEra and Google Cloud also plan to launch an AI-powered product by mid-2026 that will help manage work in the field, predicting energy equipment problems and other functions aimed at ‍increasing the reliability of the grid, the companies said.

NextEra said it expects to add 15 gigawatts, or possibly much more, of new power generation for data centers by 2035.

Also to serve that demand, NextEra will partner with ExxonMobil to develop natural-gas-fired power plants for data centers that use carbon capture technologies.

Plans with Exxon include ​an initial 1.2-gigawatt gas plant, which would be jointly marketed to data centers, that would be located near the oil major's carbon ‌dioxide-carrying pipeline in the Southeast U.S., NextEra said.

RENEWED INTEREST IN NUCLEAR POWER

In October, NextEra announced that it would restart its shut Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to power Google data centers under a 25-year power purchase contract.

The technology industry's quest for massive amounts of electricity for AI processing has renewed interest in nuclear power supply, which includes restarting fully shut reactors, expanding the capacity of operating plants, and contracting for electricity from future small modular reactors.

That electricity demand has also propelled the development of natural-gas-fired power, which is quicker to build than nuclear, but ⁠produces global warming emissions.

NextEra said it expects to announce new natural-gas-fired power deals for ​data centers in 12–24 months.

NextEra said it had also signed 11 power purchase agreements ​and two energy storage agreements with Meta Platforms, totaling over 2.5 GW of energy contracts. The projects are scheduled to come online between 2026 and 2028.

The utility has also reached an agreement with WPPI Energy to continue supplying 168 ‍megawatts of the output from the ⁠Point Beach Nuclear Plant in Two Rivers into the 2050s.

NextEra forecast higher adjusted profit in 2026 as well as the current year as it continues to benefit from the power demand surge.

The company now expects adjusted earnings for 2025 of between $3.62 and $3.70 per ⁠share, compared with its prior view of between $3.45 and $3.70 per share.

For 2026, it expects adjusted profit between $3.92 and $4.02 per share, compared with its prior view of between $3.63 and $4.00 per ‌share.

The initiative will be carried out through the Center for Aquatic Technology Transfer, a Forest Service office in Blacksburg that focuses on aquatic ecosystem science and management in national forests.

Virginia Tech will lead the human resources component, hiring and training technicians and crew leaders to conduct fieldwork. With the ability to call on current graduate students as well as connections to alumni with experience conducting analysis in a forest environment, the university can rapidly contract 20 employees to form teams and begin critical data collection in early 2026.

The benefit to the university comes in the experience students receive in providing this vital field research.

“We facilitate the hiring process, and we also facilitate the science to allow all of our federal scientists to engage with the resources of the university, not only the people we work with at the Forest Service,” said Joel Snodgrass, head of the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation. “For the university, and especially for our students, we get this access to funding opportunities for experiential learning and opportunities for graduate student projects. It works a lot like most of the other embedded federal scientists that we have with us.”

Thousands of acres of national forest were damaged by Helene in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Most funding stems from damage in North Carolina, but the work spans the entire Southern Appalachian region.

The project aims to document, evaluate, and prioritize hurricane-related damage to aquatic and forest ecosystems. Field teams will assess entire watersheds, giving forest managers data to identify high-priority areas for remediation and plan interventions that restore ecological integrity, improve public safety, and support long-term forest health.

Colin Krause, a fisheries biologist at the Center for Aquatic Technology Transfer, said initial work will focus on North Carolina and Virginia.

“The teams are going to be focused initially on storm damage assessments, where the teams are able to walk the entire lengths of streams within watersheds, on Forest Service lands, trying to find out where these damaged feature locations are,” Krause said. “They're looking for damaged items. They're looking for sites that are damaged or under the threat of damage, such as things like ecological integrity and forest health, or things that might impact human life or health.”",https://news.vt.edu/content/news_vt_edu/en/articles/2025/12/cnre-heleneassessmentgrant/_jcr_content/image.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 14:02:35.087536

Major headaches.

The 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling inSackett v. EPA was supposed to make it easier for farmers and other landowners to navigate, no pun intended, Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) law. The 5-4 majority decision written by Justice Samuel A. Alito rejected the court’s tortured logic in Rapanos v. U.S. that left stakeholders without clarity in favor of something more straightforward:

“In sum, we hold that the [Clean Water Act] extends to only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are ‘waters of the United States’ in their own right,” so that they are ‘indistinguishable’ from those waters.”

There isn’t much wiggle room in Alito’s decision. Only wetlands that have a continuous and indistinguishable surface connection to a larger regulated body of water may be regulated by the CWA.

But that’s not how the Environmental Protection Agency sees it. Just ask Iowa landowner Dan Ward, who wanted to build a pond that would have torn up a farm ditch on his property. Under its amended WOTUS regulation in the wake of Sackett, EPA ruled Ward’s only-seasonally wet ditch qualified as a relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing body of water.

The goofy folk at EPA demanded Ward pay for an assessment. And an archaeology study. And a wildlife habitat study. And, oh yeah, submit a plan to restore or build a new stream of equal size to replace the farm ditch. That’s insane.

But now there’s a new proposal looking to conform Waters of the U.S. with the Sackett ruling; released last month, it provides fresh definitions for key terms including “relatively permanent”:

“In this proposal, the agencies define ‘relatively permanent’ to mean ‘standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year round or at least during the wet season.’ Consistent with the Sackett decision, ephemeral waters (i.e., those with surface water flowing or standing only in direct response to precipitation (e.g., rain or snow fall) ) are not jurisdictional because they are not relatively permanent.”

I imagine Ward is somewhere applauding a return to sanity.

But there’s more. The proposal also attempts to provide clarity to “continuous surface connection” language:

“In this proposal, however, the agencies would define ‘continuous surface connection’ for the first time to mean ‘having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.’ Thus, the agencies’ proposed definition of ‘continuous surface connection’ provides a two-prong test that requires both (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.”

Certainly, agricultural interests must be heartened by EPA’s exclusions to “ditches dug in dry land regardless of flow,” prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems.

Environmental groups believe the WOTUS proposal is Armageddon. Just listen to Waterkeeper Alliance:

“By narrowing the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act, this reinterpretation removes federal safeguards from many rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, and other vital waterways. Without oversight, these waters face increased risks from pollution, threatening clean drinking water, recreation, fisheries, and aquatic life.”

I’m not sure it’s all that. Generally speaking, I’m in favor of laws and regulations that everyone can wrap their heads around. Farmers shouldn’t have to hire a world-class law team to determine the legalities of digging a pond.

But you know as well as I, that whatever the EPA finally lands on in a final ruling sometime next year won’t be final. Not even close. If Democrats take back the White House in 2028, there will be another shiny new WOTUS proposal. Not to mention in the interim any number of lawsuits filed after EPA publishes WOTUS changes in the Federal Register.

What recent history has shown is that WOTUS regulations are temporal, amounting to a hamster spinning on its exercise wheel. A functioning Congress could codify WOTUS definitions. But it’s dysfunctional. Congress can’t even produce a federally-mandated new Farm Bill — instead relying on year-to-year extensions and, most recently, some updates Republicans snuck into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

None of this is lost on the nation’s farmers. Missouri Farm Bureau President Garrett Hawkins told EPA during a May listening session that “We’ve seen WOTUS definitions, guidance and legal arguments change with each administration” and that “farmers, land owners and small businesses are the ones who suffer the most when we don’t have clear rules.”

Unfortunately, EPA’s new WOTUS plan, no matter how well intended it might be, is at best a bandage for more systemic problems that can’t be solved with a rewrite. The feds have shown themselves incapable of reaching anything resembling a bipartisan solution. EPA says the new WOTUS plan inspires to give states a more significant role:

“This proposal recognizes that states and tribes know their local land and water resources best. The proposed definition of WOTUS protects water quality by affirming federal protections where appropriate and supporting the role of states and tribes as primary regulators managing their own land and water resources. Cooperative federalism has been a cornerstone of Clean Water Act implementation and the agency’s proposed WOTUS rule at last fulfills that commitment to real, shared federal and state responsibility.”

To that I say, we’ll see. It sounds noble, working together for the greater good. But it’s not outrageous to ask if EPA can actually deliver on that promise.

It makes me wonder if perhaps a better long-term solution is to turn over most of WOTUS regulation directly to state governments, and scale back the number of waterways and wetlands that fall under federal jurisdiction.
