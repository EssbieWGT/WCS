“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said.
Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.","There were some highs amid a lot of lows in a roller coaster year for clean energy as President Donald Trump worked to boost polluting fuels while blocking wind and solar, according to dozens of energy developers, experts and politicians.

Surveyed by The Associated Press, many described 2025 as turbulent and challenging for clean energy, though there was progress as projects connected to the electric grid. They said clean energy must continue to grow to meet skyrocketing demand for electricity to power data centers and to lower Americans’ utility bills.

Solar builder and operator Jorge Vargas said it has been “a very tough year for clean energy” as Trump often made headlines criticizing renewable energy and Republicans muscled a tax and spending cut bill through Congress in July that dramatically rolled back tax breaks for clean energy.

“There was a cooldown effect this year,” said Vargas, cofounder and CEO of Aspen Power. “Having said that, we are a resilient industry.”

Plug Power president Jose Luis Crespo said the developments — both policy recalibration and technological progress — will shape clean energy’s trajectory for years to come.

Energy policy whiplash in 2025

Much of clean energy’s fate in 2025 was driven by booster Joe Biden’s exit from the White House.

The year began with ample federal subsidies for clean energy technologies, a growing number of U.S.-based companies making parts and materials for projects and a lot of demand from states and corporations, said Tom Harper, partner at global consultant Baringa.

It ends with subsidies stripped back, a weakened supply chain, higher costs from tariffs and some customers questioning their commitment to clean energy, Harper said. He described the year as “paradigm shifting.”

Trump called wind and solar power “the scam of the century” and vowed not to approve new projects. The federal government canceled grants for hundreds of projects.

The Republicans’ tax bill reversed or steeply curtailed clean energy programs established through the Democrats’ flagship climate and health care bill in 2022. Wayne Winegarden, at the Pacific Research Institute think tank, said the time has come for alternative energy to demonstrate viability without subsidies. ( Fossil fuels also receive subsidies.)

Many energy executives said this was the most consequential policy shift. The bill reshaped the economics of clean energy projects, drove a rush to start construction before incentives expire and forced developers to reassess their strategies for acquiring parts and materials, Lennart Hinrichs said. He leads the expansion of TWAICE in the Americas, providing analytics software for battery energy storage systems.

Companies can’t make billion-dollar investments with so much policy uncertainty, said American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet.

Consequently, greenhouse gas emissions will fall at a much lower rate than previously projected in the U.S., said Brian Murray, director of the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability at Duke University.

Still, solar and battery storage are booming

Solar and storage accounted for 85% of the new power added to the grid in the first nine months of the Trump administration, according to Wood Mackenzie research.

That’s because the economics remain strong, demand is high and the technologies can be deployed quickly, said Mike Hall, CEO of Anza Renewables.

Solar energy company Sol Systems said it had a record year as it brought its largest utility-scale project online and grew its business. The energy storage systems company CMBlu Energy said storage clearly stands out as a winner this year too, moving from optional to essential.

“Trump’s effort to manipulate government regulation to harm clean energy just isn’t enough to offset the natural advantages that clean energy has,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said. “The direction is still all good.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association said that no matter the policies in Washington, solar and storage will grow as the backbone of the nation’s energy future.

Nuclear and geothermal had a good year, too

Democrats and Republicans have supported investing to keep nuclear reactors online, restart previously closed reactors and deploy new, advanced reactor designs. Nuclear power is a carbon-free source of electricity, though not typically labeled as green energy like other renewables.

“Who had ‘restart Three Mile Island’ on their 2025 Bingo card?” questioned Baringa partner David Shepheard. The Pennsylvania plant was the site of the nation’s worst commercial nuclear power accident, in 1979. The Energy Department is loaning $1 billion to help finance a restart.

Everyone loves nuclear, said Darrin Kayser, executive vice president at Edelman. It helps that the technology for small, modular reactors is starting to come to fruition, Kayser added.

Benton Arnett, a senior director at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that as the need for clean, reliable power intensifies, “we will look back on the actions being taken now as laying the foundation.”

The Trump administration also supports geothermal energy, and the tax bill largely preserved geothermal tax credits. The Geothermal Rising association said technologies continue to mature and produce, making 2025 a breakthrough year.

Offshore wind had a terrible year

Momentum for offshore wind in the United States came to a grinding halt just as the industry was starting to gain traction, said Joey Lange, a senior managing director at Trio, a global sustainability and energy advisory company.

The Trump administration stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped federal funding for offshore wind projects.

That has decimated the projects, developers and tech innovators, and no one in wind is raising or spending capital, said Eric Fischgrund, founder and CEO at FischTank PR. Still, Fischgrund said he remains optimistic because the world is transitioning to cleaner energy.

More clean energy needed in 2026

An energy strategy with a diverse mix of sources is the only way forward as demand grows from data centers and other sources, and as people demand affordable, reliable electricity, said former Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu. Landrieu, now with Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, said promoting or punishing specific energy technologies on ideological grounds is unsustainable.

Experts expect solar and battery storage to continue growing in 2026 to add a lot of power to the grid quickly and cheaply. The market will continue to ensure that most new electricity is renewable, said Amanda Levin, policy analysis director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Hillary Bright, executive director of Turn Forward, thinks offshore wind will still play an important role too. It is both ready and needed to help address the demand for electricity in the new year, which will become increasingly clear “to all audiences,” she said. Turn Forward advocates for offshore wind.

That skyrocketing demand “is shaking up the political calculus that drove the administration’s early policy decisions around renewables,” she said.

BlueWave CEO Sean Finnerty thinks that states, feeling the pressure to deliver affordable, reliable electricity, will increasingly drive clean energy momentum in 2026 by streamlining permitting and the process of connecting to the grid, and by reducing costs for things like permits and fees.

Ed Gunn, Lunar Energy’s vice president for revenue, said the industry has weathered tough years before.

“The fundamentals are unchanged,” Gunn said, “there is massive value in clean energy.”

The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

Redwood Materials Inc., a battery recycling venture led by Tesla Inc. co-founder JB Straubel, has begun operations at a $3.5 billion factory in South Carolina that will supply badly needed critical materials.

The company has brought a system online that’s capable of recovering 20,000 metric tons of critical minerals annually, said Straubel. Initially founded to fill a gap in the electric vehicle battery supply chain, Redwood is in the midst of a broader shift in strategy as it navigates an expected slowdown in EV demand.

The pivot also comes at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing to onshore the supply chain for materials essential to US national security.

Taking into account Redwood’s existing recycling plant in Sparks, Nevada, which recovers 60,000 tons of critical minerals annually, the firm says it is now the only major domestic source of cobalt and produces as much nickel and lithium as the largest mines in the US.

The South Carolina facility isn’t operating at full capacity, and the company declined to set a ramp-up timeline. It also declined to provide a breakdown of how much of each mineral it’s recovering at the facility.

Redwood was founded in 2017 to recycle EV batteries and produce materials like cathodes and copper foils for anodes. The company had said in 2022 that it planned to produce enough materials for a million EVs annually by 2025 and 5 million by 2030, and it had agreements with Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Volvo, among others.

Yet its commercial cathode production facility in Nevada, which was slated to open in 2024 and produce 100 gigawatt-hours of battery components by this year, is still under construction with no announced opening date. While the company had planned to expand copper foil production at both of its facilities, it stopped producing it in Nevada and no longer plans to do so in South Carolina.

The industry has also faced challenges from the Trump administration, which recently canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to other battery recyclers. With the administration’s attacks on EVs further impacting the industry, including winding down federal incentives in September, Redwood has increased its focus on finding other buyers. The bulk of the critical minerals the company produces are going to customers outside the EV sector, Straubel said.

“The nickel and cobalt markets are largely not driven by batteries. They’re not the biggest consumers of those particular elements,” Straubel said.

Nickel is used in stainless steel; specialty alloys, or a custom metal blend for niche applications; and industrial chemicals, while cobalt is also used in a number of high-performance alloys like those found in jet engines. While he declined to name them, Straubel said Redwood sells its critical minerals to about 20 to 30 companies, including large industrial customers using the materials in products and mining companies that process and refine them.

The company has also shifted its focus to serving data centers’ burgeoning power demand, starting a new unit this year called Redwood Energy that turns degraded EV batteries into grid-scale energy storage systems. Retired EV batteries can still work for large-scale energy storage because those systems put less strain on the hardware. In June, it unveiled a modest 63 megawatt-hour system – the equivalent of about 800 EV battery packs – paired with 12 megawatts of solar on its Nevada campus, powering a 2,000 GPU data center.

Redwood raised a $350 million Series E at a valuation of more than $6 billion last month in part to speed up energy storage deployment. That side of the business is “growing faster” and is “a new focus that we didn’t really know we were going to have a few years ago,” Straubel said.

But if an administration is defined by what it does, this White House has been anything but transparent and accessible.

In February, the Trump administration barred AP reporters and photographers from covering White House events for not obeying the president’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. A federal court declared the banishment a violation of the organization’s free speech rights.

In September, the Department of Defense required journalists to sign a document promising not to use any material, classified or unclassified, that was not approved for publication by officials. Those who refused lost physical access to the Pentagon. A lawsuit by The New York Times claims the policy prevents “scrutiny by independent news organizations for the public benefit,” in violation of the 1st Amendment.

In December, the Inspector General for the Pentagon found that by sharing information on an unsecure messaging app about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth risked the safety of U.S. forces. Hegseth refused to sit for an interview with Inspector General Steven Stebbins. In a written statement, Hegseth said he had a right to declassify the information but did not indicate that he had done so. A Pentagon official claimed the report constituted “a total exoneration.”

Not coincidentally, President Trump himself has broken with historic norms, by firing 17 inspectors general, leaving 75 percent of presidentially appointed inspector general positions vacant, and blocking funds appropriated by Congress for the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. The administration, which has been slow to respond to Freedom of Information requests, is apparently about to impose a rule ending long-standing legal protection for whistleblowers employed by the federal government.

Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Justice to release Office of Legal Counsel documents arguing that airstrikes on alleged drug smugglers are legal. “Prompt disclosure of these records,” the plaintiffs assert, “is critically important to ensuring informed public disclosure about the U.S. military’s unprecedented strikes.”

Legal experts, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and some U.S. military personnel have expressed concerns that drug trafficking doesn’t meet accepted definitions of threats to national security, armed conflict or foreign terrorism. Smugglers haven’t attacked U.S. citizens, have due process rights, and aren’t subject to a death penalty; the alleged list of targets reportedly includes cartels not heretofore designated as terrorist organizations; and most drugs enter the United States through Mexico. Because the U.S. is not in an armed conflict with drug traffickers, critics believe the strikes constitute “extrajudicial killings” — or, more simply, murder.

Nonetheless, the Pentagon has rebuffed requests from members of Congress to review the OLC opinion. The Constitution, U.S. Army general counsel Charles Young maintains, gives the president discretion over releasing information. Young didn’t explain why Trump didn’t exercise that discretion as part of his commitment to transparency.

Asked whether he supported releasing the unedited video of the second strike on a boat that killed two shipwrecked survivors on Sept. 2, Trump replied, “I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have, we’d certainly release, no problem.” A few days later, he asserted, “I didn’t say that. That is ABC fake news.” He then attacked the “obnoxious” reporter who asked him about it. This week, Secretary Hegseth said he would not publicly release the full video.

We have seen this movie before. As he pleaded for the administration to be “as transparent as possible” on the airstrikes, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) made the connection explicit: “We’ve got to release the video. Look, we [also] have to get the Epstein files released.”

Asked in June 2024 whether he would declassify the controversial Epstein files if re-elected as president, Trump, who knew that MAGA influencers including Elon Musk, Laura Loomer, Alex Jones and Kash Patel were leading the charge, said “yeah, yeah, I would.” In September, he repeated, “I’d do the Epstein. I’d have no problem with it.”

In February 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi declared Epstein files were “sitting on my desk right now to review. That’s been a directive by President Trump.” She then released “the first phase” of documents, most of them already in the public domain.

Trump then changed his mind. Bondi said there was “no client list.” Fake news networks, Democrats and “soft and foolish Republicans,” the president claimed, were focusing on “this creep” to undermine his agenda.

The files , he said, “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” The FBI should investigate other things, like voter fraud, and “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein.” A lot of people “could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be,” Trump said. While insisting, “I don’t care about it, released or not,” he pressured Republicans in the House to refuse to sign or withdraw their names from a discharge petition requiring a vote on a bill compelling the Justice Department to release all the files.

When that effort failed, Trump took credit for telling Republicans to do what they had already decided to do: “Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous.”

“President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years,” a White House spokesperson asserted, and calling for “investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”

Once upon a time, Trump appeared to be a born-again proponent of transparency. His lack of faith, however, has been far more frequent, long-lasting and consequential.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

As Brussels continues to refine its industrial and climate agenda, the warning from one of Europe’s largest automakers points to the stakes.
For companies like Stellantis, the challenge is not only adapting to new technologies, but deciding whether Europe remains a place where long-term automotive investment makes economic and strategic sense.","Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa has issued a blunt warning that the European Union’s latest package of measures for the auto industry could undermine long-term investment in the region, deepening uncertainty for manufacturers already under pressure from weak demand, high costs, and intensifying global competition.

Speaking to the Financial Times in an interview published on Saturday, Filosa said the proposals unveiled by the European Commission earlier this week lack the urgency and coherence needed to revive growth in Europe’s automotive sector, which remains one of the bloc’s most strategically important industries.

“There are none of the urgent measures needed to return the European automotive sector to growth,” Filosa said. “Without growth, it becomes very difficult to think about investing more.”

The Commission’s plan, announced on Tuesday, includes a controversial shift on climate policy by effectively dropping the EU’s planned ban on the sale of new combustion-engine cars from 2035.

The move has exposed deep divisions within the industry and among policymakers. While some automakers and member states argue that easing the rule offers breathing space amid slowing electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure gaps, others fear it dilutes regulatory clarity and weakens Europe’s credibility in the global transition to cleaner transport.

For Stellantis, which operates 14 brands including Peugeot, Fiat, Opel, Citroën, Jeep, and Alfa Romeo, the concern goes beyond the fate of internal combustion engines. Filosa framed the issue as one of strategic certainty and industrial confidence, arguing that frequent policy shifts make it harder for companies to commit capital to European factories, suppliers, and innovation hubs.

He said that without sustained and predictable investment, Europe risks losing its ability to build a resilient automotive supply chain, something he linked directly to employment, competitiveness, and security.

“Without additional investments, it becomes very difficult to build the resilient supply chain that is vital for European jobs, European prosperity and European security,” Filosa told the FT.

In an official statement released after the Commission’s announcement, Stellantis said the proposals failed to tackle several structural challenges facing the sector. The company pointed to the absence of a clear and comprehensive roadmap for light commercial vehicles, a segment that underpins logistics, trades, and small businesses across the continent. It also criticized the lack of flexibility around the EU’s 2030 emissions targets for passenger cars, which it said do not adequately reflect market realities or consumer affordability concerns.

The criticism comes at a delicate moment for Europe’s car industry. Automakers are grappling with slowing vehicle sales, stubbornly high energy and labor costs, and fierce competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, many of which benefit from lower production costs and strong state backing. At the same time, European manufacturers are being asked to fund multiple transitions at once: electrification, software-driven vehicles, autonomous technologies, and ever-stricter environmental and safety standards.

Industry executives have repeatedly argued that regulation alone cannot drive the transition. They have called for stronger demand-side measures, including purchase incentives, accelerated deployment of charging infrastructure, and policies to lower the cost of energy and raw materials. Without such support, they warn, consumers will delay purchases and manufacturers will struggle to justify large-scale investments.

The contrast with other regions has become increasingly stark. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act has unlocked billions of dollars in subsidies and tax credits for electric vehicles, batteries, and clean manufacturing, attracting major investment from global automakers and suppliers. Filosa’s remarks echo a growing concern among European executives that capital could increasingly flow to markets offering clearer incentives and more stable policy frameworks.

While the Commission has argued that its revised approach aims to balance climate goals with industrial competitiveness, Stellantis’ response highlights fears that the package delivers neither decisively. Easing the 2035 combustion-engine deadline may reduce near-term pressure, but Filosa suggested that without a credible growth strategy, it risks prolonging uncertainty rather than resolving it.
