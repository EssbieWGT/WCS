Continental Resources, which bills itself as the biggest privately owned oil and natural gas producer in the world, will be in attendance, as will HKN Inc., which was formerly known as Harken Energy.

Several of the companies have connections to Denver, Colorado, the home turf of Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and a relatively small hub for oil and gas activity compared to other parts of the United States.

Oil output in PADD 4, the production region that includes Colorado, totaled 1.02 million barrels per day in October, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. PADD 3, which includes states like Texas and New Mexico, produced 10.28 million bpd that month.

Oil infrastructure is far more robust, with all of the gas stations that line up U.S. streets and highways.
Any shift to traditional vehicles over electric vehicles will create more headwinds for EV infrastructure companies.","Electric vehicle stocks haven’t fared well ever since the EV tax credit expired on September 30, 2025. While some companies delivered excellent results leading up to the deadline, that’s more of a reflection of last-second buyers than a long-term trend that puts electric vehicles back on top.

The EV boom peaked during the pandemic, with SPACs making the public markets more accessible to questionable companies like Nikola Motors. While investors are always looking for good opportunities to buy dips, the drops in EV stocks may not be the best opportunities. These are some of the reasons why.

A Major Incentive Is Gone

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the leading EV maker in the U.S., and even its status as a luxury auto manufacturer couldn’t save it from declining market share. The company delivered 418,227 vehicles in Q4 2025, which is a decline from 495,570 deliveries in Q4 2024. That’s a 15.6% year-over-year decline.

It’s also an accelerated dip from Tesla’s overall decrease in deliveries in the full-year 2025. The automaker delivered 1.6 million vehicles in 2025 compared to 1.8 million vehicles in 2024, marking an 8.6% year-over-year decline. Q4 2025 is the first full quarter of the EV tax credit’s expiration. The drop was immediate for Tesla and accelerated heading into the end of 2025.

Tesla wasn’t the only EV maker to sell fewer vehicles. Competitors like Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) also lost market share. Buying an EV was once a path to a tax credit of up to $7,500. That’s a major incentive, and now it’s gone. Many consumers have followed suit and feel less inclined to buy electric vehicles.

Trump’s Push Into Venezuela And Greenland Can Reduce Oil Costs

President Trump’s recent capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his desire to acquire Greenland can dramatically increase the U.S. oil supply, and that will translate into lower gas prices. As the cost of fuel goes down, more people will want to drive traditional vehicles over electric cars.

It’s another headwind for electric vehicles, and although Trump hasn’t fully capitalized on this opportunity, oil prices are already falling. The lack of EV tax credits, combined with more affordable gas, can result in a prolonged correction for EV stocks and electric vehicle deliveries.

EV Infrastructure May Also Face Setbacks

Reduced demand for electric vehicles isn’t just bad for automakers. It also hurts the companies that install EV chargers across the country. Blink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is officially a penny stock and has resorted to crypto payment offerings at select stations to boost demand. ChargePoint (NASDAQ:CHPT) is another struggling EV infrastructure stock that is down by more than 70% this year due to stalled revenue growth and significant net losses.

Oil infrastructure is far more robust, with all of the gas stations that line up U.S. streets and highways. Any shift to traditional vehicles over electric vehicles will create more headwinds for EV infrastructure companies. Those same companies may go out of business due to excessive debt and declining demand. In that scenario, the EV makers suddenly become responsible for scaling their infrastructure in addition to selling vehicles.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2190848931-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 15:59:42.560550

General Motors (GM), once at the forefront of this transition, is now facing a major setback.
The company recently announced $6 billion in charges for the fourth quarter of 2025, reflecting the financial strain of declining EV sales and the expiration of key US EV tax credits.
This follows a $1.6 billion charge in the previous quarter, bringing the total EV-related financial impact for the year to $7.6 billion.
Max Zhang, CTO at Digital Solutions, commented, “General Motors’ staggering $7.1 billion charge is a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry.","The electric vehicle (EV) market has long been seen as the future of the automotive industry, with promises of reduced emissions, innovative technology, and a shift away from fossil fuels. Automakers worldwide have invested billions to transition their fleets to electric power, driven by government incentives, stricter environmental regulations, and growing consumer interest in sustainable transportation. However, the road to electrification has proven more challenging than anticipated, with fluctuating policies, high production costs, and uneven EV adoption creating significant hurdles.

General Motors (GM), once at the forefront of this transition, is now facing a major setback. The company recently announced $6 billion in charges for the fourth quarter of 2025, reflecting the financial strain of declining EV sales and the expiration of key US EV tax credits. This development, reported by the Associated Press (AP), underscores the challenges posed by declining EV sales, the expiration of federal tax credits, and the easing of emissions standards.

The charges, detailed in GM’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, include $1.8 billion in non-cash impairments and $4.2 billion in supplier settlements, contract cancellations, and other costs. This follows a $1.6 billion charge in the previous quarter, bringing the total EV-related financial impact for the year to $7.6 billion. GM’s shares slid nearly 3% on Friday in response to the news.

Policy shifts and market realities

The expiration of the US EV tax credit in September 2025 has significantly impacted GM’s challenges, which offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones. It was a key factor driving EV consumer demand. Without these incentives, EV sales have declined, leading automakers to rethink their bold electrification strategies.

GM had previously announced plans to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025, aiming to make the majority of its fleet electric by 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. However, these goals are now in question as the company scales back its EV strategy. The relaxed emissions standards under the Trump administration have further complicated the transition, creating uncertainty for automakers.

Industry perspectives on LinkedIn

The news has sparked widespread discussion on LinkedIn, with industry professionals weighing in on the implications for GM and the broader automotive sector. Max Zhang, CTO at Digital Solutions, commented, “General Motors’ staggering $7.1 billion charge is a wake-up call for the entire automotive industry. The transition to electric vehicles was built on fragile policy promises, not genuine consumer demand. GM's struggle to honor contracts amidst evaporating federal tax credits showcases a crucial miscalculation—one that many automakers are now repeating.”

Dan Sheehan, Director of Portfolio Management, shared a similar sentiment, stating, “The early end of federal tax credits, slower consumer adoption, and rising cost sensitivity have forced automakers to pivot away from aggressive EV buildouts. GM was among the earliest to commit tens of billions to the transition, but the market that materialized was smaller and slower than forecast.”

These opinions highlight the broader challenges facing legacy automakers as they navigate the complexities of electrification. Ford, for example, recently announced nearly $20 billion in charges tied to its own EV strategy adjustments, further illustrating the difficulties of transitioning to electric power. It also ends F-150 Lightning production.

Looking ahead

Despite the setbacks, GM remains committed to its long-term EV goals. The company is now focused on lowering production costs and tightening commercial terms to adapt to market realities. Additional EV-related charges are expected in 2026, though at lower levels.

As GM prepares to announce its fourth-quarter results on January 27, the financial effects of these charges will be carefully examined. The company’s future will need precise adjustments to balance short-term gains with the potential for lasting innovation.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt164d06c6aba93641/65143345946cdee2b7fde852/F-150_20Lightning_Platinum_on-road_02.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 15:59:48.140676

Pearce’s persistent calls for the privatization of public lands are alarming, especially for the millions of Americans who mere months ago witnessed—and emphatically opposed—the sell-off attempt in the reconciliation package,” the letter reads.
Source New Mexico’s phone call about the letter to Lee’s office was not immediately returned Friday.
Lee is expected to schedule Pearce’s confirmation hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the “coming weeks,” Heinrich spokesperson Luis Soriano told Source.
The full Senate would vote on his confirmation afterward, if the committee recommends it.","More than 80 environmental groups on Thursday called on U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) to oppose Republican former New Mexico congressman Steve Pearce’s nomination to lead the nation’s largest land management agency, decrying his “absolute disdain for the 245 million acres of public lands he has now been nominated to administer.”

President Donald Trump on Nov. 5 nominated Pearce to lead the Bureau of Land Management, an agency that oversees public lands, including for recreation, cattle grazing and extraction of oil and natural gas.

Pearce, who founded an oilfield services company before getting into politics, represented New Mexico’s Second Congressional District in the southern part of the state between 2003 and 2009, then again from 2011 to 2019. He was most recently chair of the state Republican Party until late 2024.

Trump nominates former NM GOP Congressman Steve Pearce to lead federal public lands agency

His nomination drew swift criticism from environmental groups in New Mexico and across the country, including Thursday in a letter from a coalition of 81 national and local environmental groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity, GreenPeace, WildEarth Guardians and the Santa Fe Forest Project.

The coalition sent the letter to Lee, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Heinrich, the ranking member, asking them to oppose Pearce’s nomination due to what members said is a long history of trying to undermine and privatize public lands. The letter cites his record in Congress, including his support in Trump’s first term of the president’s effort to shrink national monuments including Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments.

“Mr. Pearce’s persistent calls for the privatization of public lands are alarming, especially for the millions of Americans who mere months ago witnessed—and emphatically opposed—the sell-off attempt in the reconciliation package,” the letter reads.

Source New Mexico’s phone call about the letter to Lee’s office was not immediately returned Friday.

Lee is expected to schedule Pearce’s confirmation hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the “coming weeks,” Heinrich spokesperson Luis Soriano told Source. The full Senate would vote on his confirmation afterward, if the committee recommends it.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NMPBS-copy.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 14:59:18.463982

One way we should demonstrate this support is by ensuring that domestic demand for the crops they grow remains strong.
To be fair, some states do allow year-round E15, and for the past two years, the U.S. EPA has granted temporary waivers allowing E15 sales in all states through the summer.
A permanent year-round E15 policy would benefit everyday Americans and strengthen markets by providing predictable demand.
If we’re serious about national energy security, America should help our farmers contribute to it.","Wherever we live in America, sea to shining sea, we owe a debt to the farmers who feed us, fuel us and help clothe us. There is no question: Our nation’s farms and ranches are a big part of what makes this country great, and farmers deserve our unwavering support.

One way we should demonstrate this support is by ensuring that domestic demand for the crops they grow remains strong.

Ethanol made from American corn has been part of this country’s energy mix for decades—today, year-round, the gas in most of our cars is up to 10% ethanol, or E10. A modest 5% increase in this blend rate—that is, moving to E15 year-round—could grow domestic demand by as much as 6.9 billion gallons of ethanol, or roughly 2.4 billion bushels of American corn every year.

In addition to supporting the economic viability of our nation’s farms—and protecting them from geopolitical volatility—this move would also put money back in the pockets of everyday Americans, who would see prices at the pump go down about 18%, according to the American Farm Bureau.

However, federal regulations prevent E15 from being sold during summer months, despite the fact that it offers both emissions and cost savings. To be fair, some states do allow year-round E15, and for the past two years, the U.S. EPA has granted temporary waivers allowing E15 sales in all states through the summer. These are the right steps, but navigating a patchwork of rules and regulations and asking for federal permission every year is no way to run a business—or a farm.

A permanent year-round E15 policy would benefit everyday Americans and strengthen markets by providing predictable demand. This, in turn, would help farmers make informed planting and investment decisions, stabilizing rural economies and strengthening our national agricultural supply chain. The impact on food prices would also be negligible, if there’s any at all, since technological advances have allowed this country to produce more corn than it consumes.

Moving to year-round E15 would also see American energy policy catch up to policy in other countries: Brazil mandates a 27%-30% ethanol blend in gasoline and widely uses flex-fuel vehicles, and India plans to implement a 20% ethanol blend. If we’re serious about national energy security, America should help our farmers contribute to it.

Happily, expanding access to E15 enjoys broad bipartisan support, both in Congress and in our states, so this one important move should be easy to get across the line. That’s why we are calling on Congress to pass legislation allowing E15 sales year-round. By one estimate, this could add as much as $26 billion annually to America’s gross domestic product, supporting more than 128,000 jobs and generating more than $10 billion in revenue.

Most of this would flow straight to America’s heartland, in industries ranging from farming and manufacturing to construction and transportation. At a time when 80% of communities with persistent poverty are found in rural America, this move would result in real and important opportunities for millions of Americans.

Our country this year is celebrating 250 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence. As we do so, let’s remember that since the founding of this country, agriculture has been indispensable to our way of life. Americans are fortunate that, thanks to the hard work of our farmers, we have the ability to feed everyone who calls this country home. We have an opportunity today to accomplish something similar in transportation fuel—grown in America, used in America—and support our farmers and rural communities in the process.

Passing year-round E15 is a common-sense action Congress can take, right now, to support American farmers, lower prices at the pump and create a brighter future for this country—including the small towns and communities so many of us call home. We encourage our nation’s policymakers to act on this bipartisan priority.•

“For years, Ohioans were told taxpayer bailouts were the only way to keep nuclear plants running. This announcement proves the opposite. The private sector is stepping up to modernize, operate, and expand nuclear generation without relying on taxpayer dollars or shifting costs onto residential customers.”

AFP-OH also emphasized the importance of House Bill 15 in restoring confidence in Ohio’s energy policy framework and ending the state’s reliance on subsidies to prop up generation.

AFP-OH Legislative Director Hannah Kubbins said:

“House Bill 15 ended the taxpayer-funded subsidies that distorted Ohio’s energy market and sent a clear message that the state would no longer pick winners and losers. By closing the door on those bailouts, lawmakers created the certainty needed for private investment to step in and keep reliable nuclear power online without government support.”

Role: Commercial Junior Sales Executive: Bid & Sales Support

Location: England, UK (Hybrid)

An early-stage, fast-growing business in the UK’s electric fleet and transport decarbonisation sector is seeking a commercially minded Junior Sales Executive to support sales and bid activity. This is a hands-on commercial support role rather than a graduate position, working closely with senior commercial leadership on live opportunities, proposals, and tender submissions.

The role is well suited to someone at an early stage of their career who enjoys structured written work, coordination, and problem-solving. It may particularly appeal to individuals looking to transition from consulting, analysis, or similar roles into a commercial environment.

Key Responsibilities

Support live sales opportunities and bid activity across multiple customers and projects.

Draft, coordinate, and manage bid responses, tenders, pre-qualification questionnaires, and commercial proposals.

Coordinate bid inputs from internal stakeholders, managing timelines and ensuring submissions meet quality and compliance requirements.

Maintain accurate sales pipeline data, opportunity tracking, and internal reporting.

Conduct research into customers, markets, and upcoming commercial opportunities.

Support the preparation of sales materials, presentations, and customer-facing documentation.

Candidate Profile

Commercially focused, well organised, and highly self-motivated.

Comfortable operating in a small, entrepreneurial, and fast-paced environment.

Strong written communication skills with a high level of attention to detail.

Confident working directly with senior stakeholders and experienced professionals.

Proactive, dependable, and capable of managing multiple workstreams simultaneously.

Demonstrates a genuine interest in transport decarbonisation, electric vehicles, and the wider energy transition.

Experience

1–3 years’ experience in a commercial, sales support, bid, consulting, or business development role.

Exposure to bid writing, tenders, or structured written responses is advantageous.

Background or demonstrable interest in infrastructure, energy, transport, or sustainability sectors is beneficial.

This role offers a clear development pathway. In the first year, you’ll build strong commercial foundations through bid coordination, proposal ownership, and exposure to live opportunities. Over time, you’ll progress to owning smaller deals end to end, with direct customer engagement and commercial responsibility. As the business scales, there is strong potential to move into Sales Executive, Business Development, or Commercial Manager roles.",https://piper-maddox.sites.sourceflow.co.uk/og-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 15:59:58.762221

President Donald Trump’s sweeping freeze on offshore wind construction is starting to hurt his own party’s energy ambitions.

Just days before Christmas, the Trump administration halted work on all five large-scale offshore wind farms under construction in the U.S, citing unspecified national security concerns. The order may have come as a shock to the project developers, who received letters from the Interior Department only after Fox News publicly reported on the move, as Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler reported at the time.

All but one of the targeted developers have since sued the Trump administration. Danish developer Ørsted filed two separate suits over pauses to its nearly complete Revolution Wind — which the Interior already halted for a month last fall — and to Sunrise Wind. In another lawsuit, Equinor warned that the freeze would result in the ​“likely termination” of its Empire Wind project off New York, which also suffered a monthlong stop-work order last spring. And Dominion Energy is asking a judge to let construction resume on the utility’s Virginia project, once considered safe because it had the backing of the state’s outgoing Republican governor.

The halts are also sparking backlash on Capitol Hill that could derail some of the White House’s other energy plans. In the weeks leading up to the holidays, Congress had taken up what seemed like the millionth round of negotiations to reform energy-project permitting. Reforms are essential to Republicans’ goal of speeding fossil-fuel construction, and this time around, they’d actually made progress with the House’s passage of the SPEED Act, which had support from a handful of Democrats.

That bill requires 60 votes to clear the Senate, but with Republicans holding just 53 seats, it would need significant Democratic support. That won’t happen while the Interior’s stop-work order remains in place, two high-ranking Senate Democrats say.

“The illegal attacks on fully permitted renewable energy projects must be reversed if there is to be any chance that permitting talks resume,” Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said in a late December statement calling out the offshore wind halts. ​“There is no path to permitting reform if this administration refuses to follow the law.”

Congress reconvened this week, but Whitehouse affirmed that permitting talks won’t go anywhere until offshore wind construction is free to proceed.

More big energy stories

Venezuela is dominating the energy discussion

While the Trump administration used allegations of narcoterrorism to justify its invasion of Venezuela and seizure of leader Nicolás Maduro, pretty much every conversation since has revolved around the country’s oil resources. In his first news conference after Maduro’s capture, President Donald Trump said the U.S. would ​“run” Venezuela and control its oil production, and he has been pressuring American oil companies to reinvest in the South American nation.

But it’s not just oil that the White House is eyeing. An administration official told Latitude Media that Trump and the private sector may also target Venezuela’s critical mineral resources, though experts warn that little reliable data exists on those deposits and that the country’s mining sectors are in disarray.

More delayed coal-plant retirements

The U.S Department of Energy issued a wave of orders in the waning days of 2025 to keep coal power plants running past their retirement dates. The first targeted a plant in Centralia, Washington, which its owner had been planning to close since 2011. Next up came orders to keep two Indiana coal plants open until at least late March. And just before year’s end came another, this one targeting Unit 1 at Colorado’s Craig power plant.

Both the Craig facility and one of the units in Indiana have been out of commission due to mechanical failures since earlier in 2025, meaning their owners will now have to shoulder potentially huge repair costs to comply with the federal mandate, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports.

And the U.S. EPA may soon throw another lifeline to coal power. The agency plans to let 11 plants dump toxic coal ash into unlined pits years after current federal rules allow, Canary Media’s Kari Lydersen reports. Without the extension, those plants would likely shutter.

Dive Brief:

General Motors recorded $6 billion in electric vehicle-related charges primarily in North America in Q4 2025 as it realigns its strategy to produce more full-size internal combustion engine trucks and SUVs, according to a Jan. 8 securities filing.

The charges include a $1.8 billion non-cash write-down to devalue its EV manufacturing assets and another $4.2 billion in costs to settle related supplier contracts, which were primarily battery supply deals, per the filing.

The automaker cited weakening EV demand and the termination of certain consumer tax incentives, combined with a reduction of more stringent emissions regulations, for its strategic shift from EVs to producing more ICE vehicles.

Dive Insight:

In addition to the $6 billion in charges for North America, GM expects that its total charges in Q4 will be $7.1 billion. It includes an additional $1.1 billion in non-EV-related charges related to the restructuring of its China joint venture, SAIC General Motors, which is primarily related to the company’s share of supplier claims and additional legal accrual, per the filing.

In October 2025, GM’s Audit Committee also approved a $1.6 billion impairment charge as part of a strategic realignment of its electric vehicle manufacturing capacity. It included $1.2 billion in non-cash impairments and $400 million in cash costs for contract cancellations and settlements related to its previous EV investment strategy.

GM said that ramping up production of full-size trucks and SUVs will help it meet “unmet demand.”

“GM proactively reduced EV capacity, including by pivoting the company’s assembly plant in Orion, MI from EV production to the production of full-size SUVs and full-size pickups powered by internal combustion engines,” the automaker wrote in the securities filing.

However, the automaker stated that its realignment will not impact the current retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs already in production, which includes the Equinox, Bolt EV, Lyriq SUV, Silverado EV and Hummer EV. GM said it will continue to make these models available to customers.

Last October, the automaker confirmed to WardsAuto that it is cutting roughly 3,400 jobs at its EV and battery plants as it scales back EV production, including Factory Zero, the former Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly in Detroit, and its Ultium Cells battery plant in Warren, Ohio. The bulk of the layoffs were effective Jan. 5.

GM also warned of additional material cash and non-cash charges in 2026 related to supplier negotiations, but it expects they will be lower than 2025 figures. The automaker also warned that proposed changes to greenhouse-gas standards could devalue emissions credits, potentially leading to further impairments.

Ford Motor Co. is also abandoning its previous EV strategy due to low demand for vehicles such as the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E. In December, the automaker announced a major shift in its electrification plans, which includes ramping up production of ICE F-Series trucks and a pivot to extended-range hybrid vehicles and more affordable smaller EVs.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday proposed a rule that would limit the level of perchlorate in drinking water to 20 ppb, the latest development in a 15-year legal battle over the chemical, which is used in the production of solid rocket fuels, explosives, and fireworks, among other items.

In 2016 the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) sued the EPA for failing to implement limits on perchlorate that the agency had first proposed in 2011. In 2023 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit told the EPA that it must regulate perchlorate (PDF). The new rule is a result of that decision.

Perchlorate disrupts thyroid hormone production, which can be especially dangerous for fetal brain development, according to a 2018 technical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“Perchlorate is not safe and EPA should choose the lowest level,” the organization tells C&EN in an email.

In the proposed rule, the EPA says, “The benefits of this regulation would not justify the costs.” Regulation would cost about $16 million annually, compared with about $8 million in benefits, the rule states.

In a Jan. 5 statement, NRDC senior strategic director for health Erik D. Olson calls the proposed standard “weak,” noting that the EPA initially recommended a limit of 1 ppb. In Massachusetts, the limit is 2 ppb.

Even those low levels may have health effects, though, says Ramji Bhandari, a University of Missouri cell biologist who studies the health effects of chemical exposures.

For example, fish in water dosed with perchlorate at a concentration of 1 ppb had damage to their reproductive organs and lower rates of fertility than controls, Bhandari reported in a study in November.

The chemical “is a big public health concern,” he says.

Federal appeals court blocks NIH indirect cost cap

On Jan. 5, a federal appeals court upheld a district court injunction blocking the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from cutting reimbursement rates that the federal government pays to US institutions for research overhead costs.

The unanimous decision (PDF), made by a three-judge panel, says that the NIH’s attempt to cap the indirect cost rate at 15% violates existing congressional language that prevents federal health agencies from modifying these reimbursement policies.

“We agree with the district court that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims and that NIH’s action is unlawful because it violates a statute and regulations,” the judges from the First US Circuit Court of Appeals wrote. “Congress went to great lengths to ensure the NIH could not displace negotiated indirect cost reimbursement with a uniform rate.”

Back in February 2025, the NIH announced it would be capping its indirect cost rate at 15%, substantially lower than many of the rates that institutions have individually negotiated with the NIH, which average around 28%, according to the agency. The policy, which was widely criticized by research and university organizations, would have cut billions of dollars in funding for research-related overhead costs such as lab maintenance, hazardous waste disposal, and salaries of nonresearch personnel.

But the NIH’s policy change was quickly challenged in court, and in April, Judge Angel Kelley of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a permanent injunction blocking the cap. The Donald J. Trump administration appealed the injunction, arguing that the district court didn’t have jurisdiction to rule on the case.

The appeals court ultimately disagreed and upheld Kelley’s original decision.

The ruling “means that fair and necessary support for the real costs of conducting medical research will continue for the benefit of patients and communities across the country,” the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement following the ruling.

It’s unclear whether the Trump administration will appeal the ruling and petition to send this case to the Supreme Court. The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the NIH, tells C&EN that it does not comment on litigation.

Regardless, the Trump administration has continued pushing for changes to existing indirect cost policies. In an August executive order, the administration directs funding agencies to give preference to institutions with lower indirect cost rates when making funding decisions. This order came despite multiple court rulings blocking attempts to cap the indirect cost rate at other federal agencies, including the US National Science Foundation (NSF).

But Congress is taking steps to support current rates. Language in a recently conferenced appropriations bill that funds the NSF, NASA, and other key science agencies explicitly requires them to continue applying the negotiated indirect cost rates.

The House approved the bill on Thursday, and the Senate is expected to take it up next week. After, it will be sent to President Trump for final approval.

EPA moves to regulate phthalates in workplaces, not consumer uses

The US EPA has announced plans to regulate dozens of industrial and commercial uses of five common phthalate chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

In a Dec. 31 press release, the agency says its final risk evaluations found unreasonable risks primarily to workers—particularly from inhalation during spray applications and manufacturing—as well as to aquatic life from certain industrial releases. For the consumer uses included in the TSCA evaluations, the EPA says it did not identify exposure levels that pose unreasonable risks to consumers or the broader population.

That distinction has drawn scrutiny from public health advocates, who note that phthalates—plasticizers used to make materials such as polyvinyl chloride more flexible and durable—are common not only in industrial settings but also in everyday products. Scientific advisory bodies, including the EPA’s Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals, have long warned that routine exposure to phthalates may pose developmental and reproductive risks to the general public, particularly for sensitive populations.

The EPA’s analyses focused on five high-priority phthalates: butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), all of which have been linked to hormone disruption and developmental effects.

The agency’s findings partly reflect TSCA’s limits: the law directs the EPA to evaluate specific “conditions of use,” which do not include exposures from food packaging, medical devices, cosmetics, and other pathways overseen by other federal agencies.

Agency officials say the evaluations relied on peer-reviewed, “gold standard” science. Critics, however, argue that the approach understates real-world risk. Maria Doa, senior director for chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, says the EPA’s assessment “is a step backwards” in understanding cumulative health risks from phthalates, noting that evaluating individual uses in isolation fails to capture how people encounter multiple phthalates across workplaces and in everyday life.

With the evaluations complete, the EPA is moving into risk management—including possible engineering controls, exposure limits, or use restrictions—but it remains unclear how far those measures will extend beyond the workplace to communities and consumers.

The EPA also recently announced plans to regulate nearly a dozen uses of 1,3butadiene, another industrial chemical, under TSCA, again centering on worker exposure as the primary driver of risk management measures.

EPA issues new guidance on antimicrobial pesticides and endangered species

The US EPA released final guidance on Dec. 31 on how it will assess the potential effects of antimicrobial pesticides on endangered species. The guidance doesn’t create new requirements for manufacturers applying to register such pesticides, according to the agency. Instead, the guidance is meant to help manufacturers understand what kind of information the EPA considers in its risk assessments.

That information includes how a pesticide may be used and its potential geographic footprint, as well as whether that footprint overlaps with any endangered species’ ranges or critical habitats. The EPA also suggests that manufacturers use this information to inform how they label products to reduce effects on endangered species and their habitats.

Antimicrobial pesticides can include products like disinfectants used in homes as well as commercial and public settings like restaurants or hospitals, chlorine tablets and algicides used in swimming pools, wood preservatives, antifouling coatings used on boats and underwater equipment, and chemicals used to treat water at industrial facilities.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/Jan--9-Policy-Watch---311850:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-09 14:00:59.900304

Please read our guidelines for opinion pieces before submitting an Op-Ed. Submissions that do not adhere to our guidelines will not be considered for publication.

OPINION – California has long defined what clean transportation leadership looks like. But today, that leadership faces a crossroads – and the direction we take will be determined by the upcoming state budget, which will shape whether California maintains its edge or allows global competitors to outpace us.

California has reached an inflection point, a reality echoed by a broad coalition of companies, labor groups, ports, and clean transportation organizations that recently urged Governor Newsom to prioritize ZEV funding in the 2026–27 budget. They know the stakes: Momentum is not guaranteed.

The world is moving quickly. Countries are investing aggressively in batteries, critical minerals, and next-generation manufacturing capacity. China continues to expand its dominance in clean technology manufacturing, scaling quickly and shaping the markets of the future. If California wants the jobs, innovation, and economic competitiveness of the clean transportation era, it cannot afford to hesitate – especially now.

Automakers, fleets, and transportation providers are still investing in a zero-emission future, but federal uncertainty is slowing key decisions and underscoring the need for strong state leadership. Businesses are now looking to Sacramento for signals that the state intends to stay the course and provide the market certainty needed to unlock further investment.

Clean transportation manufacturing, charging deployment, and innovation already supports tens of thousands of California jobs that position the state as a global hub for next-generation technology. These jobs are not abstractions but high-skilled, good-paying careers that support families, strengthen communities, and make California more competitive in a global marketplace.

California’s decision last year to extend the Cap-and-Invest program to 2045 was a major step forward, providing long-term certainty and generating revenues for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It is critical that these funds support the state’s core zero-emission transportation programs. But ambition alone is not enough.

A multi-year commitment of $1 billion annually for zero-emission trucks, vans, buses, and passenger vehicles and the necessary infrastructure is essential to avoid backsliding, protect California’s global competitiveness, and ensure fleets and consumers have predictable support as the market scales. This includes sustained investments in mobility solutions that expand access to zero-emission transportation in communities that need it most.

California’s existing incentive programs are among the most effective in the world, helping drivers and fleets adopt cleaner vehicles and lowering costs. But with the loss of key federal incentives – especially the consumer tax credit – the state now has an opportunity to consider how best to support consumers and fleets. Any approach must build on what works, protect medium- and heavy-duty progress, and ensure new efforts complement established programs. And with more long-haul electric truck options expected – options that could reach cost parity with diesel for more applications –the coming year is pivotal.

We are entering what many have called the “Industrial Revolution 2.0,” defined by clean energy, advanced manufacturing, digital technologies, and zero-emission transportation. Few places are as well-positioned as California to shape this era and realize the economic fruits that come with being the global hub for clean transportation. The state has the talent, workforce, innovation ecosystem, and economic engine to lead globally. But leadership is not self-sustaining; it requires partnership and a willingness to invest in what works.

California’s industry leaders have made their position clear: They want to keep building, investing, and innovating in California, but they need the policy stability and market certainty that strong state leadership provides. Their recent letter to the governor reflects a shared expectation that California will reinforce its clean transportation leadership in the 2026–27 budget and beyond so companies can continue investing with confidence.

California has led every major clean technology shift of the last half-century, and the upcoming budget is our chance to show the world we intend to finish the work we started.

In a stunning move that reinforces Big Tech’s growing role in underwriting firm, carbon-free generation for artificial intelligence infrastructure, hyperscaler Meta unveiled partnerships with three major players—Oklo, Vistra, and TerraPower—that seek to secure up to 6.6 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2035. The agreements, finalized through Meta’s nuclear request-for-proposals (RFP) process launched in December 2024, mark one of the largest corporate nuclear procurement efforts in U.S. history.

The hyperscaler on Jan. 9 outlined the three separate deals, which span the full nuclear value chain, including long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and uprates at existing reactors, pairing them with early commercial backing for first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear deployments.

Under the deals, competitive generator Vistra will support 20-year PPAs covering more than 2.6 GW of nuclear capacity from its Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and the Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania, including 433 MW of uprates—the largest nuclear uprates ever backed by a corporate customer—while providing the financial certainty needed to pursue subsequent license renewals and extend plant operations for decades. Advanced nuclear technology firm Oklo will advance development of an up to 1.2-GW Aurora fast-reactor campus in Pike County, Ohio, leveraging Meta-backed prepayments to secure fuel, initiate site work, and enable phased deployment beginning as early as 2030 directly into the PJM market. Nuclear innovation firm TerraPower will accelerate deployment of up to eight Natrium reactors—a combined 2.8 GW of baseload capacity paired with 1.2 GW of integrated energy storage, that will be capable of boosting output to as much as 4 GW. Initial units are targeted for delivery in the early 2030s, TerraPower said.

The projects are expected to preserve and expand existing nuclear capacity, add new firm generation to constrained regional grids, and shift a significant portion of nuclear project risk and early-stage capital requirements onto a single large-load customer—Meta Platforms—at a scale never seen outside utility or federal sponsorship. They build on Meta’s June 2025–announced 20-year deal with Constellation for the 1,121-MW Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, which, as POWER has reported, will keep the nucelar plant operating beyond 2027 and support a 30-MW uprate and potential advanced reactor deployment at the site.

“Our agreements with Vistra, TerraPower, Oklo, and Constellation make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history,” said Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer on Friday. “State-of-the-art data centers and AI infrastructure are essential to securing America’s position as a global leader in AI. Nuclear energy will help power our AI future, strengthen our country’s energy infrastructure, and provide clean, reliable electricity for everyone. These projects are going to create thousands of skilled jobs in Ohio and Pennsylvania, add new energy to the grid, extend the life of three existing nuclear plants, and accelerate new reactor technologies.”

Meta’s Extraordinary Nuclear RFP: A Structured Push for Clean Firm Power

The deals on Friday stem from a thorough Request for Proposals (RFP) process announced on Dec. 3, 2024, seeking 1 GW to 4 GW of new nuclear generation capacity that it envisioned would be delivered starting in the early 2030s from “developers that can help accelerate the availability of new nuclear generators and create sufficient scale to achieve material cost reductions by deploying multiple units, both to provide for Meta’s future energy needs and to advance broader industry decarbonization.” Meta explicitly sought partners “who will ultimately permit, design, engineer, finance, construct, and operate these power plants will ensure the long-term thinking necessary to accelerate nuclear technology.”

“Compared to renewable energy projects that we continue to invest in, such as solar and wind, nuclear energy projects are more capital intensive, take longer to develop, are subject to more regulatory requirements, and have a longer expected operational life,” Meta said in its December 2024 blog post announcing the RFP. “These differences mean we need to engage nuclear energy projects earlier in their development lifecycle and consider their operational requirements when designing a contract.”​ Meta added that because “scaling deployments of nuclear technology offers the best chance of rapidly reducing cost,” it views multi-project, multi-location partnerships as essential to deploying nuclear power strategically through its structured RFP process.

So far, Meta has backed nearly 28 GW of clean energy projects across 27 U.S. states and has contracted more than 12 GW of renewable energy worldwide, efforts it said have “matched” its global operations, which have used 100% clean and renewable electricity since 2020. But in its September 2025 Sustainability Report, the company pointed to accelerating AI deployment, which it said is reshaping data center infrastructure needs, noting that next-generation facilities are being designed specifically to support “future generations of AI growth.” Future data centers will require larger, more persistent, and higher-density electrical loads than earlier generations, driving Meta to seek clean firm resources capable of delivering round-the-clock power to complement variable renewables, it suggested. However, the company’s recent firm-energy procurements have been of a smaller scale, and include, for example, an August 2024 agreement with Sage Geosystems to supply up to 150 MW of geothermal power beginning in 2027.

On Friday, as it unveiled the three new deals— existing fleet operations and uprates (Vistra), first-mover advanced reactors under construction (TerraPower), and early-stage fast reactor technology (Oklo)— the company outlined its overriding priorities. “These projects are expected to provide thousands of construction jobs and hundreds of long-term operational jobs, supporting up to 6.6 GW of new and existing clean energy by 2035,” it said. “Importantly, these projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America’s nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants.”

As significantly, Meta also noted that the work builds on its “ongoing collaboration with electric utility companies and power providers to plan for and meet our energy needs years in advance of our data centers becoming operational.” It underscored: “We pay the full costs for energy used by our data centers so consumers don’t bear these expenses, and we support the broader grid through our energy agreements.” Effectively, it said, the agreements will mean “that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid.” Over time, “this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.”

Vistra Secures Record Nuclear 2.6-GW of Uprates Through 20-Year Meta Partnership

Adding to Meta’s support of Constellation’s Clinton plant, the company’s deal with Vistra will support 20-year PPAs with three Vistra nuclear plants. Specifically, Meta will buy 2,176 MW of nuclear energy and capacity from Vistra’s Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio, while also backing 433 MW of incremental capacity from uprates at Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania.

According to Vistra, Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online. “More than 15% of the contracted capacity announced today will be new capacity added to the PJM region,” Vistra noted on Friday. “The electricity generated at the plants will continue to go to the grid for all electricity users.”

Perry, a single-unit boiling water reactor (BWR) located on Lake Erie about 40 miles northeast of Cleveland, has a capacity of 1,268 MW and supports more than 600 full-time jobs in the North Perry area. Davis-Besse, a single-unit pressurized water reactor (PWR) in Oak Harbor, Ohio, approximately 35 miles east of Toledo, provides 908 MW of capacity and employs more than 600 workers. Beaver Valley, a two-unit PWR facility about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, contributes 1,872 MW of capacity and supports more than 750 full-time jobs in western Pennsylvania.

Vistra acquired all three plants as part of its $3.4 billion Energy Harbor transaction in March 2024. All three facilities operate within the PJM Interconnection, which—despite being the nation’s largest regional transmission organization—has been signaling severe supply constraints through consecutive, record-setting capacity auctions.

System stress has become increasingly evident in recent market outcomes. PJM’s 2025/2026 Base Residual Auction cleared at $269.92/MW-day—nearly ten times the prior year’s price—followed by the 2026/2027 and 2027/2028 auctions, both of which hit the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)–approved price cap above $329/MW-day, essentially pointing to tightening reserve margins and growing scarcity of firm capacity across the region.

The grid operator’s long-term outlook underscores the stakes of preserving—and expanding—its nuclear capacity. PJM’s 2025 load forecast projects summer peak demand rising by roughly 70 GW over the next 15 years. Data center load alone is expected to grow by up to 30 GW between 2025 and 2030. At the same time, PJM faces potential generation retirements approaching 40 GW by 2030, an interconnection queue exceeding 150 GW of proposed projects—many of which have withdrawn after receiving multi-billion-dollar network upgrade cost estimates—and transmission constraints that the U.S. Department of Energy estimates will require a 61% expansion of within-region transmission capacity.

“As recently as 2020, before Vistra owned Perry, Davis-Besse, and Beaver Valley, these plants were on a path to retirement,” said Stacey Doré, Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer of Vistra. “When we signed a deal to acquire these plants in 2023, Vistra saw their tremendous contribution—to the reliability of the grid, to the stability of the region, to their local communities, and to the people who work there. Fast-forward to today, and we’re investing in expanding these same plants, and thanks to our dedicated employees and a committed partner like Meta, this fleet will continue to provide reliable, carbon-free energy to power the grid of the future.”

The Meta-backed uprates will still require regulatory clearance. While each of the three plants has received initial license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the PPAs “provide certainty for Vistra to pursue subsequent license renewal for each of the reactors, which would extend each license an additional 20 years,” Vistra noted. Currently, Beaver Valley Unit 1 is licensed through 2036; Davis-Besse is licensed through 2037; Perry is licensed through 2046; and Beaver Valley Unit 2 is licensed through 2047.

Oklo to Develop 1.2‑GW Advanced Nuclear Campus in Southern Ohio as Early as 2030

Meta’s deal with Oklo, meanwhile, will underpin the development of a 1.2‑GW Aurora powerhouse campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta’s regional data centers, including its Prometheus AI supercluster, which Meta is building in the Columbus area in New Albany, about 100 miles away.

“This advanced nuclear technology campus—which may come online as early as 2030—is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region,” Meta noted on Friday.

For Oklo, the Meta agreement marks a dramatic scaling-up of a Southern Ohio strategy it has been pursuing with the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI) since at least 2023, evolving from the two 15‑MWe Aurora powerhouses it first slated for underutilized parcels at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS).

As POWER previously reported in 2023, DOE‑sponsored analyses identified the Portsmouth site—now a DOE cleanup and reuse project (and potentially a nuclear hub)—as one of the most suitable U.S. locations for industrial advanced reactor deployment, citing its existing nuclear infrastructure, experienced enrichment and decommissioning workforce, and formal community reuse organization. SODI has since used successive DOE land transfers and a DOE‑funded early‑site‑permit (ESP) template effort launched in 2020 to advance a “clean energy park” concept that Oklo is now apparently anchoring, with Meta as its first large‑load customer.

As Oklo explained on Friday, the Meta agreement is effectively a funding commitment that “provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and provide funding to advance project certainty for Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse deployment.” Oklo plans to use the funds to “secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project—supporting the development of clean, reliable power in Pike County that can scale up to 1.2 GW.”

Ultimately, Oklo expects the agreement will lead to the build out of “multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses.” For now, “pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030,” it noted. “The plans for the scalable powerhouse facility are expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to the full target of 1.2 GW by 2034.”

“Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality. We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO.

While the Southern Ohio project has long been a strong prospect for Oklo, the company’s much-watched first project—Aurora-INL—is advancing at Idaho National Laboratory (INL), where it broke ground in September 2025. That 75‑MWe sodium‑cooled fast-reactor demonstration, which directly leverages EBR‑II experience, is one of three awarded to the company under DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, and Oklo is targeting operations start between late 2027 and early 2028, contingent on regulatory approvals and construction progress.

The Aurora design uses metallic fuel, a fast-neutron spectrum, and liquid-sodium coolant to enable inherent and passive safety features that allow a much leaner set of safety‑grade systems than a conventional LWR—and, critically for data center loads, a high-capacity-factor, dispatchable profile.

The company has laid out a three‑pronged strategy built around high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) supply, downblended government stocks of uranium and plutonium‑bearing materials that do not require further enrichment, and, longer term, recycled fuel from its own and today’s LWR fleet.

At INL, Oklo is already progressing its Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility under DOE authorization to fabricate metallic HALEU fuel. The DOE in December 2025 approved the facility’s Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis, and its assembly is now underway.

Structurally, Aurora plants are packaged as standardized, shippable modules—reactor vessel, steam generators, and power conversion system—with Oklo indicating that roughly 70% of powerhouse components are sourced from established non‑nuclear supply chains in the industrial, energy, and chemicals sectors, a strategy DeWitte has highlighted in earnings calls and in interviews with POWER as central to cost and schedule control.

In tandem, Oklo has paired that supply‑chain approach with a master services agreement under which Kiewit provides full‑scope engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services for the Aurora‑INL project and follow‑on Aurora deployments, giving the company a repeatable EPC partner from early design through on‑site assembly. In November 2025, Oklo and Siemens Energy went a step further by signing a binding contract for the design and delivery of the Aurora powerhouse power conversion system—covering a condensing SST‑600 steam turbine, SGen‑100A generator, and auxiliaries—which authorizes Siemens Energy to begin detailed engineering, lock in long‑lead turbine‑generator components, and initiate manufacturing for the first Aurora‑INL unit. Oklo has suggested it may leverage a standardized package across subsequent Aurora projects, including the planned Southern Ohio campus, to de‑risk the supply chain and support parallel builds.

Oklo has also pushed for early regulatory progress.. Oklo was the first advanced reactor developer to submit a custom combined license application (COL) to the NRC for a non‑LWR, and while that initial COL submission was denied “without prejudice” in 2022, the company has since relaunched its NRC pre‑application engagement and in July 2025 completed Phase 1 of the NRC’s formal readiness assessment for a revised Aurora‑INL COL under Part 52. In parallel, DOE’s selection of Aurora‑INL under the Reactor Pilot Program allows the first unit to proceed under DOE authorization—sidestepping the traditional NRC construction/operating license dual-track sequence—using DOE’s exemption authority under the Atomic Energy Act, Oklo, however, continues developing its Part 52 COL as a reusable reference design for follow‑on commercial sites like Southern Ohio and any future advanced reactor fleet scaling.​

TerraPower: Up to 2.8 GW from Eight Natrium Reactor Plants

Finally, under Meta’s new agreement, TerraPower could deploy up to eight Natrium reactor and energy storage system plants in the U.S., which could furnish Meta with as much as 2.8 GW of a flexible additional carbon-free baseload capacity resource. Given that the system integrates a molten salt storage system, the deal could boost total output to as much as 4 GW when dispatched at peak. That could make it Meta’s largest single commitment to advanced nuclear technology to date.​

Specifically, as Meta said on Friday, its agreement with TerraPower is for “funding” to support the development two new Natrium units—a combined 690 MWe of firm power—whose delivery is targeted as early as 2032. But as notably, the Meta–TerraPower agreement will also provide Meta “with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035.”

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” noted Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO, on Friday. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well-positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”​

For POWER readers who have followed Natrium’s trajectory, the Meta deal effectively scales up the commercial model TerraPower is already demonstrating at Kemmerer 1 in Wyoming—a 345-MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) coupled to a large nitrate molten salt storage system now under construction next to a retiring coal plant. As POWER has reported, Kemmerer 1 is being built as a fully commercial plant under the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. TerraPower has indicated it is targeting fuel loading around 2030 and will seek commercial operation in 2031.​

Technically, the Natrium concept separates the nuclear island—a pool-type SFR operating at atmospheric pressure and cooled by liquid sodium—from the energy island, where sodium transfers heat to a non-radioactive molten salt loop that serves as a high-temperature thermal battery. That architecture eliminates the need for large, high-pressure containment typical of light water reactors and allows the reactor to run at essentially constant thermal power while the storage system flexes electrical output to match grid conditions.​ In practice, stored heat in the molten salt can be drawn down to drive a conventional steam cycle, boosting plant output by about 150 MW above its baseload rating for more than five hours, which allows the facility to become a dispatchable resource that can follow net load swings and firm up high renewable penetrations, while still providing the high-capacity-factor baseload profile prized by AI data centers.​

Meanwhile, on the regulatory front, Natrium remains the most advanced non–light water commercial project in the U.S. The NRC accepted TerraPower’s construction permit application for the Kemmerer Natrium demonstration in March 2024, following several years of pre-application engagement and DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program scoping. In October 2025, the project became the first commercial advanced reactor to receive an NRC‑issued final environmental impact statement for a commercial advanced nuclear power plant, and in December 2025 the NRC completed its final safety evaluation of TerraPower’s construction permit application for Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1, clearing the way for issuance of the construction permit once remaining administrative steps are finalized.

As POWER has detailed, TerraPower has already mobilized substantial non-nuclear construction at Kemmerer—test-and-fill facilities for sodium systems, a training center, and early energy-island works—under EPC contracts led by Bechtel and a reactor supply partnership with GE Hitachi.​

However, TerraPower’s Meta deal effectively plugs into a Natrium pipeline that is already much broader than the Wyoming demonstration. Beyond Kemmerer 1, TerraPower is advancing multiple utility-facing siting efforts (including MOUs in Utah and Kansas and exploratory work with Sabey Data Centers and other load-serving partners) while seeding a global vendor base through repeated Natrium equipment awards and pushing the design into overseas licensing processes in the UK.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screenshot-2026-01-09-at-114840am.png,N,,2026-01-09 14:00:53.608330

General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid almost 3% Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

,North Carolina Environment,2026-01-09 18:07:50+00:00,Charlotte Observer,"As EPA tries to loosen PFAS rules, NC regulators inch toward statewide protections","Martha Quillin, Charlie Peek",,,,,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article314258875.html,"The EPA found 1,4-Dioxane most frequently in the Cape Fear River Basin during its sampling in North Carolina, which was part of a nationwide effort.
In 2024, the EPA announced national standards for some individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures, and gave public water systems until 2029 to comply with the limits.
While states cannot weaken federal environmental rules, they can develop rules that are stricter than federal standards.
The PFAS rules would require sampling of water taken into water treatment plants and water discharged by industries.
The 1,4-Dioxane rules are targeted at the industries most likely to discharge it.","North Carolina environmental regulators on Thursday moved toward reducing the amount of several potentially carcinogenic “forever chemicals” being discharged into the state’s ground and surface waters.

Critics say the actions taken by the Environmental Management Commission on PFAS and 1,4-Dioxane fall short because they don’t set specific allowable limits on the chemicals; they rely largely on voluntary compliance; and they don’t establish penalties for industries that continue to pollute.

Commission Chair JD Solomon guided a lengthy discussion during the board’s January meeting in Raleigh and acknowledged there would be more work to do.

“But this is a first step,” he said.

What are ‘forever chemicals’?

There are many thousands of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, created by man to make products non-stick or water-, temperature-, chemical-, oil- or weather-resistant. They help fried eggs slide off a treated skillet or cause spilled red wine to bead up on carpet. They’re in the foam that air tankers drop on big forest fires in rugged terrain and they extend the life of gaskets in car engines. They’re in construction materials, electronics and food packaging.

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says that because they don’t break down easily, if at all, PFAS can accumulate in the bodies of animals and people exposed to them. One study published in 2015 on more than 1,600 people aged 12 to 80 found that more than 97% had PFAS in their blood.

PFAS have been associated with potential health issues such as cancer, immune issues, developmental delays, decreased fertility and high blood pressure among pregnant women and low birth weights in babies, as well as imbalances in thyroid and sex hormones and other concerns.

Ingesting drinking water contaminated with PFAS is the primary way most people are exposed, the state Department of Environmental Quality says.

North Carolina has the third-highest concentrations of 1,4-Dioxane in drinking water of any state in the U.S., more than double the national average, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Another forever chemical, 1,4-Dioxane is an industrial solvent used mostly to make other industrial chemicals. It can be released into the air, water and soil at places where it is produced or used, scientists say. It mixes easily with water and can travel long distances through the soil into the groundwater, where it can take years to degrade.

The EPA found 1,4-Dioxane most frequently in the Cape Fear River Basin during its sampling in North Carolina, which was part of a nationwide effort.

A 2024 report by the state noted the risk of liver cancers North Carolina residents face as a result of 1,4-Dioxane in the drinking water and the lack of water-quality standards governing the chemical.

What action did N.C. regulators take on forever chemicals?

In 2024, the EPA announced national standards for some individual PFAS and PFAS mixtures, and gave public water systems until 2029 to comply with the limits. In May 2025, the EPA announced it would extend the compliance deadline to 2031 on two of the compounds. In September, the agency asked a federal court rescind the standards for the others, in keeping with the Trump administration’s policy to loosen EPA regulations generally.

The EPA’s plan would drop rules on GenX, the trade name of a PFAS made by the Chemours company in Fayetteville, found in the water in the Cape Fear River and linked to cancer of the liver, pancreas and testicles in animals. N.C. State University is studying the health effects of GenX and other PFAS on humans.

The state has prohibited Chemours from discharging contaminated wastewater from its processing plant into the Cape Fear River, which has helped reduce the pollutant, but historic discharges have left significant groundwater contamination, according to DEQ.

Under an agreement with the state, in 2023 the company built an underground wall along the Cape Fear River to block contaminated groundwater from reaching the stream and installed extraction wells to capture the water, which is then treated to remove the chemicals.

Environmental advocacy groups are challenging the EPA’s plan to drop the standards for GenX and other PFAS, which is still in litigation.

While states cannot weaken federal environmental rules, they can develop rules that are stricter than federal standards.

Members of the Environmental Management Commission expressed the need for some urgency in moving forward with the development of statewide rules on Thursday. The group took up two sets of “monitoring and minimization rules”: one for three types of PFAS – PFOS, PFOA and GenX – and another for 1,4-Dioxane.

The PFAS rules would require sampling of water taken into water treatment plants and water discharged by industries.

The 1,4-Dioxane rules are targeted at the industries most likely to discharge it.

Both would require baseline sampling after the rules go into effect, then quarterly sampling to check for amounts of pollutants above the “lowest reporting concentration.”

If pollutants exceed those concentrations, the operation would have to develop a plan to reduce or eliminate the pollutant.

Some board members were frustrated by the lack of specific numerical limits in the proposals and asked to send them back to committee until thresholds could be set.

“If we want to do a ‘monitoring’ rule, I’m for it,” Commissioner Robin Smith said. “But we should not call this a ‘minimization’ rule,” because it lacks pollution level targets.

Still, the board voted to put both proposed rules out for public comment and public hearing.

Solomon repeatedly assured fellow commissioners that the board will later establish specific thresholds for the chemicals along with enforcement plans.

Fuquay-Varina wants to import water from Sanford

The southern Wake County town of Fuquay-Varina now buys its water from the City of Raleigh and Johnston County, both in the Neuse River Basin, and from Harnett County in the Cape Fear River Basin.

But the town, which has been one of the fastest-growing in the state, will lose its purchasing contracts with Raleigh and Johnston County in the next few years and can’t meet its needs by purchasing from Harnett County.

So the town has applied to the state for permission to make an inter-basin transfer, purchasing up to 6.17 million gallons of water a day from the City of Sanford, which lies in the Cape Fear River Basin.

The problem? The town would discharge much of the used water into the Neuse River Basin, resulting in a net loss of water from the Cape Fear.

Operators of several large drinking water systems downstream of where the water would be diverted in Sanford complained during public hearings that the transfer could leave them vulnerable to water shortages during drought and water quality problems because pollutants would be less diluted.

The state is taking public comment on the proposal through April 1.

The Environmental Management Commission would have to approve the transfer request.

In late December, the U.S. EPA informed the judge overseeing a case related to the Renewable Fuel Standard that it was aiming to finalize 2026 fuel volume obligations sometime in the first quarter. The delay could trigger a shift in compliance deadlines for refiners expected to purchase renewable fuels, creating new uncertainty for producers.

In a letter sent Thursday to the EPA, Clean Fuels Alliance America said the delay is creating “intolerable uncertainty,” especially for growers of crops used to create biomass-based fuels. Elsewhere, Argus Media reported that “the market is at a standstill” because final volume requirements that EPA will impose are still unclear.

When the EPA proposed its update to the Renewable Fuel Standard last year, it included volume obligations for 2025, 2026 and 2027 that biogas groups found to be disappointingly low. But having the certainty of multiple years of volume obligations would still send clear market signals, especially in comparison to EPA’s relative silence as it works to finalize the proposed update.

Last year, the Trump administration introduced a series of policy changes that affected the biofuels market from all sides. Among those changes is a plan to limit the amount of foreign fuels that can enter the RFS market, which would shrink supply and boost prices for domestically produced renewable fuels. But the administration is also granting a large number of exemptions from the program to small fuel refineries, reducing demand.

Despite those conflicting signals, experts predict the market will improve in 2026. D3 RIN prices, those used for cellulosic biofuels like RNG, began to trend upward in the second half of 2025, and may average around $2.50 to $2.60 per RIN in 2026, according to an investor note from Jefferies.

WM and Denver to collaborate on RNG facility

The Denver Arapahoe Disposal Site, a landfill owned by the city of Denver, will get Colorado’s first landfill-gas-to-RNG facility thanks to a new agreement with WM. Approved by the city council on Dec. 1, the agreement allows WM to finance, build and operate the facility and pay the city royalties on revenue generated.

The landfill currently captures about a third of its gas and converts it to electricity, while the rest is flared. The project partners expect construction will begin later this year, and operations will begin in 2027.

WM has made steady progress on its goal to build 20 new RNG facilities between 2022 and 2026. It plans to deliver the final five facilities by the end of this year, according to the company’s most recent sustainability report. Combined, the 20 new facilities are projected to generate approximately 25 million mmBtus of RNG.

The transaction is enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which allowed developers of alternative energy assets to sell the tax credits that their investments generated to other entities looking to reduce their tax liability. Investment tax credits have historically been used to incentivize the development of clean energy technology, according to Crux Capital.

In September, Noble Environmental announced the closing of a $100 million bond backed by the Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority. The company pursued the financing to improve its landfill gas facilities across the state, Noble Executive Chairman Nick Stork said at the time. Noble Environmental had previously closed an agreement with Clean Energy Fuels to build an RNG fueling station supplied by Noble’s Westmoreland Sanitary Landfill.

Aemetis announces its first clean fuel production credit tax sale

Longtime RNG producer Aemetis secured $17 million from an unnamed buyer of tax credits related to its RNG production at the end of last year. The company has sold about $95 million worth of investment tax credits to date as its dairy biogas and alternative energy facilities come online.

The newest sale includes $12 million in proceeds from investment tax credits and $5 million in clean fuel production credits. It’s the first time Aemetis reported selling the latter type of credit.

Aemetis began generating the clean fuel production credits, known in the U.S. tax code as Section 45Z, on Jan. 1, According to its most recent annual report. Aemetis expects to generate an increasing amount of those credits as RNG production ramps up, and it will continue to sell them to improve liquidity.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jR4sVjTSt6IMB3qPBBJFYFj8O2fhNOVFOiB589LwClA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9WYW5ndWFyZF9SZW5ld2FibGVzX05ld19SaXZlcl9GYWxsc19GYWNpbGl0eS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-09 12:58:48.787505

Zacks Investment Research","U.S. legacy automaker General Motors GM is taking a financial hit as it slows down its aggressive electric vehicle (EV) push. The company notified that it will record about $6 billion in special charges in fourth-quarter 2025 due to its EV rollback. These one-time expenses will drag down net income but won’t affect adjusted earnings.

A major part of this burden comes from $1.8 billion in unused EV equipment and about $4.2 billion in supplier settlements, contract cancellations and other related costs. This follows a $1.6 billion EV-related charge it absorbed in the third quarter, pushing GM’s total EV-linked hit for 2025 to $7.6 billion.

Notably, GM will also book another $1.1 billion tied mostly to restructuring a Chinese joint venture.

Why GM Stepped Back From EVs

General Motors is scaling back its EV plans amid a shift in U.S. policy and consumer demand. Under the Trump administration, several EV-friendly incentives and stricter emission rules introduced during the Biden era have been rolled back. This resulted in slower EV adoption, weaker demand and fading tax benefits for buyers.

General Motors had gone all-in on EVs during the Biden years. CEO Mary Barra set bold goals, including selling only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. But with consumer demand cooling and incentives fading, GM decided to “right-size” its EV plans to match real demand instead of chasing volumes that no longer look achievable in the near term.

The company has made several operational changes as part of this pivot. The Orion plant, originally planned for EVs, will now build profitable pickup trucks like the Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. GM is also reducing battery production exposure by selling part of its stake in Ultium Cells to LG Energy Solution. It cut shifts and laid off workers at its Factory Zero EV plant as demand softened.

The slowdown is already visible in the numbers. After federal EV tax credits expired, GM’s EV sales fell 43% year over year in fourth-quarter 2025 to just over 25,000 vehicles.

GM also warned that more costs could come in 2026 as it continues negotiations with suppliers, though those are expected to be smaller than the EV-related charges recorded in 2025.

By scaling back EV capacity that no longer matches demand, GM is basically shifting resources toward higher-margin vehicles and proven revenue drivers. While the $7.6B charge hurts 2025 results, the pivot is intended to improve capital efficiency and near-term profitability.

GM Isn’t Alone in Retreating

General Motors is not the only automaker hitting the brakes on its EV ambitions.

Its closest peer, Ford F, is also stepping back from its once-aggressive EV narrative. After pouring billions into EVs, Ford is now shifting toward what makes financial sense — profitable gas vehicles, hybrids and lower-cost EVs instead of expensive flagship programs. The company expects around $19.5 billion in special charges, mostly in the fourth quarter, as it restructures its U.S. EV strategy. Importantly, about $5.5 billion of this will hit cash flows, mainly through 2026 and 2027.

Italian-American automaker Stellantis STLA is also realigning its EV vision in the United States. Its RAM brand discontinued its planned all-electric pickup and delayed the Ramcharger EREV to late 2026. The company has acknowledged that strategic changes will lead to meaningful one-time costs as it pivots back toward hybrids and a more balanced lineup. Even though Stellantis hasn’t disclosed exact charge amounts, the message is clear — plans built during a different policy and demand environment won’t work now.

Final Thoughts

Together, these moves show that legacy automakers are no longer racing blindly toward an EV-only future. They are prioritizing flexibility, profitability, and a consumer-led strategy. Having said that, EVs remain a long-term priority, but automakers are now moving more cautiously, balancing ambition with financial discipline.

Congress may make it worse. | Grist,Tik Root,,,,,https://grist.org/energy/mobile-homes-already-have-huge-utility-bills-congress-may-make-it-worse/,"Advocates say the changes will streamline the regulatory process and keep the upfront costs of manufactured homes down.
But the Energy Department, which oversees national energy policy and production, didn’t always have a say over these standards.
But HUD last updated the relevant energy efficiency standards in 1994, and they have long lagged behind modern insulation and weatherization practices.
It still took 15 years and a lawsuit before President Joe Biden’s administration finalized new rules in 2022 that were projected to reduce utility bills in double-wide manufactured homes by an average of $475 a year.
“The paralysis is because you have two different agencies that have been tasked with creating energy standards,” Gooch said.","On Friday morning, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that would get the Department of Energy out of the business of energy standards for mobile homes — also known as manufactured homes — and could set the efficiency requirements back decades.

Advocates say the changes will streamline the regulatory process and keep the upfront costs of manufactured homes down. Critics argue that less efficient homes will cost people more money overall, and mostly benefit builders.

“This is not about poor people. This is not about working people,” said Melanie Stansbury (D-NM), who grew up in a manufactured home, on the House floor before the vote. “This is about doing the bidding of corporations.”

The average income of a manufactured home resident is around $40,000 and they “already face disproportionately high energy costs and energy use,” said Johanna Neumann, senior director of the Campaign for 100% Renewable Energy at Environment America. That, she said, is why more stringent energy codes are so important. But the Energy Department, which oversees national energy policy and production, didn’t always have a say over these standards.

Starting in 1974, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, became tasked with setting building codes for manufactured homes. But HUD last updated the relevant energy efficiency standards in 1994, and they have long lagged behind modern insulation and weatherization practices. So, in 2007, Congress assigned that task to the Department of Energy. It still took 15 years and a lawsuit before President Joe Biden’s administration finalized new rules in 2022 that were projected to reduce utility bills in double-wide manufactured homes by an average of $475 a year. Even with higher upfront costs taken into account, the government predicted around $5 billion in avoided energy bills over 30-years.

At the time, the manufactured housing industry argued that DoE’s calculations were wrong and that, regardless, the upfront cost of the home should be the primary metric of affordability. Both the Biden and now Trump administrations have delayed implementation of the rule and compliance deadlines, which still aren’t in effect.

This House legislation would eliminate the DoE rule and return sole regulatory authority to HUD. Lesli Gooch, CEO of the Manufactured Housing Institute, a trade organization, describes it as essentially a process bill aimed at removing bureaucracy that has stood in the way of action. “The paralysis is because you have two different agencies that have been tasked with creating energy standards,” Gooch said. “You can’t build a house to two different sets of blueprints.”

Jake Auchincloss, a democrat from Massachusetts, agreed and called the move “common-sense regulatory reform” in a letter urging his colleagues to support the bill. Ultimately 57 democrats joined 206 republicans in voting for the bill — and it now moves to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain.

If the bill becomes law, however, the only operative benchmark would be HUD’s 1994 code and it could take years to make a new one. While more than half of the roughly 100,000 homes sold in the U.S. each year already meet or exceed the DoE’s 2022 efficiency rules, ACEEE estimates that tens of thousands are still built to just the outdated standard.

“Families are struggling,” said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director at the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, and he does not expect HUD, under Trump, to move particularly quickly on a fix. “I have not seen this administration lowering energy bills.”

For now, though, it’s the Senate’s turn to weigh in.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1248101209.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-09 12:58:31.528399

JB Pritzker signs sweeping Illinois energy law - Chicago Tribune,Jeremy Gorner,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/08/pritzker-signs-new-illinois-energy-law/,"But whether the new law will meaningfully reduce electric bills remains uncertain.
The new law authorizes the Illinois Commerce Commission to sign long-term contracts and allows for funding of pilot programs for geothermal energy networks.
The batteries that comply with the law would work with wind and solar to make the electricity they supply more consistent.
In total, by 2031, the batteries would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $3.90 to $8.28 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $1.85 per month, according to the agency.
Including all its other provisions, the IPA has said, the energy law would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $4.49 to $10.59 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $2.03 per month by 2031.","Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed into law sweeping energy-related legislation that promotes battery storage and makes wind and solar power more effective, among other initiatives, with the goal of reducing electricity prices amid rising utility bills for consumers.

“This was one of the most comprehensive responses to the energy crisis that we’re in in the entire nation because it was important to us,” the governor said during a ceremony at Joliet Junior College, flanked by a group of Illinois lawmakers and the law’s advocates. “There’s no time to waste in the race to make electric bills more affordable.”

Dubbed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, the new measure comes as state officials have warned that Illinois may face energy shortages and higher bills as data centers and artificial intelligence needs drive a surge in demand.

But whether the new law will meaningfully reduce electric bills remains uncertain. When the law was passed in the fall, it pitted Democrats against Republicans, who noted the massive battery installations would be partly backed by a surcharge on consumers’ monthly bills.

GOP lawmakers on Thursday criticized the measure, which received no Republican votes in the legislature.

“The Governor has signed a bill that weakens consumer protections, expands regulatory authority, and locks Illinois into costly policies,” state Sen. Sue Rezin, a Republican from Morris, said in a statement. “This law will fundamentally reshape how energy decisions are made in Illinois, and the consequences will be felt for years.”

GOP state Sen. Terri Bryant of Murphysboro said Republicans have warned that previously approved green-energy mandates in Illinois have driven up costs and weakened energy reliability, and that the 1,000-plus-page legislation Pritzker signed Thursday didn’t address either issue.

“When those warnings became reality, the Governor and his party did not course correct,” Bryant said in a statement.

Pritzker, who is running for a third term and is considered a potential 2028 presidential contender, blamed President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress for higher electricity prices across the nation, accusing them of taking action that “abruptly and arbitrarily canceled major clean energy projects that expand the supply of energy.”

State Sen. Bill Cunningham, a Chicago Democrat and a co-sponsor of the new law, said it will allow Illinois to increase the supply of energy to the power grid and reduce its price by making it easier to develop renewable energy. The law will also lift an existing moratorium on new large-scale nuclear construction and add battery storage.

“That’s what we’re doing with this bill,” he said. “That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The law was a result of negotiations between lawmakers, organized labor, environmental interests and other groups in response to an especially high demand for electricity in the last couple of years.

That high demand is partly due to the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which aims to promote greater use of renewable energy by 2030 and eventually phase out fossil fuels, as well as the prevalence of data centers that have taken up a significant share of the electrical supply due to the emergence of AI technology. The policy shift also stems from the state’s plan to retire 28 gigawatts of coal- and natural-gas generating capacity by 2045 to improve air quality.

The new law authorizes the Illinois Commerce Commission to sign long-term contracts and allows for funding of pilot programs for geothermal energy networks. It also increases subsidies to retrofit homes to use less energy.

The batteries that comply with the law would work with wind and solar to make the electricity they supply more consistent. They require billions of dollars in upfront investment to be financed by battery developers and secured through the utility bill surcharges.

But according to an estimate released in the fall by the Illinois Power Agency, the batteries would reduce average residential electricity bills by a few dollars per month by 2031 by lowering anticipated rate increases for future capacity on regional electricity grids.

The cost of deploying 3 gigawatts of batteries on the grid by 2031 would add 58 to 68 cents per month to the average residential bill for Ameren customers in mostly downstate Illinois and 40 to 48 cents for Commonwealth Edison customers in the Chicago region, according to the IPA analysis.

But the batteries would pay for themselves by reducing the anticipated rate increases for future space on regional transmission grids, the agency said. In total, by 2031, the batteries would reduce average Ameren residential bills by $3.90 to $8.28 per month and average ComEd residential bills by $1.46 to $1.85 per month, according to the agency.

Given the short timeline for Congress to vote, state officials may have the best opportunity to protect the Boundary Waters.","MINNEAPOLIS — A resolution planned for introduction in Congress on Friday will force legislators to go on the record within 60 days about whether or not they will protect the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Northern Minnesota from devastating mining operations. Federal lawmakers can either vote to uphold a 20-year mining ban in an area just outside the protected wilderness — or opt to overturn that rule and bar similar policies in the future.

“The Boundary Waters is the nation’s most visited wilderness area. About 150,000 people from around the world visit it each year to navigate its waters and they want to see bears, beavers, lynx, moose and many more of Minnesota’s most beloved species,” said Katelynn Rolfes, conservation advocate for Environment Minnesota. “Pollution from the proposed mine would likely contaminate the waters that run into the Boundary Waters’ interconnected waterways, permanently damaging this beautiful wilderness. That’s something no one wants to see.”

If Congress rescinds the ban, it would open the door to restoring mining leases belonging to Twin Metals Minnesota, a subsidiary of the giant Chilean mining company, Antofagasta. The Boundary Waters and other nearby parts of the Superior National Forest sit on deposits of copper, nickel and other metals. This type of mining often contaminates the surrounding ecosystem with toxic metals, sulfates and other hazardous chemicals.

Given the short timeline for Congress to vote, state officials may have the best opportunity to protect the Boundary Waters.

“The State Legislature and Governor Tim Walz may be the last line of defense for this special place that has nourished the souls of so many Minnesotans and visitors to our great state for generations,” said Rolfes. “We need them to act quickly to preserve the wilderness for generations to come.”

For a decade, China has owned the global EV price war, churning out electric vehicles so cheap they’ve made Western automakers look like they’re bringing a knife to a battery fight. Ford, however, thinks it has found a way to flip the script, not by copying China’s playbook, but by tearing it up.

The automaker says it can build the world’s cheapest electric motors and sell a $30,000 electric pickup truck by doing something almost radical in today’s industry: building it in America, with Detroit-born manufacturing muscle, not California-style excess.

China makes the world’s cheapest electric vehicles. Everyone in the auto industry agrees on that — except Ford, apparently.

The company now claims it can undercut Chinese EV costs with a $30,000 electric pickup truck, provided it’s built the old-fashioned way: in the American industrial heartland, not in a high-cost, over-engineered California ecosystem. The revelation comes from Doug Field, Ford’s chief of EVs, digital and design, in an interview with MotorTrend this week

Beating China at cheap EVs isn’t supposed to be possible. China builds EVs fast, cheap, and at terrifying scale, and everyone else just tries to keep up. Ford, though, has come to the realization that the problem isn’t China at all. It’s where and how American automakers build their cars.

The company now says, by designing smarter motors, cutting the fat from production, and leaning on Detroit’s manufacturing DNA instead of Silicon Valley’s expense-heavy habits, it can deliver a $30,000 electric pickup.

The China Challenge — and Ford’s Answer

For years, Chinese automakers like BYD and others have dominated the low-cost EV segment globally thanks to massive economies of scale, lower labor costs, and highly automated factories. They’ve managed to put EVs on the road with price tags Western automakers find hard to match. According to industry analysts, Chinese brands account for a large share of EVs under $35,000 worldwide. That’s a price bracket where Western brands are barely present.

Yet Field insists Ford’s newest skunkworks (the Blue Oval’s secretive group of roughly 500 engineers mostly working out of Long Beach, California) is on track to build motors cheaper than anything Ford could source abroad, including Chinese-made units. That’s a remarkable claim for a company whose manufacturing costs have traditionally lagged behind Asian competitors.

The secret sauce, according to Field, isn’t some new magic alloy or moonshot physics breakthrough. It’s people — highly experienced engineers recruited from Tesla, Rivian, Apple and other Silicon Valley outposts, assembled in a nimble team removed from traditional Ford operations. Field argues these hires are the kind that deliver “20x” results, capable of driving down costs through smarter design and engineering choices. It’s time to show China.

Beyond China: Rethinking Ford’s Playbook

Ford’s plan is part of a broader rethink of how vehicles get designed and built. The so-called Universal EV Platform that underpins the $30K truck will require 25 percent fewer fasteners, a 22-pound lighter wiring harness, and drive as many simplifications as possible in pursuit of affordability; all designed to cut thousands of dollars in per-unit cost.

The pickup itself (a four-door crew cab) will be offered in rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive versions, with multiple battery choices that let buyers trade price for range.

Perhaps the most interesting twist in this story is that Ford doesn’t plan to throw automation at the problem. In Louisville, Kentucky, where the truck will be assembled, Ford says it will eliminate tasks entirely, reducing workstations by up to 40 percent and shaving assembly time by about 15 percent compared with traditional methods.

Rather than a high-tech robotic extravaganza, this is lean production that a human can do fast. It spotlights a sort of modern American assembly process that takes its cues from the Model T’s legendary affordability but updated for the 21st century.

Made in Detroit — Not California?

Here’s where a deeper geopolitical angle emerges. With global supply chains, rare-earth magnets still largely controlled by China, and battery production concentrated in a few geographies, Ford’s strategy is more than an industrial gambit. It’s a sovereignty play, but it’s not without contradictions.

On paper, Field’s team operates outside of Detroit, and Detroit is a hub of legacy costs and union structures that some believe would stifle innovation. Yet the vehicle itself will be put together in Louisville, drawing on the heartland’s manufacturing backbone and a deeply domestic supply of parts and labor.

This dichotomy — designed on the West Coast, built in the Midwest — reflects Ford’s bet that the intellectual work of beating China cost-wise can come from nimble, high-priced talent, while the muscle of production still thrives where it always has: in American factories.

But Does This Fix the China Problem?

Many are skeptical because they do not believe China’s advantage is about headcount but about control over the entire EV supply chain, from rare earth processing to battery gigafactories. Even if Ford’s motors are cheaper, they still require materials dominated by Asian producers. That’s a gap technology alone won’t close anytime soon.

Still, war isn’t new to the Blue Oval, and the industry has come to the point where America feels a tightening noose requiring a battle for freedom. Ford beat the Italians at the Le Mans; can Farley beat the Chinese at electrification? As many U.S. automakers recalibrate their EV ambitions due to weak demand and high costs, Ford is doubling down on the notion that the future of affordable electrification must be built at home. Like the victorious GT40.

Whether that belief will pay off in a marketplace where Chinese EV mastery is as much about volume as it is about price remains to be seen, but it’s clear Ford is tired of watching from the sidelines. The $30,000 EV pickup — slated for 2027 — may well be America’s most litmus test yet in the global EV economy.

Picture an electric car that could go 600, 700 or even 1,000 miles on a single charge. That’s much farther than the longest-range electric vehicles on the U.S. market, according to Car and Driver magazine – and twice as far the official rating for the long-range, rear-wheel-drive Tesla Model 3, which has a maximum rated range of 363 miles.

Current EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which are also found in smartphones, laptops and even large-scale energy storage systems connected to the power grid. A standard for decades, these batteries have been tweaked and improved by generations of scientists and are now close to their physical limits. Even with the best materials and most optimized designs, there is only so much energy that can be packed into a lithium-ion battery.

I’m a materials engineer who studies these batteries and seeks alternatives with better performance, improved environmental sustainability and lower cost. One promising design uses sulfur, which could boost battery capacity significantly, though some key roadblocks remain before it can be widely used.

Lithium-sulfur vs. Lithium-ion

Any battery has three basic components: a positively charged region, called the cathode; a negatively charged region, called the anode; and a substance called the electrolyte in between, through which charged atoms, also known as ions, move between the cathode and anode.

In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is made of a metal oxide, typically containing metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt, bonded with oxygen. The materials are layered, with lithium ions physically between the layers. During charging, lithium ions detach from the layered cathode material and travel through the electrolyte to the anode.

The anode is usually graphite, which is also layered, with room for the lithium ions to fit between them. During discharge, the lithium ions leave the graphite layers, travel back through the electrolyte and reinsert into the layered cathode structure, recombining with the metal oxide to release electricity that powers cars and smartphones.

In a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium ions still move back and forth, but the chemistry is different. Its cathode is made of sulfur embedded in a carbon matrix that conducts electricity, and the anode is made primarily of lithium itself, rather than graphite layers with lithium in between.

During discharging, the lithium ions travel from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where – rather than sliding in between the cathode layers – they chemically convert sulfur in sequential steps to a series of compounds called lithium sulfides. During charging, the lithium ions separate from the sulfide compounds, leave the cathode behind and travel back to the anode.

The charging and discharging process for lithium-sulfur batteries is a chemical conversion reaction that involves more electrons than the same process in lithium-ion batteries. That means a lithium-sulfur battery can theoretically store much more energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size.

Sulfur is inexpensive and abundantly available worldwide, meaning battery manufacturers do not need to rely on scarce metals such as nickel and cobalt, which are unevenly distributed on Earth and often sourced from regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has limited worker safety regulations and fair labor practices.

Those advantages could deliver batteries with far more capacity and that are cheaper and more sustainable to produce.

Why aren’t lithium-sulfur batteries widely used yet?

The biggest obstacle to mass production and use of sulfur-based batteries is durability. A good lithium-ion battery, like those in an electric vehicle, can go through thousands of cycles of discharging and recharging before its capacity starts to fade. That amounts to thousands of car rides.

But lithium-sulfur batteries tend to lose capacity much more quickly, sometimes after fewer than 100 cycles. That’s not very many trips at all.

The reason lies in the chemistry. During the chemical reactions that store and release energy in a lithium-sulfur battery, some of the lithium sulfide compounds dissolve into the liquid electrolyte of the battery.

When that happens, those amounts of both sulfur and lithium are removed from being used in any remaining reactions. This effect, known as “shuttling,” means that with each round of discharging and recharging, there are fewer elements available to release and store energy.

In the past couple of decades, research has produced improved designs. Earlier versions of these batteries lost much of their capacity within a few dozen discharge–recharge cycles, and even the best laboratory prototypes struggled to survive beyond a few hundred.

New prototypes retain more than 80% of their initial capacity even after thousands of cycles. This improvement comes from redesigning the key parts of the battery and adjusting the chemicals involved: Special electrolytes help prevent the lithium sulfides from dissolving and shuttling.

The electrodes have also been improved, using materials such as porous carbon that can physically trap the intermediate lithium sulfides, stopping them from wandering away from the cathode. This helps the discharge and recharge reactions happen without so many losses, making the reactions more efficient so the battery lasts longer.

The road ahead

Lithium-sulfur batteries are no longer fragile laboratory curiosities, but there are significant challenges before they can become serious contenders for real-world energy storage.

In terms of safety, lithium-sulfur batteries have a less volatile cathode than lithium-ion batteries, but research is continuing into other aspects of safety.

Another problem is that the more energy a lithium-sulfur battery stores, the fewer cycles of charging it can handle. That’s because the chemical reactions involved are more intense with increased energy.

This trade-off may not be a major obstacle for using these batteries in drones or grid-level energy storage, where ultrahigh energy densities are less critical. But for electric vehicles, which demand both high energy capacity and long cycle life, scientists and battery researchers still need to sort out a workable balance. That means the foundation for the next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries is likely still a few years down the road.

Federal agencies collectively finalized $129.7 billion in net regulatory cost savings and 50.9 million hours in paperwork reductions in 2025, making it the most deregulatory calendar year recorded in RegRodeo.

While only two actions accounted for most of those totals, the renewed regulatory budget program under Executive Order (EO) 14192 largely constrained new costs; that EO and proposed rulemakings currently under development are set to bring even more dramatic cost reductions over the next year or so.

The first year of the second Trump term also brought a nearly unprecedented level of EOs and an aggressive push to re-orient typical regulatory procedures – the implications of which remain largely unknown.

INTRODUCTION

The change-over in administrations, even just across a single year, could not be more apparent. In 2024, federal agencies under the Biden Administration had the costliest year of regulations on record. In 2025, with the return of the Trump Administration’s deregulatory agenda under Executive Order (EO) 14192, federal agencies had the highest level to-date of regulatory cost reductions. Final rules accounted for nearly $130 billion in net savings (and nearly 60 million hours annually in paperwork reductions) while $4 billion in additional reductions came from Biden-era rules repealed under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), with hundreds of billions more still in the offing from currently proposed rules. A deeper examination reveals, however, that much of that final rule total is attributable to just two rulemakings. Nevertheless, this past year in regulation – or rather, deregulation – lays claim to a significant record. There’s also plenty to suggest the current administration is poised to make even more profound changes to the administrative state in the coming year.

SNAPSHOT OF FINAL RULES WITH ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACTS

MOST SIGNIFICANT FINAL RULES OF THE YEAR

The following tables include the top five final rules published this past year across a series of categories:

Top 5 Costliest Rules

Agency Rule Cost ($ billions) Justice Preventing Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons 4.1* Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Standards To Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River 2.3 Homeland Security Cybersecurity in the Marine Transportation System 1.2* Homeland Security Enhanced Air Cargo Advance Screening (ACAS) 0.9 Health & Human Services Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Contract Year 2026 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage Program, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, Medicare Cost Plan Program, and Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly 0.8

Top 5 Cost-cutting Rules

Agency Rule Savings ($ billions) Treasury Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting Requirement Revision and Deadline Extension -84.0 Health & Human Services Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Repeal of Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities -55.1 Environmental Protection Agency Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category-Deadline Extensions -1.4 Environmental Protection Agency Extension of Deadlines in Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review Final Rule -1.4 Health & Human Services Medicare Program; FY 2026 Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities Prospective Payment System-Rate Update -0.3

*Denotes Biden Administration rule

The main conclusions to draw from the above rules are that 2025: A) saw relatively restrained new burden-adding rules, and B) had a cost-cutting topline largely propped up by two very significant rulemakings. The top five costliest rules add up to roughly $9.3 billion in overall costs. This represents roughly two-thirds of the total from all cost-additive final rules for the year: approximately $14 billion. For historical context, per RegRodeo data, the only calendar years with lower net totals than $14 billion were 2018 (the only other net-deregulatory year), 2005, and 2006. As such, the impact of final regulatory actions this past year was relatively restrained.

The cost-cutting top five is largely dominated by two rulemakings: the roll-back of the beneficial ownership rule and the effective repeal of the long-term care rule. The American Action Forum (AAF) covered the further implications of each here and here, respectively. Note that without these two rules , 2025 would clock in at roughly $9.4 billion in net total costs across all final regulatory and deregulatory rules. Even taking into account the cost reductions from CRA repeals (see below), this past year would have still been net-regulatory if not for these two specific rules.

CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT

The past year also saw some significant developments under the Congressional Review Act, the law that allows a new Congress and administration to repeal certain rules issued by the preceding administration via an expedited process. As of year’s end, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 70 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in estimated compliance costs. Of these, 22 have been signed into law. By way of comparison, across the entire history of the CRA, there had only been 20 successful resolutions of disapproval before this term. These resolutions repealed a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs. The Trump Administration estimates that the repeal of this rule yields an additional $936 million in savings. Full details of the rules affected can be found here at AAF’s CRA Tracker.

REGULATORY BUDGET ASSESSMENT

Similar to AAF’s examination of the administration’s EO 14192 progress at the six-month mark, the closing of the calendar year provides an opportunity to take a closer look at where agencies stand in terms of regulatory budget implementation. Across all the final rules recorded in RegRodeo for 2025, AAF has identified 67 that include some discussion of their relationship to EO 14192. The following table provides a breakdown of those rules:

Designation # of Rules Total Costs/Savings Total Paperwork Deregulatory 40 $-143.1 billion -54 million hours Regulatory 3 $3.1 billion 0.6 million hours Exempt 8 $2.4 billion 5.8 million hours Not Applicable/Ambiguous 16 $0.7 billion -5.3 million hours

The primary takeaway here is that, for rules that had a clear designation as either regulatory or deregulatory, federal agencies were successful at a top-line level in meeting the 10 deregulatory actions for every one regulatory action ratio as well as producing $140 billion in net savings. In a late-December announcement, the administration claimed to have achieved a 129-to-1 deregulatory-to-regulatory ratio with net savings of nearly $212 billion. That statement did not include much in the way of supporting documentation of those claims beyond highlighting a handful of actions. The main discrepancy between AAF’s figures here and those in the administration’s announcement is likely due to AAF’s analysis focusing on published rulemakings that contain some kind of measurable economic effect, whereas the administration’s appears to include less formalized actions (such as ending the “shoes-off” policy for airport screening) to which it ascribes an ad hoc estimate.

As the other two lines in the above table make clear, there are also some rulemakings that include a discussion of EO 14192, but do not fall neatly into the deregulatory versus regulatory breakdown. Eight of these claim the EO’s exemption for “regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, homeland security, foreign affairs, or immigration-related function of the United States.” One of the novel aspects of EO 14192 compared to its spiritual predecessor, EO 13771, is the inclusion of an immigration policy exemption. Given the aggressive nature of this administration’s immigration policies, it is not surprising to see such rules add more costs – regardless of whether the administration cares to account for them in its regulatory budget math.

Additionally, there are rules for which the agency does not make a clear EO 14192 designation one way or another, despite the rule’s language suggesting that it could or should have. For instance, this Department of Health and Human Services rule contains the following passage regarding the EO in its section responding to public comments: “Regarding Executive Order 14192, we refer stakeholders to section IX.J. of this final rule for a discussion of the rule’s interaction with this order.” Yet when one goes to the relevant section, the agency simply includes a rote restatement of the EO’s primary objective with no actual determination on where the rule falls. Interestingly enough, if one were to include the rules that either explicitly claim an exemption or are otherwise indeterminate, that would essentially double-up the net cost and paperwork totals of those designated as regulatory under the EO.

PROPOSED RULES HEADING INTO 2026

Top 5 Costliest Proposed Rules

Agency Rule Cost ($ billions) Homeland Security Trade and National Security Actions and Low-Value Shipments 71.9* Food & Drug Administration Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Yield of Cigarettes and Certain Other Combusted Tobacco Products 58* Health & Human Services HIPAA Security Rule To Strengthen the Cybersecurity of Electronic Protected Health Information 32* Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation: Controlled Unclassified Information 15.9* Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program: Standards for 2026 and 2027, Partial Waiver of 2025 Cellulosic Biofuel Volume Requirement, and Other Changes 12.2

*Denotes Biden Administration rule

The main trend that jumps out in examining the most significant proposed rules of the year is simply the increase in order of magnitude across the board. For final rules, outside of the two big deregulatory measures discussed above, many of the actions were substantial, if not earth-shattering. The 2025 headliner proposed rules, however, play in the realm of the tens and even hundreds of billions of dollars.

The other main dichotomy comes in how the respective administrations are represented in each of these above lists. All but of one of the top regulatory proposals came during the waning days of the Biden Administration, whereas all but one of the deregulatory standouts comes from the current administration. It is worth pointing out, however, that while the costliest proposal here is one of the very last rulemakings attributable to the Biden Administration, the Trump Administration has largely implemented it via its own trade policy maneuvers.

Turning to the cost-cutting rules, the clear implication is that, assuming the top four listed above come due in largely the same form as their proposed versions, 2026 is set to be an even more dramatic year in terms of deregulatory efforts. Led by the monumental proposed rule seeking to rescind the EPA endangerment finding – and subsequent rules like tailpipe emissions standards – the coming year could see at least $1 trillion in total cost reductions. That figure may very well be the floor, too.

OTHER ASPECTS OF TRUMP 2.0 REGULATORY POLICY

Executive Orders

In contrast to the administration’s overall emphasis on limiting new regulatory requirements, there is one aspect of the administrative state where it – and more specifically the president, himself – stood out historically: the issuance of EOs. Per Federal Register data on the matter, President Trump issued 225 EOs last year– which is the most in a calendar year since 1942 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This one-year total is also greater than the amount issued during the entirety of the following presidential terms:

Biden (162)

Trump 1 (220)

W. Bush (166)

Ford (169)

Kennedy (214)

Granted, outside of areas where a president exerts direct control (such as national security concerns or organizational decisions), EOs typically direct subordinate officials and/or agencies to undertake a given action or set of actions over some window of time. As such, the immediate policy impact of EOs can often be quite limited.

Nevertheless, the historically high level of EOs issued suggests that President Trump has found a preference for such actions as a policy vehicle. Additionally, even if the EO document itself does not immediately affect policy provisions, it can spur agencies to act expeditiously on a given matter. One notable example from this past year that demonstrates this – albeit in a somewhat legally dubious way – is EO 14264. That EO, titled “Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads,” directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to repeal a Biden-era rule on “Energy Conservation Program: Definition of Showerhead.” Less than a week after the president signed the EO, DOE obliged and declared the rule in question repealed without the typical rulemaking process. The main authority the agency cites for such an action is EO 14264. It remains unclear whether that claim to policymaking authority is legitimate.

Changes to Rulemaking Process

The showerhead EO and repeal rule happen to also be one of many examples from the past year of the Trump Administration trying to increase the White House’s direct control over regulatory policy decisions and to side-step the usual rulemaking procedures. Last spring, through a series of EOs, the administration:

Extended its purview over regulatory review to agencies previously understood to be “independent”;

Broadened the range of issues agencies ought to consider in examining existing regulatory provisions for possible repeal; and

Directed agencies to, where possible, utilize “enforcement discretion” as a means of providing regulatory relief while developing more substantial rulemakings.

Later in the fall, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs issued a memo on “Streamlining the Review of Deregulatory Actions” that, among other things, instructed agencies to find existing provisions that contravene a series of Supreme Court decisions and repeal them directly under the “good cause” exception. There has yet to be much action under the auspices of this memo, but one can expect rulemaking under that memo to be another development that picks up the pace in the coming year. In sum, all of these policy directives taken together point to an administration that seeks to grease the skids on its regulatory policy agenda.

CONCLUSION

The second iteration of the Trump Administration certainly left a mark in 2025 on the regulatory front – however it got there. With nearly $130 billion in final net cost reductions plus another roughly $4 billion in CRA savings, this past year was clearly the most deregulatory on record. It was not the deepest set of policy actions, however, with most of the credit going to just a couple rulemakings. All the same, there’s plenty in terms of both rules currently in the proposed stage and other policy actions outside of just rulemakings to suggest that this administration is only getting started in its efforts to upend the regulatory state in rather consequential ways.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alexander-grey-8lnbXtxFGZw-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 12:00:52.580118

“This package reflects the priorities my constituents, and hardworking Americans, want to see Congress address: lowering energy costs, strengthening public safety, investing in clean energy and science, and upgrading critical water infrastructure,” Rep. Peters said. “It also holds the Trump Administration accountable by reasserting Congress’s power of the purse and taking steps to end their slash-and-burn approach, ensuring no one is above the law. I hope the Senate gets this bill over the finish line without delay so we can deliver real results for San Diego and communities across the country.”

Highlights of the package include:

Addresses high electricity costs by investing $375 million in our electric grid, which Rep. Peters helped secure, tackling a major point of rising electricity costs and strengthening reliability.

Supports $1.8 billion in clean, affordable, and secure energy programs to lower energy bills, including nuclear energy activities—a bipartisan effort led by Rep. Peters to strengthen America’s nuclear energy sector.

Curtails the reckless abuses of the Trump Administration by restricting efforts to dismantle entire agencies without Congressional authorization, blocking wasteful spending on useless vanity projects, and diminishing the Administration's ability to wipeout Congressionally approved spending.

Supports federal programs to support a wide range of criminal justice program areas, ensuring cities like San Diego have the tools to strengthen public safety, expand mental health crisis intervention programs, and invest in prevention efforts that keep our neighborhoods safe.

Repudiates the Trump Administration’s anti-science agenda by providing strong funding for scientific and technological research. Rep. Peters led a bipartisan effort to secure $58 million for NASA’s Space Grant College and Fellowship Program, supporting STEM education and research through a network of colleges and universities, including the University of California, San Diego.

Invests $2.8 billion in our nation’s water infrastructure, including drinking water, wastewater, and storm water management projects in San Diego, and across the country.

Also included in the package were six Community Project Funding requests led by Rep. Peters for FY 2026 funding, totaling more than $6.3 million.

“These investments will help prepare San Diego for the future, from safer water to stronger infrastructure to more opportunities for students to gain the skills that power our local economy,” Rep. Peters continued. “I’m proud to deliver targeted federal funding that improves the quality of life for my constituents and delivers real, tangible benefits for San Diegans.”

Community Project Funding requests made by Rep. Peters include:

San Diego City College CyberLab — $1,031,000

This funding would be used for modern computers, high-end laptops, and cyber range access to support students in the Cyber Defense and Analysis programs. It will address a critical gap in national security by preparing students to enter the cybersecurity workforce and counter evolving cyber threats.

Coastal Ocean Pathogen Pollution Forecast Model — $1,031,000

This funding would be used to develop, deploy, and maintain real-time monitoring stations of oceanographic conditions within the Tijuana estuary. It will help better manage beach contamination events, which in turn will minimize public health risks and economic damage.

Engineering and Computer Science Capacity Building Project — $1,031,000

This funding would be used to for laboratory and teaching equipment to expand California State University San Marcos’s systems, electrical, and computer engineering programs. This would address critical workforce needs, drive regional economic growth, and foster long-term societal benefits.

City of Coronado Stormwater Mitigation Project — $1,092,000

This funding would be used for the protection of surface and groundwater quality and assist with the minimization of pollutants entering waterways, preventing flooding during heavy rain events and enhance water quality.

Pump Station Component D Upgrade — $1,092,000

This funding would be used to increase the community’s drainage system's capacity by providing electrical, structural, and mechanical improvements to the pump station. This is essential to mitigate flood risks, lower costs, and ensure the pump’s power reliability.

Famosa Slough Alley Slope Restoration — $1,092,000

This funding would be used for the construction phase of a storm drain infrastructure project to address severe erosion in an alleyway that floods during rain events, preventing further damage to nearby streets and residential neighborhoods.

Community Project Funding enables Members of Congress to advocate directly for local priorities, ensuring transparency and accountability. To see more about Rep. Peters’ FY26 requests, click here.

For nearly 40 years, this 1.7-million-acre watershed has been protected by large conservation easements, boasted untouched environmental resources, and maintained the rural character cherished by residents.

This legacy of conservation is under threat due to a new Colleton County ordinance that makes it easier for data centers to be built in rural areas.

There is no universe where this should be allowed anywhere near the ACE Basin.

Jennifer Singleton, Colleton County resident

That’s why SELC just filed a lawsuit to stop this zoning change, and the first data center project to take advantage of it—a proposed 859-acre, 1,000-megawatt complex that would be one of the largest in the country.

New data center development would degrade rural nature of the area

On behalf of two Colleton County residents, SELC filed a complaint this week over the recently passed zoning ordinance that creates a special exception for data centers and makes it easier for them to locate in rural areas of the county. The lawsuit argues that the county’s new ordinance violates state law, the county’s comprehensive plan, and the county’s zoning code.

“This zoning ordinance opens up a treasured and rural part of our state to industrial development and all the pollution and degradation that comes with it. Data centers don’t belong in the rural ACE Basin,” said Emily Wyche, SELC Senior Attorney. “Colleton County should be continuing the legacy of conservation in this area, not selling it to the highest bidder.”

Shortly after the zoning ordinance passed, the public learned that Eagle Rock Partners had filed an application to construct a massive data center campus in a rural part of Colleton County.

Data centers not only use large quantities of energy, but they can also:

adversely impact water quality,

contribute to noise and light pollution,

and degrade the character of rural communities.

Residents, including those named in the lawsuit, say that the ACE Basin is the last place a data center should be built. These impacts would threaten the ACE Basin’s many threatened and endangered wildlife species, cultural and archaeological resources, and untouched swaths of land.

“I did my due diligence and specifically chose to move to an area that was zoned for rural agricultural use,” says resident Jennifer Singleton. “Now with Colleton County passing this ordinance, opening the door for this 9-building data center campus, this entire pristine and vulnerable area is under attack undermining decades of conservation.”

Colleton County residents strongly oppose massive data center proposal

In December, the Colleton County Zoning Board of Appeals held a public meeting to discuss Eagle Rock Partners’ data center application.

Over 450 residents and many environmental nonprofits attended to raise concerns and oppose the proposal.

Speakers touched on:

environmental impacts,

low quality jobs,

preservation of the area’s rural nature, and

who will pay for the extra power needed to run the complex.

“As a lifelong Colleton County resident, I’m seriously concerned about the harm the data center construction would have on our rural community, local wildlife, and the environment,” says resident Miles Crosby. “We cannot allow this ordinance to threaten our star-filled night skies, natural quiet, and enjoyment of landscapes with light, water, and noise pollution.”

An online petition to stop the data center has over 7,000 signatures.

This is not the first time Eagle Rock Partners faced opposition to their data center proposals. In Twiggs County, Georgia, a group of local landowners sued the county for a rushed rezoning process and approval of another proposed Eagle Rock data center despite extreme local opposition to the project. In Jones County, Georgia, Eagle Rock recently cancelled a proposed data center in response to significant local push back.

In Colleton County, Ken Loeber, representative for Eagle Rock Partners, was the only speaker who voiced support for the proposal.

Considering the public outcry over the application, the Colleton County Zoning Board of Appeals said that Eagle Rock Partners will need to reapply for the special exception to zoning requirements. So far, the reapplication has not come through.

Data center demand is driving methane gas generation proposals

As a report SELC released last year found, there is a national overestimation of data center demand, causing utilities to scramble to build new power generation. Much of that proposed generation includes polluting methane gas power plants like the Canadys gas plant in Colleton County proposed by utilities Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy.

This gas plant, which would require a massive new pipeline, has a $5 billion price tag and would generate 2,200 megawatts of energy. If the new data center in Colleton County gets built, it would need almost half of that generation. By comparison, other large data centers in the state operated by tech giants, such as Google and Meta, use about 200 megawatts each and are sourcing and building clean energy for some of their power.

As a Walterboro resident and a Climate Campaign Associate with SELC, Robby Maynor has voiced many concerns about the proposed data center and gas plant.

“South Carolina is at a crossroads. Do we want to open up to big data centers, polluting gas plants, pipelines that go through private property, and the industrial development that will result from that? Or do we want to preserve the rural and natural character and high quality of life here for generations to come?” said Maynor.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image-26.jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 12:13:51.513140

The writedown, disclosed in an SEC regulatory filing, is a reflection of the automaker's reduced EV production expectations and the subsequent downstream impact on GM’s supplier network.

Cancelling contracts and settlements with suppliers that had tooled up for much higher EV volumes will cost GM $4.2 billion in cash. The automaker said the expense will be recorded as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings and warned that there are likely to be additional, albeit smaller charges throughout 2026 as negotiations with suppliers continue.

GM also said the writedown will not change its current U.S. EV lineup, which still has a rough dozen battery-electric models across Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac, and Buick.

GM had been among the most aggressive legacy automakers in its EV ambitions, at one point even planning to phase out internal-combustion vehicles by 2035, which was on par with the most aggressive plans from Volkswagen—and look how well that's working out.

While GM's target has not been formally abandoned, actions speak louder than words—the company has already slowed or paused battery production at joint-venture plants, cut EV output at its Detroit Factory Zero facility, and redirected a planned Michigan EV plant to build full-size pickups and Cadillac Escalades instead.

If it sucks to be a GM shareholder, things look even worse across town at Ford. The Blue Oval recently disclosed nearly $20 billion in EV-related writedowns after canceling or delaying multiple programs, including killing the F-150 Lightning.

Both decisions come against the backdrop of policy changes under the Trump administration, including the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September, which triggered a sinkhole that swallowed EV demand after a brief pre-deadline buying surge—a dead cat bounce if there ever was one.

Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet.
“We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium.
He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.
At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects.
Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.","Amid warnings of impending energy shortages, Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday signed a wide-ranging energy reform package into law aimed at bolstering the state’s power grids after years of negotiations.

Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — will fund battery storage, grant greater authority to state utility regulators, create new options for “virtual power plants” and lift a longtime ban on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re making it easier to develop renewable energy,” bill sponsor Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet. “We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium. That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid, and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The Illinois Power Agency, an independent body responsible for planning and procuring cost-effective energy for Illinoisians, found that the law will save utility customers in the state $13.4 billion over the next two decades. But opponents question those projections, pointing to increased subsidies for battery storage that will eventually be reflected via a new charge on consumers’ bills beginning in 2030.

The bill signing took place less than a month after state regulators projected energy shortfalls would likely drive up costs in the next three to five years and force Illinois to import more power from out of state absent action from lawmakers and grid operators.

Shortfalls, Pritzker said, would be exacerbated by actions at the national level, including the Trump administration’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out renewable energy tax credits and froze federal funding for energy projects. He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

“All of that raises prices in the short term, while threatening our long-term ability to meet growing electricity demand,” Pritzker said.

CRGA, he said, will allow Illinois to forge its own path.

What's in the new law?

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects. It will result in new charges to ratepayers, though supporters of the bill say that those costs would be offset by cost savings from greater energy efficiency, storage and planning.

The law grants new authority to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state body responsible for regulating utilities. The ICC will now have the power to set long-term plans for managing energy supply and demand in the state through approval of an integrated resource plan.

It additionally adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at electric and natural gas utilities and places new air regulations on backup generators used by data centers.

It also secures new labor protections by closing a loophole for community solar projects that has allowed some developers to avoid hiring union labor, a major priority for organized labor groups involved in negotiating the bill.

CRGA also lifts a longstanding ban on constructing new large-scale nuclear power plants, while at the same time increasing fees for nuclear plant operators. It outlines new programs for geothermal and thermal energy network projects, using naturally occurring heat from underground and transferring it via water-filled pipes to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel heating.

The law also creates new “virtual power plant,” or VPP, programs. That’s not virtual as in occurring via the internet or virtual reality, but rather as a program that allows homes and businesses with solar panels or wind turbines to pool energy together, acting “virtually” like a power plant despite not physically existing as one.

The idea is that the energy stored in residential and business batteries can be contributed to the electrical grid when the state’s primary electric delivery companies, like ComEd and Ameren Illinois, face high supply prices during peak hours of use, especially during the summer.

Homes and businesses who contribute energy to the grid via VPPs will be paid for their energy. The law also mandates that electric utilities offer optional “time-of-use” pricing, allowing customers to save money by using less energy during periods of high demand.

ComEd already offers time-of-use pricing, as approved in an ICC ruling in January 2025, but CRGA enshrines the requirement for both Ameren and ComEd into law.

Path to passage

The legislation passed during the legislature’s veto session in late October with support from environmental, labor and utility oversight advocates. Business groups and Republicans criticized the bill for its reliance on a new ratepayer charge to fund new battery storage and for yielding what they said was too much power to the ICC.

“Senate Bill 25 is a guaranteed rate increase that does nothing to increase energy production,” Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.

Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb, also denounced energy sources like wind and solar as unreliable in a statement, saying that the state “should focus on preserving reliable energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power that actually work when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”

Supporters, though, say that ratepayer charges will be offset with savings from increased energy supply and grid reliability. They argue the investment in battery systems allows the state to store extra energy generated on bright sunny days or windy days and deploy it at night and when other energy supply is low.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of Citizens Utility Board and champion of the bill, said CRJA was the state’s response to market signals sent by regional grid operators.

“To me, CRGA is really about us here in Illinois, together as a state, deploying the tools we have here at our disposal to defend the promise of clean and affordable power for Illinois,” Moskowitz said.

Organized labor advocates also supported the bill, which is expected to generate up to 100,000 jobs according to statements from multiple House Democrats. AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Pat Devaney and LiveWire Construction CEO Shon Harris joined Pritzker on stage at the signing ceremony.

“By expanding access to pre-apprentice programs, lowering thresholds for project labor agreements, ensuring that wind, solar and thermal energy projects are built by skilled Illinois workers, this bill clearly says the future of clean energy in Illinois will be union built,” Devaney said.

The bill prioritizes grants to historically underserved contractors and projects in communities that would most benefit from investments to combat discrimination. Harris said that legislation keeps the doors open for businesses like his.

“CRGA ensures equity remains a part of Illinois’ clean energy future,” Harris said. “That means that companies like mine can keep building projects, training workers and creating good-paying jobs all across Illinois.”

How Ford's even larger writedown compares GM's $6 billion EV charge, whilst substantial, appears modest compared to the $19.5 billion writedown announced by Ford in December.
Ford's larger hit stems partly from killing entire programme generations, whilst GM appears to be moderating volumes whilst maintaining its current model range.","General Motors has disclosed a $6 billion charge related to unwinding portions of its electric vehicle (EV) investments, marking one of the industry's starkest acknowledgements that ambitious battery-powered production forecasts have collided with market realities. The 'writedown', announced in a regulatory filing, forms part of a broader $7.1 billion fourth-quarter charge that includes a further $1.1 billion tied to restructuring the automaker's Chinese joint venture.

The numbers lay bare the manufacturing challenges confronting Detroit's largest automaker. Of the EV-related charge, $4.2 billion represents cash payments to suppliers who had tooled up and expanded capacity based on GM's earlier, more aggressive volume projections. A further $1.8 billion reflects non-cash impairments on assets that no longer align with revised production plans. This massive retraction demonstrates the tangible cost of industrial overcapacity built on demand assumptions that failed to materialise.

The scale of retreat from electric ambitions

The magnitude of GM's retrenchment becomes evident when examining the production adjustments already under way. Factory Zero, the automaker's dedicated EV assembly plant in Detroit, has shifted from two-shift to single-shift operation. The move placed approximately 1,200 workers on indefinite layoff whilst reducing output of the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. These are precisely the vehicles that were meant to demonstrate GM's manufacturing prowess in the battery-electric segment.

Battery production has faced even more dramatic curtailment. GM halted operations at its two Ultium Cells joint-venture facilities in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee for a six-month period beginning in January. The Ohio plant placed 850 workers on temporary layoff whilst Tennessee affected 700 employees. These facilities, developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution, represented cornerstone investments in GM's vertical integration strategy for battery cell production. Their idling until mid-2026 signals a fundamental mismatch between installed capacity and actual market absorption.

New alliances and innovative factory upgrades for US auto industry

GM and Hyundai form a wide-ranging new partnership, and Toyota reinvents its Kentucky plant to pioneer global manufacturing standards

The carmaker's Orion Assembly plant in Michigan exemplifies the strategic pivot. Originally slated for electric pickup production following a $4 billion investment that included $480 million in state grants, the facility will instead begin manufacturing the internal combustion-powered Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups in early 2027. Battery module production will continue at the site, but the shift toward traditional powertrains reflects where management now sees sustained demand and acceptable margins.

Supplier settlements expose the real cost of strategy pivots

The $4.2 billion earmarked for supplier commercial settlements and contract cancellations represents the most immediate manufacturing impact. These payments also acknowledge a fundamental truth about automotive supply chains. Suppliers invested heavily in equipment, tooling and expanded capacity predicated on volume commitments that are no longer viable. The settlements are not penalties but rather the cost of maintaining relationships whilst extracting the industry from contracts written when the regulatory and market environment looked markedly different.

This supplier dimension deserves particular attention from a manufacturing standpoint. Component manufacturers typically operate on thin margins and make capital investments years in advance of production. When an original equipment manufacturer scales back dramatically, the ripple effects extend through multiple tiers of the supply base. Unused capacity, idle tooling and stranded investments create financial stress that can destabilise smaller suppliers. GM's decision to absorb these costs through negotiated settlements rather than protracted disputes suggests recognition that maintaining supplier viability matters for future production flexibility.

The carnmaker has indicated additional charges will emerge in 2026 as negotiations continue, though management expects these to be substantially lower than 2025's impairments. This phased approach to unwinding commitments reflects the complexity of automotive supply arrangements and the time required to renegotiate contracts across a global supplier network.

Tariffs, trade shifts, and EV turbulence: How Trump’s second term is reshaping North American auto manufacturing

North American vehicle manufacturing is undergoing major changes. These are in response to political actions, wider market factors and some interesting decisions by major vehicle companies

Production footprint undergoes dramatic transformation

Beyond the immediate financial impact, GM's manufacturing footprint is undergoing restructuring that will define its capabilities for the remainder of the decade. The elimination of a planned Michigan facility initially designated for EV production, which will now build the Escalade and full-size pickups, demonstrates how quickly strategic priorities have shifted. Factory Zero in Detroit-Hamtramck remains the sole dedicated assembly location for the Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Escalade IQ and Hummer EV, consolidating electric truck and SUV production rather than dispersing it across multiple sites as originally envisioned.

The reduction to single-shift operation at Factory Zero carries implications beyond workforce numbers. It affects throughput rates, quality metrics and the ability to achieve economies of scale. Single-shift manufacturing can actually improve certain quality parameters by allowing more thorough maintenance during off-hours, but it fundamentally alters the cost structure and makes it harder to amortise tooling and facility investments across sufficient unit volumes.

GM maintains it will continue offering roughly a dozen EV models in the United States, which remains the industry's broadest battery-electric portfolio amongst traditional automakers. The OEM stated it plans to ""continue to make these models available to consumers"" despite the production adjustments. This creates an interesting manufacturing dynamic where the automaker maintains model diversity whilst constraining volume, essentially operating a portfolio strategy rather than the volume-production approach that characterised earlier plans.

How Ford's even larger writedown compares

GM's $6 billion EV charge, whilst substantial, appears modest compared to the $19.5 billion writedown announced by Ford in December. Ford's charge reflected the wholesale cancellation of multiple EV programmes, including the fully electric F-150 Lightning and additional truck and van projects planned as second-generation offerings. Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in a December interview that ""when the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call."" The comparative scale of these writedowns reveals different strategic positions and degrees of exposure.

Ford's larger hit stems partly from killing entire programme generations, whilst GM appears to be moderating volumes whilst maintaining its current model range. This suggests GM may have built in more production flexibility or chosen to preserve optionality at the expense of achieving maximum scale efficiencies. The approaches reflect different manufacturing philosophies on how to navigate market uncertainty.

Both automakers now confront the reality that sales of battery-powered vehicles dropped 43% in the fourth quarter following elimination of the $7,500 federal tax credit on 30 September. Industry-wide EV sales increased just 1.2% in 2025 according to research firm Omdia, a dramatic deceleration from previous years' growth rates. Automotive data provider Edmunds expects EVs to account for approximately 6% of overall US vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025. These figures frame the manufacturing environment both companies must navigate.

Market dynamics force fundamental reassessment

The manufacturing implications extend beyond immediate production adjustments. GM had at one point planned to invest $30 billion in EVs, targeting dozens of new models and substantial battery production capacity. The company previously stated ambitions to essentially phase out internal combustion passenger cars and trucks by 2035. Whilst that target officially remains in place, recent operational decisions point toward a more measured transition timeline.

The policy environment has shifted dramatically. Elimination of consumer tax credits, relaxed emissions regulations and reduced urgency around fuel economy standards have removed much of the regulatory impetus that originally drove aggressive electrification timelines. Manufacturing strategies built on one regulatory scenario now operate under fundamentally different conditions.

Analysts have noted GM's limited exposure to hybrid vehicles represents a potential vulnerability. Competitors including Toyota have maintained robust hybrid portfolios that provide fuel efficiency without requiring customers to commit fully to battery-electric powertrains. CFRA Research equity analyst Garrett Nelson observed that ""GM's lack of hybrid exposure could partially reverse recent market share gains.""

This creates a manufacturing challenge. Developing hybrid variants requires engineering resources and production capacity allocations that GM has thus far directed primarily toward pure electric and traditional internal combustion options.

The company's October disclosure of a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge foreshadowed the larger fourth-quarter writedown, suggesting management recognised the scale of adjustments required but needed time to complete supplier negotiations and finalise restructuring plans. The sequential disclosure approach has allowed the market to absorb the impacts incrementally rather than as a single shock.

GM's shares gained more than 50% during 2025, leading all major publicly traded automakers, though they declined approximately 2% in after-hours trading following the writedown announcement. The stock's strong annual performance reflected optimism about the OEM's operational turnaround and EV potential. The charge now introduces uncertainty about whether the core business can generate sufficient cash to offset these writedowns whilst funding future growth without additional debt or dilution.

From a financial perspective, the company will record these charges as special items in its fourth-quarter earnings, meaning they will not affect adjusted results that investors often use to evaluate ongoing operational performance. This accounting treatment acknowledges the one-time nature of the supplier settlements whilst still recognising the real cash impact on the balance sheet.

The 'writedown', announced in a regulatory filing, forms part of a broader $7.1 billion fourth-quarter charge that includes a further $1.1 billion tied to restructuring the automaker's Chinese joint venture.

The numbers lay bare the manufacturing challenges confronting Detroit's largest automaker. Of the EV-related charge, $4.2 billion represents cash payments to suppliers who had tooled up and expanded capacity based on GM's earlier, more aggressive volume projections. A further $1.8 billion reflects non-cash impairments on assets that no longer align with revised production plans. This massive retraction demonstrates the tangible cost of industrial overcapacity built on demand assumptions that failed to materialise.

The scale of retreat from electric ambitions

The magnitude of GM's retrenchment becomes evident when examining the production adjustments already under way. Factory Zero, the automaker's dedicated EV assembly plant in Detroit, has shifted from two-shift to single-shift operation. The move placed approximately 1,200 workers on indefinite layoff whilst reducing output of the GMC Hummer EV, Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ. These are precisely the vehicles that were meant to demonstrate GM's manufacturing prowess in the battery-electric segment.

Battery production has faced even more dramatic curtailment. GM halted operations at its two Ultium Cells joint-venture facilities in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee for a six-month period beginning in January. The Ohio plant placed 850 workers on temporary layoff whilst Tennessee affected 700 employees. These facilities, developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution, represented cornerstone investments in GM's vertical integration strategy for battery cell production. Their idling until mid-2026 signals a fundamental mismatch between installed capacity and actual market absorption.

New alliances and innovative factory upgrades for US auto industry

GM and Hyundai form a wide-ranging new partnership, and Toyota reinvents its Kentucky plant to pioneer global manufacturing standards

The carmaker's Orion Assembly plant in Michigan exemplifies the strategic pivot. Originally slated for electric pickup production following a $4 billion investment that included $480 million in state grants, the facility will instead begin manufacturing the internal combustion-powered Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups in early 2027. Battery module production will continue at the site, but the shift toward traditional powertrains reflects where management now sees sustained demand and acceptable margins.

Supplier settlements expose the real cost of strategy pivots

The $4.2 billion earmarked for supplier commercial settlements and contract cancellations represents the most immediate manufacturing impact. These payments also acknowledge a fundamental truth about automotive supply chains. Suppliers invested heavily in equipment, tooling and expanded capacity predicated on volume commitments that are no longer viable. The settlements are not penalties but rather the cost of maintaining relationships whilst extracting the industry from contracts written when the regulatory and market environment looked markedly different.

This supplier dimension deserves particular attention from a manufacturing standpoint. Component manufacturers typically operate on thin margins and make capital investments years in advance of production. When an original equipment manufacturer scales back dramatically, the ripple effects extend through multiple tiers of the supply base. Unused capacity, idle tooling and stranded investments create financial stress that can destabilise smaller suppliers. GM's decision to absorb these costs through negotiated settlements rather than protracted disputes suggests recognition that maintaining supplier viability matters for future production flexibility.

The carnmaker has indicated additional charges will emerge in 2026 as negotiations continue, though management expects these to be substantially lower than 2025's impairments. This phased approach to unwinding commitments reflects the complexity of automotive supply arrangements and the time required to renegotiate contracts across a global supplier network.

North American vehicle manufacturing is undergoing major changes. These are in response to political actions, wider market factors and some interesting decisions by major vehicle companies

Production footprint undergoes dramatic transformation

Beyond the immediate financial impact, GM's manufacturing footprint is undergoing restructuring that will define its capabilities for the remainder of the decade. The elimination of a planned Michigan facility initially designated for EV production, which will now build the Escalade and full-size pickups, demonstrates how quickly strategic priorities have shifted. Factory Zero in Detroit-Hamtramck remains the sole dedicated assembly location for the Silverado EV, Sierra EV, Escalade IQ and Hummer EV, consolidating electric truck and SUV production rather than dispersing it across multiple sites as originally envisioned.

The reduction to single-shift operation at Factory Zero carries implications beyond workforce numbers. It affects throughput rates, quality metrics and the ability to achieve economies of scale. Single-shift manufacturing can actually improve certain quality parameters by allowing more thorough maintenance during off-hours, but it fundamentally alters the cost structure and makes it harder to amortise tooling and facility investments across sufficient unit volumes.

GM maintains it will continue offering roughly a dozen EV models in the United States, which remains the industry's broadest battery-electric portfolio amongst traditional automakers. The OEM stated it plans to ""continue to make these models available to consumers"" despite the production adjustments. This creates an interesting manufacturing dynamic where the automaker maintains model diversity whilst constraining volume, essentially operating a portfolio strategy rather than the volume-production approach that characterised earlier plans.

How Ford's even larger writedown compares

GM's $6 billion EV charge, whilst substantial, appears modest compared to the $19.5 billion writedown announced by Ford in December. Ford's charge reflected the wholesale cancellation of multiple EV programmes, including the fully electric F-150 Lightning and additional truck and van projects planned as second-generation offerings.

Field Editor

Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is an emerging building material that could open new opportunities for Texas’ forestry economy.

CLT is a type of mass timber that is created by bonding multiple layers of kiln-dried lumber like 2x4s and 2x6s. The lumber is glued or nailed together to make a modern version of heavy timber that gives the panels strength and stability.

The panels are manufactured off-site in controlled factory settings and are then transported to construction locations where they can be assembled quickly, reducing build times for projects.

CLT panels can be used for flooring, walls and roofs.

“Mass timber systems like CLT are particularly compelling because they lend themselves to offsite manufacturing, which is ideal for both rural housing and dense urban projects,” James Michael Tate, an associate professor at Texas A&M University, said.

Tate also noted that CLT’s high strength-to-weight ratio allows for lighter foundations and faster construction, while its natural wood appearance becomes a visible design feature.

CLT offers an alternative to traditional steel and concrete construction and is gaining significant traction driven by a surplus of timber in East Texas.

“Across East Texas, we’re growing nearly double the amount of timber we’re harvesting,” Dr. Aaron Stottlemyer, department head of Forest Analytics at Texas A&M Forest Service, said. “That surplus creates a need for new markets. Mass timber, including CLT, is one of the most promising avenues for utilizing that excess in a sustainable way.”

Stottlemyer’s team monitors forest growth and harvest rates across Texas and provides data for land management and economic development. He sees CLT as a key component in building a circular economy that supports private landowners, the forest industry, conserves working forests and reduces carbon-intensive construction.

With Texas’ already robust forest industry, mass timber would be an opportunity to bring new markets to Texas.

“Texas is 95% privately owned, and when markets slump, you often start to see forests converted to non-forest uses like shopping malls, subdivisions, things made with concrete,” Stottlemyer said. “Strong timber markets encourage landowners to keep their land forested and invest in stewardship. That’s good for the environment and the economy.”

By the end of this decade, the job of batteries and power electronics at large facilities will shift from break-glass insurance to weekly or almost daily operations. This is part 1 of a two-part series.

Many experts are skeptical that the mission for critical power equipment could shift so soon, but this prediction is based on basic supply and demand: demand is rising, firm electricity supply is retiring, and aging equipment will be required to cycle in ways it was never designed for. The result will be more curtailments, more calls to run on-site power and price swings that make energy shifting with the assets you already own too valuable to ignore.

A short look ahead

Picture late summer in 2030: Rolling outages are now routine in several metros. Even where the lights stay on, generators and UPS systems at data centers and industrial campuses run dozens of times a year to ride through thin reserves and local constraints. Faced with massive demand growth, grid operators require large loads to make their backup generators available for dispatch during grid emergencies. This is already law in Texas.

Meanwhile, time-of-use rates swing from negative to punishing peaks. Finance leaders expect facilities to discharge storage batteries during expensive hours and recharge when prices dip, then ask again the next week. What used to be “standby” is now in the critical path.

That future comes from forces already in motion.

Why is this happening?

Load growth is no longer flat

For nearly a decade, U.S. electricity demand barely moved. That is no longer the case. Hyperscale AI campuses, a rebound in domestic manufacturing, electrification of heat and transport, and population growth are lifting both average load and peaks. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) estimates that U.S. power demand will increase more than 50% over the next 25 years.

According to Grid Strategies, the projection for peak demand growth in early 2024 was 67 GW. Later in the same year, however, their estimate nearly doubled to 128 GW—5% annually. By any measure, these load growth estimates are massive.

Grid planners have revised peak forecasts upward more than once in the past two years. New load arrives in clusters, so the impact concentrates in Northern Virginia, Texas, the Northeast corridor, and parts of California. Local transmission and distribution were not built for this ramp.

Dispatchable capacity has been retiring faster than it is being built

From the mid-2010s through the early 2020s, the U.S. retired nearly twice as much dispatchable capacity as it commissioned, as Thomas Popik of the Foundation for Resilient Societies shared in his address to the Electrical Generating Systems Association 2025 spring conference. Roughly 177 GW of coal, oil, older gas, and some nuclear units left the fleet; yet only 97 GW of firm capacity came online in return. Coal still supplied about 17 percent of U.S. electricity as recently as 2025, yet many units are old and expensive to maintain.

New firm capacity is not filling the gap quickly and the one gigawatt of nuclear capacity built recently was a decade under construction. New combined-cycle gas can be faster, but many projects face permitting, pipeline constraints, and long equipment lead times. Gas turbine manufacturers are swamped with orders, with delivery backlogs that stretch past 2029 already leading to project cancellations, like Engie pulling out of two gas plant projects in Texas earlier this year. Another source, Heatmap, says rather than pushing for massive expansion, gas turbine manufacturers are cautiously increasing capacity to protect high margins and guard against overcapacity should the present boom turn bust as it did post Enron.

Aging assets are being cycled hard

Large thermal plants were designed for steady baseload, yet many are now asked to cycle daily to deliver power when renewables don’t. Thermal stress stacks up, forced outages increase, and owners defer expensive life-extension on units with uncertain futures.

Distribution transformers, many already far beyond design life, fail more often as stresses rise. Replacement wait times have stretched. Two years for some distribution units is now common, and 400-ton generator step-up transformers can take three years or more. When restoration hinges on parts that take years, operators plan for more interim curtailments.

Why the usual “fixes” will not land fast enough

Transmission. Moving remote wind and solar to coastal load centers sounds simple until rights-of-way, litigation, and local opposition add years. Even with approvals in hand, extra-high-voltage transformers required for new transmission lines are built in small numbers and have very long lead times.

Utility-scale batteries. Grid batteries are effective for peak shaving and fast reserves, but today’s utility projects are commonly designed for four hours of discharge. This is too little runtime to ride through multi-day wind and solar droughts that still require firm generation. A simple thought experiment from Minnesota shows why: average daily consumption is 179 GWh. With 50% renewables penetration, covering this load for three days takes 269 GWh of storage, or three times the entire US installed BESS capacity in 2024. Extrapolated nationally, the energy required is a staggering 16,000 GWh – well beyond current manufacturing and financing capacity.

Nuclear. Nuclear reactors provide steady, carbon-free power. Long term, the nuclear fleet will grow. But nuclear will not scale in time to solve mid-decade shortfalls. The last U.S. large reactors took roughly 15 years from start to service and far exceeded early cost estimates. New technologies like small modular reactors are promising, but most designs still face first-of-a-kind licensing and fuel supply questions.

Gas. Most new firm capacity in interconnection queues is gas-fired. Many projects will still take several years from permit to operation, and pipeline capacity is tight in the very corridors that need the plants. Meanwhile OEMs report years-long backlogs, yet are cautious about adding factory capacity until demand is proven.

What it means inside the fence line

Industrial facilities cannot control build rates for new generation or transmission. They can, however, control how their sites ride through tight supply.

More interruptions and more requests to self-supply. Grid operators are already asking large users to curtail or run on-site power to protect stability. Data centers in particular are signing interruptible service agreements that put them first in line for curtailment when reserves thin.

Price volatility becomes an engineering problem. When off-peak prices go negative and peaks spike, the economics of shifting energy with storage become too large to ignore. Idle standby capacity gets pulled into daily or weekly duty cycles.

“Standby” batteries and power electronics become operational assets. Designs built for float service and rare discharges will be replaced by systems that cycle frequently, synchronize with the grid, and can both charge and export on command.

The role of standby generators. When reserves thin, operators will ask large sites to self-supply. That pulls standby generators into routine duty alongside storage. Expect more starts per year and more coordination between ATS/paralleling gear, batteries, and price signals. Generators carry the long events; batteries cover fast response and price shaping.

What this shift implies for design

Once standby becomes weekly duty, the design changes. You must specify storage for thousands of cycles and a long calendar life. And size it for two missions: holding a state-of-charge floor to ensure critical applications run during blackout, and adding enough energy above it for time-shifting. Replace one-way chargers with bidirectional, grid-synchronized converters sized to recharge quickly.

At higher power, DC bus must increase to 800 volts or more to keep conductor size manageable. Lower voltages are, in turn, supplied by DC-DC converters. Fault protection equipment and procedures are required by the new high voltage DC bus voltages. A subsequent article summarizes requirements for new power conversion and energy storage systems.

From standby to weekly duty

By the end of this decade, electricity shortages and blackouts will become more frequent, longer, and more widespread than at any time since the inception of the U.S. electric grid. During scarcity, the price of electricity will reach staggering heights. At other times, businesses will be paid to consume. As grid disruptions and volatile prices affect bottom lines, many C&I enterprises will add or repurpose stationary batteries.

While this will be a challenging time for America, suppliers of critical power equipment will see increased opportunities. Conventional designs will be replaced by more capable products. New suppliers will arise from within and from outside the industry. Legacy suppliers will need to adapt if they don’t want to be left sitting on the sidelines.

For us, the old ways of thinking are facing unprecedented challenges. As an industry, we will need to adapt or make way for those who do.

If standby power is going to work every week or more, equipment and operations must evolve. Upcoming Part 2 outlines the new requirements for critical power equipment across storage life and sizing, bidirectional conversion and controls, site infrastructure, and how to run the asset safely and profitably.

They emphasized permitting timelines, land access, and long-term power availability as key determinants of competitiveness.

Speaking during a CES panel on Thursday, Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) said the state is reducing its dependence on gaming revenue, which he said once dominated state finances and left Nevada constrained as casino development proliferated nationwide.

Lombardo said Nevada now marketed itself around regulatory simplicity, a stable tax environment, and workforce alignment aimed at logistics, manufacturing, and technology investment.

Lombardo said permitting speed and predictability had become decisive factors for businesses siting major projects. About 80 percent of Nevada’s land is federally controlled, he noted, making federal permitting timelines central to energy and infrastructure development.

Solar generation supplies roughly 50 percent of Nevada’s electricity, much of it on federal land, and Lombardo said the state was negotiating with the Trump administration over solar policy amid federal pullbacks, to match the state’s data center capacity as power demand grows.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy (R) presented a different case, centering his argument on scale, natural resources, and organized labor. He said about 60 percent of Alaska is federally controlled, and cited the state’s 65 percent share of the nation’s wetlands, more than 50 percent of the country’s freshwater, and large contiguous land areas as structural advantages unavailable elsewhere.

Alaska also has more than 150 volcanoes, which Dunleavy said offered long-term potential for the geothermal industry .

Dunleavy said Alaska’s economic trajectory had been constrained by federal permitting and regulatory actions, even though the state was once a major oil and gas producer. He pointed to a proposed 800-mile natural gas pipeline, designed to move gas to tidewater for export, with a projected capacity of 20 million tons per year and throughput of about 4.2 billion cubic feet per day.

Dunleavy said the project could support long-duration electricity for data centers, industrial facilities, and energy-intensive uses such as cryptocurrency mining.

On labor, Dunleavy said Alaska remained highly unionized - third highest by state - and argued that organized labor played a role in maintaining wage standards as automation and artificial intelligence expanded. He said the state faced demographic decline and shortages of skilled trades, including pipefitters and truck drivers, making workforce development as critical as capital investment.

Both governors said businesses were prioritizing energy cost, reliability, and regulatory certainty over incentives, with Lombardo emphasizing speed and predictability and Dunleavy emphasizing scale, power availability, and labor capacity.",https://broadbandbreakfast.com/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-08-at-7.12.32---PM-1.png,N,,2026-01-09 16:00:34.716806

General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards, according to a report from Yahoo Finance. Shares slid about 2% before the opening bell Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power. The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic. GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025. Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have been shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations. China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles. Earlier this month, Tesla was dethroned as the worlds largest EV automaker, replaced by Chinas BYD, which produced 2.26 million electric vehicles last year.

Until 2022, Vučić could get away with his balancing strategy, but Russia’s war against Ukraine has made foreign policy alignment a key criterion also for candidate countries.
Serbia under Vučić can further expect the same stagnation in its EU accession effort as last year.
At the same time, disappointment with US foreign policy toward Serbia — marked by self-interest and pragmatism rather than favoritism — has further weakened his position.
His areas of expertise include the Western Balkans, EU enlargement, and regional security.","If you think you had a bad year, just look at Aleksandar Vučić. Serbia’s strongman, now in power for almost a decade and a half, had a seriously bad 2025.

Challenges such as student protests, blows to economic megaprojects, and the failure to win hoped-for favoritism with President Trump put the Serbian leader in an uneasy position. This new year will be characterized by what we might term a Waiting for Godot strategy characterized by political damage control.

Internally, problems are not merely looming; they are so serious that they may represent the first nails in the government’s political coffin. The protests may have been student-led, but they encompassed a remarkably

heterogenous segment of Serbian society all year long. Popular unrest was triggered by the Novi Sad station canopy collapse in November 2024 that killed 16 people. Showing no signs of exhaustion, protesters are still firmly committed to their goals of greater accountability and transparency, a freer judiciary and media, and the holding of snap elections.

The masks are now off. Tactics often employed by the government, such as smear campaigns against activists and academic staff, distractions through self-generated crises in the north of Kosovo, and blaming neighboring or unnamed Western countries for interference, have failed to break the protesters’ spirit and support.

The more violent the government and its hooligans became in efforts to crack down on peaceful demonstrators, the more determined the demonstrators became. Their immunity to these tactics is a worrying sign for Vučić. How he finds a grip on this large, grassroots movement will remain a central question in 2026, too.

Although the power of the protesters speaks for itself (one rally in March attracted more than 300,000 demonstrators), it does not mean that the government — Vučić, in particular — will go quietly. A political standoff has emerged: any concession would either mean the end of the protests or the possible collapse of the system. This deadlock is likely to persist throughout the year.

Vučić was also forced to bid farewell to major economic projects. In November, the British-Australian mining company Rio Tinto announced the indefinite suspension of its proposed lithium mine investment in Serbia. A few weeks later, the American investment firm Affinity Partners, founded by President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, withdrew its Belgrade-based luxury development project. The lithium mining project would have brought around $3bn in badly needed foreign investment and the hotel construction about $500m.

For Vučić, losing these “pet projects” not only damages Serbia’s economy but also cuts deeply into his political ego. Additionally, the political benefits — namely, garnering extra votes through announcements of large-scale investment projects — remain an unfulfilled dream for the coming year.

The most pressing economic challenge Serbia will continue to face this year concerns its sole oil refinery. NIS, majority-owned by Russia’s Gazprom Neft, has been under US sanctions since March, with full enforcement effective from October 2025. Although OFAC, the Department of the Treasury’s responsive body, granted NIS a special license to continue operations until January 22, this does not change the requirement that Russian ownership must be reduced to exactly zero percent. Negotiations must also be finalized by mid-March — most likely with Hungary’s MOL purchasing the Russian shareholding — but the transaction still requires US approval.

The firm US stance on NIS demonstrates that Washington’s primary concern is not the interests of Serbia’s government but the removal of Russian energy influence and the expansion of American energy interests — such as liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and small nuclear power plants — across Europe, including the Balkans. This goal leaves little room for Vučić, despite his strong pro-Trump alignment.

These strict demands and deadlines caught Vučić off guard. He had hoped that Trump’s return to the White House would pave the way for the golden age of bilateral relations, bringing political and economic benefits to Serbia. Like Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and Republika Srpska’s Milorad Dodik in Bosnia, Vučić had high expectations of Trump’s presidency. Instead, the US administration has so far remained pragmatic, prioritizing its broader strategic interests over personal affinities in the Balkans.

The US continues to support mutual recognition as the desired outcome of the Serbia-Kosovo normalization talks, despite Vučić’s hope for a more “pro-Serbian” stance. Moreover, the bipartisan Western Balkans Democracy and Prosperity Act, part of the National Defense Authorization Act, reiterates the importance of mutual recognition, and also names Serbia as a country where democracy is deteriorating and electoral conditions are unfair.

There is still a strong bipartisan support for maintaining existing borders, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, and for regional stability. This position has even been echoed by Trump himself, who counts Serbia and Kosovo among the eight wars he claims to have ended in 2025.

In the European context, Serbia’s EU accession prospects have never been bleaker. A more outspoken European Commission and vocal member states have begun to challenge the government, despite acknowledging Serbia’s geopolitical importance for the region. Apart from rule-of-law issues, Serbia’s reluctance to align with the EU’s common foreign and security policy has become particularly costly. Until 2022, Vučić could get away with his balancing strategy, but Russia’s war against Ukraine has made foreign policy alignment a key criterion also for candidate countries.

Meanwhile, Serbia’s neighbors are slowly but steadily advancing on their EU accession paths, with Montenegro and Albania being prime examples. Serbia under Vučić can further expect the same stagnation in its EU accession effort as last year.

Under Vučić’s rule, Serbia has developed a system of state capture marked by rule-of-law deficiencies and a sharp decline across all major democratic indices. The long-standing balancing act between East and West — maintaining the façade of EU aspirations while deepening ties with Russia and China — is increasingly difficult, especially under global shifts and US foreign policy interests.

The problems of last year have not faded; they have only intensified. Internal pressures — especially the student-led protests — may force Vučić to call snap elections by the end of 2026 as a last-ditch effort to cement his reign.

At the same time, disappointment with US foreign policy toward Serbia — marked by self-interest and pragmatism rather than favoritism — has further weakened his position. Amid internal challenges and miscalculations about global political shifts working in his favor, the Serbian strongman may continue doing what he has done for most of the past year: pursue a wait-and-see policy, in hopes of ensuring his own survival.

The sweeping package provides tax law changes to individuals and businesses, while cutting various programs and credits. Most of these new tax changes start in 2026, with some affecting 2025 taxes filed in 2026 and some becoming effective later. The biggest part of the package is a permanent extension of the temporary tax rates established under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).

Holland & Hart has been advising clients on the law for over six months, as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury), and the White House develop regulations and implementation policies. The Administration’s earliest efforts focused on political efforts such as Trump Accounts for children, “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime,” and the new emphasis on rural Opportunity Zones. More matters are still to be finalized, such as foreign-entity-of-concern restrictions on clean energy credits, the status of Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program tied to 45Q and 45Z credits, and (as recently announced) guidance to resolve conflicts arising after the OBBBA passage to allow for retroactive application of the new international tax transition rules. After IRS and Treasury efforts, the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) will weigh in. Congress, meanwhile, is engaged in oversight and hearing from constituents on the effects of the law. The relevant Committees will be preparing for a potential technical corrections bill, either bipartisan or through the same partisan reconciliation process the OBBBA passed under last year.

Key Takeaways:

TCJA individual tax rates made permanent.

Tips and overtime premium pay deductible through 2028 with income caps.

Qualified Small Business Stock capital gain exemptions revised.

Most IRA clean energy credits repealed, including EV and residential credits, with various effective dates.

Opportunity Zones permanent with stricter rules and 30% rural basis step-up.

Permanent bonus depreciation, R&D expensing, and EBITDA business interest expense limitation.

Individuals

The law generally makes the seven rates created by the TCJA permanent.

Itemized Deductions

The temporary increase in the basic standard deduction passed in 2017 is made permanent in the OBBBA. The standard deductions are for married filing jointly $31,500, heads of household $23,625, and single filers and married filing separately $15,750. The itemized deduction limit for state and local taxes was raised temporarily to $40,000 for married and individual filers ($20,000 for married filing separately) beginning in 2025 and phases out above certain income levels. In 2030, the cap reverts to $10,000.

No Tax on Tips

Beginning with 2025 and continuing through 2028, workers in both traditional employment and self-employment arrangements can claim a deduction for qualifying tips earned in job categories identified as customarily tip-receiving positions, which categories the IRS proposed on September 19, 2025. This deduction applies to tips documented on W-2 forms, 1099 forms, other qualifying tax statements provided to the worker, or those self-reported using Form 4137.

No Tax on Overtime

From 2025 to 2028, workers earning qualifying overtime wages can deduct the premium portion of their overtime compensation. Specifically, the additional pay above their standard hourly rate (for example, the extra ""half"" in time-and-a-half pay) as mandated by Fair Labor Standards Act requirements and documented on W-2s, 1099s, or other qualifying tax forms. The deduction is capped at $12,500 annually for individual filers and $25,000 for married couples filing jointly. And the deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

Business

Holland & Hart has been advising clients on the tax changes since OBBBA enactment. The new and extended business rates include revival and permanency of the 100% bonus depreciation for equipment; revival and permanency of domestic R&E expensing along with some retroactive R&D expensing back to 2021 in certain cases; new international tax rates and rules; allowing the expensing of factories through 2028; extending and modifying the Clean Fuel Tax Credit; and enhanced Low-Income Housing Credit and New Markets Tax Credit.

The other side of the ledger is primarily from restricting and phasing out tax credits for clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced manufacturing and energy production enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), but also includes new floors for charitable deductions; sunsetting duty-free “de minimis” treatment for imports; and expanded reach of the executive compensation deduction limit.

Clean Energy

The changes to the IRA tax credits can be split into three categories: 1) repeals to consumer-focused credits related to electrifying vehicles and buildings; 2) more complex phaseouts and restrictions for power generation and other business-related credits; and 3) expansions to the clean fuel and carbon oxide sequestration credits.

The OBBBA permanently eliminated the new and used Clean Vehicle Credit. Additionally, it repeals the Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit. The alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit is terminated for property placed in service after June 30, 2026.

With January 1, 2025 behind us, many tax credit projects that “begin construction” under IRS rules from here on will be required to prove that their projects do not have material assistance from prohibited foreign entities. While President Trump ordered Treasury to provide guidance in this area within 45 days of July 7, 2025, IRS and Treasury continue work on these new foreign-entity-of-concern provisions. (Holland & Hart continues to advise clients on the statutory rules and is available to potentially influence the ongoing development of the guidance.)

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The law made the Opportunity Zones (OZ) program a permanent part of the tax code, tightened eligibility criteria and reporting rules, and added new incentives for rural areas. The current 8,764 OZ designations in the U.S. will end on December 31, 2026. All 50 governors will select new OZs starting July 1, 2026 (and every 10 years thereafter), and designations will take effect at the beginning of 2027.

New OZ eligibility requirements include a necessity for lower median incomes and elimination of the “contiguous tracts” exception. Opportunity Funds must now disclose total assets held, investment amounts, and data on employment and housing. Treasury will also now publish annual reports on OZ investments and economic performance. Rural Zones will now receive a 30% step-up in basis benefit (the standard is 10%) and require a lower level of improvement.

What’s Next?

Typically, after large tax packages are signed into law, decisions by the various Departments and agencies greatly impact the implementation. Congress often continues to make adjustments and technical corrections.

TerraPower in Mega Deal with Meta for Eight 345 MW Natrium Advanced Nuclear Plants

TerraPower, a nuclear innovation company, and Meta, which owns and operated multiple social media platforms, announced an agreement to develop up to eight Natrium reactor one and energy storage system plants.

This agreement supports the early development activities for two new Natrium units with rights for energy provided to Meta for up to six additional Natrium units. Each Natrium reactor provides 345 MW of baseload power, with built-in energy storage that can ramp up to 500 MW for over five hours. A dual Natrium reactor site can provide 690 MW of reliable 24/7 365 power, and up to 1 GW of dispatchable electricity. Each site selected by Meta is expect to host twin Natirum reactors for a total of 690 MW at each site.

Under this commercial agreement, Meta will provide funding to support the deployment of the Natrium plants, with delivery of initial units as early as 2032. This is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date and is the firm’s first direct investment in a new nuclear build.

At a hypothetical cost of $6,000/kW, each Natrium reactor will cost about $2.1 billion and eight of them would require about $17 billion. The size of the deal supports significant economies of scale for TerraPower’s supply chains as well as for the manufacturing of the reactors.

Power Will Support Meta Data Centers

Each reactor site will provide power for Meta’s data centers. Meta owns and operates several prominent social media platforms and communication services, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Threads. According to official Meta statistics, the combined user community world-wide is 3.9 billion users a month.

The companies will target identification of a specific site for the initial dual reactor unit later this year. The press materials did not indicate whether all sites would be limited to the U.S. Also, it was not indicated whether Meta would connect these sites to local/regional grids or select some or all of them as private wire installations for its data centers which would by pass the current multi-year backlog of FERC approvals of new grid connections.

The eight 345 MW advanced sodium cooled reactors would provide Meta with up to 2.8 GW of carbon-free, baseload energy. Each reactor comes with the Natrium technology’s innovative built-in energy storage system providing the capacity to boost total output to 4 GW of power.

Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO said, “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well-positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”

Urvi Parekh, director of global energy, Meta, said, “This agreement with TerraPower, the result of Meta’s nuclear RFP process, which identified leading developers of nuclear energy to help us advance our energy goals, marks a significant step forward in advancing next-generation nuclear technology. Supporting new nuclear energy generation spurs job growth, drives innovation in our local communities, and reinforces America’s leadership in energy technology.”

TerraPower began construction on the first commercial-scale, advanced nuclear project in the United States, which is expected to be complete in 2030. The Natrium plant is the only commercial advanced nuclear technology with a complete environmental impact statement and final safety review as part of a construction permit application pending with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Betting on HALEU Fuel

Meta and TerraPower are betting that sufficient supplies of HALEU uranium metal fuel will be available to fuel the reactors by the early 2030s. In October 2022 Global Nuclear Fuel–Americas (GNF-A), a GE-led joint venture, and TerraPower announced an agreement to build the Natrium Fuel Facility at the site of GNF-A’s existing plant site near Wilmington, NC. The product will be enriched uranium metal fuel based on TerraPower’s specifications and ready to be fabricated into the form use in the Natrium reactor.

The Natrium Fuel Facility will be jointly funded by TerraPower and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which aims to speed the demonstration of advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with U.S. industry. The facility represents an investment of more than $200 million.

The process, technologies, and expertise used to produce metal from depleted uranium can be used with uranium at the higher enrichment levels required to power TerraPower’s advanced reactor design. Production of HALEU metal is a crucial part of the fuel fabrication process which allows uranium to transform into a metallic feedstock that is used to fabricate fuel for advanced reactors.

In November 2025 Framatome and TerraPower achieved a key milestone in uranium metallization for advanced reactor fuel commercialization, producing successful elements of uranium metal. These metallic uranium ‘pucks’ represent a critical component in advancing the fuel supply chain for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor. The metallization fabrication line was completed at Framatome’s Richland, Washington, nuclear fuel manufacturing facility.

The input feed stock form is metallic fuel with sodium bonding up to 19.75% enriched feed material. Metallic fuel fabrication – Feed material cast with melted zirconium to form a slug, processed into a rod up to 19.75% enriched fuel rods. Each Natrium reactor requires refueling outages every 24 months. The outages can be scheduled to occur staggered with two refueling outages every second year and one refueling outage between. For two unit sites, one unit can be operating while another is being refueled. (TerraPower briefing on fuel for the Natrium reactor – PDF file)

Big Tech Rivals Also Looking To Nuclear Power

(NucNet) Meta’s big tech rivals are also looking to nuclear power to help fuel their AI work. Meta, Amazon and Google signed a pledge in March supporting the tripling of global nuclear energy production by 2050. All three companies have signed deals related to the development and use of nuclear power.

In June, Meta announced a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy so it could purchase purchase nuclear power from the company’s Clinton nuclear power station in Illinois beginning in 2027.

In 2024 Google said it will back the construction of seven SMRs from Kairos Power, becoming the first tech company to commission new nuclear power plants to provide low-carbon electricity for its energy-hungry data centres. Google has also agreed with electric utility NextEra to support the restart of the Duane Arnold nuclear power station in Iowa.

Microsoft announced that it would commit to buying 20 years’ supply of electricity from the mothballed Three Mile Island nuclear power plant – now renamed Crane – if Constellation restarted one of the two plants at the Pennsylvania site.

Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of the online retail giant founded by Jeff Bezos, acquired US power producer Talen Energy’s Cumulus data centre campus at the Susquehanna nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.

In October Amazon unveiled updated plans for an SMR facility in Washington that have 12 reactors producing a maximum of 960 MW of electricity.

The Cascade Advanced Energy Facility will be constructed in three phases, each with four of X-energy’s 80-MW, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors.

DOE Awards $2.7 Billion for Uranium Enrichment

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $2.7 billion to strengthen domestic enrichment services over the next ten years. The historic investment expands U.S. capacity for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and jumpstarts new supply chains and innovations for high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) to create American jobs and usher in the nation’s nuclear renaissance.

Enrichment Task Orders

Last year, DOE signed contracts with a total of six companies for LEU and HALEU enrichment that allowed them to bid on future work. Today, the Department announced task order awards with three companies that will transition the United States away from foreign sources of uranium and diversify the nation’s domestic fuel supply.

Developing this new domestic production capacity for LEU and HALEU ensures an adequate fuel supply is available to maintain operations of the nation’s 94 commercial reactors and builds a strong base to supply future deployments of advanced nuclear reactors. To ensure accountability, these awards will be distributed to the companies under a strict milestone approach.

The following companies were awarded task orders totaling $2.7 billion to provide enrichment services for LEU and HALEU:

American Centrifuge Operating ($900 million) to create domestic HALEU enrichment capacity

General Matter ($900 million) to create domestic HALEU enrichment capacity

Orano Federal Services ($900 million) to expand U.S. domestic LEU enrichment capacity

Innovative Technology Funding Opportunities

DOE also awarded an additional $28 million today to Global Laser Enrichment to continue advancing next generation uranium enrichment technology for the nuclear fuel cycle. The award is the result of a competitive solicitation issued last December.

Oklo, Meta Plan 1.2 GW Nuclear Energy Development in Southern Ohio

Meta’s agreement with Oklo highlights growing market demand for advanced nuclear energy and commitment to clean power

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) an advanced nuclear technology company, announced an agreement with Meta Platforms, Inc. (Nasdaq: META) that advances Oklo’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW power campus in Pike County, OH, to support Meta’s data centers in the region. The agreement provides a mechanism for Meta to prepay for power and provide funding to advance project certainty for Oklo’s Aurora powerhouse deployment.

Oklo will use the funds to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project—supporting the development of clean, reliable power in Pike County that can scale up to 1.2 GW. Meta’s commitment enables Oklo to pursue development in southern Ohio.

Oklo seeks to develop the project on 206 acres of land in Pike County owned by the company and formerly owned by the Department of Energy. The land purchase was facilitated in part by the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI), a nonprofit working to reuse the land for regional development.

The agreement is expected to lay the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs, expanding Ohio’s clean energy workforce, and generating new local and state tax revenues through investment in energy infrastructure.

Pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. The plans for the scalable powerhouse facility are expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to the full target of 1.2 GW by 2034.

Ohio’s location within the PJM interconnection—one of the nation’s largest grid systems—and its strong transmission network position it as a strategic hub for America’s clean energy growth as demand for artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure accelerates.

The project aligns with the broader redevelopment efforts led by SODI to transform thousands of acres at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant—a symbol of national strength where local families played a key role in America’s national security efforts—into a hub for advanced manufacturing and clean energy.

“The project brings into focus the potential for the transformative impact the redevelopment of this site can have on our energy infrastructure and the reinvigoration of our community,” said Kevin Shoemaker, General Counsel at SODI. “We appreciate our strong partnership with Oklo and look forward to continuing to work with them to bring more jobs and economic opportunity to the region.”

Oklo and DOE Partner to Deploy Radioisotope Pilot Facility

Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, announced that it has signed a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to support the design, construction, and operation of a radioisotope pilot plant under the DOE Reactor Pilot Program (RPP). Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization.

Atomic Alchemy Inc., an Oklo subsidiary, is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States. These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer, treating disease, powering medical research, and supporting national security. Today, many are produced overseas or in aging facilities. By first operating a pilot plant, Oklo can then scale into reliable, domestic production that helps ensure hospitals, researchers, and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials.

With the OTA now in place, Atomic Alchemy will focus its near-term resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization. As part of this learn-first-then-scale strategy, Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner-1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility.

Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security, healthcare infrastructure, and industrial leadership.

Oklo Developing an Plutonium Fueled Fast Test Reactor

The “Pluto” Reactor Project is a plutonium-fueled fast test reactor. Its purpose,unlike Oklo’s primary commercial product (the Aurora powerhouse), is designed as a test reactor to qualify surplus plutonium as a “bridge fuel” for commercial use. The Pluto project was selected under the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Reactor Pilot Program (RPP).

The strategic goal of the test reactor is to establish the technical basis for converting surplus U.S. government plutonium into HALEU fuel. This data will eventually support the licensing and operation of Oklo’s commercial Aurora reactors using recycled or alternative fuel sources.

In December 2025, Oklo and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) successfully conducted a series of “fast-spectrum plutonium criticality experiments” at the Nevada National Security Site. These tests demonstrated negative reactivity feedback, a critical safety feature where the reactor naturally shuts itself down as temperatures increase, providing the benchmark data needed for Pluto’s formal design and safety basis.

It is important to note that Pluto is distinct from Aurora. Aurora is Oklo’s flagship commercial powerhouse (intended for data centers, industrial sites, etc.). Pluto is the pilot/test reactor platform specifically focused on the plutonium fuel cycle and R&D.

Terrestrial Energy Executes DOE Agreement Under the Advanced Reactor Pilot Program

The OTA agreement provides for construction and operation of Project TETRA, Terrestrial Energy’s pilot reactor using Integral Molten Salt Reactor technology

Terrestrial Energy now positioned to move quickly from design to operation under DOE authorization, laying the groundwork for swift commercialization of IMSR plants

Terrestrial Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: IMSR), a developer of small modular nuclear power plants using its Generation IV reactor technology, announced that it has executed an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for Project TETRA, an initiative to construct and operate a pilot reactor which will support Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant development.

This announcement marks an important milestone in Terrestrial Energy’s engagement with the Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, established by Executive Order 14301, under which the Company is targeting IMSR plant deployment facilitated by the DOE’s accelerated authorization of pilot TETRA reactor operation.

The agreement establishes a direct, streamlined collaboration with the DOE to review and authorize the design and safe operation of the TETRA reactor, a molten salt-fueled, graphite-moderated reactor that uses standard assay, low-enriched UF6-based fuel (SALEU) containing less than five percent U-235.

This agreement enables Terrestrial Energy to move quickly from design to operation under DOE authorization. Executed under DOE’s authority at 42 U.S.C. § 7256(g), the OTA enables the Company to operate outside traditional federal contracting constraints, providing a flexible and agile framework designed for swift advanced reactor innovation.

Terrestrial Energy’s commercial IMSR plant is designed to produce 822 MWth (390 MWe) of flexible low-cost clean firm energy for electricity generation and industrial heat applications. Its high-temperature molten salt fuel design supports electricity generation at superior efficiency and direct thermal delivery for manufacturing, data center operations, and other industrial heat end users.

The reactor’s use of readily available SALEU fuel eliminates substantial obstacles from high assay low-enriched (HALEU) fuel dependency, strengthening supply security and enabling rapid scalability with existing U.S. manufacturing infrastructure. With IMSR technology, Terrestrial Energy is creating a short and practical path to low-cost clean firm nuclear energy at scale.

The Advanced Reactor Pilot Program, established under Executive Order 14301, enables the DOE to authorize privately built reactors outside its national laboratories. The program provides a streamlined pathway to regulatory authorization for operation, bridging the gap between pilot reactor operations for system testing, and licensing for commercial plant operation, advancing U.S. leadership in the advanced reactor sector. In September 2025, Terrestrial Energy was separately selected for the DOE Fuel Line Pilot Program.

ZettaJoule Targets Industrial Uses of Advanced Nuclear HTGR Technology

The new design is based on Japan’s R&D work on the HTTR, a 30 MWt HTGR.

ZettaJoule, Inc., an advanced small modular reactor company, says that a major focus for the first commercial application for its ZJ advanced nuclear technology is to provide heat and power to an oil and gas operation. With an emphasis on production of heat and power, a refinery site is a potential location for the firm’s first planned commercial units.

However, in the near term the firm is planning to develop a 30MWt research reactor. With all the activity at Texas university sites for new nuclear technologies, any one of them might welcome the project. ZettaJoule has not yet publicly named the specific university partner for its Texas site, though it has confirmed it is transitioning its headquarters to Houston, Texas to support its initial project at an “as-yet-unnamed Texas university” and its first industrial commercial project in the state.

While the initial research reactor will be at a university in Texas, one possible commercial focus for ZettaJoule in Texas is the oil and gas refineries. While the first proposed ZettaJoule reactor is designed to produce 30 MWt, commercial units may approach may approach 300MWe.

ZettaJoule’s proposed ZJ research reactor (non-power) is designed with the unique ability to operate operate up to 950 C, which is 600° C higher than conventional water-cooled reactors.

ZettaJoule’s ZJ reactor will be developed by modernizing proven, publicly available, safety-tested technology derived from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s HTTR, which began operating in 1998 and reached full power capacity in 2001.

About the Reactor Technology and Fuel

The ZettaJoule ZJ reactor is a High-Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR) based on modernized technology derived from the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s HTTR (High-Temperature Engineering Test Reactor). The target for a construction permit for the modernized design is projected by ZettaJoule to be within the next two to three years (by 2028-2029).

Power Ratings: While the initial ZJ reactor is designed to produce 30 MWt, ZettaJoule’s roadmap includes scaling future commercial units to higher capacities approaching, such as 300 MWe from a 600 MWt source.

Heat Transfer System: It uses gas cooling (helium) to produce high-grade process heat.

Fuel Type: The ZJ reactor will use TRISO fuel which consists of uranium particles individually encapsulated in multiple protective layers of pyrocarbon and silicon carbide. They retain fission products even at temperatures as high as 1600° C. The ZJ reactor is expected to use LEU+ fuel, which is at 5-10 percent enrichment, to ensure commercial availability. The possible use of HALEU fuel may be considered at a later time. Most advanced reactors being developed in the U.S. use much higher levels of enrichment, e.g., up to 19.75% U235.

Investors, MOUs and Expected Uses

Aramco Support: ZettaJoule has received formal support from Aramco Services Company (an affiliate of Motiva Enterprises). Aramco is evaluating applications for its upstream and downstream operations.

Major Investors: Globis Capital Partners (GCP) is a known early investor, having participated in a seed round in December 2024. Significant in addition to Globis Capital Partners (GCP) are, Coral Capital, Archetype Ventures, HAX, and SOSV.

Regulatory Affairs: The firm has a dedicated regulatory leadership team, including Rumina Velshi, formerly President and CEO of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (Regulatory Affairs) and Andrea Veil, formerly Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation at the NRC (SVP Regulatory Strategy). However, the firm has not yet announced its plans to submit a regulatory engagement plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

Hydrogen Production: While the primary focus mentioned is high-temperature process heat for industrial sectors, HTGRs capable of reaching 950°C also provide efficient ways to produce hydrogen. Industry analysis continues to highlight hydrogen production as a key expected use for such high-heat technologies.

VISTRA Inks 20-Year PPA with Meta; Uprates Planned at Three Nuclear Plants

Vistra (NYSE: VST) announced it has entered into 20-year PPAs to provide more than 2,600 MW of zero-carbon energy from a combination of three different Vistra nuclear plants to support Meta’s operations in the region.

The agreements include 2,176 MW of operating generation and an additional 433 MW of combined power output increases, which will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the United States. Vistra will now begin planning for subsequent license extensions at all three plants, which would extend operations of these carbon-free assets for another 20 years. Meta’s purchases under the agreements will begin in late 2026, with additional capacity added to the grid through 2034, when the full 2,609 MW of power will be online.

Through the agreements:

Meta is purchasing 2,176 MW of nuclear energy and capacity from the operating Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio;

Meta is also purchasing 433 MW of incremental nuclear energy and capacity from equipment upgrades to increase generation output (called uprates) at the Perry (Ohio), Davis-Besse (Ohio), and Beaver Valley (Pennsylvania) plants – more than 15% of the contracted capacity announced today will be new capacity added to the PJM region;

the electricity generated at the plants will continue to go to the grid for all electricity users.

Each of the three plants has received initial license renewal from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The PPAs provide certainty for Vistra to pursue subsequent license renewal for each of the reactors, which would extend each license an additional 20 years. Currently, Beaver Valley Unit 1 is licensed through 2036; Davis-Besse is licensed through 2037; Perry is licensed through 2046; and Beaver Valley Unit 2 is licensed through 2047.

Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology

As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.

These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.

TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology

Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”

Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio

Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.

This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. Oklo Aurora powerhouses are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.

“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”

Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy

Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our first nuclear energy agreement helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.

Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.

Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.

“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”

While Illinois is promoting solar and storage, California is eyeing the rental population for plug-and-play systems.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA), paving the way for the state to deploy 3 GW of grid-scale battery storage by 2030. It will also boost solar and virtual power plants (VPP) in the state.

Under the act, utilities will be required to create VPP programs that pay homes and businesses for letting their smart devices – like solar panels, batteries, EVs, and smart thermostats – help supply or save electricity.

It increases the maximum size of community solar projects to 10 MW and establishes a Solar Bill of Rights that allows municipal and cooperative utilities to install rooftop solar panels. The Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) will be able to expedite renewable energy projects before federal tax credits expire.

The state expects the CRGA to lower monthly utility bills and save consumers $13.4 billion over the next 20 years.

“Under this law, we'll end price gouging by private grid owners and begin to bring down costs here in Illinois, starting with people’s utility bill,” said Lieutenant Governor Juliana Stratton. “Energy prices will come down without sacrificing our other priorities — Illinois will continue to be a leader in renewable energy and grid reliability.”

The CRGA builds upon the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) and the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA). It has installed over 6 GW of renewable energy since the passage of CEJA, while an additional 6 GW is currently under development in the state.

The state has also lifted the moratorium on new, large nuclear reactors to promote new, carbon-free energy resources.

Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) has welcomed the development. SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said, “This landmark law is a model for how states can secure their energy future and lower costs for families and small businesses. A 21st-century economy requires a 21st-century grid, and solar, storage, and Virtual Power Plants are made for this moment.”

Sarah Cottrell, SVP of State affairs at American Clean Power Association (ACP), added that this act will improve reliability and create clean-energy and manufacturing jobs in the state.

Efforts to boost clean energy are also ongoing in another Democratic Party-governed state, California. Senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco has introduced the Clean Homes and Energy Affordability Package (CHEAP). It comprises SB 868, The Plug And Play Solar Act, to promote the use of small-scale mobile solar systems – also called balcony solar – that can lower energy costs for renters, apartment dwellers and homeowners. California has around 14 million rental units, making it a ready market for such installations.

Electricity generated by plug-and-play systems can be used directly to power refrigerators, air conditioners, or other home appliances, reducing grid load.

California aims to follow in the footsteps of the Utah market, which passed a law enabling the use of these systems, said Wiener.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2026-01-09%2Fm92ok8dg%2FBalcony-Solar.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-09 14:00:41.145473

Sodium-ion batteries, on the other hand, show promise as an eco-friendly and affordable alternative.
However, sodium is heavier than lithium, which means sodium-ion batteries provide less energy than lithium-ion batteries of the same weight and size.
“I am most inspired by the possibility of discovering entirely new materials that could transform energy technologies,” Zeng said.","A Florida State University researcher has been honored for her work developing new materials that enable more efficient energy storage and produce cleaner energy for daily use, ranging from phones and laptops to electric cars and renewable energy systems.

Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Yan Zeng has earned a 2025 Materials Today Rising Star Award in recognition of her contributions to the field of energy conversion and storage, including her work in designing sodium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. This year, she is one of nine researchers worldwide to receive this distinction and is the first-ever honoree from FSU.

“It is an honor to be recognized by the community, and I feel thankful to everyone who has supported my work,” Zeng said. “It is especially meaningful because it recognizes our early efforts in energy conversion and storage research; the award encourages me to keep pushing this work forward and continue to grow as a researcher.”

First granted by the Materials Today Family of Journals in 2018, the Materials Today Rising Star Awards recognize early career researchers who are poised to become future leaders in the fields of materials science and engineering, highlighting the exceptional potential of their works’ real-world impact.

“Our goal in the Zeng Research Lab is to create better materials for storing energy, which ultimately affects everyday technologies,” Zeng said. “Even though the chemistry is complex, the goal is simple: make energy safer, cleaner, and more reliable for everyone.”

In early 2024, Zeng joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s $50 million Low-cost Earth-abundant Na-ion Storage Consortium, or LENS Consortium, which aims to discover, develop, and demonstrate a new class of sodium-ion batteries for use in electric vehicles.

Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries. While these cut down on emissions, lithium poses several risks, both environmental and economic. Mining lithium often requires large amounts of water in arid areas; this process not only damages ecosystems, but manufacturing lithium-ion batteries is also energy intensive and produces considerable greenhouse gas emissions. These challenges, among others, contribute to the supply chain risks associated with lithium.

Sodium-ion batteries, on the other hand, show promise as an eco-friendly and affordable alternative. By swapping sodium for lithium, Zeng’s research hopes to reduce reliance on critical elements, or chemicals that are in high demand but limited supply. However, sodium is heavier than lithium, which means sodium-ion batteries provide less energy than lithium-ion batteries of the same weight and size. Zeng aims to push past this barrier by designing brand-new element and structure combinations that will allow sodium-ion batteries to not only compete with but outperform their lithium-ion counterparts.

“I am most inspired by the possibility of discovering entirely new materials that could transform energy technologies,” Zeng said. “The combination of creative chemistry, data-driven tools, and curiosity-driven exploration keeps the work exciting every day. My lab leverages artificial intelligence and automation to accelerate discovery and optimization, opening up opportunities to uncover design principles and innovations.”

Zeng’s approach to creating and optimizing new materials is unique for its integration of automation and AI to accelerate the research process. For example, an automated robotic arm is used to complete some of the lab’s repetitive work, such as carrying out individual chemical reactions. After each successful synthesization, or creation of a new substance, Zeng employs AI as a springboard for new ideas, considering what types of tweaks could optimize the new material.

“Designing solid-state materials has been challenging due to chemical complexity, and gaining empirical knowledge via human repetitive work is very costly and time consuming,” said Wei Yang, chair of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. “Dr. Zeng is a pioneer in her field for integrating AI with robotics, a method that has attracted tremendous national and international attention.”",https://news.fsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zeng_TW.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:02:19.732169

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in a regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM’s writedown – a $4.2 billion cash charge – is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, who had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its US lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” it said in its filing.

The company will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges in 2026 as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but expects them to be less than its 2025 EV charges.

GM placed a big bet on EVs

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when President Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on September 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest US automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the US, GM’s largest and most profitable market. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla.

The company also said on Thursday that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

EV sales are down industrywide

GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter after the loss of the consumer tax credit. Sales hit record highs in the previous three months, when customers rushed to buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

Automotive data provider Edmunds expects EVs to account for about 6% of overall US vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025.

Ford’s shift, in which it essentially killed off its entire planned second generation of EVs, resulted in a much higher charge. Ford CEO Jim Farley said it was a painful but necessary move as the market cooled.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Farley told Reuters in a December interview.

Ford is now setting its EV hopes on a brand-new architecture that will enable the production of affordable models, starting with a $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gm-electric-vehicles.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767889561&w=1200,N,,2026-01-09 11:03:52.810365

25%: GM Takes A $7.1 Billion Hit As It Trims EV Plans

Throughout the 2020s automakers moved fast and spent big on EVs. Billions of dollars flowed into retooling factories, developing new models and locking in battery manufacturing contracts.

After the Trump administration and Congress targeted pro-EV policies last year, that momentum began to sputter. Automakers embarked on an expensive retreat as they unwound some of their EV investments and refocused on combustion.

The must-read auto and tech roundup, delivered every morning.

For General Motors, that pullback has come with a hefty price tag. The company booked $7.1 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of last year, according to a Thursday SEC filing, much of it a result of reversing EV plans.

The automaker attributed $1.1 billion to costs associated with the restructuring of its China joint venture, where it operates under the SAIC-GM banner. The bulk of the hit, about $6 billion, had to do with pumping the brakes on EVs in North America. That’s on top of a $1.6 billion charge it took last year, also due to a slowdown in EV sales.

Here’s how GM explained the move:

With the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, industry-wide consumer demand for EVs in North America began to slow in 2025.

As a result, GM proactively reduced EV capacity, including by pivoting the Company’s assembly plant in Orion, MI from EV production to the production of full-size SUVs and full-size pickups powered by internal combustion engines, where we believe we have unmet demand, and we proactively reduced battery cell capacity, including by selling our interest in Ultium Cells LLC’s Lansing, MI facility to LG Energy Solution.

The $6 billion includes $1.8 billion in non-cash charges and $4.2 billion that will have a cash impact, including contract cancellation fees. Crosstown rival Ford made a similar announcement last month, though on an even larger scale. It expects an over $19 billion hit to profits due to its own restrategizing, which saw the cancellation of the F-150 Lightning.

General Motors was the second highest-selling EV automaker last year in the U.S. behind Tesla. And its EV portfolio is among the strongest in the industry, with about a dozen models across the Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC brands.

But the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit and a major rewrite of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations, which now no longer carry any penalties, changed the math for automakers. EV sales plunged in the fourth quarter, and it’s not clear how quickly they’ll rebound.

GM made clear that its deep lineup isn’t impacted by Thursday’s announcement, however.

“Our strategic realignment of EV capacity does not impact today’s retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EVs in production,” GM said. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers.”

50%: China Seeks To Tighten Screws On Battery Production Overcapacity

The Chinese government summoned the country’s largest battery makers for EVs and energy storage systems to a closed-door meeting to mitigate price wars and curb battery production overcapacity, the state-run China Daily reported Thursday.

Some 16 companies including CATL, BYD, Gotion, Svolt and Eve Energy attended the session, as Chinese regulators pledged to tighten oversight in the market, enforce more strict rules around pricing, improve quality and crack down on intellectual property violations, the outlet reported.

According to research firm BloombergNEF, China is grappling with a significant oversupply of batteries. In other words, the country has built far more battery capacity than the world can currently absorb, even before factoring in the next wave of projects already in the pipeline.

That oversupply has helped to drive down battery prices to new lows, but unchecked growth clearly presents issues too.

Global automakers will roll into this weekend’s Brussels Motor Show with a broad lineup of futuristic EVs. The spotlight will be firmly on Europe-focused models. The region is far ahead of the U.S. on the EV adoption curve, though it still trails China.

EVs worth watching, as compiled by Automotive News, include the upcoming Kia EV2, Citroën’s Elo Concept electric utility van, the battery-powered version of Hyundai’s Staria van, Mazda’s second Europe-only EV following the 6e sedan and Renault’s reborn electric Twingo.

BYD, meanwhile, will be there with as many as nine models on display. Tesla will also be present, bringing its lower-priced Standard trims of the Model 3 and Model Y, according to the outlet.

Shares slid about 2% before the opening bell Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power. GM operates Fort Wayne Assembly which makes Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.

Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.

China has become a global leader in electric vehicle technology in recent years, with factories there churning out millions of cars and laying the groundwork for a massive charging network for vehicles.

West Pharmaceutical Services — a century-old pharmaceutical company that manufactures self-injection devices, syringe components and seals for injectable packaging systems — announced Thursday morning it plans to expand its network by adding a manufacturing site in Greenfield.

West will occupy the warehouse at 989 Opportunity Parkway, which housed BWI Group from 2019-2024. Company leaders hope to create over 300 high-paying job in manufacturing, quality, engineering, automation and support functions at the future Greenfield location.

“Indiana offers an ideal environment for growth — with a strong manufacturing base, a talented workforce and a welcoming community,” said Aileen Ruff-Patry, president of West Contract Manufacturing. “We’re excited to be expanding here, creating new jobs, and partnering with local organizations to make a positive impact in the region.”

West has locations in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, plus its global headquarters in Pennsylvania. West’s expansion into Indiana represents the company’s focus on its Midwestern operations.

Greenfield City Council member Dan Riley noted the pharmaceutical industry is a competitive one to land.

“Project Crossroads — as we have called the West project — is an exciting addition to our manufacturing, distribution and commercial portfolio,” he said. “Pharmaceutical manufacturing is an innovative field that communities compete fiercely to land, and Greenfield is proud to be a destination for a company building the future of global health.

“West is a community-minded company that wants not to just have a facility here, but be a part of the city as we continue on our path of quality growth. We look forward to their coming to 989 Opportunity Parkway in 2026.”

Under the Project Crossroads code name, Greenfield City Council approved a letter of commitment affirming the body’s support for the project at a November meeting. In the letter, the company would invest $48 million in machinery and equipment between 2025 and 2028, and an additional $42 million in capital investment between 2029 and 2035.

When West first moves in, according to the letter, there will be 90 jobs with an average salary of $75,000. Between 2027 and 2030, the number of jobs at the facility will grow by 210 employees, “subject to customer demands and solutions.”

The letter also states Greenfield City Council would consider a granting a 15-year personal property tax abatement to the company, with potential tax savings of $5.5 million.

“”I look forward to the relationship the City of Greenfield will have with West,” Greenfield Mayor Guy Titus said. “Having this first-class company become a part of our community will be a tremendous opportunity for us. West makes products people depend on while creating cutting-edge jobs, and we are thrilled to be recognized as a place where pioneering, life-changing industries want to invest and grow.

“Our economic development team has done a great job securing another high-profile company providing positive development and growth for Greenfield’s future.”

Greenfield has had a long history of involvement in the pharmaceutical industry. The Lilly Biological Laboratories on U.S. 40 was built in the 1910s and was a laboratory complex for Eli Lilly and Co. until Lilly sold it in 2008. That property is now home to toxicology and developmental and reproductive toxicology facilities for Labcorp.

In 2007, Elanco, a pharmaceutical company focused on drugs for animals, moved its global headquarters to a dedicated campus located at Interstate 70 and Ind. 9 to Greenfield. Last year, Elanco vacated its Greenfield campus to move into a new headquarters complex in Indianapolis.

Indiana has emerged as a major pharmaceutical hub in the United States and worldwide, with companies such as Lilly, Roche, Zimmer Biomet and Elevance Health either being headquartered or having a significant base of operations in the Hoosier State. A 2024 report by the Biotechnology Industry Organization showed the Indianapolis metropolitan area as fourth in the nation for number of employees in the pharmaceutical industry.

“This investment will bring more than 300 high-paying jobs to a state that leads the nation in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and logistics,” Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said in the press release. “Indiana’s capable workforce and strong business environment continue to attract world-class companies like West.

Now, a U.S. technology could save nearly 800,000 bats annually.
Recent studies have found that offshore wind turbines negatively affect marine mammals.","Sometimes we suffer the consequences of our own actions, regardless of whether our intent was for the greater good or not. This is evident regarding our renewable energy technologies. Take wind turbines, for example. The global installed wind capacity at the end of 2025 was predicted to surpass 1,320 GW and reportedly offset nearly 1.3 billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually. Yet, turbines triggered a reaction no one expected, but a certain U.S. technology could make the difference.

Wind turbines triggered a reaction no one expected

Wind energy and its associated technologies have significantly grown in both popularity and capacity. According to the World Wind Energy Association, wind power is now responsible for almost 12% of the global power supply. However, conventional turbine designs have been found to trigger a reaction that no one expected before, until now.

The UN Environment Programme has found that millions of bat fatalities occur on an annual basis due to wind turbines. It added that these fatalities occur globally, as bats are on every continent, excluding Antarctica. For example, the approximate number of annual bat fatalities due to turbines in the following countries is:

50,000 in Canada

More than 200,000 in Germany

More than 500,000 in the U.S.

Global bat populations are rapidly declining, especially considering their slow reproduction rates and their long gestation period, as per the Animal Diversity Web. Now, a U.S. technology could save nearly 800,000 bats annually. But why exactly do wind turbines lead to bat fatalities? Find out below.

Now, a U.S. technology could save 800,000 bats

A CNN Science report found that the most recent evidence indicates that the majority of bat fatalities are due to direct impact with fast-moving turbine blades. Another cause of death in bats due to turbines is barotrauma. Turbine barotrauma is a low-pressure area near the blades that can rupture bats’ lungs and cause internal bleeding.

One of the current methods to prevent bat fatalities is called “blanket curtailment.” This entails halting wind turbines during low wind speeds, as this is when bats will most likely be present. This reduces bat fatalities by nearly 60%, but it also decreases annual wind energy output by more than 10%. The latest solution? A U.S-based company called EchoSense believes the answer is “smart curtailment.”

Sensors are added to the turbine blades that detect echolocating signals of bats. Once the signal is detected, the turbine is halted to allow bats to pass in a timely manner. This also reduced the amount of lost energy. Unfortunately, bats are not the only wildlife that are impacted by wind turbines. Recent studies have found that offshore wind turbines negatively affect marine mammals.

Other disadvantages of wind turbines that must be addressed

The chief scientist at Bat Conservation International believes that the only way to protect wildlife is to increase focus on wind turbine operation and displacement to keep risks to a minimum. In a statement, he added:

“We want to find ways in which we can maximize energy production, but do that in a way that is ecologically responsible and not causing biodiversity loss.”

Besides wildlife mortality and habitat disruption, other disadvantages of wind turbines that must also be addressed include:

Visual impact

Noise pollution

Radar interference

Transmission challenges

Difficulty recycling the blades

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030.
It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.
Its goal was to make the vast majority of the vehicles electric by 2035, and the entire company carbon neutral five years after that.
Those plans have be shaken due to the drastic differences in economic and environmental policies between the Biden and Trump administrations.","General Motors will be hit with charges of about $6 billion as sales of electric vehicles sputter after the U.S. cut tax incentives to buy them and also eased auto emissions standards.

Shares slid about 2% before the opening bell Friday.

The charges that will be recorded in the fourth quarter follow an announcement in October that the Detroit automaker would take a $1.6 billion charge for the same reason in the previous quarter, with automakers forced to reconsider ambitious plans to convert their fleets to electric power.

The EV tax credit ended in September. The clean vehicle tax credit was worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones.

GM, which had been the most ambitious among all U.S. automakers with plans to replace internal combustion engines, said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday that the $6 billion in charges includes non-cash impairments and other non-cash charges of about $1.8 billion as well as supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees, and other charges of approximately $4.2 billion.

EVs have been considered to be the future of the US automotive industry. GM announced in 2020 that it was going to invest $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, a 35% increase over plans made before the pandemic.

GM expected more than half of its factories in North America and China would be capable of making electric vehicles by 2030. It also pledged at the time to increase its investment in EV charging networks by nearly $750 million through 2025.

GM will record about $6 billion in EV-related charges tied to reduced production and supplier contract settlements.

The writedown reflects weaker EV demand following the end of federal tax credits and shifting policy priorities.

GM will maintain its current EV lineup but continue adjusting production and investments to match market conditions.

General Motors will record roughly $6 billion in charges tied to its pullback from electric vehicle investments, reflecting weaker EV demand, policy changes under the Trump administration and reduced production plans across its supply chain.

The Detroit automaker disclosed the writedown in a regulatory filing Thursday, confirming it will be recorded as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings. When combined with a $1.1 billion charge related to restructuring a China joint venture, GM’s total fourth-quarter special charges will reach $7.1 billion.

Most of the EV-related charge, about $4.2 billion, is expected to have a cash impact and is tied to supplier contract cancellations, settlements and other commercial adjustments. The remaining portion consists of non-cash impairments related to scaled-back EV production plans.

GM said the writedown will not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen electric models, which remains the broadest EV portfolio among legacy automakers. The company said it plans to continue offering those vehicles while adjusting production levels to better align with current market demand.

The automaker expects additional EV-related charges in 2026 as negotiations with suppliers continue, though it said those costs should be lower than the impairments recorded in 2025.

GM’s decision follows similar moves across the industry. Ford Motor in December announced plans to take about $19.5 billion in charges after canceling multiple EV programs. Automakers have been scaling back EV investments since mid-2024, when changes to federal policy darkened the outlook for electric vehicle adoption.

EV sales momentum slowed sharply after the Trump administration ended a $7,500 federal consumer tax credit on Sept. 30. GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter as buyers rushed purchases earlier in the year before the incentive expired.

GM has already paused battery production at two joint-venture plants, reduced shifts at an EV-only factory in Detroit and pivoted a planned Michigan EV facility toward producing full-size pickups and SUVs. Despite EV headwinds, GM gained U.S. market share in 2025, primarily driven by strong demand for gas-powered trucks and SUVs.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01092026-GM-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:04:00.149858

Oklo Aurora powerhouse (Image: Oklo)

Oklo will use the funds to secure nuclear fuel and advance Phase 1 of the project—supporting the development of clean, reliable power in Pike County that can scale up to 1.2 GW. Meta's commitment enables Oklo to pursue development in southern Ohio. Oklo seeks to develop the project on 206 acres of land in Pike County owned by the company and formerly owned by the Department of Energy. The land purchase was facilitated in part by the Southern Ohio Diversification Initiative (SODI), a nonprofit working to reuse the land for regional development.

""Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced reactors in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality. We have finalized the purchase of over 200 acres in Pike County and are excited to announce this agreement in support of a multi-year effort with Meta to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio,"" said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo's co-founder and CEO. ""Meta's funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward.""

The agreement is expected to lay the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora powerhouses, creating thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs, expanding Ohio's clean energy workforce, and generating new local and state tax revenues through investment in energy infrastructure.

Pre-construction and site characterization are slated to begin in 2026, with the first phase targeted to come online as early as 2030. The plans for the scalable powerhouse facility are expected to expand incrementally to deliver up to the full target of 1.2 GW by 2034.

Ohio's location within the PJM interconnection—one of the nation's largest grid systems—and its strong transmission network position it as a strategic hub for America's clean energy growth as demand for artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure accelerates.

Oklo's business model allows large energy users to fund their own generation and add new clean power to the grid supported by private capital investment. The agreement provides Oklo with the commercial support needed to advance the development of power infrastructure to support future data center capacity for Meta. This means that Meta is paying to help add more power to Ohio, which will support a reliable grid for all energy customers in the region. This project will also add local jobs to build and operate the nuclear facilities.

""Our agreement with Oklo enables the development of 1.2 gigawatts of nuclear energy in Southern Ohio, supporting Meta's operations in the region—including our AI supercluster in New Albany. This project will create jobs, spur local innovation, and advance American leadership in energy technology. By investing in baseload nuclear energy, we're helping build a resilient and sustainable future for our communities,"" said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy, Meta.

The project aligns with the broader redevelopment efforts led by SODI to transform thousands of acres at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant—a symbol of national strength where local families played a key role in America's national security efforts—into a hub for advanced manufacturing and clean energy.

""The project brings into focus the potential for the transformative impact the redevelopment of this site can have on our energy infrastructure and the reinvigoration of our community,"" said Kevin Shoemaker, General Counsel at SODI. ""We appreciate our strong partnership with Oklo and look forward to continuing to work with them to bring more jobs and economic opportunity to the region.""

She said many of the charging stations are on Green Bay’s west side with a smattering of locations on the east side.
Tony Evers recently announced $14 million in funding for charging stations across the state which are supported by the national electric vehicle infrastructure program.
“I feel like there’s a lot more charging stations in other areas compared to here,” she said.
“It’ll give you a map that’s built in so you know where charging stations are as you’re traveling,” Forst said.","HOWARD, Wis. — Stephanie Forst searched for a new vehicle for four to six months.

She bought her new Volkswagen ID4 Pro electric vehicle at the end of September, just days before federal tax credits on the vehicles ended.

“I thought with maintenance it would be easier. You don’t have the oil changes,” Forst said about her decision to buy an EV. “It’s better for the environment.”

The switch to an EV has also meant finding a place to charge up in the Green Bay area. She said many of the charging stations are on Green Bay’s west side with a smattering of locations on the east side.

“I would think there would be more coming up in the future. There are more electric cars becoming available,” Forst said about future access to charging in the state. “A lot of the new (EVs) are coming up in 2026. I drove quite a few before I decided on what vehicle I was going to get. Hopefully we get more because it would be convenient to have them at more spots.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration attempted to block federal funding for EV infrastructure projects after the ability to use that money was passed by the state with bipartisan support in 2024.

The paused federal program was restarted in August after 16 states — including Wisconsin — filed a lawsuit.

Gov. Tony Evers recently announced $14 million in funding for charging stations across the state which are supported by the national electric vehicle infrastructure program. It includes locations in both urban and rural areas.

Logan Burrows is living in the Green Bay area while going to school in Grand Chute. A charging station in at a Meijer in Howard is preferred place to plug in his Ford F-150.

“This charger in particular is the fastest one I’ve found in the area,” he said. “I charge about once a day.”

A native of Fence in northern Wisconsin, Burrows said he’d like to see similar charging options in smaller communities.

“Up north, you’ve got Crivitz that has one that takes hours. There’s one in Wausaukee that’s about as fast as this one,” he said. “In Iron Mountain (Mich.) there’s one that also takes hours, six hours. Iron Mountain should have one that’s faster than that. I’d love to see more fast ones.”

Twenty-six charging locations are included in the latest announcement from the state.

Forst said her farthest trip so far has been Appleton, but she’s open to a longer road trip to other cities like Minneapolis.

“I feel like there’s a lot more charging stations in other areas compared to here,” she said.

Her vehicle will also lend a helping hand.

The 185MW-alternating current (MWac) Beekman Solar Project in Morehouse Parish completed its financial close in late November 2025, while the 200MWac Hollis Creek Solar Project in Sabine Parish finalised its financing last month.

Treaty Oak has long-term agreements in place with Meta Platforms, under which the Facebook owner will purchase the facilities’ environmental attributes, while the projects’ electricity will be delivered to the local grid.

Treaty Oak CEO Chris Elrod said: “Closing the financing for these two projects during a challenging economic year for renewable energy projects underscores our strong business model and commitment to bringing energy independence to states like Louisiana.

“I am incredibly proud of our teams and grateful to our financing partners, suppliers, and vendors for their collaboration in making these projects a reality while supporting our commitment to build a US-based supply chain for our customers.”

The Beekman project secured $410m in non-recourse senior secured credit facilities, including a construction-to-term loan, letter of credit facilities and a tax credit bridge loan.

CIB, Crédit Agricole, ING Capital, MUFG, National Australia Bank and SMBC acted as coordinating lead arrangers, with each of them serving as bookrunner, green loan coordinator and hedge provider.

Prosecutors concede they are asking the state’s highest court to do something out of the ordinary in bypassing the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which initially hears the majority of criminal appeals. Death penalty cases are the only ones that are appealed directly to the state Supreme Court.

But Heidi M. Williams, special deputy attorney general, said the case demands immediate review by the state Supreme Court for several reasons, including the high-profile nature of the case and because it involves “legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the state.”

Williams argues that any “delay in final adjudication poses a risk of substantial harm” and that the appeal is “important in overseeing the integrity of the court system.”

Two decades ago, five teenagers—Nathaniel Cauthen, Rayshawn Banner, Christopher Bryant, Jermal Tolliver, and the late Dorrell Brayboy—were convicted in two separate trials of murdering 61-year-old Nathaniel Jones, who was believed to have been the proprietor of the first Black-owned service station in North Carolina. Winston-Salem police said Jones was attacked soon after he arrived at his East Winston-Salem home on November 15, 2002, beaten in the head and face, and left to die of a cardiac arrhythmia. Jones was found lying face-down in his carport near his Lincoln Town Car. His hands were tied behind his back with black tape, and his mouth was taped shut. His wallet was missing.

Five days later, Paul, a high school senior who had just signed to play basketball at Wake Forest University, scored 61 points in his grandfather’s honor. The moment catapulted the teenager into the national limelight. Paul went on to play for several NBA teams, most recently the Los Angeles Clippers.

The men have long maintained their innocence, alleging that police used harsh interrogation techniques to coerce them into making false confessions. No definitive physical evidence, including fingerprints, tied them to the crime scene. New questions were raised after the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission started investigating and discovered that the key witness, Jessicah Black, recanted. The commission also ordered DNA testing on some of the physical evidence in the case, which found none of the DNA matched the five men or Black.

Black’s recantation partially led Superior Court Judge Robert Broadie to issue a 33-page ruling exonerating the four living men (Brayboy was murdered a year after his release from prison) and dismissing charges against them with prejudice last August. That meant they could not be retried and made prosecutors’ ability to appeal Broadie’s ruling more difficult.

But within hours, prosecutors sought to appeal. They also asked the Court of Appeals to temporarily prevent Cauthen and Banner, who are serving life sentences for first-degree murder, from being released. The court granted the temporary stay but denied a more permanent stay in September, saying that prosecutors had not “meritoriously” argued that any errors existed in Broadie’s ruling and had “failed to articulate a clear right to appeal.”

State prosecutors appealed to the state Supreme Court, which blocked the brothers’ release.

This latest move comes after attorneys for the men sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Jackson on October 6, saying all four men would agree to be retried in exchange for Banner and Cauthen being released on bond. The attorney general’s office declined the offer on November 24, saying it needed Forsyth County District Attorney Jim O’Neill to agree.

If prosecutors retried the case, they’d likely have difficulty securing a conviction. The defense has new evidence about the men’s intellectual disabilities at the time they were interrogated. Their statements at the time of their arrest, which were inconsistent with each other and with the physical evidence, would likely be suppressed. And without Black’s original testimony, there are no eyewitnesses who could testify they saw the five teenagers at Jones’ house the night he died.

Prosecutors also would have no clear right to appeal to the state Supreme Court if they lost at the Court of Appeals. It is a possibility that Williams alludes to in her petition: “The State recognizes, however, that if the trial court’s order is affirmed on appeal, Defendants are entitled by the terms of that order to have their convictions vacated and, in the cases of Defendants Banner and Cauthen, to unconditional release from prison.”

Christine Mumma, the attorney representing Banner and Cauthen, said state prosecutors are trying to bypass the Court of Appeals because they will likely lose there and won’t have a chance to have the top court review the case.

“This is an attempt to go around the controls built into the law and the appellate procedure and get somewhere they would never get,” she said.

Nazneen Ahmed, spokeswoman for the state attorney general’s office, declined to comment, citing pending litigation.

Mumma said this process has been brutal for Banner and Cauthen, whose mother had prepared for their return to their Winston-Salem home.

Polestar's Sales Growth and Market Strategy

STOCKHOLM, Jan 9 (Reuters) - EV maker Polestar reported a sharp rise in fourth‑quarter vehicle sales on Friday, helped by its recent strategy of focusing on Europe.

Sales Performance Overview

The company's sales rose 27% to 15,608 vehicles sold in the fourth quarter. It sold 60,119 cars throughout the year.

Challenges in the U.S. Market

Over the last year, Polestar has increasingly leaned on Europe, which now accounts for around 78% of its sales, as demand in the U.S. softened because of tariffs, the expiry of EV tax credits and intensifying competition.

Financial Support from Geely

Polestar has also scaled back its emphasis on online, direct‑to‑consumer sales in favor of a traditional dealer‑led model, expanding its sales network, although the company shut all of its 30 retail sites in China.

Future Plans and Product Updates

U.S. tariffs have hurt the carmaker's margins, forcing it to rejig supply chains and shift production to Europe.

""For retail sales volumes, 2025 has been the best year ever for Polestar, despite continued external headwinds and challenging market conditions,"" said Polestar CEO Michael Lohscheller.

High debt loads, persistent losses, and financial difficulties have also led to a weak share price, prompting the company to avoid a NASDAQ delisting by conducting a reverse stock split, mechanically lifting the price from below $1 to $18.

Polestar has relied heavily on Chinese carmaker and majority-owner Geely Holding to help fund its loss-making operations. In December, it got up to $900 million in fresh financing and loan deals made with Geely and two European banks.

Like Swedish automaker Volvo Cars that is also owned by Geely, Polestar increasingly depends on the Chinese group's platforms and supply chain to cut costs, reduce development spending and improve efficiency.

Polestar said it plans to provide key product updates and financial outlook on February 18.

That sounds like a silly thing to say, but what it means is that what the entire economy of China is set up to do — scale up high-tech manufacturing businesses — is something that only one man in America knows how to do. Only Elon has built China-like manufacturing businesses in America, and he has done it twice now — SpaceX and Tesla. When something like that happens twice, it wasn’t a coincidence.

Just to give you an example of how important this is, note that without SpaceX, China would be leaving America in the dust when it comes to space launches. But with SpaceX, it’s America leaving China in the dust:

One implication of this is that America needs to make it a lot easier to set up and scale a manufacturing business, so that our entire high-tech manufacturing sector isn’t dependent on one slightly kooky right-wing billionaire. But that’s a topic for another post.

A second implication is that if we want to know about the future of physical technology, we should listen to Elon Musk. In fact, Elon has a great track record of seeing and entering manufacturing industries that China zeroes in on later:

This is a good list, but it omits the most important items. The three industries that Elon zeroed in on very early, which made him much of his fortune — and which China has subsequently gone all-in on — are batteries, electric vehicles, and solar power. In fact, he still thinks these technologies are some of the most important in the world. In a recent interview, Elon said:

It seems like China listens to everything I say, and does it basically— or they’re just doing it independently. I don’t know, but they certainly have a massive battery pack output, they’re making a vast number of electric cars, and [a] vast amount of solar…

These are all the things I said we should do here [in America].

Elon didn’t go for batteries, EVs, and solar power because he was a climate-obsessed liberal; he correctly understood that there was a revolution underway in the technologies that humans use to produce, store, transport, and harness energy. He knew that whoever mastered that technological revolution would attain a dominant position in a bunch of different, seemingly unrelated industries.

In other words, Elon understood — and still understands — the importance of the Electric Tech Stack.

I’ve written a lot about electric technology, and why it’s the key to the future of every nation and every industry on Earth. In a post back in 2024, I argued that what we’re seeing is a wholesale shift away from combustion, toward technologies that harness electricity directly:

For a more in-depth explanation, I strongly recommend this very long post by Packy McCormick and Sam D’Amico:

Basically, electricity is more controllable than combustion; pushing electrons through a wire simply offers you much finer control over where the energy goes than blowing up hot gases to turn some gears. For a long time, electric technology was limited by low energy density, low power density, and weak magnetic field strengths — combustion gave us the oomph that electricity just couldn’t give us.

But then in the late 20th century, we invented three things that utterly changed the game. These three inventions were the lithium-ion battery, the rare-earth electric motor, and power electronics. A little over a year ago, I wrote a post about why these three inventions were such game-changers:

Basically, these three things allow electric motors to replace combustion engines (and steam boilers) over a wide variety of applications. Batteries make it possible to store and transport electrical energy very compactly and extract that energy very quickly. Rare-earth motors make it possible to use electrical energy to create very strong torques — for example, the torque that turns the axles of a Tesla. And power electronics make it possible to exert fine control over large amounts of electric power — stopping and starting it, rerouting it, repurposing it for different uses, and so on.

With these three technologies, combustion’s main advantages vanish in many domains. Whether it’s cars, drones, robots, or household appliances, electric technology now has both the power and the portability that only combustion technology used to enjoy.

Elon Musk understood this decades before people like me ever did, which is why he entered the electric car business very early. And over time, Elon’s vision for the car industry has increasingly been proven correct. Sales of internal combustion cars peaked almost a decade ago and have been declining ever since, while sales of electric cars have only grown:

This shift isn’t just being driven by Europe subsidizing EVs at the urging of climate activists, nor by China incentivizing its citizens to buy its companies’ cars. Much of the world, from Asia to Latin America, is beginning to make the switch:

As of 2025, more than a quarter of total global car sales were EVs.

This shift is likely to accelerate rather than slow down. As I wrote back in 2024, now that the basic problems of energy density, power density, and torque have been solved, EVs are simply a superior technology:

They have many fewer moving parts, meaning they’re a lot easier and cheaper to maintain. They’re a lot more energy-efficient. You can charge them at night at your house, meaning you rarely have to go to a charging station. They’re quieter, and they have faster acceleration. There are a number of popular arguments against EVs, and all of those arguments are wrong — EVs now have very long range, EV batteries last for many years, charging stations can charge your car very quickly, there are plenty of minerals to give everyone in the world an EV, batteries are easy to recycle, and so on.

EVs are going to win, and there will be a tipping point — different in each country — where the whole market just flips from combustion to electric. One reason that tipping point comes very fast is that gas stations have a network effect — when enough consumers switch to EVs, there aren’t enough gasoline-powered cars on the road to make gas stations profitable, so they start closing down, which makes EVs even more attractive.

Elon Musk understood all this long ago, and it made him the world’s richest man. China caught on a little bit later, and now dominates global auto exports as a result. Europe is starting to understand it as well.

But apart from Elon, the rest of America doesn’t yet understand it. The Trump administration has canceled subsidies for electric vehicles, and most of the U.S. auto industry (except for Tesla) is shifting away from EVs:

U.S. automakers are shifting production from electric vehicles to gas-powered vehicles and are reducing spending, laying off workers, and repurposing EV battery plants to energy storage plants due to reduced consumer interest in electric vehicles and fewer government incentives…The Trump administration rolled back financial incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles…and is modifying automobile efficiency standards…to eliminate the requirement for EV purchases…

Ford is writing down $19.5 billion, with additional EV losses of $13 billion since 2023. The EV transition has cost the company $32.5 billion. Ford plans to switch production at a new factory in Tennessee to gas-powered pickup truck models from electric models, cancel an electric commercial van model, remake the F-150 Lightning vehicle into a hybrid from a pure electric vehicle, and convert its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and AI data centers.

The main reason America is missing the EV transition is that we’ve insisted on thinking of EVs in terms of climate — as a “green” technology whose purpose is to save the environment, rather than a superior technology whose purpose is to save you time and money. Trump canceled EV subsidies because he associates them with the environmental movement and the political left.

American consumers are avoiding EVs because of this, and also because of a lack of charging stations. The Biden administration promised to build a vast network of EV charging stations, but managed to build almost zero, largely because the initiative was larded up with unrelated contracting requirements. So many Americans still think they won’t be able to charge their EV on a long trip, and are sticking with gas cars as a result.

The ramifications of this failure will go far beyond the auto market. The reason is that the components that go into making EVs — the batteries, the motor, and the electronics — are increasingly the same components that go into making a vast array of other high-tech products. I have a video interview with Sam D’Amico where he explains this, and Sam’s long post with Packy McCormick also explains it in detail. But for a shorter explanation, let me recommend this recent post by Ryan McEntush of a16z:

Ryan explains that when the components that go into electronics are the same as the components that go into cars, drones, robots and tons of other stuff. This allows Chinese manufacturers like BYD and Xiaomi to leverage truly awesome economies of scale:

Once [the iPhone] existed, everything else started to look the same. Your laptop, smart TV, thermostat, doorbell camera, refrigerator, industrial robot, drone: all of them follow the same basic recipe. Even an electric vehicle, once you peel back the sheet metal, relies on the same ingredients — batteries, sensors, motors, compute, and software, just in a different skin. We no longer live among truly distinct technological paradigms, but within a world of variations on one single idea: the smartphone, endlessly turned inside and out and scaled across every domain. Everything is a smartphone…

Consumer electronics is about scale…Unlike legacy internal-combustion vehicles, electric vehicles draw heavily on components and device primitives shared across many other industries…Much of today’s most important technology rests, almost inadvertently, on the foundations built by [the consumer electronics] ecosystem…An electric vehicle is a smartphone with wheels. A drone is a smartphone with propellers. A robot is a smartphone that moves…

BYD, the global leader in batteries, builds cars, buses, ships, and trains. DJI makes drones, but also cameras, radios, and robotics hardware. Even Dreame, a Chinese vacuum company, just debuted an electric supercar. These firms are not “diversifying” in the traditional sense. Rather, they are…repeatedly assembling the same electro-industrial stack — batteries, power electronics, motors, compute, and sensors — into new permutations.

This means that China’s Everything Makers can make not just cars and electronics more cheaply than America can, but almost everything else as well — because almost everything is being eaten by the Electric Tech Stack. Even the software industry is being eaten by the Electric Tech Stack — AI is eating software, and AI requires huge amounts of electric power and battery stabilization in order to run its data centers.

Currently, China generates much more electricity than the U.S. does — partly because it’s willing to build out solar power, where in the U.S. solar is often blocked by local NIMBYs, “environmental” permitting laws, and a hostile Trump administration. But China also builds most of the world’s batteries, meaning that American AI is going to be dependent on Chinese batteries as well.

On top of all that, America desperately needs the Electric Tech Stack for its national defense. I pointed this out in a post back in September, and Ryan talks about it a lot as well. Drones are taking over the modern battlefield, and drones require batteries and rare-earth electric motors — the same components that go into the EVs that America is now refusing to build.

Thus, America’s weakness in EVs, batteries, and rare earths threatens to become a weakness in everything — a weakness in AI, a weakness in drones, a weakness in robots, and so on. Because we collectively decided that EVs are hippie-dippy climate bullshit, we ignored the key physical technologies that increasingly underlie all of manufacturing, including defense manufacturing.

Throughout America’s history, we have been at or near the forefront of every single major technological revolution. We were leaders in railroads, mechanized agriculture, industrial chemistry, electricity, mass production, internal combustion/automobiles, aviation, plastics/polymers, nuclear, space, telecommunications/TV, genetics, semiconductors, computing, the internet, mobile, and AI. This technological leadership enabled us to remain the world’s leading nation for over a century.

But now we are missing the big one. We are missing the Electric Tech Stack. We treated it as a climate issue instead of an issue of raw national power and industrial might, and we allowed it to become a political football. As a result, China is mastering this crucial technological revolution, and America is forfeiting it. Our entire existence as a leading nation is under threat from this remarkable failure of vision and leadership.

We should have listened to Elon Musk about the importance of the Electric Tech Stack. We should still listen to him now.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KwNT!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7e42627c-73f9-444e-a7f5-bd6e25f1ef68_980x653.jpeg",N,,2026-01-09 11:04:04.065850

Supporting New Nuclear Energy With Advanced Technology

As the demand for reliable, scalable, and clean energy continues to rise, advanced nuclear technology has the potential to become a key part of the solution. The latest generation of advanced nuclear reactors are designed to be safer — delivering reliable baseload power that can be efficiently added to existing grids, which makes them ideal for supporting America’s evolving power needs. Our agreements with Oklo and TerraPower will help advance this next generation of energy technology.

These agreements also mean that Oklo and TerraPower have greater business certainty, can raise capital to move forward with these projects, and ultimately add more energy capacity to the grid. Over time, this will be an important tool in ensuring that grids maintain reliability for all customers and ensure stable wholesale electricity prices.

TerraPower: Investing in Advanced Nuclear Technology

Our agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium® units capable of generating up to 690 MW of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The agreement also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 GW and targeted for delivery by 2035. At a total of eight potential units, with 2.8 GW of baseload energy generation capacity and an additional 1.2 GW of built-in storage, this agreement is Meta’s largest support of advanced nuclear technologies to date.

“To successfully address growing energy demand, we must deploy gigawatts of advanced nuclear energy in the 2030s. This agreement with Meta is designed to support the rapid deployment of our Natrium technology that provides the reliable, flexible, and carbon-free power our country needs,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “With our first Natrium plant under development, we have completed our design, established our supply chain, and cleared key regulatory milestones. These successes mean our TerraPower team is well positioned to deliver on this historic multi-unit delivery agreement.”

Oklo: Adding New Nuclear Energy in Ohio

Our partnership with Oklo helps advance the development of entirely new nuclear energy in Pike County, Ohio. This advanced nuclear technology campus — which may come online as early as 2030 — is poised to add up to 1.2 GW of clean baseload power directly into the PJM market and support our operations in the region.

This agreement lays the foundation for constructing multiple Oklo Aurora Powerhouse reactors, which is expected to create thousands of construction and long-term operations jobs and generate new local and state tax revenue through major investments in energy infrastructure. Oklo Aurora powerhouses are based on proven fast-reactor designs with inherently safe systems capable of using both fresh and repurposed fuel.

“Meta’s funding commitment in support of early procurement and development activity is a major step in moving advanced nuclear forward,” said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO. “Two years ago, Oklo shared its vision to build a new generation of advanced nuclear powerhouses in Ohio. Today, that vision is becoming a reality through the support of a multi-year effort with Meta; to deliver clean energy and create long-term, high-quality jobs in Ohio.”

Vistra: Extending and Expanding Operational Nuclear Energy

Many American nuclear power plants need long-term support and require ongoing investment to maintain best-in-class safety and reliability in operations. For example, our first nuclear energy agreement helped extend the life of a nuclear energy plant in Clinton, Illinois for 20 more years.

Through additional 20-year nuclear energy agreements, we will purchase more than 2.1 GW of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio (Perry and Davis-Besse), in addition to the energy from expansions (uprates) at these two Ohio plants and a third Vistra nuclear plant in Pennsylvania (Beaver Valley). All three plants are located in and will continue to deliver power into the PJM grid region, and these expansions will be the largest nuclear uprates supported by a corporate customer in the US.

Meta’s commitments ensure that these facilities can continue providing reliable power to the regional electricity grid. The new additional uprate capacity at each of them, totaling 433 MW, is expected to come online in the early 2030s — supporting the growing needs in the PJM grid region in the future. This means consumers will benefit from a larger supply of reliable, always-ready power through Meta-supported uprates to the Vistra facilities.

“This is an exciting collaboration for us at Vistra. We are focused on meeting customer needs, and providing reliable, carbon-free nuclear power is something we’re proud to offer Meta,” said Jim Burke, president and CEO of Vistra. “This agreement is beneficial in many ways — it powers American innovation and AI technology, while allowing us to extend the operational life of these plants, boost the capacity of the nuclear reactors to support the grid, protect existing jobs while creating new ones, and continue investing in the communities where our plants are located. Partnerships like ours are key in moving America forward in both AI and energy leadership.”

The way to get electricity prices down is to produce more electricity.” The Trump appointee has emphasized that building new infrastructure to support data centers and manufacturing will ultimately lower average electricity prices.
And it's not data centers,” which noted that the recent trend in the national conversation of making data centers the scapegoat for rising electricity prices simply doesn’t hold up when you examine the facts.
Rather than increasing electricity prices, new data center projects present an opportunity to lower prices — if handled the right way.
Meta’s investment also provides Entergy with more resources to strengthen the grid against storms at a lower cost to current customers.","At Power for Tomorrow, we track how U.S. utilities adapt to challenges like artificial intelligence and data centers — sharing what works to keep power reliable and affordable. That’s why we’re closely watching the emerging data center hub in the Gulf South, including Louisiana, where Meta is building what may become the world’s largest AI facility in Richland Parish.

Louisiana securing the historic Meta project wasn’t luck — it was leadership. State officials saw the opportunity and worked across party lines to solve a tough problem: how to power massive data centers without raising rates or hurting reliability. Louisiana figured it out — and proved that smart growth can benefit everyone.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said, “When people say, ‘AI is going to drive up my price of electricity,’ it’s actually the opposite. The way to get electricity prices down is to produce more electricity.”

The Trump appointee has emphasized that building new infrastructure to support data centers and manufacturing will ultimately lower average electricity prices. In fact, one of the nation’s leading science labs — the same one that Congress selected last year to prepare a report on data center energy usage — recently identified that, in many instances, large customers like data centers can help stabilize or even lower electric bills for homes and small businesses.

In October, The Washington Post published an article titled “There's a reason electricity prices are rising. And it's not data centers,” which noted that the recent trend in the national conversation of making data centers the scapegoat for rising electricity prices simply doesn’t hold up when you examine the facts. The article pointed out that “the biggest factors behind rising rates were the cost of poles, wires and other electrical equipment — as well as the cost of safeguarding that infrastructure against future disasters.”

The article goes on to explain that electricity markets don’t follow the typical economic model where more demand tends to result in higher prices — on the contrary, electrical utilities operate on an economy of scale, where more customers mean more ways to spread out the impact of fixed system costs, like physical infrastructure. Rather than increasing electricity prices, new data center projects present an opportunity to lower prices — if handled the right way.

The key is to ensure that these giant customers are paying their way and that the cost of their growth isn’t being passed on to other customers’ bills. That’s where Louisiana is getting it right: The utility powering Meta’s Richland Parish data center, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Public Service Commission built safeguards into Meta’s agreement so other customers don’t foot the bill. In fact, many grid upgrades tied to the project will benefit all customers — at no extra cost.

For example, to meet the data center’s needs without straining the state’s grid, Meta is funding three new Entergy power plants. These modern, more fuel-efficient facilities will serve all Entergy customers and save them money on bills by producing more power at lower cost for decades.

Meta’s investment also provides Entergy with more resources to strengthen the grid against storms at a lower cost to current customers. That means fewer outages and real bill savings, including reducing what other customers pay for grid upgrades and future storm repairs by 10%. All told, Meta’s participation in the Entergy Louisiana grid is projected to save other customers upward of $650 million over their 15-year agreement.

Louisiana is proving that data centers don’t have to mean higher power bills for residents. On the contrary, strategic infrastructure investments tied to industrial growth can be used to improve grid reliability, boost economic growth and lower costs for everyone.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/7f/f7f43957-a6f2-5120-8da2-19d0d48e2a6f/685ef5ffe1e0c.image.jpg?crop=1467%2C770%2C0%2C321&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-09 08:00:40.056772

Cuts to EPA affect Indiana In May President Donald Trump announced his intention to cut the EPA budget by 55%.","The EPA under President Donald Trump has rolled back several rules initially designed to protect the environment and people's health.

While these changes will impact the country as a whole, the effect here in Indiana could be particularly acute, environmentalists say.

The changes apply to a number of industries, including automotive, power plants and coal and gas.

The Trump administration has steered the federal agency tasked with protecting human health and the environment in an unusual direction over the last 12 months: The Environmental Protection Agency has deregulated and delayed swaths of industrial rules designed to protect the environment and human health, reversed course on climate policy and axed much of its own research arm.

The effect on Indiana will be acute, environmental advocates say. Environmental advocates say they are concerned many of the EPA’s rollbacks will jeopardize the health of Hoosiers who live in a state that already has a precarious relationship with environmental health. Many of the state's largest polluters such as coal plants, chemical factories and steel mills have received exemptions from the federal government this year.

In a 2025 U.S. News report, Indiana ranked last in the ""natural environment"" category, which ranks states based on air and water quality as well as pollution threats. The report cited the state’s nearly 3,000 pounds of industrial toxins per square mile — the national average is closer to 900.

The state also has an above average number of polluted waterways and more coal ash ponds — small, toxic water bodies near coal plants where poisonous refuse is discarded — than any other state.

On March 12, 2025, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced the rollback of 31 different policies, calling regulations like those designed to regulate hazardous air pollutants “suffocating.”

""Today, the green new scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success,” Zeldin said in a press video. “President Trump has delivered on his promise to unleash energy dominance and lower the cost of living. We at EPA will do our part to power the great American comeback.”

Zeldin’s positioning the EPA to lower the cost of fossil fuel production and promote industry is a new look for the agency that has historically been tasked with protecting environmental health. And as the federal agency rolls back and deregulates one policy at a time, scientists say it's difficult to get the complete picture of the impact on human and environmental health outcomes, making it trickier to fight back.

“The strategy is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts kind of approach,” said Gabriel Filippelli, a biochemist and the executive director of the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute.

By sawing off small policies here and big policies there, he said, the EPA is minimizing the appearance of the environmental regulation overhaul, but the intent is “actually a very, very concerted plan to eliminate all of them.”

Fighting such changes in court also becomes more difficult, he said.

“You can’t just have one lawsuit, you are actually having to fight against 20 different policy changes at the same time,” Filippelli said. “It just overwhelms the ability of the normal checks and balances.”

The EPA has the ability to repeal and amend its own regulations. It's this process that local environmental advocates are worried about.

Here are some of the EPA's changes from the last year that could have the greatest impact on Indiana.

Unraveling climate change policies

In late July, Zeldin and U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced perhaps the most consequential of EPA rollbacks.

Speaking at an Indianapolis auto dealership alongside Gov. Mike Braun and Indiana Energy Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski, Zeldin said he intended to repeal air pollution guidance. This so-called ""endangerment finding"" has set the stage for greenhouse gas standards and regulations since 2009.

Zeldin said that if the finding successfully makes it through the agency's repeal process and is revoked, it would “be the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

After a years-long legal battle ending at the Supreme Court, the endangerment finding gave the EPA the authority to manage six greenhouse gases as threats to human health. The finding led to several regulations on vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas industry — policies Zeldin said he would also like to undo.

Repealing this could exacerbate the negative effects of climate change, endanger public health and potentially slow the economy, local environmental advocates told IndyStar in July.

Rep. Sue Errington, D-Muncie, the ranking minority member of the House Environmental Affair Committee, said that summers in Indiana are already “hotter, longer and more dangerous than they were a decade ago."" Eliminating greenhouse gas standards, she added, will accelerate climate change and harm public health.

The EPA has also proposed eliminating the ""burdensome"" Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, enacted in 2008. In a Sept. 12 news release, the agency said that clawing back the program would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs.

The program requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers across the United States to record and submit their greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA each year. The EPA proposed to remove all of these requirements.

Janet McCabe, a former EPA deputy under President Joe Biden and current visiting professor at Indiana University, recognized it might not seem like eliminating a recording program would increase emissions. But, McCabe said, it actually does.

""Reporting programs are often the first step to people recognizing what they emit, how much they emit, and realizing that there are ways that they can emit less,"" she said. ""It's very well in ingrained into how people do business, and it's hugely helpful to the country understanding and the industries themselves understanding and the public understanding where we are in terms of emissions.""

Delays, delays, delays

The EPA under Biden worked to reduce pollution across the United States with a series of regulations, but over the past year Trump's EPA has given companies more time to comply with those policies.

In some of these cases, McCabe said, it seems like the EPA is giving companies extensions to meet pollution standards because they plan to eventually rescind the Biden-era rules.

""He's telling industry, 'You don't need to comply with this because we're going to change it anyway,'"" she said.

In Gary, Indiana, this delay means that residents living near the steel industry will continue to deal with dirty air.

In August the EPA issued interim final rules to delay complying with the previous administration’s pollution standards until 2027. Interim rules are typically used to address natural disasters or public health emergencies, not to provide industry with more time to comply.

The EPA issued a report saying the timeline the Biden Administration had set was too short and would cost too much for the industry.

The delay could have long-term health impacts, especially for young children who live near these polluters, Annie Fox, a law clerk with the Clean Air Council, told IndyStar in September. Clean Air Council is one of many environmental organizations suing the EPA over the interim rules.

The Biden EPA also updated a series of hazardous air pollution rules for multiple manufacturing sectors, giving facilities a deadline to meet compliance. In 2025, Trump issued a series of executive orders, giving these facilities ""regulatory relief"" by extending the deadlines in an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on “foreign control over materials critical to national resilience.” The targeted industries include energy, national defense, agriculture and health care.

Two Indiana facilities received extensions: the chemical manufacturing plant SABIC Innovative Plastics in Mount Vernon and Cook Medical's medical equipment sterilization facility in Ellettsville. EPA previously listed both plants as high-risk to human health after considering the amount of chemicals released on site.

Cuts to EPA affect Indiana

In May President Donald Trump announced his intention to cut the EPA budget by 55%. Later that month Zeldin announced further agency budget reductions, totaling $300 million.

Zeldin said in a written statement in July that the cuts would save the U.S. $748.8 million and help the EPA become “responsible stewards of [American’s] hard-earned tax dollars.”

One $130 million program on the chopping block called Solar for All aimed to help nearly 7,000 low-income Hoosiers lower electric bills and reduce their homes’ reliance on fossil fuels for energy.

Indiana’s program director for Solar United Neighbor Zach Schalk called the cut a “huge gut punch” in an August IndyStar interview.

In a written statement Zeldin said spending money on programs such as Solar for All were like “throwing gold bars off the Titanic” and the EPA under him and Trump would not condone “frivolous spending in the name of ‘climate equity.’”

Hoosiers adapt to changing priorities

In November, the EPA announced plans to redefine ""Waters of the United States"", which could leave Indiana's dwindling wetland habitats with even fewer protections. The EPA is also greenlighting pesticides that contain chemicals environmental advocates worry contain PFAS, commonly known as ""forever chemicals."" In addition, the agency is trying to loosen regulations that control heavy metal emissions, like mercury, from some coal and oil-fired electric plants, and has begun to remove the term climate change from certain webpages.

Filippelli said he's concerned about the future of health and the environment in Indiana and the country oversall.

""We already have a lot of environmental burdens,"" Filippelli said, referencing the state's poor air quality and the high number of Superfund sites across the state. ""All of that just leads us to be particularly vulnerable when they start relaxing some of these protections that have been very hard fought.""

Despite the federal government's disinvestment in renewable energy and environmental protections this past year, Filippelli said he still hears from communities across Indiana who have an appetite for a clean, healthier future; many Hoosiers still want an electric vehicle or solar on their property. Funding is often the issue.

Filippelli said people are finding clever ways to navigate state level funding and local philanthropies will still finance some projects, but much of the Biden-era federal funding for such initiatives is gone.

""Certainly these transitions that people were hoping to see happen really quickly are much slower now, there's no greenwashing that. We're stepping backwards,"" Filippelli said. ""But community appetite is still there and we are committed to serving that appetite with good solutions.""

Row crop farmers in the Midwest and Great Plains have a better idea of how much money they can expect from one-time federal aid payments announced last month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently released per-acre rates for 20 crops included in the $11 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance Program. The dollars aim to help farmers impacted by tariffs, high production costs and low crop prices until stronger farm safety nets go into effect in October.

“President Trump committed to increase certainty in the farm economy, and farmers can count on these payment rate calculations when going to the bank as they plan for the spring planting season,” Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins stated. “Farmers who qualify for the FBA Program can expect payments in their bank accounts by February 28.”

Details have not been released for an additional $1 billion allocated for specialty crops and sugar.

The USDA based its “bridge” payment rates on the number of acres planted in 2025, along with estimated production costs and losses.

An analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation projected payments at the state level will be highest in Texas at $1.1 billion, followed by Iowa, Kansas and Illinois. Corn, soybeans and wheat are expected to account for over three-quarters of the program dollars.

DeDe Jones, a risk management economist for the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service in the Amarillo District, said the grain and cotton farmers she works with are struggling. Many are entering the 2026 growing season with high interest rates, high input costs, low crop prices and significant amounts of debt.

“This bridge of assistance will definitely provide some relief, both to the farmer and then also to the lender, and some reassurance that they will be able to pay off some of that carryover debt and continue to farm for another year,” Jones said. “It is nowhere near enough to cover all their losses that they've dealt with in the last couple of years, but anything helps.”

Over half of the farmers surveyed by the Purdue/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer this fall said they would use potential government aid to pay down debt.

Nicholas Paulson, professor of agricultural economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program is designed to distribute financial aid quickly. The tradeoff is that payment rates, based on national averages, may not reflect the financial realities for individual farms.

“There will be farms where the bridge payments are maybe more than sufficient to cover the financial stress that they're experiencing on their own farm. There will be farms where the bridge payment is insufficient to cover it,” Paulson said. “It will be helpful, but it won't completely cover the losses that they're experiencing in the 2025 crop year.”

For example, he said soybean yields in southern Illinois were much lower last year than in the central and northern parts of the state.

Paulson and his colleagues estimate the average returns for southern Illinois soybean farmers will remain in the red, even with the bridge payment, commodity programs and crop insurance. But soybean farmers in central and northern Illinois are more likely to break even or come out ahead.

Factors contributing to a bleak farm economy

Production costs were more than 50% higher in October 2025 compared to 2011, while the prices farmers received were roughly 21% higher, Investigate Midwest reports. That’s created one of the widest gaps in a decade between what farmers are paying and what they earn.

Over the past five years, fertilizer, labor and interest expenses have risen 37%, 47% and 73%, respectively.

High corn and soybean prices in 2021 and 2022 – in part due to China rebuilding its swine herd, global market disruptions from the Ukraine-Russia war and lower yields in the U.S., Brazil and Argentina – helped offset higher production costs. But then prices fell as supply and demand shifted again.

“We have had some really, really good growing seasons, especially with the grain crops,” Jones said. “When you have these bumper yields … then we're going to need not just average demand, but better than average demand to offset that supply and keep those prices high, and we just don't have that.”

Trade disruptions in 2025 decreased demand and contributed to an oversupply of some U.S. commodities, said Chad Hart, an agriculture economics professor at Iowa State University. Cotton, rice and soybeans experienced more significant market impacts due to retaliatory tariffs compared to corn and wheat, he said.

“Even though there's been a lot of discussion of deals with China, and we have seen some sales coming in … soybean trade is still lagging behind where it usually is,” Hart said.

Reactions from national soy, corn associations

After the USDA released its payment rates, the American Soybean Association said in a news release that it “appreciates the administration’s focus on the economic downturn in the U.S. agricultural industry” but the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program “falls short.” The association pointed to damage caused by the trade war with China.

“Due to significant trade losses this year, the payment rate for soybeans will likely not be enough for soybean farmers to keep their operations financially solvent as we move into the next planting season,” the group’s president Scott Metzger said in the release.

Metzger urged the administration to strengthen domestic markets for soybeans, in part by incentivizing soy-based biofuels through the 2026-2027 Renewable Volume Obligations and finalizing rules for the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

The National Corn Growers Association also called for more long-term solutions.

“Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,” President Jed Bower said in a news release. “We urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.”

Ad hoc assistance

The Farmer Bridge Assistance Program comes on the heels of other economic aid.

In December 2024, Congress passed legislation allocating $20 billion for producers impacted by natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 and $10 billion to offset economic losses from low crop prices and high production costs.

The Farmer Bridge Assistance Program and its payment rates largely mirror the last economic aid program.

Paulson described the ad hoc assistance programs as Band-Aids to the challenges row crop producers are facing.

“Prices for most row crops have not significantly improved from what farmers are currently dealing with for their 2025 crop, and we don’t see production costs declining to the extent needed to get farmers back into the black,” Paulson said.

Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights, aims to provide relief to Illinoisans facing rising energy costs.

“Families shouldn’t have to choose between paying their utility bill or putting food on the table,” Grasse said. “I’m pleased we got this measure to the governor’s desk quickly, so families can start seeing dollars back on their bill as early as this month.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket due to increased power demand and Washington’s massive tax bill—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices, both immediately and in the long-term, by:

Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents and improves equity by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois.

“This legislation further cements Illinois’ status as a national leader in clean energy initiatives,” Grasse said. “When we can take steps to cut costs for consumers, boost our state’s manufacturing industry and extend a huge favor for our planet, it’s a win-win-win for all involved.”

But under the proposed extension, ​“the plants will continue to burn coal, thus creating additional air pollution,” and contamination from coal ash.
The ruling led to an April 2021 deadline to start closing unlined coal ash ponds.
Schahfer plant in Indiana is violating the coal ash rules by failing to file the required groundwater monitoring reports and other documents for a retired coal ash pond, which she and Earthjustice attorneys discovered in reviewing maps and images of the site.
Illinois is one of the states with the highest number of coal ash sites, according to data filed by power companies.","The Environmental Protection Agency plans to let 11 coal plants dump toxic coal ash into unlined pits until 2031 — a full decade later than allowed under current federal rules.

The move tosses a lifeline to the polluting power plants. If the facilities were barred from dumping ash into unlined pits, they would be forced to close, since they can’t operate if they don’t have a place to dispose of the ash, and the companies say finding alternative locations for disposal would be impossible.

These 11 plants have already circumvented the 2021 deadline to close such pits, through a 2020 extension offer from the first Trump administration. By filing applications for that extension through 2028, the plants were allowed to keep running even though the EPA has yet to rule on the applications.

On January 6, the EPA held a virtual public hearing on its proposal to give the plants an additional three years to stop dumping coal ash in unlined pits. Attorneys, advocates, and people who live near the plants called the plan illegal, a threat to public health, and another tactic by the Trump administration to prolong the lives of polluting coal plants.

In recent months, the Department of Energy has ordered coal plants scheduled for retirement to continue operating, saying their electricity is needed — an argument the EPA echoed in its proposal. Some state regulators, grid operators, and energy experts have pushed back on the notion that it is necessary to force these power plants to stay online. At the hearing, critics of the EPA’s proposed extension said reliability concerns are outside the agency’s coal ash mandate to protect human health and the environment.

“If the proposal is not finalized, the plants would have to close their [coal ash] impoundments and cease burning coal by 2028,” said Lisa Evans, a senior attorney for the environmental law firm Earthjustice. But under the proposed extension, ​“the plants will continue to burn coal, thus creating additional air pollution,” and contamination from coal ash.

Coal ash dumped in unlined pits can leach into groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water wells with carcinogens and other dangerous elements. In 2018, the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 2015 federal regulation on Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) must be strengthened to better deal with such sites. The ruling led to an April 2021 deadline to start closing unlined coal ash ponds.

Through a 2020 extension offer from the first Trump administration, the EPA invited power companies to apply for the extension through 2028 if they had no other way to deal with the ash and were otherwise in compliance with the rules for disposal.

The EPA made a final decision in only one case, denying an extension to the troubled James M. Gavin plant in Ohio in 2022. But any company that filed an application has been able to keep its plant running while the EPA considers the case, something critics say is an obvious loophole.

The latest proposal would let three such plants in Illinois, two in Louisiana, two in Texas, and one each in Indiana, Ohio, Utah, and Wyoming operate until 2031.

“That [2021] deadline was established to stop ongoing contamination and protect communities,” said Cate Caldwell, senior policy manager of the Illinois Environmental Council, which represents 130 groups in the state. ​“By expanding a loophole created during the first Trump administration, EPA would allow coal plants to delay closure for at least three more years and potentially much longer.”

An illegal proposal?

The EPA’s previous and proposed regulations say that an extension for unlined pits can be granted only if the site is in compliance with the federal coal ash rules, including those involving cleaning up groundwater contamination.

At the hearing, experts argued that the 11 plants are not in compliance. Groundwater monitoring data that the companies are required to provide shows that all the sites eligible for the extension have elevated levels of contaminants linked to coal ash.

“EPA never reviewed these demonstrations,” Evans said. ​“If they did, I am confident that they would likely find that each of the plants are ineligible for an extension.”

In the virtual hearing, Indra Frank, coal ash adviser to the citizens group Hoosier Environmental Council, told the EPA that the R.M. Schahfer plant in Indiana is violating the coal ash rules by failing to file the required groundwater monitoring reports and other documents for a retired coal ash pond, which she and Earthjustice attorneys discovered in reviewing maps and images of the site.

“That impoundment is subject to the federal CCR rule, but it has not met any of the requirements of the rule. To qualify for the extension offered in 2020, utilities were required to be in full compliance,” Frank said at the hearing. ​“Since Schahfer was not in compliance, Schahfer did not qualify for the extension in 2020 and should not receive the additional proposed extension.”

Schahfer’s two coal-fired units were scheduled to close in December, but the Department of Energy ordered the plant to keep running — though one unit has actually been offline since July in need of repairs. In an August email to the EPA, an official with the plant’s parent company said the coal ash extension would be necessary to justify spending money to get the plant back online.

Serious concerns

Locals are dismayed that Schahfer may continue to run and say that no more coal ash should be placed in its unlined pond. Arsenic, molybdenum, cobalt, and radium have been found in groundwater near the pond, and the coal ash is held back by a dam with a high hazard rating, meaning its failure would be likely to cause death.

“We just see this proposed rule as a downright unlawful, reckless attempt by the Trump EPA to let polluters keep polluting,” said Ashley Williams, executive director of the advocacy organization Just Transition Northwest Indiana. She called the coal ash at the Schahfer site a ​“largely silent crisis that we’ve had to continue to sound the alarms on.”

Colette Morrow, a professor at an Indiana public university, told the EPA during the hearing that she suffers from an autoimmune disease and fears for her health if the Schahfer plant is allowed to keep running.

“This is unconscionable that the U.S government would put its own people at risk to such a high degree, only in order to enhance profits of these utility providers,” Morrow said.

Retired chemistry teacher Mary Ellen DeClue said she was shocked to learn about the contaminants that could be leaching into Illinoisans’ drinking water — since many rural residents tap private wells.

“This is not acceptable,” she said, imploring the EPA not to ​“rubber-stamp” the extension.

The three Illinois plants seeking the extension — Kincaid, Newton, and Baldwin — are owned by Texas-based Vistra Corp. The plants have already benefited from leniency under the Trump administration: Last year the company accepted the administration’s offer of an extension on complying with federal air pollutant limits.

Illinois is one of the states with the highest number of coal ash sites, according to data filed by power companies. Illinois coal plants will have to shut down by 2030 under state law, but each extra year of operation places residents at risk, local advocates say.

“Many of these communities rely on groundwater for drinking water and lack the resources to address widespread contamination on their own,” Caldwell of the Illinois Environmental Council told the EPA. ​“The agency should not be asking coal companies how long they would like to continue dumping toxic waste. It should be enforcing closure requirements that are already long overdue.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Virginia-coal-ash-pond_GettyImages-506680852.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=993a4ce93f367505c941eb8688d4995b,N,,2026-01-09 05:59:39.213338

Complicating matters further is that the required repairs may not even be feasible to complete within the 90-day window covered by the DOE orders.
“Coal plants — and in particular the plants DOE has targeted — are these clunky old jalopies that, out of nowhere, just fail,” said Michael Lenoff, a senior attorney at nonprofit law firm Earthjustice, one of several environmental groups challenging the must-run orders.
Fixing up coal plants to comply with the DOE mandates could also put utilities in a legal bind.
Some plan to convert the facilities to run on fossil gas, as is the case with the Schahfer plant and the coal plant in Washington state.","The Trump administration’s campaign to force aging coal plants to keep running has entered a new phase: ordering broken-down units to come back online. Repairing those polluting plants could take months and cost tens of millions of dollars — all just to comply with legally questionable stay-open mandates that last only 90 days at a time.

In December, the Department of Energy ordered four coal plants — two in Indiana and one each in Colorado and Washington state — that were set to retire by year’s end to continue generating power for 90 days. Two of them have units that have been out of commission because of mechanical failure: Colorado’s Craig Generating Station Unit 1 has been down for three weeks and Indiana’s R.M. Schahfer Unit 18 has sat idle since July.

This means the utilities that own those plants must now race to bring them into working order, even though they’ve long ago deemed the facilities uneconomical to operate. Customers already grappling with skyrocketing electricity rates are likely to shoulder the costs of fixing and running the equipment. Complicating matters further is that the required repairs may not even be feasible to complete within the 90-day window covered by the DOE orders.

“Coal plants — and in particular the plants DOE has targeted — are these clunky old jalopies that, out of nowhere, just fail,” said Michael Lenoff, a senior attorney at nonprofit law firm Earthjustice, one of several environmental groups challenging the must-run orders. ​“DOE forcing these things to be available, and in some instances to run, actually creates reliability risk to the grid.”

The Trump administration claims that keeping the plants online is the only way to prevent blackouts in the near future. Last month’s must-run orders, as well as earlier ones forcing a Michigan coal plant and an oil- and gas-fired plant in Pennsylvania to stay open, were issued under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, which lets the DOE compel power plants to operate to forestall immediate energy emergencies.

Critics say the Trump administration has weaponized this authority to prop up the U.S. coal industry, which provided about half the country’s generation capacity in 2001 but now supplies about 15%. None of the plants that the DOE has forced to stay open is needed for near-term reliability, according to the utilities, state regulators, and regional authorities responsible for maintaining a functioning grid. And despite its claims of an energy crisis, the federal government is throwing up roadblocks to wind, solar, and battery projects that are a fast and cheap way to add electrons to the grid.

The costs of the Trump administration’s coal interventions are mounting. The Sierra Club estimates that the price tag of keeping those six power plants running under the DOE’s orders has added up to more than $158 million as of this week.

And utilities that have to repair units before starting to generate power again will face a new set of costs.

In Indiana, Schahfer’s Unit 18 has been offline since July because of a damaged turbine. Vincent Parisi, president of Northern Indiana Power Service Co., the utility that owns and operates the plant, told Indiana state regulators in December, ​“It can take six months or longer for us to ultimately be able to get that unit back to where it would need to be to operate for an extended period of time.” Parisi did not provide cost estimates for those repairs or for extending operations at the Schahfer plant, and a NIPSCO spokesperson declined to provide an estimate to Canary Media.

In Colorado, Craig Unit 1 has been offline since Dec. 19 because of mechanical failure, according to Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the electric cooperative that operates and holds a partial ownership stake in the plant. ​“As a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,” Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in a December press release. ​“There is not a clear path for doing so, but we will continue to evaluate our options.”

Tri-State spokesperson Mark Stutz said the co-op and its partners don’t have firm cost estimates for repairs or for compliance with the order, ​“which will likely require additional investments in operations, maintenance, and potentially fuel supply.”

Consultancy Grid Strategies has estimated that keeping Craig 1 running for 90 days would cost at least $20 million, and that running it for a year could add up to $85 million to $150 million. Those costs do not include repairs of the equipment that failed and caused it to go offline.

Fixing up coal plants to comply with the DOE mandates could also put utilities in a legal bind. State attorneys general and environmental groups are already challenging many of the agency’s Section 202(c) orders, saying those orders are based on false premises and violate the law’s strictures for the agency to use its authority only to prevent immediate grid emergencies.

These arguments may soon see their day in federal court. In December, a coalition of environmental groups, including Earthjustice, filed a legal brief with the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging the DOE’s use of Section 202(c) authority to force the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to keep running. The brief asks the court to ​“put an end to the Department’s continued abuse of its authority, which has imposed millions of dollars in unnecessary costs and pollution on residents of Michigan and the Midwest.”

Nor does the DOE have authority to order utilities to undertake repairs or alterations to power plants under Section 202(c), Earthjustice, Sierra Club, and Indiana-based environmental and consumer advocates argued in a December letter to NIPSCO. The groups warned the utility that they plan to legally challenge any repair costs it tries to pass on to customers.

“The authority does not exist within Section 202(c) for DOE to force upgrades or major investments in energy-generating facilities. The authority only extends to operational choices,” said Greg Wannier, senior attorney for the Sierra Club. ​“I do think that at some point, regulated utilities do bear some responsibility for not taking illegal actions to comply with illegal orders.”

NIPSCO spokesperson Joshauna Nash told Canary Media that compliance with the DOE’s order is ​“mandatory.” The utility is ​“carefully reviewing the details of this order to assess its impact on our employees, customers, and company to ensure compliance,” Nash said. ​“While this development alters the timeline for decommissioning this station, our long-term plan to transition to a more sustainable energy future remains unchanged.”

The Trump administration seems set to continue using Section 202(c) authority. The DOE has issued three consecutive 90-day must-run orders for both the J.H. Campbell plant and the Eddystone plant in Pennsylvania. It has also issued a report that appears to lay the groundwork for justifying federal action to prevent any fossil-fueled plant from closing, citing data that critics say has been cherry-picked and misrepresented to paint a false picture of a power grid on the verge of collapse.

If the DOE continues to prevent fossil-fuel plants from closing, the costs could reach into the billions of dollars. Grid Strategies has estimated that forcing the continued operations of the nearly 35 gigawatts’ worth of large fossil-fueled power plants scheduled to retire between now and the end of 2028 could add up to $4.8 billion over that period.

Financial concerns aside, forcing utilities to react to successive 90-day emergency orders amounts to ​“sticking a wrench in the spokes of how utilities and their state regulators have planned their systems,” said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity at think tank Energy Innovation.

The utilities under DOE must-run orders have developed plans to retire workers at those plants or move them to other jobs, he said. They’ve ended long-term coal-delivery contracts and procured alternative resources to make up for the lost power from the shuttering units. Some plan to convert the facilities to run on fossil gas, as is the case with the Schahfer plant and the coal plant in Washington state. Those projects will likely be delayed if the coal units must keep running, he said.

Earthjustice’s Lenoff agreed that the DOE’s intrusion into those plans is ​“creating uncertainty that harms investment, raises costs, and disrupts orderly planning by experts and authorities who know what they’re doing. The Department of Energy has shown that it is just blundering into markets and processes that it doesn’t understand with flimsy arguments that don’t withstand scrutiny. And other people are bearing the costs.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/2048px-Schaffer_2105.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a31e6a45ff2e33e53c8713be8057d191,N,,2026-01-09 05:12:41.085304

Health protections from chemicals are under attack in Congress EPA’s announcement comes amid mounting concern that chemical industry lobbyists wield outsized influence over federal chemical policy.
Banning unnecessary toxic chemicals like phthalates and advancing safer solutions is one of the most effective ways we can protect the health of Americans.
EPA’s announcement falls far short of that goal and represents a missed opportunity to protect health, workers, and the environment.","We are all tired of being told everything is fine while our kids get sicker, chronic diseases rise, and toxic exposures increase.

So when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on December 31, 2025 that EPA intends “to regulate dozens of uses of five phthalates”—hormone-disrupting chemicals commonly used in everyday plastic products—some may have thought this was a good thing for the health of Americans.

It wasn’t.

Instead, EPA’s announcement follows a familiar and troubling pattern: chemical industry science and corporate profits prioritized over the health of our families.

Despite overwhelming evidence of harm, the EPA does not plan to regulate phthalates in consumer products, even though children and women of childbearing age are among the most vulnerable to their hormone-disrupting effects. Buried in the EPA’s press release was this startling admission:

“For the consumer uses that are part of this TSCA risk evaluation, EPA found no products with exposure levels that are causing unreasonable risk to the general population.” (emphasis added)

That’s right. EPA is recommending no action to safeguard consumers from hormone-disrupting phthalates under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

It’s hard to see how the EPA’s decision protects anyone’s health. It does, however, protect the big chemical corporations that make and use these chemicals.

Phthalates: the “everywhere chemicals” in consumer products

EPA’s conclusion runs counter to the growing body of science showing that families, especially children, are regularly exposed to phthalates from many everyday products like vinyl flooring and wall coverings, wiring, children’s toys, and baby products. Exposure happens through indoor air and household dust, as well as through direct contact—touching and chewing on PVC plastic products.

If EPA were truly relying on “gold standard science,” it would follow the lead of states and companies that have already banned phthalates in consumer products and switched to safer alternatives. We have been working for decades to eliminate this old chemistry in favor of safer solutions, including reducing unnecessary plastic use altogether.

States from Washington to Maine, along with major retailers like Walmart and The Home Depot, have adopted common-sense policies to ban phthalates to protect people’s health, especially children and pregnant women. Congress did the same in 2008, when bipartisan federal law restricted eight phthalates in children’s toys and baby products—yet those same hormone-disrupting chemicals remain unregulated across other consumer products.

Why this matters

Nearly every American has measurable levels of phthalates in their body. These chemicals have been linked to serious health problems on the rise, from birth defects and infertility to ADHD, asthma, and early puberty in children.

Exposures to these chemicals are regular, repeated, and can be avoided by removing these chemicals from products. This is exactly the kind of common-sense action Congress intended EPA to take when it reformed TSCA in 2016.

Is EPA’s announcement good news for workers?

Probably not.

EPA said that all five phthalates evaluated “pose unreasonable risks to workers and the environment,” but signaled no intention to ban the chemicals. Instead, it will most likely rely on personal protective equipment (PPE), which has proven woefully inadequate. Relying on PPE to control toxic chemicals has repeatedly failed workers, especially in real-world conditions where equipment isn’t properly used, workers are inadequately trained, or protective gear is unavailable. Workers deserve protections that eliminate hazards at the source, not policies that shift the burden onto individuals.

Health protections from chemicals are under attack in Congress

EPA’s announcement comes amid mounting concern that chemical industry lobbyists wield outsized influence over federal chemical policy. At the same time, Big Chem is pushing Congress to weaken TSCA itself.

That’s why, in December, Toxic-Free Future organized a letter signed by more than 250 public health, consumer, and environmental organizations to urge Congress to reject efforts to further erode chemical safety protections.

The survey focused on areas where residents live near large biomass plants, including a facility in Northampton County, North Carolina.

Wood pellet plants process trees into fuel pellets that are exported overseas, primarily to Europe and Asia, where they are burned to generate electricity.

While often described as a renewable energy source, the manufacturing process produces dust and emissions that residents say affect air quality and daily life.

The survey was carried out by local residents working alongside environmental organisations, students and legal advocates.

Participants visited households near pellet plants to gather information about health concerns, environmental conditions and quality-of-life impacts associated with nearby industrial activity.

According to the survey findings, residents reported respiratory problems, persistent dust, noise and increased industrial traffic.

These concerns were most frequently recorded in rural communities and in areas with lower-than-average household incomes.

Environmental justice advocates note that heavy industrial facilities are often sited in communities with limited political influence, where residents may face barriers to raising concerns or accessing regulatory processes.

Companies operating such facilities frequently cite economic benefits and job creation, though residents surveyed said they saw limited long-term community investment.

The organisers of the survey say the data supports long-standing community complaints and will be used to inform public awareness efforts and policy discussions related to biomass energy production and environmental regulation.

Further surveying and data collection are expected to continue as part of broader efforts to assess the local impacts of wood pellet manufacturing across the region.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/bigstock-222018511-768x512.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 12:01:15.989905

Because USMCA is the first U.S. FTA to undergo a joint review, the scope and process of the review remain unclear.
The parties also may choose to discuss certain bilateral or trilateral issues separately from the joint review process.","Introduction

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a trilateral free trade agreement (FTA) that outlines rules for duty-free trade among the eponymous three countries as well as commitments on non-tariff issues, including labor, environment, investment, digital trade, and services. USMCA entered into force on July 1, 2020, replacing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).1 The USMCA Implementation Act (P.L. 116-113), which was signed into law on January 29, 2020, approved and implemented the agreement. Congress, in both its legislative and oversight capacities, was active in numerous trade policy issues related to the negotiations and conclusion of USMCA, and continues to be active in overseeing its implementation.

A key issue for the 119th Congress is a scheduled July 2026 ""joint review"" of USMCA. The joint review is specified within the ""review and term extension"" provision2 (sometimes referred to as a ""sunset clause"")—the first time such a provision has been included in any U.S. FTA. USMCA is scheduled to terminate 16 years after its entry into force (July 1, 2036) unless all three member countries confirm that they wish to continue the agreement through a ""joint review"" process. The parties committed to begin the first joint review on the sixth anniversary of the agreement's entry into force (July 1, 2026).

The establishment of a USMCA joint review provision was controversial. In hearings that took place during USMCA negotiations, Members of Congress expressed doubts about adding a mandatory review clause to USMCA, arguing that such a provision would create uncertainty that could discourage private investment and harm U.S. businesses.3 Some Members questioned whether the sunset clause provision may circumvent congressional authorities related to trade agreements.4 Then-U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer argued that the USMCA joint review process allows Congress to exert greater oversight than ""eternal"" FTAs that lack a mechanism for periodic review of an agreement.5

The USMCA Implementation Act includes congressional consultation requirements related to the joint review process.6 Congress may consider whether, and if so, how, to shape U.S. priorities for and approaches to the USMCA joint review. If there are significant revisions to USMCA resulting from the joint review, Congress may have a role in approving a revised agreement.

USMCA Joint Review Provision (Article 34.7)

While negotiating the USMCA terms, officials in the first Trump Administration proposed a five-year ""sunset clause"" and stated that the President would decide whether or not to continue the agreement five years after the agreement went into effect.7 An Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) official at the time argued that such a sunset clause would prevent agreements from becoming ""out of date"" and that ""it takes a fair amount of political pressure in order to get nations to come together and work on these agreements.""8 Canadian and Mexican officials opposed the initial U.S. ""sunset clause"" proposal, maintaining it would create uncertainty for investment and other economic activity.9

The three parties eventually agreed on a 16-year term for USMCA, with a required joint review to decide whether to renew the agreement.10 As described below, USMCA broadly outlines certain aspects of the joint review related to timeline and procedure Because the scheduled July 2026 joint review of USMCA is the first time that the United States is conducting such a process in relation to an FTA, there is no precedent for how the President or Congress may approach the scope of the review and the U.S. domestic process and trilateral process for conducting it.

According to Article 34.7 of USMCA, the parties are to meet on the sixth anniversary of the USMCA's entry into force (i.e., on July 1, 2026) for the first joint review.11 If a party wishes to make changes to the agreement, it is to provide recommendations for action at least one month before the joint review.12 If a party wishes to extend the agreement, it ""shall confirm, in writing, through its head of government.""13 If all parties agree to an extension, USMCA would ""automatically"" be extended for another 16 years. Subsequently, another joint review would be held ""no later than at the end of the next six-year period"" to discuss further extension of USMCA.14

If a party does not agree to extend USMCA, the agreement requires the parties to conduct additional annual joint reviews until all parties agree to extend the agreement for another 16-year period (after which the parties will return to a six-year joint review cycle15) or until USMCA terminates.16 The joint review process is separate from USMCA's withdrawal provisions, which allow any party to withdraw from the agreement with six months' written notice to the other parties.17

The Role of Congress in the Joint Review

The USMCA Implementation Act (P.L. 116-113), requires the President to consult with certain congressional committees (i.e., the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee), and other stakeholders before each joint review with respect to ""any recommendation for action to be proposed"" at the joint review, and ""whether or not to confirm that the United States wishes to extend"" USMCA.18 The law also instructs USTR to issue a notice in the Federal Register at least 270 days before a joint review to solicit public comments and to hold a public hearing for a presentation of views.19 Ahead of the scheduled July 2026 review, USTR issued a Federal Register notice on September 17, 2025, and held a public hearing from December 3 to December 5, 2025.20

At least 180 days before a six-year joint review, USTR must report to the appropriate congressional committees its 1) assessment of the operation of USMCA; 2) recommendations for actions to be proposed at the joint review; 3) the U.S. position on whether to extend USMCA; 4) what, if any, prior efforts have been made to resolve concerns underlying such recommendations and position; and 5) the views of trade advisory committees regarding such recommendations/position.21 USTR also is required to engage with Congress following a joint review, including in the case that not all USMCA parties agree to extend the term of the agreement.22

On December 16 and 17, 2025, USTR Jamieson Greer reported to the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee and asserted that these meetings held by USTR fulfilled aforementioned consultation requirements.23 Some Members of Congress sought a written report on the proceedings. In USTR Greer's publicly available opening remarks to the committees during the closed-door briefings, he assessed USMCA, recommended action on bilateral and trilateral issues, described efforts undertaken to resolve concerns, and presented views of the trade advisory committees, which include representatives from the private sector, labor unions, nongovernmental organizations, and other U.S. stakeholders.24 USTR Greer stated that ""the shortcomings [of USMCA] are such that a rubberstamp of the Agreement is not in the national interest"" and indicated that the nature of the joint review will depend on the ""successful resolution"" of various bilateral and trilateral issues (see ""Issues for Congress"").25

Issues for Congress

Congress may consider whether and how to engage on the 2026 USMCA joint review, including on oversight of U.S. trade relations with Canada and Mexico. Congress also may investigate and assess how proposed changes to the agreement might impact the U.S. economy and broader U.S. relations with Canada and Mexico. Congress also may consider to what extent the Administration is satisfying its statutorily required consultation requirements, or whether to seek more or less consultation with the Administration.

Because USMCA is the first U.S. FTA to undergo a joint review, the scope and process of the review remain unclear. The parties may choose to address longstanding and/or new bilateral and trilateral issues, which may require revising some USMCA provisions or adding new language on areas not currently addressed in USMCA. The parties also may choose to discuss certain bilateral or trilateral issues separately from the joint review process. Congress may consider whether and how to weigh in on the issues to be discussed at the review. In his December 2025 meetings with Congress, USTR Greer highlighted some potential topics for the joint review, including

Bilateral trade issues such as dairy, digital services, and provincial bans on the distribution of U.S. alcohol (Canada); and agriculture, labor, and energy (Mexico);26 and

Potential revisions to the rules for duty-free trade among USMCA partners (""rules of origin"");27

Congress may also debate whether the USMCA joint review is the appropriate forum for some issues, particularly longstanding bilateral disputes or discussions related to tariffs implemented by the United States in 2025, such as

Tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. §§1701 et seq.) ;28 and

Global national security tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. §1862, as amended) that affect key Canadian and Mexican sectors.29

Congress is the branch constitutionally authorized to regulate commerce with foreign nations and may decide whether revisions to USMCA require congressional approval.30 Revisions to the agreement that would require changes to U.S. law would require Congress to enact implementing legislation. Congress approved USMCA and enacted its implementing legislation under rules set out in the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (TPA-2015, P.L. 114-26), which expired in 2021.31 Under TPA, Congress specified negotiating objectives and consultation requirements and allowed expedited consideration of implementing legislation for FTAs that sufficiently addressed those objectives and requirements. Congress could consider legislation adopting similar requirements, or, in the absence of TPA, may consider whether and how to set priorities for the Administration in preparation for and during the joint review, and how any required implementing legislation may be voted on.

In preparation for the joint review, some Members of Congress have written letters to the Administration that contain recommendations for issues to be addressed during the joint review.32 Congress also could consider amending the USMCA implementing legislation to clarify or strengthen Congress's role in the joint review process, such as whether to add congressional reporting requirements or specify whether reports should be submitted orally, in writing or both and whether USMCA revisions should require congressional approval and whether additional negotiating authority should be delegated to the executive branch.",https://www.EveryCRSReport.com/reports/R48787.png,N,,2026-01-09 11:02:48.544985

U.S. policy toward data center environmental impacts has so far been piecemeal.
Texas, California, Michigan, Minnesota, and other states are now drafting an increasing number of state regulations to limit local environmental impacts.
Beijing is keenly aware of this surge and has launched major initiatives to shape where and how data centers operate.
Many data center operators now face new regulations to purchase a certain percentage of green power credits.","As artificial intelligence rapidly expands, the United States and China face similar sustainability challenges, but their responses differ starkly — shaping AI’s long-term environmental footprint.

In Part 1 of my series on environmental AI governance, we identified that energy and water are at risk of data center overusage and could be competing with local communities for electricity and water. A polling from AP-NORC center for public affair research says that 4 in 10 Americans are “extremely” or “very” concerned about the environmental impacts of AI. How do authorities in the U.S. respond to the resource intensive demand and environmental impacts of AI data centers?

U.S. policy toward data center environmental impacts has so far been piecemeal. There are largely no federal regulations specifically capping data centers’ energy or water use; instead, market forces and local state authorities are playing the key roles. China, which now makes more profit selling green technology than America makes from selling fossil fuels, is “baking in” their renewable technologies into their national data center initiatives.

The U.S. environmental AI push is largely from bottom-up – relying on local state, civic engagement, and market forces

In recent years, local state’s tax exemption incentives have attracted large tech corporations to bring in high tech jobs into their cities. A report by CNBC business found that as many as 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data center projects or have no state sales tax at all. Environmental concern was not on the front docket until air pollution and water reserves for citizens were in question.

Some tech companies are striking their own deals to secure cleaner energy. For example, Meta recently inked a landmark 20-year purchase agreement for the entire output of a 1.1 GW nuclear power plant in Illinois. At the same time, Meta’s expansion in the southern region of the U.S. powered by fossil fuels seems to be double-faced. Louisiana’s Entergy Corp. has proposed building three new gas-fired power plants exclusively to feed Meta’s data centers. This project is now under legal scrutiny for its potential climate impacts, which are forecasted to burn 3 times as much electricity as the city of New Orleans at any given day. Microsoft, Google, and other hyperscalers are also attempting to find a green AI path by signing wind and solar deals.

Today, most data center policies are centered around local grievances for energy and water overusage. Local grassroot community organizers are protesting the negligence and carelessness of corporations. In response, an array of state policymakers in recent months have formed frameworks around data center development. Texas, California, Michigan, Minnesota, and other states are now drafting an increasing number of state regulations to limit local environmental impacts.

Some U.S. states are stepping up with incentives and requirements for greener data centers. For instance, in 2024 Virginia’s proposal bill for Data Center Efficiency stipulating Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) efficiency targets for tax breaks, and in June 2025 Oregon now mandates water reporting for large cooling users. Another tactic local governments are using is third-party verification systems such as LEED to incentivize green sustainable data development.

In the end, America’s regulatory approach to AI data centers remains a patchwork—driven by corporate deals and local politics rather than national coordination. States set the pace as Washington lags behind. Without a cohesive strategy, the AI gold rush risks overwhelming both the power grid and the environmental safeguards for improving urban sustainable development.

China’s Sustainable AI development is ahead of building the Eco and Efficient AI – an existing Chinese industrial policy top to bottom approach

Unsurprisingly, China, by contrast, is taking a more centralized, policy-driven path to manage AI’s environmental footprint. Chinese analysts project data centers will consume 400 TWh annually, around 3.2% of China’s total electricity supply – roughly quadrupling in a decade. Beijing is keenly aware of this surge and has launched major initiatives to shape where and how data centers operate.

A signature policy is the “East-West Computing Resources Transmission” (EWCRT) or “东数西算” unveiled in 2022, which directs new supercomputing, data centers, and cloud facilities to be built in China’s western and northern regions. Because these regions – Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia – are home to cooler climates and abundant wind and solar resources, they can facilitate greener energy build out, enhance supply and demand optimization, and better balance compute resourcing. In comparison to the populous eastern provinces, energy demand is strained, and expanding energy capacity means burning more coal. This national EWCRT strategy is a highly coordinated effort across multiple Chinese provinces demonstrating Beijing’s ambitious top to bottom approach to achieving sustainable AI governance.

By relocating AI data centers closer to regions with abundant renewable energy sources and cooler temperatures, China aims to use less water for cooling and improve the carbon profile of its AI hardware infrastructure. Some research claims that the East-West Data Project can result in a reduction of 11,500 metric tons (Mt) of CO2 between 2020 and 2050 – the equivalent of reducing 30,000 barrels of oil. In addition, Beijing has set new goals to cut the average PUE down and with the use of green electricity in these data centers.

Equally important, Chinese authorities recently have mandated the use of clean energy not only for industrial manufacturers but also for data centers – a move which further integrates its complex energy policy with its AI industrial policy. March 2025, China’s National Development and Reform Commission issued guidelines pushing the country’s big data hubs to further increase their share of renewable electricity. Many data center operators now face new regulations to purchase a certain percentage of green power credits.

China’s provincial governments have rolled out complementary policies. Inner Mongolia offers incentivesfor data centers to directly pair with local wind and solar farms to reduce carbon emission. Another example, the local Shanghai government and China Telecom collaborated on a partnership to build the Lin-gang Special Area, which has become home to what the country calls the world’s first underwater data center. The $226 million project combines renewable energy with deep-sea cooling to improve efficiency and sustainability.

While the U.S. relies on market-led innovation and decentralized governance, China pursues state-led coordination and strategic regional planning. Whether China’s efforts will fully offset the emissions growth remains unclear – China’s grid is still ~60% coal-fired, so a jump to serve the enormous demand of data centers could add significantly to CO₂ emissions. Unless renewables scale even faster, the AI race will still run the risk of developing AI infrastructure powered by coal or natural gas in the near future

Balancing both AI ambitions and environmental constraints is not an easy task for a tight AI race. Their divergent models—bottom-up adaptation versus top-down orchestration—illustrate different strengths: American flexibility drives technological experimentation, while Chinese centralization enables systemic efficiency. Both nations ultimately should aim to reconcile AI’s rapid growth with environmental stewardship.",https://www.chinausfocus.com/d/file/202601/9a141e39dc2412919a5adcf6061faef4.png,N,,2026-01-09 02:13:43.166096

Farm bills are massive pieces of legislation that address a diverse constellation of topics, including agricultural commodities, conservation, trade, nutrition, rural development, energy, forestry and more. Because of their complexity, farm bills are difficult to negotiate in any political environment. And as the topics have expanded since the first iteration in 1933, Congress has generally agreed to take the whole thing up once every five years or so.

However, the most recent farm bill’s provisions expired in 2023. They have been renewed one year at a time ever since, but without the comprehensive overhaul that used to accompany farm bills.

As former federal employees handling agriculture policy who now study that topic, it’s unclear to us whether a comprehensive, five-year farm bill can be passed in 2026, or ever again.

The July 2025 enactment of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the Trump administration’s budget priorities in the tax and spending bill, revised funding levels for many programs that were historically handled in the farm bill. For instance, that law included a 20% cut in funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which helps low-income families buy food. And it doubled support for the largest farm subsidy programs.

Those changes and current divisions in Congress mean the nation’s food and agriculture policy may remain stuck in limbo for yet another year.

Cuts to SNAP used for farm subsidies

For decades, political conventional wisdom has held that sweeping federal farm bills are able to pass only because farmers seeking subsidies and anti-hunger advocates wanting increased SNAP dollars recognize the mutual advantage in working together. That’s how to build a broad, bipartisan consensus strong enough to garner the 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to avoid a filibuster and actually pass a bill.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending law did not create a compromise between those competing interests. It slashed SNAP spending by $186 billion over the next decade. At the same time, it boosted price support for farmers who grow key crops like corn, soybeans and wheat by $60 billion, in addition to a $10 billion economic relief package passed at the end of 2024 to address high costs of seeds, fertilizer and other farming supplies.

Supporters of anti-hunger programs are furious that these funds for farmers are being paid for by cutting SNAP benefits to families.

In addition, about one-third of the SNAP cuts came by shifting the program’s cost to state budgets. States have always carried some of the costs to administer SNAP, but they have never before been required to fund billions of dollars in benefits. Many states will be unable to cover these increased costs and will be forced to either reduce benefits or opt out of SNAP altogether, dramatically cutting the help available to hungry Americans.

Groups that support SNAP are unlikely to help pass any bill relating to food or farm policy that does not substantially reverse the cuts to SNAP.

And farmers who receive money under the two largest farm subsidy programs are not even required to grow the specific crops those programs are meant to support. Rather, they must simply own farmland that was designated in 1996 as having grown that crop in the early 1980s.

Farmers have repeatedly said they would prefer federal farm policies that support markets and create conditions for stable, fair commodity prices. And evidence shows that spending more money on farm subsidies does little to actually improve underlying economic conditions affecting the costs of farming or the prices of what is grown.

And yet, in early December 2025, the Department of Agriculture released an additional $12 billion to help offset losses farmers experienced when Trump’s tariffs reduced agricultural exports. In mid-December, the National Farmers Union said that money still wasn’t enough to cover losses from consistently low commodity prices and high seed and fertilizer costs.

A regular five-year farm bill may be out of reach

The success of any bill depends on political will in Congress and outside pressure coming together to deliver the required number of votes.

Some leaders in Congress remain optimistic about the prospects of a farm bill passing in 2026, but major legislation is rare with midterm elections looming, so meaningful progress appears unlikely. It seems to us more likely that the ongoing stalemate will continue indefinitely.

In September 2025, Politico reported that instead of a complete five-year farm bill, the House and Senate committees on agriculture might take up a series of smaller bills to extend existing programs whose authorizations are expiring. Doing so would be an effective declaration that a permanent five-year farm bill is on indefinite hold.

Prospects for sustainable farm policy

By using financial incentives cleverly, Congress has shifted farming practices over time in ways that lawmakers determined were in the public’s interest.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, allocated $20 billion over four years to encourage farmers to reduce or offset carbon emissions, which the Agriculture Department calls “climate-smart agriculture.” Those funds, along with a separate Department of Agriculture initiative with similar aims, were well received by American farmers. Farmers applied for far more money than was actually available.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending law cut those funds and repurposed them for traditional Agriculture Department programs for farmers who want to implement conservation practices on their land.

But unexpectedly, the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, agenda contains some ideas that climate-smart advocates have previously advanced. These include scathing indictments of the effects of conventional agriculture on Americans’ health, including concerns over pesticide use and the so-far-undefined category of “ultra-processed foods.”

The MAHA agenda could be an opportunity for organic farmers to secure a boost in federal funding. In December, the Agriculture Department committed $700 million toward “regenerative” practices, but that’s a trifling amount compared with the billions commodity farmers received in 2025.

And the administration’s allies who support conventional agriculture have already expressed concerns that MAHA efforts might reduce the nation’s agricultural productivity. The administration may end up caught between the MAHA movement and Big Ag.

Overall, in this new political environment, we believe advocates for changes in agriculture and food aid will likely need to rethink how to advance their agendas without the promise of a farm bill coming anytime soon.

WASHINGTON — In the fallout of President Trump’s extraordinary rendition of the president of Venezuela, the administration’s obsession with developing the uneconomic oil resources in the country raises the likelihood of massive U.S. taxpayer subsidies and financial guarantees to Big Oil, according to a new report from Public Citizen.

The report, Congress Must Stop Trump’s Venezuelan Oil Takeover, highlights ways Congress can conduct much-needed oversight over potential conflicts of interest and corporate favors stemming from Trump’s Venezuelan oil grab.

While Trump claims he will rely on U.S. companies to exploit Venezuela’s oil resources for years to come, due to decrepit Venezuelan infrastructure, the low quality of Venezuelan crude, and political instability, most Big Oil corporations are hesitant to invest without a guarantee of profits. Trump’s solution appears to be U.S. taxpayer subsidies and guarantees for Big Oil.

The report identifies key vehicles, including the U.S. International Development Finance Corp and the Export-Import Bank, poised to subsidize Big Oil.

The report also spotlights international oil majors who may be in line for payouts in longstanding litigation against the Venezuelan government and highlights Gulf Coast refineries, including Valero Energy, Phillips 66, and Marathon Petroleum as potential beneficiaries. These refiners already import Venezuelan heavy and dirty crude and would likely be in a position to import and refine more.

“Handing over Venezuela’s oil industry to Big Oil will do nothing to lower prices at the gas pump, but will burden American taxpayers with billions in new subsidies for oil executives,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “Rebuilding Venezuela’s battered oil industry in the long term will require a massive influx of capital. The fossil fuel industry is unwilling to take on this risk without some sort of taxpayer-backed guarantee. ”

The report calls on Congress to stop any federal government guarantee to Big Oil that would force American taxpayers—or use the proceeds from purloined Venezuelan oil—to cover all or some of the risk of investment in Venezuela. Further, lawmakers must prevent the Trump administration from using federal programs like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to provide risk insurance and other subsidies for Big Oil.

Public Citizen’s report comes ahead of a Friday White House meeting between the president and representatives of major fossil fuel companies, including leaders from Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Exxon Mobil, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“The Trump administration’s shocking actions to use force to exploit Venezuela’s oil resources echo the imperial arrogance of the United States after the invasion of Iraq and a century of military intervention in Central and South America,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen. “But at no time in post World War II history has the United States ever so blatantly claimed a right to control other countries’ natural resources or to use military force to obtain them. Along with blocking further military action against Venezuela, Congress must act to ensure U.S. taxpayers don’t subsidize Big Oil’s exploitation of Venezuela’s oil resources.”

Announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the partnership introduces the first application of its kind by a global consumer packaged goods (CPG) company, marking a shift in how facilities are designed, simulated and managed.

As demand grows and the need for faster and more adaptable production rises, PepsiCo is taking steps to digitally overhaul its plants and warehouses in the US.

The process involves piloting digital twins – digital replicas of real-world facilities – before making any changes to physical infrastructure.

These virtual models allow the company to simulate, test and validate new setups with speed and precision.

Ramon Laguarta, Chairman and CEO at PepsiCo, explains: ""The scale and complexity of PepsiCo's business, from farm to shelf, is massive – and we are embedding AI throughout our operations to better meet the increasing demands of our consumers and customers.

""Our work with Siemens and Nvidia will help accelerate our continued journey of becoming a future-fit company, operating with agility and foresight.""

Using digital twins to model, test and build smarter

PepsiCo is now adopting a digital-first strategy for facility planning.

Using physics-based digital twin simulations, the company is able to co-design operations with AI agents that help to test and refine layout choices before making any on-site changes.

These simulations are powered by Siemens’ Digital Twin Composer software, which is built using Nvidia’s Omniverse platform – a set of tools that creates real-time 3D simulations with physically accurate behaviour.

The technology enables PepsiCo to digitally reconstruct all machines, conveyor systems, operator paths and pallet flows with a high level of detail.

This helps the company identify system flaws and performance improvements virtually, eliminating the need to build or modify physical infrastructure until every variable has been tested.

According to early trial outcomes, PepsiCo improves throughput by 20% while achieving almost full design validation and reducing capital expenditure by 10% to 15%.

Nvidia Founder and CEO Jensen Huang sees digital twins as the foundation of AI adoption across physical industries: ""Physical industries are entering the age of AI. For companies with real-world assets, digital twins are the foundation of their AI journey.""

""Working with Nvidia and Siemens, PepsiCo is re-architecting its operations – using physically-accurate digital twins and AI to reinvent how it designs, optimises and runs its global operations,"" he adds.

The new approach will allow PepsiCo to spot up to 90% of operational issues in simulation before changes are made in the real world.

That efficiency is already visible in initial pilot sites, where PepsiCo uses AI and computer vision to optimise the end-to-end supply chain.

Building a global, intelligent supply chain

At the heart of the transformation is Siemens’ new software solution, which supports large-scale industrial metaverse environments.

These environments merge 2D and 3D data from digital twins with real-time physical information – all within a managed, high-fidelity 3D interface.

The system enables manufacturers to view and test every aspect of a facility – both virtual and physical – throughout its operational lifecycle.

Roland Busch, CEO at Siemens, says: ""We are proud to partner with PepsiCo and Nvidia to digitally transform their manufacturing facilities using physics-based digital twins and AI from design to engineering to operations.

""The Digital Twin Composer is a cornerstone in enabling PepsiCo to transform manufacturing and warehousing.

""Siemens is powering the industrial AI revolution – with an unmatched industrial AI technology stack, deep domain knowhow and world-class partners.

""This collaboration sets a new standard for all industries. Customers can turn ideas into real-world impact with greater speed, quality, and efficiency.""

With a clear strategy in place, PepsiCo is embarking on its digital transformation in select US locations, but has confirmed it aims to scale the approach across its global operations.

The digital twins simulate not only machinery and facility layouts but also the end-to-end supply chain, helping to establish a performance benchmark for each site.

Using AI tools, PepsiCo teams can test new layouts and system changes to refine operations and boost capacity without costly physical upgrades.

Designing plants that anticipate and adapt

In addition to creating flexible and responsive facilities, PepsiCo wants to design a new type of intelligent supply chain that predicts and adapts to changes automatically.

Athina Kanioura, CEO for Latin America and Global Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer at PepsiCo, adds: ""We are deploying the first digital blueprint that reimagines how the supply chain is designed, built, and scaled, a first for the industry.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/218a6775ebb754908e902aa03cb433a9:161f7f84e45111bbc51ae32cfcb4e9c4/pepsico-x-siemens-x-nvidia-6.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 11:13:26.190161

In addition, CFS will use NVIDIA’s Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD to integrate data with both classical and AI-powered physics models during the digital twin development.
Bob Mumgaard, CFS’s cofounder and CEO, said that the digital twin will enable his company “to compress years of manual experimentation into weeks of virtual optimization using the digital infrastructure developed by NVIDIA and Siemens.
Del Costy, president and managing director for Americas, Siemens Digital Industries Software, called the collaborative effort the “future of industrial engineering,” saying, “By connecting Siemens Xcelerator with NVIDIA AI visualization libraries, we're demonstrating that end-to-end digital workflows aren't just efficient, they're transformative.","The digital twin will provide CFS with a “user-friendly way to run simulations, test hypotheses, and quickly compare the experimental results from the machine to the simulations,” CFS said. The company expects that this ability to rapidly analyze data will speed its efforts to make fusion energy a commercial reality.

Commercially relevant: In 2027, according to CFS, SPARC will become “the world’s first commercially relevant fusion energy machine to produce more energy from fusion than it needs to power the process—a threshold called net energy generation or Q>1.” The SPARC device, which is being constructed at the company’s Devens campus, is a type of tokamak that is intended to demonstrate net fusion energy and refine the core technology that the company plans to use in the machine’s successor, ARC, which will “put power on the grid.”

The first ARC plant, which is to be sited in Chesterfield County, Va., will produce 400 MW of power when it is connected to the grid by the early 2030s, CFS said.

Development of digital twin: The development process for the SPARC digital twin will use data from the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio of industrial software, including the Designcenter NX for advanced product engineering and the Teamcenter product life cycle management tools. CFS intends to apply these designs and assemblies to its modeling and simulation workflows, including the layering of AI-enabled tools. In addition, CFS will use NVIDIA’s Omniverse libraries and OpenUSD to integrate data with both classical and AI-powered physics models during the digital twin development.

IN Agency Fails to Hold US Steel and BP Whiting to Standards Needed to Minimize Air Pollution

Environmental, community groups ask US EPA to compel Indiana agency toughen steel facilities’ air permit renewal requirements

Environmental and community groups submitted two petitions to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency asking it to object to two inadequate air permit renewals the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) recently issued to a steel plant and oil refinery in Northwest Indiana. A petition was filed on January 2 in connection to a permit renewal for BP Whiting and a separate petition was filed on December 23, 2025 in connection to a U.S. Steel Midwest Plant in Portage permit renewal. The permits fail to include many basic provisions of the Clean Air Act, including clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements.

The U.S. Steel Midwest Plant petition was filed on behalf of the Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), Gary Advocates for Responsible Development (GARD), Just Transition Northwest Indiana (JTNWI), Northern Lake County Environmental Partnership (NLCEP), National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), Abrams Environmental Law Clinic, and Faith in Place. The groups contend that IDEM disregarded key concerns that U.S. EPA and other Commenters raised about the permits during the public comment period, specifically the permit’s failure to include requirements that ensure compliance with emission limits and federal regulations.

The BP Whiting petition was filed on behalf of ELPC, GARD, Environmental Integrity Project, Save the Dunes, JTNWI, NLCEP, and Faith in Place. The groups contend that, among other shortcomings, BP’s air permit fails to include an emissions limit on particulate matter that is required by Indiana’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan.

Kerri Gefeke, ELPC Associate Attorney, said:

“U.S. EPA should object to these permits because they’re inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and The Region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone. Numerous studies show that residents living near these facilities already suffer from some of the highest rates of air pollution in the nation – resulting in high rates of asthma, cancer, and other diseases. And recent reporting identifies Indiana’s natural environment as ranked dead last based on air and water quality as well as pollution threats.

“IDEM needs to do better and ensure that BP Whiting and U.S. Steel Midwest Plant are operating in a way that is not only economically lucrative but also protective of human health. IDEM can do that by simply ensuring that the permits it issues follow the law and include the necessary monitoring provisions to ensure that these plants – and similar facilities – are not polluting more than what’s allowable in their permits.”

Dorreen Carey, President of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, said:

“For over 100 years Northwest Indiana residents have been continuously exposed to the daily, monthly, and yearly air pollution from the iron and steelmaking process including particulate matter, NOx, SO2, and hazardous air pollutants like mercury and lead. Upgrades in air pollution monitoring and control at these plants are long overdue. The outdated and insufficient requirements for U.S. Steel and BP Whiting air emission monitoring contained in the IDEM Title V Permit Renewals do not allow for continuous real time information, timely intervention, and the corrective action needed to assure compliance and enforcement of the Clean Air Act.

“EPA must object to this deficient IDEM Permit Renewal and require revisions to the air monitoring methodology that will include updated and supplemental monitoring of emissions and opacity limits to ensure permit compliance and current and ongoing protection of nearby residents’ health and environment.”",https://elpc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/original-12757EB9-7B67-4C29-A676-DC2F37384BE12.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 23:58:10.612661

When Compliance Shapes the Clock Regulatory factors now dictate schedules as much as engineering timelines, complicating supply chain risk management in energy.","For decades, supply chains in the power sector have operated steadily behind the scenes. They were the quiet backbone: essential, dependable, and rarely acknowledged unless something went wrong.

That dynamic has changed. As the energy landscape grows more complex, supply chain considerations are increasingly center stage. While supply chain planning has always been critical, it is now playing a greater role in shaping project feasibility, cost, and timing. Securing capacity has become more competitive and more consequential: for the first time in decades, customers are paying reservation fees to hold their place in production queues.

The industry is adjusting in real-time, rethinking how supply chains are managed under tighter timelines and higher stakes. Building energy supply chain resilience now depends on greater visibility, flexible sourcing, and closer collaboration, not just within procurement teams.

Utilities that understand these dynamics and align early with OEMs on compliance, logistics, and design are best positioned to protect costs, stay on schedule, and maintain reliability as they plan for what comes next.

What’s Reshaping Supply Chain Complexity?

The growing complexity reflects the sector’s momentum, and the widening set of actors now involved in supply chain decisions. As power demand surges from data centers, manufacturing onshoring, and the electrification of everything from vehicles to factories, utilities, OEMs, developers, and EPCs are increasingly pulled into conversations once handled almost exclusively by supply chain teams.

To keep pace with the demand for electricity, some forecast that developers plan to add a total of roughly 36.4GW of gas capacity by 2028. This level of planned capacity requires utilities to work with partners to plan earlier, more proactively, and more efficiently, ensuring resources are aligned and available across the supply chain before constraints occur.

AI and automation are also reshaping utilities’ operations, speeding some processes, straining others, and creating new dependencies on technology and skilled labor. At the same time, workforce dynamics are shifting, making it harder to attract, retain, and support the people needed to keep projects moving.

On the global and policy stages, rising risks from tariffs, trade tensions, uncertain regulations, cost inflation, and competition are adding pressure on the energy sector’s supply chains. Cancellations and delays have become far more common, underscoring the need for adaptability and resilience across the power generation ecosystem.

When Compliance Shapes the Clock

Regulatory factors now dictate schedules as much as engineering timelines, complicating supply chain risk management in energy. One example of this is that global tariffs require utilities and OEMs to evaluate multiple pathways that balance design, timing, and cost.

“We are constantly evaluating the tariff impact and having discussions both internally and externally to figure out the best course of action,” says Vincent Leonard, VP of Supply Chain Management at Mitsubishi Power Americas.

Customers must work with OEMs to determine whether to pivot to a different equipment style to avoid tariff impacts or maintain the standardized design, knowing it may require paying a premium. Flexibility often hinges on contractual structures like change-in-law provisions, making early collaboration across legal, engineering, and procurement teams essential.

Country of origin and local content rules now dictate timing as much as cost.

Federally funded projects may require OEMs to “Buy American,” under the Build America, Buy America Act(link is external), which can apply to both equipment and transportation.

“If it's a project that has certain funding through DOE, they may also have a requirement to use a U.S. flag vessel, once again with impact on capacity and cost,” says Agustin Harriague, VP of Logistics and Supply Chain Operational Excellence at Mitsubishi Power Americas.

Because compliance requirements vary by project, utilities benefit from evaluating them early. Recognizing these impacts upfront helps teams select pathways that remain feasible as timelines, costs, and regulations evolve.

Capacity Has Become Currency

Capacity has become a scarce commodity in the sector across gas turbines, steam turbines, and generators, impacting both single and combined-cycle builds. According to McKinsey(link is external), the industry is now seeing sustained load growth for the first time in nearly two decades. That backdrop demands a new level of coordination among OEMs, utilities, developers, and EPCs.

To meet customer needs, OEMs are shifting from reactive acceleration to proactive protection of manufacturing capacity earlier in the planning cycle.

Securing production slots has become strategic. Reservation agreements with auxiliary equipment suppliers, often prepaid, are used to guarantee a place in the queue. Supplier diversification adds further protection when certain vendors face constraints.

The implication for utilities is clear: projects track to the pace of secured capacity. Those who plan ahead with OEM partners gain predictability and, by extension, priority.

Regional Manufacturing and Digital Logistics Provide Agility Under Pressure

OEMs must stay nimble in a volatile global environment, monitoring risks and developing alternative plans to preserve resiliency for customers. Companies are reducing their dependence on inventory buffers, according to McKinsey’s 2024 analysis on supply chain strategies(link is external), with 34% of companies relying on them in 2024, down from 59% in 2023.

Mitsubishi Power’s cross-region manufacturing footprint helps strengthen compliance, reduces transit risks, and supports on-time delivery. To accommodate customer requests for “Buy American” sourcing, the company is expanding U.S. manufacturing through its Savannah Machinery Works facility, increasing capacity for gas, steam, and hydrogen-ready turbine technologies.

Regional manufacturing helps shorten lead times, balances compliance with cost, and provides capacity closer to demand. Proximity is valuable during both equipment manufacturing and deployment, especially for modular power generation projects. Regionalization offers a buffer against geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, and global logistics disruptions.

Mitsubishi Power’s integrated supply chain model gives the flexibility needed to support customers’ evolving needs.

“Integration has allowed us to select the best, high-quality suppliers, which is helping drive quality and on-time delivery,” says Leonard.

Integration also allows Mitsubishi Power to pool and bundle volumes. “As an integrated company, you come with more volume and with a longer pipeline business,” says Harriague.

That scale broadens the supply base, allowing Mitsubishi Power to pivot sourcing faster, helping customers avoid tariff impacts and mitigate delays.

Digital logistics are one example of integration in action, and Mitsubishi Power has been investing in digital solutions that enable further visibility and control, from vendor management to freight booking and routing.

The framework was negotiated in Brazil in 1992, championed by Republican U.S. President George H.W.
The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.
“The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change.
“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the entire United Nations climate-fighting apparatus takes America's environmental isolation to another level and is likely to damage both the United States and the world as the planet flirts with ecological tipping points, experts say.

Leaders from around the world say the United States will be left behind as more than 190 other nations join in what they call a blossoming green economy that is transitioning from polluting coal, oil and gas to cleaner and cheaper solar, wind and other renewable energies.

Wednesday's action starts the process to pull the U.S. out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It's the main way nations negotiate, monitor and enforce agreements to curb worsening climate change, and is a bigger step than Trump's 2017 and 2025 withdrawals from the bedrock 2015 Paris Agreement aimed at limiting warming.

The framework was negotiated in Brazil in 1992, championed by Republican U.S. President George H.W. Bush and ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate. It's what Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden used to justify signing and reactivating the Paris deal without needing Senate approval. The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.

“It is a more serious step definitely. The world loses a lot and it is very damaging,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change. So, yes, in that sense, it's more fundamental and more damaging” than earlier efforts.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in announcing the U.S. withdrawal, said the Trump administration “has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.”

Since 1850, the United States has put more than 480 billion tons (440 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That accounts for nearly one-quarter of the world's historic emissions of a gas that stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, according to the scientists at the Global Carbon Project.

Under the Paris agreement, countries voluntarily pledge to curb emissions by various amounts, but each year global emissions continue to rise. The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.

“It will mean more warming because the U.S. is not going to be fulfilling its obligations of reducing their emissions,” said Adelle Thomas, climate adaptation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and also a vice chair of the U.N. climate science panel that Trump is quitting.

And it comes at a critical time as Earth is approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the internationally agreed warming threshold established in Paris, Thomas and Rockstrom said.

“We need to start reducing emissions globally by 5% per year,” Rockstrom said. “It’s our last chance. And exactly at that moment, the biggest player in the world steps out of the game.”

The world is perilously close to several “tipping points' of irreversible change, such as coral reef loss, said former Ireland president Mary Robinson, a tireless climate change advocate for the group of retired leaders called The Elders.

”We really have no time and it is so unbelievably stupid at one level and reckless for the Trump administration to be taking the steps that they are taking,"" she said.

In past international climate negotiations, especially when Democrat John Kerry was secretary of state or America's top climate envoy, the United States kept oil countries, such as Saudi Arabia, from watering down deals too much, experts said. But that was missing last November in Brazil's negotiations, which the U.S. skipped under Trump.

Kerry called Trump's action “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which represents industries that emit much of the heat-trapping gases, said “removing the U.S. from the U.N. climate framework will accelerate a positive shift towards abandoning the destructive global climate framework.”

Thomas, Rockstrom and Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped fashion the Paris agreement, said the United States is leaving itself behind in a new, cleaner world of cheaper energy and more jobs.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Trump's move will hurt the U.S.

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year,"" he said.

Some environmental advocates have feared that future presidents won't be able to easily reinstate the U.S. to the climate convention in an era when Senate approval would likely be far harder.

But Sue Biniaz, a former State Department lawyer and deputy chief negotiator who now teaches at Yale, said the next president would have the power to undo Trump's action.

“I wouldn’t want to say any sort of damaging action or inaction is irreversible,"" Biniaz said. ""I imagine a future U.S. government would work with other countries to revive as much as possible. We did that in 2021 after the first Trump administration.’’

Small Michigan communities are weighing over a dozen data center projects this year, according to mapping done by the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance.

If elected, El-Sayed said he’s unlikely to be able to get data center legislation passed until President Donald Trump is out of office.","U.S Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed released a framework Thursday for evaluating data center proposals in Michigan communities that looks to ensure resident input and protections for water, energy reliability and affordability, and clean energy laws.

The candidate, who is running in the 2026 Democratic primary for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Gary Peters, told Planet Detroit he wants these priorities to serve as a guidepost for local decision-making and federal legislation.

“I think it’s important for forward-thinking, future legislators to be talking about what it looks like to actually stand up for communities and protect them,” El-Sayed said. He previously worked as Wayne County’s health director and as executive director of the Detroit Health Department.

El-Sayed’s “terms of engagement” for data centers outline community protections for ensuring projects don’t result in electric rate hikes, harm energy reliability, pollute local waterways, and undermine clean energy laws. It also calls for assurances around transparency, community benefits, and job creation promises.

Small Michigan communities are weighing over a dozen data center projects this year, according to mapping done by the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. Developers have said these projects could create hundreds of temporary construction jobs and bring in significant tax revenue.

Many Michigan residents and some lawmakers oppose data center projects in their communities. Data centers’ often massive water and energy demands raise concerns the facilities could harm water resources, pass on costs to other electric ratepayers, and imperil state climate goals.

Data centers’ energy demands risk triggering an “off ramp” provision in the state’s climate law, allowing fossil fuel generation to stay online if there’s a capacity shortage.

U.S. voters support banning data centers near where they live by a margin of 41% to 36%, according to a November Morning Consult poll.

McMorrow: Legislation needed to ensure community safeguards

Environmental and ratepayer protections already exist for data centers receiving state tax breaks, but legislation is needed to codify community safeguards, Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) told Planet Detroit in a statement. McMorrow is another candidate for the Democratic nomination in the U.S. Senate race.

Energy experts previously told Planet Detroit that language in the tax break legislation provides insufficient detail to ensure ratepayers are protected from data center costs, and the facilities’ power demands could undermine Michigan’s renewable energy law.

McMorrow said any data center legislation should include ratepayer and environmental protections, and assurances that data centers are built with union labor and “pay their fair share in taxes to fund our schools, roads, and communities.”

“I’m against any data center that hurts Michiganders’ energy bills, our water, or fails to create good jobs and revenue for our communities,” she said, adding the facilities could also bring in “generational investment.”

McMorrow voted to pass tax breaks for large data centers in 2024.

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham); and Republicans Mike Rogers and Bernadette Smith, who have been identified as competitive candidates in the primary field, did not respond to questions about their positions on data centers.

Data centers raise corporate donation questions, El-Sayed says

The targeting of small townships by large tech companies for data centers makes federal legislation necessary, El-Sayed said.

Such communities are often unprepared to move as quickly as well-resourced corporations, and codifying the framework into law could protect communities from being steamrolled, he said.

If elected, El-Sayed said he’s unlikely to be able to get data center legislation passed until President Donald Trump is out of office.

Data centers raise the “foundational question” of the influence large corporations have over U.S. politics, he said.

El-Sayed said has not accepted campaign donations from DTE Energy. DTE is a major contributor to Michigan political campaigns, and its shareholders could benefit significantly from the electric load growth created by data centers.

JB Pritzker on Thursday signed a wide-ranging energy reform package into law aimed at bolstering the state’s power grids after years of negotiations.

Senate Bill 25 — also known as the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA — will fund battery storage, grant greater authority to state utility regulators, create new options for “virtual power plants” and lift a longtime ban on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

“We’re making it easier to develop renewable energy,” bill sponsor Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, said at the signing ceremony in Joliet. “We’re going to deploy battery storage; we’re lifting the nuclear moratorium. That’s all going to bring more supply onto the grid, and that will help hold the line on our electrical bills.”

The Illinois Power Agency, an independent body responsible for planning and procuring cost-effective energy for Illinoisians, found that the law will save utility customers in the state $13.4 billion over the next two decades. But opponents question those projections, pointing to increased subsidies for battery storage that will eventually be reflected via a new charge on consumers’ bills beginning in 2030.

The bill signing took place less than a month after state regulators projected energy shortfalls would likely drive up costs in the next three to five years and force Illinois to import more power from out of state absent action from lawmakers and grid operators.

Shortfalls, Pritzker said, would be exacerbated by actions at the national level, including the Trump administration’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out renewable energy tax credits and froze federal funding for energy projects. He also criticized a Trump executive order that stripped funding for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major renewable energy law passed by Congress in 2022.

“All of that raises prices in the short term, while threatening our long-term ability to meet growing electricity demand,” Pritzker said.

CRGA, he said, will allow Illinois to forge its own path.

What’s in the law?

At the core of the law is a new structure to incentivize energy storage, or battery, projects. It will result in new charges to ratepayers, though supporters of the bill say that those costs would be offset by cost savings from greater energy efficiency, storage and planning.

The law grants new authority to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the state body responsible for regulating utilities. The ICC will now have the power to set long-term plans for managing energy supply and demand in the state through approval of an integrated resource plan.

It additionally adds new requirements for energy efficiency programs at electric and natural gas utilities and places new air regulations on backup generators used by data centers.

It also secures new labor protections by closing a loophole for community solar projects that has allowed some developers to avoid hiring union labor, a major priority for organized labor groups involved in negotiating the bill.

CRGA also lifts a longstanding ban on constructing new large-scale nuclear power plants, while at the same time increasing fees for nuclear plant operators. It outlines new programs for geothermal and thermal energy network projects, using naturally occurring heat from underground and transferring it via water-filled pipes to offset the need for electric or fossil fuel heating.

The law also creates new “virtual power plant,” or VPP, programs. That’s not virtual as in occurring via the internet or virtual reality, but rather as a program that allows homes and businesses with solar panels or wind turbines to pool energy together, acting “virtually” like a power plant despite not physically existing as one.

The idea is that the energy stored in residential and business batteries can be contributed to the electrical grid when the state’s primary electric delivery companies, like ComEd and Ameren Illinois, face high supply prices during peak hours of use, especially during the summer.

Homes and businesses who contribute energy to the grid via VPPs will be paid for their energy. The law also mandates that electric utilities offer optional “time-of-use” pricing, allowing customers to save money by using less energy during periods of high demand.

ComEd already offers time-of-use pricing, as approved in an ICC ruling in January 2025, but CRGA enshrines the requirement for both Ameren and ComEd into law.

Path to passage

The legislation passed during the legislature’s veto session in late October with support from environmental, labor and utility oversight advocates. Business groups and Republicans criticized the bill for its reliance on a new ratepayer charge to fund new battery storage and for yielding what they said was too much power to the ICC.

“Senate Bill 25 is a guaranteed rate increase that does nothing to increase energy production,” Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said in a statement released after the signing, calling battery storage an “unproven” strategy.

Rep. Norine Hammond, R-Macomb, also denounced energy sources like wind and solar as unreliable in a statement, saying that the state “should focus on preserving reliable energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear power that actually work when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”

Supporters, though, say that ratepayer charges will be offset with savings from increased energy supply and grid reliability. They argue the investment in battery systems allows the state to store extra energy generated on bright sunny days or windy days and deploy it at night and when other energy supply is low.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of Citizens Utility Board and champion of the bill, said CRJA was the state’s response to market signals sent by regional grid operators.

“To me, CRGA is really about us here in Illinois, together as a state, deploying the tools we have here at our disposal to defend the promise of clean and affordable power for Illinois,” Moskowitz said.

Organized labor advocates also supported the bill, which is expected to generate up to 100,000 jobs according to statements from multiple House Democrats. AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Pat Devaney and LiveWire Construction CEO Shon Harris joined Pritzker on stage at the signing ceremony.

“By expanding access to pre-apprentice programs, lowering thresholds for project labor agreements, ensuring that wind, solar and thermal energy projects are built by skilled Illinois workers, this bill clearly says the future of clean energy in Illinois will be union built,” Devaney said.

The bill prioritizes grants to historically underserved contractors and projects in communities that would most benefit from investments to combat discrimination. Harris said that legislation keeps the doors open for businesses like his.

“CRGA ensures equity remains a part of Illinois’ clean energy future,” Harris said. “That means that companies like mine can keep building projects, training workers and creating good-paying jobs all across Illinois.”",https://i0.wp.com/capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BATTERY-STORAGE-AA.jpg?fit=1140%2C712&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-08 19:59:37.578585

International Motors detailed plans for its upcoming S13 integrated powertrain designed to comply with Environmental Protection Agency emissions requirements for 2027 model-year trucks, a deadline it and other manufacturers must hit despite some uncertainty surrounding details on the final rule.

“We are marching forward as though this emissions regulation lands at the beginning of 2027,” Dan Kayser, executive vice president of commercial operations at International, said during a Jan. 7 media roundtable. “We haven’t altered our plans there at all. We’re marching [on] as though this happens January of 2027. We have no reason to believe that won’t be the case.”

American Trucking Associations in August 2025 asked EPA to delay by four years implementation of the rules’ stricter nitrogen oxide limits, citing “substantial compliance costs and operational burdens at a time when the trucking industry is already contending with historically difficult market conditions.” The federation in November notified members that EPA had rejected that request, but said the agency through an ongoing rulemaking may make other adjustments. Among them are the possible elimination of extended warranty periods set to take effect in 2027, along with revisions to “useful life standards” and other technical changes.

Lingering uncertainty over the rule’s future driven by EPA statements from March 2025 about stalling certain pending regulations compelled Cummins in August to delay the launch of its 2027-compliant X15 diesel engine.

EPA told ATA it will leave in place a Biden-era requirement that NOx emissions for heavy-duty trucks drop to 35 milligrams per horsepower-hour from 200 mg/horsepower-hour. The agency is expected to publish an updated rule in March or April.

Availability for the updated S13 powertrain is likely a few months away, Kayser said.

“My best estimate is probably mid-2026 as a rough estimate, but it’s just a rough estimate at this point in time as to what I would expect,” he told Transport Topics. A full understanding of the regulations is needed before the order book opens, and the same is true for pricing, he noted.

“There are costs associated with the new emission standard that aren’t just the products — they’re useful life, warranty, and so forth and so on,” Kayser said. “We don’t have great clarity yet on those pieces, which makes it a little bit hard to really lean in.”

Analysts and OEMs had expected a robust so-called “pre-buy” of 2025 and 2026 model-year trucks from fleets in the lead-up to the 2027 rules, but a persistently weak freight market has kept customers on the sidelines.

Powertrain Enhancements

The S13 integrated powertrain was initially launched in August 2022.

Enhancements for the updated powertrain include:

Variable valve timing for the S13 engine, enabling variable valve braking for improved braking performance.

A 24-volt transmission control module for the T14 transmission with predictive shifting using GPS/topography data.

A standardized 24-volt electrical architecture across the powertrain platform, which can enhance cold-crank performance. A 12-volt cab and chassis electrical system is retained.

“[Exhaust gas recirculation] is fully eliminated,” said International VP of Integrated Sales David Hillman. “The compression release brake performance is going to be noticeably better because of the variable valve technology that we’re bringing to the market. The transmission gets the benefit of even faster and smoother shifts with the electronic clutch actuator because we’re running on 24 volts.”

Kayser noted that service training at dealers will begin in late 2026. “We’ve been preparing for EPA 2027 for years. Our customers won’t face surprises, only the same proven powertrain,” he said in a statement.

Kayser noted that the engine upgrades are part of wider changes at International. The company unveiled a revamp of its HV series of vocational Class 8 trucks in September 2024.

Kayser stressed that the market outlook for trucks with the new powertrain remains murky.

“The market’s still very weak, and we expect ’26 to at least start out in a fairly weak position, and then we’ll see where it goes,” he said. “It’s very hard right now to predict what order intake will be. It’s been quite hard throughout 2025.”

He noted, however, that December showed some hopeful signs.

“December was certainly, from a historic perspective, strong,” Kayser said. “We think that a little bit of further clarification on sort of tariff impacts and [possibly] allowed people to think a little bit more openly about releasing [capital expenditures] now. The big question is: Is this a blip on the radar screen? In January, I’m going to be looking with a very close set of eyes to see if we see any carryover.”

December’s preliminary North America Class 8 net orders totaled 42,700 units, a jump of 16% year over year, according to ACT Research data released Jan. 5.

In contrast, November orders slumped 47% year on year to 19,700, ACT said. The 10-year average for the month is 28,910, according to FTR Transportation Intelligence.

Leaders from around the world say the United States will be left behind as more than 190 other nations join in what they call a blossoming green economy that is transitioning from polluting coal, oil and gas to cleaner and cheaper solar, wind and other renewable energies.

Wednesday’s action starts the process to pull the U.S. out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It’s the main way nations negotiate, monitor and enforce agreements to curb worsening climate change, and is a bigger step than Trump’s 2017 and 2025 withdrawals from the bedrock 2015 Paris Agreement aimed at limiting warming.

The framework was negotiated in Brazil in 1992, championed by Republican U.S. President George H.W. Bush and ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate. It’s what Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden used to justify signing and reactivating the Paris deal without needing Senate approval. The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.

“It is a more serious step definitely. The world loses a lot and it is very damaging,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change. So, yes, in that sense, it’s more fundamental and more damaging” than earlier efforts.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in announcing the U.S. withdrawal, said the Trump administration “has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.”

Since 1850, the United States has put more than 480 billion tons (440 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That accounts for nearly one-quarter of the world’s historic emissions of a gas that stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, according to the scientists at the Global Carbon Project.

Emissions keep rising despite Paris agreement

Under the Paris agreement, countries voluntarily pledge to curb emissions by various amounts, but each year global emissions continue to rise. The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.

“It will mean more warming because the U.S. is not going to be fulfilling its obligations of reducing their emissions,” said Adelle Thomas, climate adaptation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and also a vice chair of the U.N. climate science panel that Trump is quitting.

And it comes at a critical time as Earth is approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the internationally agreed warming threshold established in Paris, Thomas and Rockstrom said.

“We need to start reducing emissions globally by 5% per year,” Rockstrom said. “It’s our last chance. And exactly at that moment, the biggest player in the world steps out of the game.”

The world is perilously close to several “tipping points’ of irreversible change, such as coral reef loss, said former Ireland president Mary Robinson, a tireless climate change advocate for the group of retired leaders called The Elders.

”We really have no time and it is so unbelievably stupid at one level and reckless for the Trump administration to be taking the steps that they are taking,” she said.

Another step in U.S. shift away from leading on climate

In past international climate negotiations, especially when Democrat John Kerry was secretary of state or America’s top climate envoy, the United States kept oil countries, such as Saudi Arabia, from watering down deals too much, experts said. But that was missing last November in Brazil’s negotiations, which the U.S. skipped under Trump.

Kerry called Trump’s action “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which represents industries that emit much of the heat-trapping gases, said “removing the U.S. from the U.N. climate framework will accelerate a positive shift towards abandoning the destructive global climate framework.”

Thomas, Rockstrom and Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped fashion the Paris agreement, said the United States is leaving itself behind in a new, cleaner world of cheaper energy and more jobs.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Trump’s move will hurt the U.S.

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year,” he said.

Some environmental advocates have feared that future presidents won’t be able to easily reinstate the U.S. to the climate convention in an era when Senate approval would likely be far harder.

But Sue Biniaz, a former State Department lawyer and deputy chief negotiator who now teaches at Yale, said the next president would have the power to undo Trump’s action.

“I wouldn’t want to say any sort of damaging action or inaction is irreversible,” Biniaz said. “I imagine a future U.S. government would work with other countries to revive as much as possible. We did that in 2021 after the first Trump administration.’’

Leaders from around the world say the United States will be left behind as more than 190 other nations join in what they call a blossoming green economy that is transitioning from polluting coal, oil and gas to cleaner and cheaper solar, wind and other renewable energies.

Wednesday’s action starts the process to pull the U.S. out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It’s the main way nations negotiate, monitor and enforce agreements to curb worsening climate change, and is a bigger step than Trump’s 2017 and 2025 withdrawals from the bedrock 2015 Paris Agreement aimed at limiting warming.

The framework was negotiated in Brazil in 1992, championed by Republican U.S. President George H.W. Bush and ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate. It’s what Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden used to justify signing and reactivating the Paris deal without needing Senate approval. The Trump administration also withdrew Wednesday from a United Nations climate science panel, a biodiversity-saving effort and the Green Climate Fund to help poor nations as well as many other international collaborations.

“It is a more serious step definitely. The world loses a lot and it is very damaging,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “The U.S. turns its back against science, against global collaboration, against any kind of action on climate change. So, yes, in that sense, it’s more fundamental and more damaging” than earlier efforts.

“This is the gateway to the preeminent international forum for combatting climate change,” said University of Pennsylvania law professor Jean Galbraith, an expert on international treaties.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in announcing the U.S. withdrawal, said the Trump administration “has found these institutions to be redundant in their scope, mismanaged, unnecessary, wasteful, poorly run, captured by the interests of actors advancing their own agendas contrary to our own, or a threat to our nation’s sovereignty, freedoms, and general prosperity.”

Since 1850, the United States has put more than 480 billion tons (440 billion metric tons) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air through the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. That accounts for nearly one-quarter of the world’s historic emissions of a gas that stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, according to the scientists at the Global Carbon Project.

Emissions keep rising despite Paris agreement

Under the Paris agreement, countries voluntarily pledge to curb emissions by various amounts, but each year global emissions continue to rise. The United States, under the Biden administration, had promised to cut its emissions by 61% to 66% by 2035.

“It will mean more warming because the U.S. is not going to be fulfilling its obligations of reducing their emissions,” said Adelle Thomas, climate adaptation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council and also a vice chair of the U.N. climate science panel that Trump is quitting.

And it comes at a critical time as Earth is approaching 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times — the internationally agreed warming threshold established in Paris, Thomas and Rockstrom said.

“We need to start reducing emissions globally by 5% per year,” Rockstrom said. “It’s our last chance. And exactly at that moment, the biggest player in the world steps out of the game.”

The world is perilously close to several “tipping points’ of irreversible change, such as coral reef loss, said former Ireland president Mary Robinson, a tireless climate change advocate for the group of retired leaders called The Elders.

”We really have no time and it is so unbelievably stupid at one level and reckless for the Trump administration to be taking the steps that they are taking,” she said.

Another step in U.S. shift away from leading on climate

In past international climate negotiations, especially when Democrat John Kerry was secretary of state or America’s top climate envoy, the United States kept oil countries, such as Saudi Arabia, from watering down deals too much, experts said. But that was missing last November in Brazil’s negotiations, which the U.S. skipped under Trump.

Kerry called Trump’s action “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, which represents industries that emit much of the heat-trapping gases, said “removing the U.S. from the U.N. climate framework will accelerate a positive shift towards abandoning the destructive global climate framework.”

Thomas, Rockstrom and Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who helped fashion the Paris agreement, said the United States is leaving itself behind in a new, cleaner world of cheaper energy and more jobs.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said Trump’s move will hurt the U.S.

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year,” he said.

Some environmental advocates have feared that future presidents won’t be able to easily reinstate the U.S. to the climate convention in an era when Senate approval would likely be far harder.

But Sue Biniaz, a former State Department lawyer and deputy chief negotiator who now teaches at Yale, said the next president would have the power to undo Trump’s action.

“I wouldn’t want to say any sort of damaging action or inaction is irreversible,” Biniaz said. “I imagine a future U.S. government would work with other countries to revive as much as possible. We did that in 2021 after the first Trump administration.’’

“I am glad that this legislative package includes the funding I requested to improve marine research and community safety in Whatcom County,” said Rep. Larsen. “Today my colleagues and I voted to continue funding that protects the environment, grows local economies and supports law enforcement, despite the President’s best efforts to defund these priorities. I will keep working closely with Northwest Washington leaders to bring home federal dollars that improve the communities I represent.”

Larsen’s Requested Funding for Local Projects Included

Last year, Rep. Larsen requested $1.6 million for two Whatcom County community projects. Funding for those projects is included in the FY26 spending package.

$1,031,000 for Western Washington University’s (WWU) Shannon Point Marine Center Research Vessel: This funding will support acquisition of a new research vessel for WWU marine and coastal science educational and research activities.

$600,000 for Whatcom County Sheriff Office’s Portable Radio Replacement Project: This funding will support the purchase of new portable radios to replace outdated radios that are failing, allowing deputies to communicate clearly with dispatch and each other.

“Congressional support from Representative Rick Larsen for a new research vessel at Western Washington University’s Shannon Point Marine Center is a vital investment in the Salish Sea,” said WWU President Sabah Randhawa. “This vessel will expand hands-on learning for students, create new research opportunities for faculty, and strengthen partnerships with Tribal nations and state agencies advancing critical research and restoration in the North Puget Sound. We are deeply grateful to Representative Larsen for his leadership and support.”

Larsen Priorities for Environment, Economic Development, Law Enforcement Included

The final package also provides funding for several Northwest Washington priorities, including:

$65 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, which supports state and Tribal habitat restoration projects to reverse the decline of Pacific salmon and steelhead and support conservation efforts in Washington and the Pacific Northwest.

$1.285 million for Washington’s Regional Fisheries, restoring funding the Administration refused to allocate in Fiscal Year 2025. In August, Rep. Larsen and Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) led Washington state’s Democratic Congressional delegation in sending a letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urging him to reverse the Trump administration’s disastrous decision to eliminate funding for Regional Fisheries Enhancement Groups (RFEGs).

$40 million for the National Estuary Program (NEP), which is a non-regulatory program that supports locally driven efforts to restore and protect the environmental and economic health of 28 estuaries of national significance, including Puget Sound. In June, Rep. Larsen introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the NEP through 2031.

$56 million for EPA’s Puget Sound Geographic Program, which supports restoration and research projects.

$3.473 billion for Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund projects, which will help support ports in the Puget Sound region.

$1 million to establish a new Northwest Regional Commission that will coordinate economic development opportunities in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.

$329 million for the Weatherization Assistance Program that helps families reduce home energy bills.

$964 million for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program, which provides funding for regional drug task forces that help Washington state communities fight the opioid epidemic.

$800 million for Community Oriented Policing Services Grants, which awards funds to hire community policing professionals, develop and test innovative policing strategies, and provide training and technical assistance to community members, local government leaders, and all levels of law enforcement.

Accessing energy is essential for the Reserve’s resilience, and Pitts plays a major role in ensuring the Reserve’s energy resilience.
Melissa Johnson, REM program manager said Pitts’ position is unique to the REM program.
“She is the Army Reserve go-to person, central point to all USAR, to assist within Enterprise Building Control System (EBCS), Facility Related Control Systems (FRCS) and the Reserve Army Metering Program,” Johnson said.
“Army Reserve Centers are located across a wide geographic footprint, and some sites are located in more remote or out-of-the-way locations,” Pitts said.","REDSTONE ARSENAL, Ala. –Maintaining and documenting numbers for Army Reserve’s growing network of automated, data-driven facilities is a daunting mission.

A contractor serving as a resource efficiency manager (REM) under the U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville’s Energy Division is turning that mission into reality.

Alexandra Pitts, a Lindahl Reed, Inc. contractor working under the management of the Center’s REM Program, is the technical link powering the Reserve’s unified energy control system.

Energy data collection and facility automation are becoming essential to military readiness, and the Army Reserve’s digital modernization efforts are bringing thousands of facilities together under one secure, unified system.

With over 200 thousand Soldiers and Civilian employees operating within more than 40 million square feet of building space spread across the nation, the Army Reserve is a major energy consumer. Accessing energy is essential for the Reserve’s resilience, and Pitts plays a major role in ensuring the Reserve’s energy resilience.

Prior to entering the federal facilities sector, Pitts worked with a residential heating and air conditioning company, where she gained early exposure to HVAC systems, field operations, and the importance of efficiency and proper system performance.

That experience helped build a practical foundation that later supported her transition into the commercial and federal facilities environment.

In 2011 Pitts began working with Johnson Controls Federal Systems as part of the integration team embedded into the Directorate of Public Works at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She worked closely with project teams and government personnel to help organize workflows, documentation, and coordination for building integration projects as they were brought online. As the program expanded, Pitts’ role evolved into a project coordination position supporting building automation and integration projects across multiple facilities.

Following a reduction in force at Johnson Controls in 2018, Pitts took the opportunity to formalize and expand my technical background. Within weeks, she began the process of returning to school (her academic background was originally in speech pathology) and was accepted into Bismarck State College’s National Energy Center of Excellence within the Energy Management program.

She enrolled in early 2019 and focused on coursework related to energy efficiency, building systems, utilities and facility optimization and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in energy management, in 2020.

Melissa Johnson, REM program manager said Pitts’ position is unique to the REM program.

“She doesn't have the normal REM focus, nor does she cover one garrison or even a region; she is the REM for all of Army Reserve locations,” Johnson said.

Johnson said Pitts’ experience and knowledge with controls systems and troubleshooting issues is valuable USAR installations to have properly running systems, which allows them to have accurate system controls and reporting building information.

“She is the Army Reserve go-to person, central point to all USAR, to assist within Enterprise Building Control System (EBCS), Facility Related Control Systems (FRCS) and the Reserve Army Metering Program,” Johnson said.

“She came onboard with Huntsville Center in 2024 and is exactly what we are looking for in the REM program.”

Pitts currently supports the Army Reserve’s EBCS program by helping simplify and improve how facilities manage their energy use across widely scattered locations.

Her role involves coordinating and implementing JACE software updates, module installations, ensuring the devices are functional, compliant, and reporting properly within the EBCS platform to support secure remote monitoring and enhanced operational visibility.

Coordinating software updates, installing new system components, and making sure the equipment in each building operates correctly, meets program standards, and sends accurate information into the EBCS platform, her work ensures secure remote monitoring and gives Army Reserve leadership clearer insight into how their facilities are performing.

“I serve as a technical liaison between USARC Headquarters and the Readiness Division REMs, helping ensure consistent EBCS implementation across all divisions,” Pitts said.

As part of her fieldwork, Pitts often conducts site visits to Army Reserve centers across multiple Readiness Divisions depending on project needs or field-level troubleshooting requests related to the JACEs.

Travel is a regular part of Pitts’ role as an REM. Under normal circumstances, Pitts said site visits are typically planned every couple of months as needed, depending on system conditions, project activity, and facility support requirements.

“Army Reserve Centers are located across a wide geographic footprint, and some sites are located in more remote or out-of-the-way locations,” Pitts said.

“While my travel to date has been within the continental United States, the dispersed nature of Reserve facilities requires coordination across regions and locations.”

These visits involve general facility walkthroughs to assess the presence, status, and connectivity of JACE devices and utility meters, including water, gas, and electric, within the EBCS framework.

Pitts said coordinating travel to Reserve Centers isn’t nearly as difficult as the coordination required managing the complexity that comes with supporting buildings when there are many moving parts involved.

She said working with multiple stakeholders, including different contractors, technical teams, and local site personnel, is often quite complex.

“These groups often operate with different processes, timelines, and levels of system familiarity,” she said.

“Ensuring everyone is aligned and informed before work is performed is critical, since even well-intended changes can unintentionally impact other efforts if communication is not properly coordinated.”

Pitts said maintaining clear points of contact, understanding site-specific conditions, and ensuring that work is properly sequenced helps prevent duplication or conflicting changes.

Bridging those gaps, Pitts said, keeps efforts aligned across locations is a key challenge, but an important one.

“The most gratifying aspect of the work is seeing those efforts come together successfully,” Pitts said.

When Pitts is in the field, a lot of her focus is on ensuring the JACE is properly installed, physically connected, and actively communicating with the building’s control system so data can be transmitted to the centralized EBCS platform.

Pitts also verifies whether meters are present and correctly wired into the system.

If meters are missing or not visibly located, she documents those findings so they can be flagged for follow-up or considered for inclusion in future integration projects.

Pitts also supports troubleshooting efforts for energy managers and HVAC teams by assisting with JACE connectivity issues, offline devices, platform/station access, and verifying proper communication between JACEs and the EBCS system.

(NYSE: TPR), a global house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands uniting the magic of Coach and Kate Spade, are celebrating a milestone in their partnership. Today, Pivot announced the completion of three Illinois community solar projects, totaling 13.475 megawatts (MWac).

The Projects

The three new Illinois community solar projects – financed, developed, owned, and operated by Pivot – are in Peoria, Dover, and Ottawa. They are the first of five Pivot community solar projects to be developed and completed in Illinois and part of a 15-year agreement with Tapestry, which is purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) from Pivot, produced by the projects. Collectively, the solar projects are expected to generate more than 23,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy per year, the equivalent of powering approximately 2,500 Illinois households annually. Construction for the two remaining solar projects in the Illinois portfolio is expected to finish by 2030.

Community Impact Investment Commitments

Pivot Energy is dedicated to investing in the communities where its projects operate. Across the five projects in this partnership, they plan to contribute more than $115,000 to support local initiatives. To date, nearly $65,000 has already been donated to two Illinois organizations, Illinois Central College (ICC) and HIRE360, to fund workforce training programs that expand access to solar careers across the state. The remaining funds will be donated in the coming years as the other two projects reach key construction milestones.

Companies request CBI claims as to proprietary information or knowledge – such as manufacturing processes and chemical formulas – that could give competitors an advantage if gone unprotected. This expiration date was set in 2016 under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which amended and modernized the TSCA, a mechanism by which the EPA can collect a variety of information relating to health and chemical safety, some of which falls under the CBI qualification.

To account for this need for confidentiality while still achieving one of the primary aims of the Lautenberg Act – increasing public transparency concerning chemical information that could potentially affect Americans’ health and safety – Congress amended the TSCA to, for the first time, have CBI claims expire while still enabling stakeholders to submit CBI claims to the EPA without fear the agency would publicly release the protected information, as it is now legally prohibited from doing. Most CBI claims expire about a decade following their submission.

The expiring CBI claims that are the focus of this week’s announcement were submitted by companies right after the TSCA was amended via the Lautenberg Act in June 2016 and therefore will expire this June.

The EV fee hikes are expected to generate about $12 million a year in new revenue — a small fraction of the larger road funding deal signed into law by Gov.
The nonprofit Ecology Center estimates that Michigan EV owners were already paying about $20 more than gas-powered vehicle owners annually in transportation-related taxes.
“This deal, one that many said couldn’t be done, repairs our local roads and gives stability to road funding for the future.
“We’ve continued to hear over decades that road funding is a major priority for the Legislature,” Binoniemi said.","Michigan’s roughly 122,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle owners are in for some sticker shock the next time they renew their plates.

Their annual vehicle registration fees have skyrocketed to the nation’s highest in 2026, the result of a road funding package passed last fall that had little financial impact on gas-powered vehicle owners.

While critics of the EV fee hike call it an unfair tax on a user group that’s already paying more to maintain Michigan’s roughly 120,000 miles of paved public roadways, proponents contend it fairly charges EV drivers for their use of the roads.

“The goal was not to nick or punish anyone. We don’t want an undue burden on anybody,” state Rep. Tom Kunse, R-Clare, told Bridge Michigan on Tuesday. “But, if we look at the math, I think it’s right where it should be.”

Under the formula triggered by last year’s road funding deal, annual registration fees for light-duty EVs are increasing from $160 to $267, while plug-in hybrid fees are going from $60 to $113. That’s on top of the state’s base registration fees, which apply to all vehicles and vary depending on the vehicle’s value.

The fee hike makes Michigan the most expensive among 40 states that charge a special EV registration fee, according to nationaldatabases maintained by the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Tax Foundation. Hawaii and South Dakota have the lowest fees at $50 per vehicle, while the national average is a little over $100.

“The thinking in the EV community is that this is way beyond what EV drivers should be made to pay,” said Karl Bloss, a longtime EV owner in Muskegon.

But efforts to undo the change are unlikely to gain traction in the Legislature.

How we got here

Like other states, Michigan has long used gas taxes and vehicle registration fees to fund its road system. But lawmakers and advocates have long complained that it’s not generating enough money, leaving Michigan with among the most pothole-riddled roads in the nation.

Last fall, lawmakers struck a funding deal that is expected to eventually generate more than $1.8 billion a year for roads, including about $1 billion this fiscal year. The deal relies in part on abolishing Michigan’s 6% sales tax on gas – which funds things other than roads – while raising Michigan’s fuel tax from 31 cents to 52.4 cents a gallon.

While internal combustion engine drivers will see virtually no change in their price at the pump, the newly enacted plan triggered a 2015 law that ties EV registration fees to the cost of the gas tax, resulting in the spike in EV fees.

Michigan lawmakers in 2015 authorized a special registration surcharge for EVs and plug-in hybrids that took effect in 2017. It’s meant to ensure EV drivers help pay for road upkeep despite the fact that they don’t buy gas.

The law triggers an increase of $5 for EVs and $2.50 for hybrids for every cent that Michigan’s gas tax rises above 19 cents.

The EV fee hikes are expected to generate about $12 million a year in new revenue — a small fraction of the larger road funding deal signed into law by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer that also includes more than $400 million a year from a new wholesale marijuana tax.

But EV advocates are crying foul, arguing the fee hike is unfair. The nonprofit Ecology Center estimates that Michigan EV owners were already paying about $20 more than gas-powered vehicle owners annually in transportation-related taxes.

Proponents of the fee hike dispute that math.

“We still don’t even think, with this increase, that they’re still paying their fair share,” said Lance Binoniemi, vice president of government affairs for the Michigan Infrastructure & Transportation Association.

What next?

Sen. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, last fall proposed a bill aiming to lessen the blow to EV drivers by lowering the fee increase to a respective $1.88 and 94 cents for every penny increase to the gas tax.

That would have meant a $63 fee hike for EV owners this year, as opposed to $107 under the enacted road funding deal, and a $32 fee hike for plug-in hybrid owners, down from $53.

The Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing on the bill in November but did not vote on it. Even if approved by the full Senate this year, House Speaker Matt Hall has made clear he does not plan to take up the EV fee reduction proposal.

“I negotiated this historic roads deal with the governor, and the Legislature, including Senator Singh, voted for it,” Hall, R-Richland Township, said Tuesday in a statement provided to Bridge. “This deal, one that many said couldn’t be done, repairs our local roads and gives stability to road funding for the future. His bill would be going back on the deal we all agreed to, and that’s not how deals work.”

Singh, however, said this week he thinks EV fees are still a topic worth discussing, noting that lawmakers stressed throughout the road funding conversation that any change to sales tax at the pump would be revenue neutral for drivers.

“We had obviously tried to bring the issue up during negotiations,” he said, referring to his own legislation. “I think, unfortunately, there were so many moving pieces that this is one of the pieces that got left behind.”

Although the road funding deal represents an historic investment in Michigan’s roads, some say it’s still not enough to fix them.

Michigan has the 40th worst-maintained roads in the nation, according to the nonprofit Citizens Research Council. Initial plans from both Whitmer and House Republicans had called for about $3 billion a year to fix them. The road-building lobby, meanwhile, contends Michigan needs $3.9 billion more a year.

“We’ve continued to hear over decades that road funding is a major priority for the Legislature,” Binoniemi said. “We’ve heard many different legislatures say that, but we’ve never come up with a full, long-term, sustainable solution that actually solves the problem.”

Long-term, both EV and infrastructure advocates say they want a more equitable road funding formula that charges drivers based on road usage, rather than the type of vehicle they drive.

“To be clear, there needed to be a road funding fix,” said Sophia Schuster, policy principal with the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, but the end result of this one is “not fair.”

Last year, lawmakers directed the Michigan Department of Transportation to study the concept of a usage charge in order to ensure stable road funding as more fuel-efficient vehicles and EVs cut into gas tax revenue.

Other states such as Oregon and Utah have experimented with a mileage tax, but critics have raised privacy concerns about GPS data collection devices used to track miles driven.

A flurry of changes for EV drivers

Bloss, the EV driver from Muskegon, predicted the fee hike won’t drive any EV owners back into gas cars. But it might prompt EV-curious buyers to stick with gas for a little longer.

From his perspective, the benefits of EV ownership still outweigh the costs. Refueling his EV costs less than half the price-per-mile of gas, he has no need for scheduled oil changes or belt replacements, and with at-home charging, “I never have to stand in the slush and fill up my car in the middle of a blizzard.”

The state fee hike for EV owners joins a flurry of other recent policy changes that have made EV ownership more expensive, contributing to lackluster EV adoption.

EVs account for 1.3% of the roughly 8 million vehicle registrations in Michigan, according to the Department of State. That’s below the national average of about 2%.

While the 102,549 EVs registered in Michigan today represent a marked increase from 20,000 in 2022, the state is not on pace to meet Whitmer’s goal of putting 2 million EVs on Michigan roads by 2030. There are another 19,226 plug-in hybrids registered in the state, according to Secretary of State data.

Whitmer’s office declined to comment on the new EV registration fee hike.

Beyond the state fee increase, President Donald Trump has canceled the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV purchases put in place by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, revoked grants and incentives for EV manufacturing and delayed disbursements from a multi-billion-dollar fund for EV charging stations along the nation’s major highways.

Those policy shifts are expected to slow consumer uptake of EVs. Indeed, both Ford Motor Co. and General Motors have downscaled their EV ambitions in the past year and reprioritized gas and hybrid manufacturing. Experts have said they expect the EV transition to continue, albeit more slowly, as buyers are drawn to the anticipated release of cheaper EV models that, when combined with lower maintenance and fueling costs, are expected to make EVs more affordable than gas-powered cars.

DETROIT, Jan 8 (Reuters) – General Motors said on Thursday it would take a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, the latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration’s policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in ‍a regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM’s writedown – a $4.2 billion cash charge – is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, who had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” it said in its filing.

The company will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges in 2026 ‌as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but expects them to be less than its 2025 ‌EV charges.

GM PLACED A BIG BET ON EVs

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on September 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as ​it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion ‍cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 ​goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the U.S., GM’s ​largest and most profitable market. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in ‍late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla.

The company also said on Thursday that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away ‍from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

EV SALES ARE DOWN INDUSTRYWIDE

GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter after the loss of the consumer tax credit. Sales hit record highs ‍in the previous three months, when customers rushed to ‍buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous ​year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

Automotive data provider Edmunds ​expects EVs ⁠to account for about 6% of overall U.S. vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025.

Ford’s ‌shift, in which it essentially killed off its entire planned second generation of EVs, resulted in a much higher charge. Ford CEO Jim Farley said it was a painful but necessary move as the market cooled.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Farley told Reuters in a December interview.

Ford is now setting its EV hopes on a brand-new architecture that will enable the production of affordable models, starting with a $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.

Scripps News Group Business and Tech Correspondent Maura Barrett met Lee on Lake Mead, about 30 minutes away from the hectic CES show floor, for the chance to test drive their new all-electric sport boat.

Despite skepticism from the current administration about investing in electric technology, Lee said his boat is a direct competitor to other premium sport boats, using a lot of the same tech found in electric vehicles, regardless of rolled-back incentives.

When asked about the president's comments regarding electric batteries and water, Lee addressed safety concerns directly.

""We can charge cars faster, faster than anything else on the market, but we don't put any extra stress on the grid. We can grow that infrastructure right now, we do not need to wait for the grid to catch up,"" said Leonardo Mattiazzi, president of Electric Fish.

When asked about the whiplash in electric vehicle investments, Mattiazzi acknowledged the challenges while remaining optimistic.

""It is kind of sad that this is happening, but carmakers are going to progressively decrease the cost of EVs, and we actually remove a lot of stress from the grid,"" Mattiazzi said.

Motor City, the former automotive center of Detroit, is the first place in the nation to roll out a public EV-charging road. The road charges electric vehicles wirelessly as the drive along it.

The EV-charging road is one mile long and comes from the Michigan Department of Transportation, while the tech comes from Electreon. It includes copper coils a few inches below the pavement that provide the opportunity for inductive charging. Of course, the electric vehicles also need components to allow wireless EV charging. They need a certain receiver plate onboard.

The charging capacity of the road is 15–16 kW. That’s not going to pump a lot of electricity into your car driving just a mile over the road. However, if this charging solution was implemented broadly around a city, it would provide enough electricity for most drivers to cover a huge portion of their charging needs, if not all of them.

I saw a headline about this EV road last month implying that it had just gone live, which confused me, because I thought we had written about it going live a long time ago. Well, we had. This road become operational in 2023.

“In February 2022, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, in coordination with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification (OFME) and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), announced that Electreon had won a tender to deploy a 1 mile (1.61 km) wireless Electric Road System in downtown Detroit, Michigan as part of Michigan Central Station, a new mobility innovation hub being developed in partnership with Ford, the city of Detroit, and the state of Michigan. The project will serve as North America’s first public Electric Road System for wireless charging of electric vehicles, and will also include static (stationary) wireless charge points as well,” Electroen writes.

“In addition to market entry into the U.S., the primary goals of the pilot will be to showcase the viability and effectiveness of wireless dynamic charging on public roads for multiple vehicle types and use cases in a real-world scenario — such as, but not limited to, transit buses, passenger shuttles, and last-mile delivery trucks. The pilot will also serve as a potential first step towards much larger Electric Road Systems being considered in multiple U.S. states and aims to build partnerships with U.S. based vehicle and infrastructure companies in order to serve as a blueprint for future collaboration and growth.”

Well, that’s great and all, but it’s 2026 now and I haven’t seen any news about another EV-charging road — public or private — coming to a town near you or me. Is the technology viable? Does it make enough sense when you pull out the spreadsheets and crunch the numbers, from any type of perspective — public or private?

Well, in September, Electreon signed a collaboration agreement with autonomous vehicle company ATLoS in Portugal, “starting with vehicles operating along fixed routes within manufacturing compounds, logistics hubs, and warehouse environments—key target sectors for both companies.” In October, Electreon launched another pilot induction charging system in France on a motorway. “The project is now entering a new phase, with prototype vehicles—including a heavy-duty truck, a utility vehicle, a passenger car, and a bus—driving on the motorway under real traffic conditions,” the company wrote. In November, we reported on Electreon acquiring another inductive charging company, InductEV, presumably to help it technologically and commercially in some way. The company wrote, “the combined company will unite Electreon’s stationary and dynamic wireless charging technology with InductEV’s ultra-fast static systems, creating a unified platform with a complete range of wireless charging solutions.”

Congresswoman Dina Titus of Nevada’s First Congressional District, a senior member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, announced securing $4.8 million dollars for local funding projects on behalf of Southern Nevada.

Washington, D.C. - Today, Congresswoman Dina Titus of Nevada’s First Congressional District, a senior member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, announced securing $4.8 million for community project funding on behalf of Southern Nevada. All five of Congresswoman Titus’s Community Funding Project requests received final passage as part of the Minibus bill to fund several federal government agencies for Fiscal Year 2026.

“This bipartisan appropriations agreement pushes back against Trump Administration cuts and makes investments in key priorities in Southern Nevada. This bill restores funding for the Bureau of Land Management and unlocks federal assistance for critical infrastructure improvements in Southern Nevada,” said Congresswoman Dina Titus. “I’m also pleased this spending package includes $4.8 million in funding for projects I proposed for District One. These projects will help Southern Nevada create jobs, improve our climate resiliency, support our law enforcement personnel, boost STEM education opportunities, and protect the health of our community.”

Projects Championed by Congresswoman Titus include:

$980,000 for Boulder City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant Upgrades. This funding will be used to expand the treatment capacity of existing wastewater facilities while improving their safety and reliability. This project will invest in the water security of the Boulder City community as well as all of Southern Nevada.

Over $1 million for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’s Instrumentation for Pathogen Detection in Water project. This funding will be used to purchase equipment to measure the levels of pathogens in water. The project will implement monitoring systems to detect illicit substances like fentanyl, track infectious diseases, deploy solar-powered technology to produce clean drinking water, and provide evidence-based strategies for enhancing health and water security throughout the state. Early detection of diseases like bird flu or mpox in wastewater will also enable rapid acquisition of vaccines and testing resources for at-risk communities.

$750,000 for the Henderson Police Department’s Crisis Negotiation Command Vehicle. This funding will be used to replace a two-decades old mobile command vehicle and upgrade associated technologies to deal with community crises. The new Crisis Negotiation Command Vehicle will function as the Henderson Police Department's primary mobile command vehicle and will be outfitted with the latest technology to serve the citizens of Henderson in emergency situations.

Over $1 million for the City of Henderson’s Last Warning Shot Initiative. This will implement a comprehensive anti-violence initiative focused on: improving training for police and prosecutors; providing qualified, consistent forensic examinations; and providing intervention services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. This will prevent homicides through the early detection of non-fatal strangulation incidents as well as timely and appropriate prosecution of domestic violence perpetrators. This project is meant to address domestic and sexual violence, which remains a major concern in Southern Nevada with the state ranking second in the nation for domestic violence. Currently, the region lacks the critical infrastructure to reduce these incidents and implement a fuller community effort.

Over $1 million for the Nevada System of Higher Education’s Mitigating Wildfire Smoke Impacts in Nevada Project. This will enable the Desert Research Institute to partner with NASA to utilize satellite technology combined with AI to mitigate risks associated with wildland fire smoke in Las Vegas and across Nevada. As wildland fires grow in frequency and severity, the dangers to public health and safety have increased exponentially. This project will work to better track, map, and forecast fires and smoke.

Rep. Titus also helped secure significant investments for our public lands and natural landscapes:

Rejects President Trump's proposed cuts to Bureau of Land Management: Secured $1.26 billion for the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Management of Lands and Resources and $59 million for BLM's National Conservation Lands, rejecting deep cuts to both accounts proposed in President Trump's budget request. Congresswoman Titus led an appropriations letter calling for robust funding for both accounts, which are vital to the management and protection of public lands.

Protecting Jobs: The bill includes guardrails to ensure that the BLM maintains staffing levels to protect natural and cultural resources, maintain safe and appropriate access and recreation, and consult with tribes. As a proud member of the House Labor Caucus, Congresswoman Titus has spoken out against efforts by the Trump Administration to lay off federal workers or coerce them into leaving public service.

And $1 million for the Invasive Species in Alpine Lakes Pilot Program. Congresswoman Titus led provisions to reauthorize this vital program as part of the Water Resources Development Act of 2024.

The legislation also addresses some of our nation’s biggest challenges:

Maintaining Fiscal Responsibility: Reasserts Congress’s power of the purse through mandatory staffing thresholds and notification requirements;

Keeping Energy Costs Down: Helps address higher energy costs and rising utility bills, increasing investment in electric grid infrastructure by $375 million;

Delivering Justice for Women and Girls: Helps keep our communities safe by increasing funding for Violence Against Women Act grants by $7 million;

Protecting our Water Resources: Invests in water infrastructure and climate resilience by increasing funding for the Army Corps of Engineers by $1.8 billion ($10.4 billion total);

Investing in Clean Energy: Provides $3.1 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy funding, repudiating the Trump administration’s crusade against clean energy;

Confronting the Climate Crisis: Protects the environment with $8.8 billion in EPA funding – nearly double the White House budget proposal;

Creating American Jobs: Puts more Americans to work in good-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure; helps small businesses grow and thrive; fosters the green energy jobs of tomorrow; and supports high-quality job training and apprenticeship programs so every American can contribute and succeed.",https://titus.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:02:01.735634

Central Ohio residents were already concerned about the rising amount of data centers. For one, they’re causing a constant noise in some people’s neighborhoods. Residents are also experiencing soaring electric and water bills, and many people that live close to data centers nationwide are reporting severe health complications.

As if those weren’t enough to worry about, now, a proposed Ohio Environmental Protection Agency permit would allow data centers to release wastewater into Ohio’s lakes and streams.

BROUGHT TO YOU BY

If this is approved, a five-year permit would allow certain data centers to release water used to cool down their technology and water from air compressor condensation and boiler blowdowns back into the state’s fresh water resources.

There are some limitations:

Data centers couldn’t discharge water that “exhibits the reasonable potential” to break Ohio’s minimum water quality standards

Any discharged water that isn’t up to public water supply standards couldn’t be discharged within 500 yards upstream from a public water supply intake.

Discharges can’t occur in a lake other than Lake Erie, or into groundwater supplies

Discharges cannot contain large traces of chemicals known as volatile organic compounds

In a statement, Ohio EPA said, “Ohio EPA does not allow discharges that harm aquatic life, recreation, or human health. Every permit includes strict limits and monitoring requirements to ensure water quality standards are met at the state and federal levels.” Even so, environmental groups, as well as citizens, are worried that water would be polluted throughout our state.

It comes on top of a $1.6 billion charge it disclosed in October for changes to its EV plans.

It’s another sign of the significant cost to traditional automakers after President Donald Trump ended federal policies that were intended to foster the adoption of zero emissions vehicles.

GM and other automakers invested heavily in EV plans in anticipation of stringent environmental regulations put in place during the Biden administration. They also expected some states to follow the lead of California and ban gas-powered vehicle sales within a decade. GM had previously announced a goal to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.

But the Trump administration has rolled back those emissions rules along with the financial support for EVs. It is also challenging the states’ authority to set their own tougher rules.

Electric cars aren’t going away entirely, however, as significant demand remains in the United States and demand continues to soar higher in other markets.

GM’s latest charge follows a Ford announcement in December that it would take a similar $19.5 billion charge against its earnings from its own change in EV plans.

GM did not announce that it would be discontinuing any particular electric cars at the moment, nor did it announce that it would be closing any factories or cutting any jobs. But it already announced in October that it would be eliminating one shift at its Factory Zero EV plant in Detroit, placing 1,200 hourly workers on indefinite layoff. It also placed 550 workers at an EV battery plant in Ohio on indefinite layoff as well.

Demand for electric vehicles surged through the summer and September due to the scheduled expiration of a $7,500 US tax credit for EV buyers. But US sales of electric models fell sharply across the industry in the fourth quarter, both compared to a year earlier as well as from the record third quarter.

GM CEO Mary Barra told investors in October that “electric vehicles remain our North Star,” but that it was now clear that sales of cars and trucks with traditional internal combustion engines “will remain higher for longer.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1236631485.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-08 17:01:36.635256

New requirements for utilities to consider upgrades to existing grid and transmission infrastructure that will allow it to operate more efficiently, providing more electricity without requiring expensive new power line construction;

New programs to expand energy storage and implement virtual power plants that tap into extra power from homes and businesses, ensuring electricity is available affordably when it’s needed most;

New and improved energy efficiency programs to help individual households and businesses lower their energy bills while also reducing overall strain on the electric grid;

New energy planning processes to prepare Illinois for future demand, including requiring utilities to align infrastructure planning with projected energy needs and support the growing adoption of electric vehicles and building electrification.

Charlie Jenkins, Chief Executive Officer

Port Houston

111 East Loop North

Houston, Texas 77029

Via email to cjenkins@porthouston.com.

CC: Maria Aguirre, maguirre@porthouston.com.

Dear Mr. Jenkins,

As elected officials representing communities and people living near the Houston Ship Channel, we write to ask you not to dump dredge material from the Houston Ship Channel Expansion Project 11 in our communities.

Members of the Healthy Port Communities Coalition (HPCC) recently learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) sought and received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to dump Project 11 dredge material in Galveston Bay. We understand that the Port of Houston Authority may be in a position to approve a plan for Project 11 that avoids dumping in the Glendale and Filterbed dredge material placement areas (DMPAs) in Pleasantville.

At the October 24 meeting of the Port Houston Commission, members of the HPCC spoke in favor of a plan to avoid dumping Project 11 dredge material in DMPAs located in communities. HPCC members and their representatives reiterated their specific concerns with the plan to dump Project 11 dredge material in communities.

Mr. Bill Empson, a retired geotechnical engineer from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Risk Management Center, spoke as a private consultant on behalf of the HPCC. Mr. Empson raised the following concerns:

The proposal to use existing dredge material to raise placement area berms, known as “upstream construction” which can also lead to berm failures and was banned in Brazil after multiple failures.

The proposed height of DMPAs qualifies them as dams that should comply with USACE dam safety regulations.

Upstream construction could lead to contaminated soils and offsite runoff.

DMPAs block natural drainage and could increase the risk of neighborhood flooding.

Dr. Paige Varner, a toxicological scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, also spoke at the Commission meeting. Dr. Varner asserted that testing from USACE and communities show that the material from both Project 11 dredging and ongoing maintenance dredging contains potentially hazardous concentrations of chemicals including dioxins, furans, PCBs, arsenic, and PAHs. Several samples taken from the dredge sites and the adjacent placement areas exceed EPA Regional Screening Levels. Dr. Varner also pointed out that the Pleasantville Community already faces some of the highest cancer and non-cancer health risks in the country from air pollution.

Several members of the HPCC, including Bridgette Murray with Achieving Community Tasks Successfully, Leticia Gutierrez with Air Alliance Houston, and Guadalupe Fernandez with Bayou City Waterkeeper, spoke as advocates and as residents of impacted communities. They asked Port Houston not to dump dredge material in their communities.

We write now with the same ask. Please support a plan for Project 11 that does not include the reopening of any DMPAs or the use of DMPAs in communities.

Brooks Landgraf and the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association say the situation compares poorly with Texas’ pro-energy environment.
California sued ExxonMobil and other companies in 2024 about the recyclability of plastics and now ExxonMobil has sued California, claiming the state’s new climate disclosure laws violate the First Amendment.
“Our state has encouraged advanced recycling, modern manufacturing and responsible energy development while enforcing clear, consistent environmental standards.
“As chair of the House Environmental Regulation Committee in Austin, I make sure California-style Green New Deal mandates stop cold before they ever take hold in Texas,” he said.
“In September 2024 California launched a highly publicized lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court, accusing ExxonMobil and others of misleading the public about plastic recyclability over decades,” Longanecker said from Austin.","There’s a legal war going on between the Houston-based ExxonMobil Corp. and the State of California and State Rep. Brooks Landgraf and the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association say the situation compares poorly with Texas’ pro-energy environment.

California sued ExxonMobil and other companies in 2024 about the recyclability of plastics and now ExxonMobil has sued California, claiming the state’s new climate disclosure laws violate the First Amendment.

“Texas delivers real results because we govern with common sense, not courtroom theater,” said Landgraf, an Odessa Republican. “Our state has encouraged advanced recycling, modern manufacturing and responsible energy development while enforcing clear, consistent environmental standards.

“That balanced approach, grounded in science, free enterprise and regulatory certainty, is why Texas leads the nation in energy production and continues to attract investment and jobs, especially in West Texas.”

By contrast, Landgraf said, California has turned environmental policy into a legal and ideological crusade.

“As chair of the House Environmental Regulation Committee in Austin, I make sure California-style Green New Deal mandates stop cold before they ever take hold in Texas,” he said. “Regardless of how those legal fights play out nationwide I will continue fighting to block any radical policies that would ever threaten the Texas Miracle.”

TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said the California standoff “is a clear case of politically motivated regulatory overreach targeting one of America’s most innovative energy companies.

“In September 2024 California launched a highly publicized lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court, accusing ExxonMobil and others of misleading the public about plastic recyclability over decades,” Longanecker said from Austin. “ExxonMobil has forcefully rejected these claims, emphasizing its pioneering role in advanced recycling technologies that have already diverted more than 120 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills and oceans, delivering real, scalable solutions that far outpace California’s rhetoric with actual results.

“ExxonMobil is defending its business against the California attorney general’s campaign of disparagement and defamation, suing him on Jan. 6, 2025, in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas along with the environmental activists who pushed his agenda.”

On Oct. 25, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, ExxonMobil also challenged California’s 2023 disclosure laws, Senate Bills 253 and 261, as blatant violations of the First Amendment, he noted.

“These mandates force large companies operating in the state to report Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and climate risks using frameworks that effectively compel the endorsement of California’s preferred narrative on climate change,” Longanecker said. “ExxonMobil correctly argues that this amounts to unconstitutional compelled speech, overriding the company’s own rigorous, voluntary reporting and clashing with established Supreme Court protections. “The company’s proactive leadership is further evidenced by its recent co-founding of the Carbon Measures coalition, which is developing superior market-driven carbon accounting standards that prioritize accuracy and practicality over ideological mandates.”

He said the national implications of these cases are substantial and TIPRO strongly supports ExxonMobil’s position.

“A victory in the climate disclosure case would help reinforce constitutional limits on state overreach, preventing a costly patchwork of disclosure rules that divert capital from productive innovation,” Longanecker said. “Such an outcome would protect investment across the sector and reinforce America’s energy dominance.

“Texas operators, already benefiting from a pro-innovation climate, would gain even greater advantage as capital continues to flow toward jurisdictions that reward results over excessive regulation or counterproductive litigation.”

He said ExxonMobil’s steadfast position exemplifies the industry’s commitment to delivering affordable, reliable energy and genuine environmental progress through American ingenuity.",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/040822_OilArt_05-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:01:53.693326

Spencer Cox signed a next-generation agreement that builds on a successful shared stewardship partnership. The agreement expands opportunities for timber production, new wood uses, restoring landscapes, and reducing wildfire risk to communities, ecosystems, and local economies across Utah.

“I applaud Gov. Cox for reaffirming the importance of our partnership and recommitting to ensuring healthy forests on public and private lands,” said Chief Schultz. “More importantly, our shared vision includes expansion of sustainable timber production, advancing wood utilization opportunities, accelerating landscape-scale restoration, and increasing the pace and scale of forest treatments to reduce the threat of catastrophic wildfires, while also seeking additional opportunities for cooperative management of other resources on National Forest System lands. It’s a win for people in Utah and across the nation.”

“Utah knows how to manage land well and has done so successfully, side-by-side with federal partners, for decades. This agreement doesn’t change who owns or controls national forests. It simply lets us work together more efficiently,” said Utah Gov. Spencer Cox. “This allows us to combine capacity, funding and expertise so we can quickly and more effectively care for our forests now and far into the future.”

The agreement follows similar agreements with Montana and Idaho. It also supports implementation of President Trump’s Executive Order 14225, Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production, and strengthens the 2004 Utah Good Neighbor Authority, which allows the Forest Service to authorize states, counties and federally recognized tribes to conduct certain projects on federally managed lands. Through the Good Neighbor Authority, the Forest Service and the state have reduced hazardous fuels and improved forest, rangeland and watershed health, including fish and wildlife habitat.

Agreements like these are essential to maintaining healthy landscapes, thriving rural economies, safer communities, and resilient infrastructure. USDA looks forward to working with all interested states, counties and federally recognized tribes to expand these efforts and deliver lasting benefits for our forests and rural communities.

capacity does not impact today’s retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac E.V.s in production,” G.M.","General Motors on Thursday became the latest automaker to announce a big loss from its investments in electric vehicles, as it reckoned with a slump in sales of those cars after Congress and President Trump overhauled federal policy to favor fossil fuels.

G.M., the largest U.S. carmaker, said it would record a $7.1 billion loss for the last quarter of 2025 primarily to reflect the diminished value of its investments in battery factories and electric vehicle assembly lines.

The loss also reflects compensation that G.M. will pay to suppliers for investments they made to produce components that the automaker no longer needs. About $1.1 billion of the total reflects the cost of restructuring G.M. operations in China that are not related to electric vehicles, the company said.

Policies put in place since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term have forced many carmakers to undertake costly changes. Ford Motor said last month that it would take a $19.5 billion hit to its profits related to its electrical vehicle business.

Electric cars have become more difficult to sell after federal tax credits that covered as much as $7,500 of the cost to buy or lease an electric vehicle were eliminated at the end of September. The Trump administration has also loosened environmental and fuel economy standards that had put pressure on carmakers to sell more electric vehicles, which have no tailpipe emissions.

“With the termination of certain consumer tax incentives and the reduction in the stringency of emissions regulations, industrywide consumer demand for E.V.s in North America began to slow in 2025,” G.M. said in a securities filing on Thursday.

In October, G.M. announced a third-quarter loss of $1.6 billion stemming from its electric vehicle assets. The company has scaled back plans for electric vehicles while ramping up production of large sport utility vehicles and pickups, which are far more profitable. A G.M. plant in Orion, Mich., is being converted from electric vehicle manufacturing to production of large vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

The company warned that it might book further losses related to electric vehicles in the coming months. But those losses “will be significantly less than the E.V.-related charges incurred in 2025,” G.M. said.

General Motors offers one of the broadest selections of electric vehicles of any carmaker outside China, including luxury vehicles like the Cadillac Escalade IQ and models that sell for less than $40,000 like the Chevrolet Equinox EV. But to make money on those cars, G.M. needs to produce and sell them in much larger numbers to benefit from economies of scale.

Industry executives and analysts expect sales of electric vehicles to begin growing again as early as this year as companies begin selling more electric models for $30,000 or less, including a revived version of G.M.’s Chevrolet Bolt.

There is broad agreement in the industry that U.S. carmakers must keep investing in electric vehicles to compete with Chinese carmakers, like BYD, that are selling a lot more cars across Asia, Europe and Latin America. Tariffs effectively ban Chinese cars from the United States, but industry executives say it will be difficult to keep them out forever.

“Our strategic realignment of E.V. capacity does not impact today’s retail portfolio of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac E.V.s in production,” G.M. said. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08biz-gm-writedown-pgwl/08biz-gm-writedown-pgwl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:00:37.557656

It comes on top of a $1.6 billion charge it disclosed in October for changes to its EV plans.

It’s another sign of the significant cost to traditional automakers after President Donald Trump ended federal policies that were intended to foster the adoption of zero emissions vehicles.

GM and other automakers invested heavily in EV plans in anticipation of stringent environmental regulations put in place during the Biden administration. They also expected some states to follow the lead of California and ban gas-powered vehicle sales within a decade. GM had previously announced a goal to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.

But the Trump administration has rolled back those emissions rules along with the financial support for EVs. It is also challenging the states’ authority to set their own tougher rules.

Electric cars aren’t going away entirely, however, as significant demand remains in the United States and demand continues to soar higher in other markets.

Much of GM’s $6 billion charge against its earnings will go towards settling canceled contracts with parts suppliers.

GM’s latest charge follows a Ford announcement in December that it would take a similar $19.5 billion charge against its earnings from its own change in EV plans.

GM did not announce that it would be discontinuing any particular electric cars at the moment, nor did it announce that it would be closing any factories or cutting any jobs. But it already announced in October that it would be eliminating one shift at its Factory Zero EV plant in Detroit, placing 1,200 hourly workers on indefinite layoff. It also placed 550 workers at an EV battery plant in Ohio on indefinite layoff as well.

Demand for electric vehicles surged through the summer and September due to the scheduled expiration of a $7,500 US tax credit for EV buyers. But US sales of electric models fell sharply across the industry in the fourth quarter, both compared to a year earlier as well as from the record third quarter.

GM CEO Mary Barra told investors in October that “electric vehicles remain our North Star,” but that it was now clear that sales of cars and trucks with traditional internal combustion engines “will remain higher for longer.”

Majority members emphasized nuclear’s role in ensuring firm capacity and energy security, citing recent legislative actions such as the ADVANCE Act as critical steps toward deployment, and framing nuclear expansion as essential for U.S. competitiveness against China and Russia. According to committee chair Rep. Bob Latta (R., Ohio), “The importance of successful growth of the American nuclear energy cannot be understated. . . . What we need in this country is more energy.”

Others echoed support but raised concerns about maintaining the independence and transparency of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Several warned that political interference and staffing losses could erode public trust—a cornerstone for successful nuclear deployment. Ranking member Kathy Castor (D., Fla.) spoke about wanting to counter the “chaos coming out of the [Trump] administration” by keeping things on track, saying, “If the American public loses that confidence, then the industry will wither.”

Call for action: Witnesses included Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute; John Williams, senior vice president at Southern Company; John Wagner, director of Idaho National Laboratory; and Judi Greenwald, president and CEO of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance.

Korsnick said the U.S. nuclear sector is “at a pivotal moment,” noting that electricity demand is accelerating faster than it has at any other point in decades. She outlined six priorities for congressional leadership: regulatory modernization, financial risk mitigation, fuel supply chain rebuilding, waste strategy, workforce readiness, and global competitiveness.

Williams pointed to lessons learned from Southern Company’s completion of Vogtle-3 and -4—the first new U.S. reactors in more than 30 years—where improved practices cut costs for Unit 4 by about 20 percent, compared with Unit 3. He stressed the need for federal risk-sharing tools, including tax credits and DOE loan support, to overcome high up-front capital costs.

Wagner emphasized the “unprecedented inflection point” for nuclear energy, a rare alignment of market demand, national security priorities, and policy support, and warned that decades of limited deployment have ceded global leadership to China and Russia. He called for sustained investment in advanced reactor demonstrations, fuel cycle capabilities, and waste policy modernization.

Greenwald underscored the importance of NRC independence and transparency, arguing that public trust is essential for scaling nuclear energy. She also urged Congress to ensure adequate staffing and oversight while fully implementing the ADVANCE Act.

Demand, deployment, and trust: Throughout the hearing, members and witnesses agreed that U.S. electricity demand is rising sharply and that nuclear energy must play a central role in meeting it. As Rep. Mariette Miller-Meeks (R., Iowa) said, “The question before us no longer is whether America needs nuclear energy, but how quickly we can deploy it.”

While optimism about nuclear’s future was evident, witnesses and several committee members stressed that success depends on maintaining strong safety standards and an independent regulator. As Greenwald noted, “Efficiency and safety can advance together—but only if transparency and independence are preserved.”",https://www.ans.org/file/23122/l/Screenshot (10).png,N,,2026-01-08 19:59:32.736476

GM's $6 billion charge linked to EV investment reduction

Most of the writedown tied to supplier payouts for canceled work

GM is latest automaker to walk back EV plans after federal policy changes

DETROIT, Jan 8 (Reuters) - General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab said on Thursday it would take a $6 billion charge to unwind some electric-vehicle investments, the latest car company to pull back from EVs in response to the Trump administration's policies and fading demand.

The charge stems from reducing its planned EV production and the fallout on the supply chain, GM said in a regulatory filing, and comes weeks after rival Ford Motor (F.N), opens new tab announced a similar but much bigger charge.

Most of GM's writedown - a $4.2 billion cash charge - is related to contract cancellations and settlements with suppliers, who had planned for much higher production volumes before the market turned.

GM said the writedown would not affect its U.S. lineup of roughly a dozen EV models, which is the industry’s broadest offering of battery-powered vehicles. “We plan to continue to make these models available to consumers,” it said in its filing.

The company will record the charge as a special item in its fourth-quarter earnings report. It expects to incur additional charges in 2026 as a result of negotiations with its supply base, but expects them to be less than its 2025 EV charges.

GM PLACED A BIG BET ON EVs

Many automakers, including GM’s crosstown rival, Ford, have been dialing back factory work on EVs since last summer, when U.S. President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending package darkened the outlook for the EV market. Sales of battery-powered vehicles have cratered following the elimination on September 30 of a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers.

Ford in December said it would take a $19.5 billion writedown over several quarters as it canceled several EV programs, including the fully electric version of its F-150 Lightning truck and an additional electric truck and van.

GM, the largest U.S. automaker by sales, made one of the biggest bets on EVs among global automakers, at one point vowing to essentially phase out internal-combustion cars and trucks by 2035.

While the company has not publicly walked back the 2035 goal, analysts have sharply cut the industry’s EV sales forecast into the next decade for the U.S., GM’s largest and most profitable market. GM CEO Mary Barra has said the company will respond to customer demand.

GM’s EV sales had started gaining traction in late 2024 after years of manufacturing setbacks. The company rolled out more lower-cost offerings, helping it reach No. 2 in sales behind Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab.

The company also said on Thursday that it would record a $1.1 billion charge in the fourth quarter related to its ongoing restructuring of its China joint venture.

The automaker began writing down some EV-related investments last year, including a $1.6 billion third-quarter charge. This month, GM halted production of EV batteries at two joint-venture plants for six months and cut production to one shift at an EV-only factory in Detroit.

The company also pivoted away from plans for another Michigan factory that was slated to build EVs, and instead will build the Cadillac Escalade and full-size pickups, it has said.

EV SALES ARE DOWN INDUSTRYWIDE

GM’s EV sales dropped 43% in the fourth quarter after the loss of the consumer tax credit. Sales hit record highs in the previous three months, when customers rushed to buy EVs before the credit ended.

EV sales across the industry increased 1.2% in 2025 from the previous year, according to research firm Omdia, a much slower growth rate than previous years.

Automotive data provider Edmunds expects EVs to account for about 6% of overall U.S. vehicle sales in 2026, down from 7.4% in 2025.

Ford’s shift, in which it essentially killed off its entire planned second generation of EVs, resulted in a much higher charge. Ford CEO Jim Farley said it was a painful but necessary move as the market cooled.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Farley told Reuters in a December interview.

Ford is now setting its EV hopes on a brand-new architecture that will enable the production of affordable models, starting with a $30,000 electric pickup in 2027.

Menendez and Casar Lead Legislation to Require Data Centers to Generate Electricity and Utilize Renewable Energy; Federal Government to be Required to Collect Data on Environmental Impacts of AI Data Centers

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representatives Rob Menendez (NJ-08) and Greg Casar (TX-35) introduced the Preventing Rate Inflation in Consumer Energy (“PRICE”) Act and the Data Transparency Act, legislation to address skyrocketing energy bills and the environmental impacts of data centers built for artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the country. The bills would require data centers to generate their own renewable energy to reduce strain on the energy grid and require the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Information Administration to collect and update data on the environmental impacts and energy consumption of data centers.

“While AI innovation is promising, we must ensure that our constituents are not negatively impacted because of the industry’s continued growth,” said Congressman Menendez. “New Jersey families have seen their electricity bills increased by 20% because of the rapid growth of energy-intensive AI data centers. Our bills would protect Americans by requiring data centers to generate their own clean energy, transition to 100% renewable sources by 2040, and provide detailed, transparent reporting on their environmental footprint. Addressing the growing energy affordability crisis requires bold solutions, and that is what we are delivering with this legislation that puts working families first.”

“Families should not pay more for utilities so that billionaires can get rich off AI data centers,” said Congressman Casar. “With this bill, Congressman Menendez and I are saying clearly: AI data centers should not be allowed to jack up your electric bill or poison your environment.”

""Energy costs are too high,"" said Karim D. Marshall, Director of Climate and Energy Policy at the Consumer Federation of America. ""Individual consumers should not be forced to pay corporate welfare through higher utility bills. Private-sector data centers should pay their own way and cover their energy costs. Disclosure is important and must be paired with meaningful action. These bills are a welcome and necessary first step in protecting the interests of everyday Americans and their ability to manage home energy costs.""

“Customers can’t afford to foot the bill for AI data centers,” said Charles Harper, Senior Power Sector Lead at Evergreen Action. “Data centers need to bring their own cheap, clean electricity to the table so they don’t spike our power bills and bring pollution to our neighborhoods. We are already seeing historically high power bills—the PRICE Act is exactly the safeguard we need to ensure data centers are paying their fair share. With the Data Center Transparency Act, the public will finally know what is being built in their communities. Data centers require large amounts of electricity—and sometimes bring new sources of pollution to our air and waters. The public has a right to know.”

Electricity consumption in the United States hit a record high in 2024, with data centers accounting for more than 4 percent of total national electricity consumption. That figure is expected to continue to grow in coming years. Last year, the Independent Market Monitor for PJM, the largest grid operator in the country, found that data center load growth is the primary reason for higher energy prices in the PJM region. In New Jersey, families experienced an electricity bill hike of about 20 percent, despite having far fewer data centers than other states in the PJM region.

At the same time, the environmental impact of AI data centers is expected to grow alongside energy demands. Much of the electricity required to power data centers is likely to come from fossil fuels, increasing emissions, and in some instances, worsening air quality in neighboring communities. In addition, data centers use large amounts of water to keep the facilities cool, which has caused serious concerns about their impact on local water systems.

Purdue demonstrates wireless on-highway electric truck charging

For the first time in the U.S., a roadway has wirelessly charged an electric heavy-duty truck driving at highway speeds, demonstrating key technology that could help reduce costs of building electrified highways for all electric vehicles to use.

The experimental highway segment tests a patent-pending system designed by Purdue University engineers. Built by the state department of transportation that Overdrive readers named the worst in the nation for highway upkeep in 2025, the segment gives Indiana DOT a bit of a feather in its cap for new builds. It's a quarter-mile stretch on U.S. Highway 52/231 in West Lafayette.

Purdue researchers demonstrated the wireless charging system in the fall using an electric truck provided by Cummins.

“Cummins is proud to play a role in this initiative by successfully adapting a prototype Class 8 battery-electric truck to integrate with Purdue’s high-power dynamic wireless power transfer system,” said John Kresse, chief technology engineer at Cummins. “The on-road testing went exceptionally well, thanks to strong collaboration between our teams. With its high power and promising cost structure, this technology represents a practical, and potentially game-changing, solution for the future of on-highway commercial transportation.”

The demonstration is part of a multistage research project that Purdue and INDOT began in 2018. In addition to its funding from INDOT through the Joint Transportation Research Program at Purdue, the project is affiliated with a fourth-generation National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center called Advancing Self-sufficiency through Powered Infrastructure for Roadway Electrification (ASPIRE).

“With this breakthrough system, Purdue has shown that powering large commercial vehicles wirelessly is not just technically feasible but could be a practical and scalable solution for real-world highway transportation,” said Nadia Gkritza, a Purdue professor of civil and construction engineering and agricultural and biological engineering.

The Purdue system demonstrates “dynamic wireless power transfer,” with “dynamic” referring to vehicles in motion, the university said. A few other states and countries have also begun testing roads designed to enable dynamic wireless power transfer. But making this possible for highways -- and particularly for semis and other heavy-duty vehicles -- is a unique challenge. Because vehicles travel so much faster on highways than city roads, they need to be charged at higher power levels.

The Purdue-designed system works at power levels much higher than others demonstrated in the U.S. so far. Using the test segment in West Lafayette, the system delivered 190 kilowatts to a truck traveling at 65 miles per hour. By accommodating the higher power needs for heavy-duty vehicles, the Purdue design is also able to support the lower power needs of other vehicle classes.

Purdue said that with the ability for electric trucks to charge or stay charged using highways, batteries could be smaller in size, allowing the trucks to haul more cargo, which could lower equipment costs and increase revenue.

North Carolina DOT reminds truckers to stay off backroads in Western N.C.

The North Carolina Department of Transportation put out a reminder this week to truck drivers that “local roads near I-40 in Western NC are for drivers with four wheels.”

In a video PSA posted to Facebook, NCDOT’s Marion Ferguson said “truck drivers need to stay on the interstate.” The side roads, he said, are “curvy, mountainous roads” that “lead into gravel roads, and trucks can get into bad situations when they leave the interstate.”

Ferguson added that heavy-duty trucks should stay on either a “prescribed detour” or the main highway to avoid issues. Routes for truck drivers heading West out of North Carolina, NCDOT said, are to stay on I-40 through the Pigeon River gorge, or take I-26 West to I-81.

International’s S13 Integrated Powertrain meets EPA 2027 requirements

International Motors this week announced its 2027 S13 Integrated Powertrain meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) emissions requirements for 2027 model year trucks.

The 2027 S13 powertrain, made up of the S13 engine and T14 transmission, carries more than 90% of the hardware from the current platform, which includes consistency in service tools, parts, and technician training, International said. Truck owners can expect similar fuel economy, driving experience, and powertrain weight as today's S13 Integrated Powertrain.

""We've been preparing for EPA 2027 for years. Our customers won't face surprises, only the same proven powertrain,"" said Dan Kayser, executive vice president, Commercial Operations, International. ""Our customers get a reliable solution without unnecessary complexity.""

The S13 Integrated Powertrain enables a compact, efficient design that meets nitrogen-oxide (NOx) regulations without unnecessary complexity.

[Related: EPA won't delay 2027 NOx rule, but plans 'major changes']

New features for 2027 in the powertrain:

S13 engine: Variable Valve Timing (VVT), which enables Variable Valve Braking (VVB) for improved braking performance, closed crankcase breather, oil centrifuge

T14 transmission: 24V Transmission Control Module with predictive shifting using GPS/topography data

Electrical architecture: Reduces complexity by using a standardized 24V electrical architecture across the entire powertrain platform; 24V alternator, starter, and engine controllers for improved cold-crank performance and durability, while retaining a 12V cab and chassis electrical system for battery accessories and body controls.

The 2027 powertrain also eliminates exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), International noted.

House Republicans are on a mission to responsibly fund the federal government as we fight to get America’s financial house in order and return to regular order. To continue making progress in funding the government, we are bringing forward a package of three appropriations bills that furthers President Trump’s agenda and delivers real spending cuts for hardworking Americans.

The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act protects Americans at home and advances American leadership by halting the spread of fentanyl and other illicit and deadly drugs in the U.S. through increased funding for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), holding foreign countries accountable for unfair trade practices, supporting NASA’s Artemis program to counter China, bolstering the American research enterprise, and countering foreign adversaries by increasing funding to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). It also defends the Second Amendment from Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) overreach and invests in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.

The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act bolsters our long term national security by investing in our nuclear weapons stockpile and infrastructure, preventing hostile nations and terrorist groups from acquiring nuclear devices or expertise, and banning the sale of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. This legislation also reduces our reliance on foreign countries for critical minerals by making historic investments in mining technologies. Additionally, the legislation improves and maintains America’s ports and waterways and increases investments to develop new geothermal energy sources.

The Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act allows us to continue unleashing American energy by increasing funding for oil and gas development. It reduces regulatory burdens by encouraging the ongoing review of harmful Biden-era rules and exempting farmers and livestock producers from confusing greenhouse gas permitting and reporting requirements, and safeguards access to public lands. It also combats illegal drug trade, confronts the opioid crisis, and increases funding for law enforcement to protect public lands. Additionally, the legislation gets rid of wasteful funding for Environmental Justice and cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

With this appropriations package, House Republicans are following through on our promises to gut wasteful bureaucracy, bolster our national security, restore American energy dominance, and put America first while returning to fiscal responsibility.

H.R. 6938, the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026, sponsored by Chairman Tom Cole, makes appropriations through FY26 and supports efforts to strengthen our energy security, secure our communities, reduce bureaucratic environmental red tape, advance critical programs, and implement President Trump’s America-First agenda.

As of the end of Q3, Nuvve had 26.4MW of bidirectional EV charger power capacity under management and 200kWh of stationary storage batteries.
In New Mexico, it would deploy the 40MWh of systems through the company’s recently launched battery-as-a-service subscription business model, which offers customers access to battery storage capacity at no upfront cost.
The BESS assets will provide peak load mitigation, resiliency and wholesale market participation through the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM).
Nuvve had previously participated in a V2G pilot in Japan in 2020 with the same partners.","A week earlier, Nuvve had revealed a non-binding agreement via a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Denmark-based renewables developer E&B Renewables for projects in European Nordic and Baltic countries, ranging from 2MW to 100MW in output to the grid.

That partnership, which builds on a collaboration framework signed by the pair in November, will kick off with three Danish projects, each of 2MW and undisclosed megawatt-hour capacity.

Nuvve emphasised BESS strategy in Q3 earnings call and shareholder letter

As reported by our colleagues at Electric Vehicle Infrastructure News (EVIN) on 19 December, Nuvve’s company leadership sent a letter to shareholders last month, informing them that it is expanding its focus on stationary BESS and microgrid technologies.

The move to make stationary batteries a “larger portion” of its business in the three global regions was signposted earlier in the company’s Q3 2025 earnings call. At that time, Nuvve reported a 20% decline in year-to-date revenues versus 2024 figures and losses widening year-over-year from US$1.2 million in Q3 2024 to US$4.8 million in Q3 2025.

As noted by EVIN, the shift echoes moves by other companies in the e-mobility sector, particularly, but not limited to, the US, where EV demand growth has slowed in the past year.

Nuvve’s Grid Integrated Vehicle (GIVe) energy management technology platform was developed to facilitate the aggregation of EV batteries to provide grid services. Its business model in that space has seen it work with the likes of electric school bus fleet operators in California that have been enrolled in utility demand response programmes.

As of the end of Q3, Nuvve had 26.4MW of bidirectional EV charger power capacity under management and 200kWh of stationary storage batteries.

Aggregation platform and BaaS business models enabling diverse applications and ownership structures, company claims

In its Japan project announcement, Nuvve claimed its aggregation platform equipped with proprietary AI would provide market forecasting and automated bidding to optimise the asset’s participation across the country’s merchant market opportunities, which include the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JPEX) wholesale trading and frequency response ancillary services markets.

In New Mexico, it would deploy the 40MWh of systems through the company’s recently launched battery-as-a-service subscription business model, which offers customers access to battery storage capacity at no upfront cost.

The BESS assets will provide peak load mitigation, resiliency and wholesale market participation through the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM). They will also be capable of grid-forming and black start functions for Kit Carson Electric Cooperative’s grid, and provide backup for critical community infrastructure, like healthcare facilities.

The New Mexico deal comes after Nuvve was the only bidder awarded a contract in March 2025 through ‘Electrify New Mexico’, a request for proposal (RFP) held by the US state’s government to find partners for EV charging and other electrification solutions. This is in support of a New Mexico zero emissions vehicle mandate, but also includes the right for Nuvve to deploy stationary storage and the startup claimed the total value of the opportunity could be as much as US$400 million over four years.

Meanwhile, in the Nordic and Baltic states, Nuvve highlighted that current market conditions are seeing BESS assets earn between US$340,000 and US$570,000/MW-year in revenues, with opportunities extending to multiple value streams beyond the currently lucrative ancillary services markets over their expected 15-year lifetimes.

That said, Nuvve had previously announced deals in the Nordic and Japanese markets in 2023 that do not yet appear to be included in its most recent asset under management figures.

In June of that year, the company said it would manage 40MW of fast EV chargers and around 1MW to 2MW of battery storage capacity in frequency regulation markets in Norway and Denmark for roadside services operator Circle K. In December 2023, Nuvve said it had been selected by Japanese partners Toyota Tsusho and Chubu Electric Power Miraiz to manage grid-connected battery storage with a combined capacity of 30MWh. Nuvve had previously participated in a V2G pilot in Japan in 2020 with the same partners.

Nuvve has also formed a joint venture (JV) in South Korea to participate in the country’s ongoing 2025 Second-Round Central ESS Auction with South Korean company Volt. The pair registered for the auction in early December, and award announcements are expected in February.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nuvve-EV-charger.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 17:13:46.150768

The appropriations legislation helps address the cost of living crisis, protects funding for key Democratic priorities like clean energy, environmental protection, scientific research and public safety grants, and reasserts Congress’s power of the purse.

Summaries of funding bills included in the package can be found here: CJS; E&W; Interior.

“I commend Ranking Members Meng, Kaptur and Pingree for their extraordinary work crafting this legislation,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro. “We had three goals when we began this process: to protect funding for Democratic priorities, remove any poison pills, and reassert Congress’s power of the purse. This legislation accomplishes all three and more. It invests in programs to address high utility costs, promotes public safety through increased grant funding, defends our national parks and public lands, and protects the environment while rejecting steep cuts sought by the Trump Administration. Now that this package has passed the House, I look forward to completing the remaining funding bills ahead of the January 30th deadline.”

“I’m glad to see that the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill has finally passed the House,” said Congresswoman Grace Meng, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies. “While this bill does not achieve every goal, I am proud to pass legislation that is far more responsible and meets many more Americans’ needs than the GOP’s original proposal would have. After weeks of negotiations, we were able to produce a bill that saves programs that combat violence against women and other violent crime in communities across the country, help create and preserve good-paying American jobs, and reaffirm our commitment to the United States’ global leadership in science, technology, and innovation. We were also able to strip this bill of every harmful policy rider that the GOP attempted to include that would have weakened gun safety regulations, undercounted the Census, made our schools and communities less safe, and harmed our LGBTQ+ friends and neighbors. Importantly, this legislation also reasserts Congress’s power of the purse, holding the Administration more accountable on funding, staffing, and Congressional notification requirements. I am proud to support this bill, along with every dollar it delivers to our communities and the programs that all Americans rely on.”

“Today, the House of Representatives passed a measure that chooses progress over retreat. The Energy and Water legislation that now goes to the Senate provides a critical $2.4 Billion increase over last year to address rising energy and water bills for American families, climate-caused shortages in the West, and increased flooding coast to coast. It ensures our Great Lakes stay vibrant, our ports on all coasts stay open, and our water infrastructure is built to last for Mother Nature’s complexities in this century. It maintains our commitment to critical regional commissions and authorities to build America forward here at home,"" said Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (OH-09), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water. ""To tackle the cost-of-living crisis and affordability head-on, this bill provides an additional $375 Million for electric grid modernization. America can, and must, meet the new age frontiers of energy and water, and invest in our workers, protect our water, and power our future. I thank my colleagues for their overwhelming bipartisan support for this bill, and I urge the Senate to move with haste to get this legislation to the President’s desk to be signed into law.”

“After weeks of difficult negotiations, Appropriators delivered a bipartisan funding bill that protects public lands and the environment, invests in Tribal communities, supports the arts, and rejects billions in extreme cuts proposed by the Trump Administration and House Republicans,” said Congresswoman Chellie Pingree, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Interior and Environment. “No one should mistake this for Republicans suddenly embracing responsible governance. These investments exist because Democrats fought to restore dollars that Republicans tried to eliminate and insisted on real, enforceable funding requirements that reassert Congress’s Constitutional power of the purse. Rather than handing the Trump Administration a blank check through another stopgap measure, we've imposed precise, legally binding spending requirements that constrain executive overreach. We secured $8.8 billion for EPA—$4.7 billion above what the administration requested—and level funded the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities, which the Administration tried to eliminate entirely. I’ll keep pressing for stronger investments in the months ahead, but the funding package we passed today is proof that when we stand our ground, we can deliver for communities, protect our environment, and block harmful special-interest provisions.”

Appropriators have been making steady Article I progress, with three full-year appropriations bills signed into law and three more heading to President Trump's desk following Senate passage next week. All twelve full-year funding bills have passed through committee, and work continues on floor passage of remaining FY26 legislation.

Despite the longest government shutdown in history, partisan obstruction, and tough deadlines, Appropriators have continued the thoughtful and deliberate work of funding our government. Last month, Congress avoided another end-of-year omnibus rammed through at the last minute because Republican leadership and governance insisted on responsible legislating and a member-driven process. Today’s action reflects steady movement toward regular order and completing full-year funding through accountability and deliberation.

Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said, ""Today, the House took another step forward in advancing three more FY26 appropriations bills to President Trump’s desk. Through bipartisan, committee-led consensus, we are delivering full-year measures that spend less than current funding, implement critical priorities for our districts, and continue to advance the America First agenda. This was not by accident – it is the result of ending bloated omnibuses, empowering members, and doing the hard work Article I of the Constitution demands. I commend the leadership and attention to detail of our Subcommittee leaders: Chairman Hal Rogers, Chairman Mike Simpson, and Chairman Chuck Fleischmann. With their direction, we have a product that supports law enforcement and the fight against illicit drugs, unleashes U.S. energy dominance and strengthens nuclear deterrence, and supports our wildland firefighters and the stewardship of America’s resources. This package reflects a commitment to governing discipline, transparency, and purpose. It is exactly the kind of responsible legislating the American people expect – and deserve – from Congress.""

Chairman Cole’s floor remarks are available here.

Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) said, ""This new year's package is a great way to kick off 2026, delivering key funding to make America safer and stronger, including our economy, our borders, and our holistic future. The bill for Commerce, Justice, Science, and related agencies, reins in wasteful spending and invests in programs that strengthen our families and communities. We're doubling down on our commitment to back historic law enforcement efforts to dismantle drug cartels and stop the flood of deadly drugs, like fentanyl, from poisoning our communities. We're also restoring national security, leading the way for cutting-edge innovation, and bolstering economic development opportunities. Thanks to the stellar leadership of Chairman Tom Cole, we're upholding our promise to advance critical federal funding for the American people.""

Subcommittee Chairman Rogers' remarks are available here.

Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) said, ""As part of President Trump’s and House Republicans’ mission to renew our great nation, we promised to unleash American-made energy, invest in our military, and modernize infrastructure nationwide. The Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, which I led and successfully passed in the House, strengthens America by investing in our nuclear deterrent to counter aggression from Russia and China, funding essential upgrades for our ports and waterways infrastructure – including full funding for the Chickamauga Lock: a critically important project for Tennessee, and strengthening our electrical grid to enhance its resiliency. The Energy and Water bill also makes historic commitments to decrease our reliance on China’s monopoly of critical minerals, makes America the global leader in the technologies of tomorrow like AI, quantum, and supercomputing, continues to provide robust funding for America’s next-generation Nuclear Navy, and ensures that we continue unleashing American energy dominance to lower energy prices. I am proud that the FY26 Energy and Water bill puts America First and delivers for our great nation. I thank the Trump Administration, Chairman Cole, and my bipartisan colleagues in the House and Senate for their collaboration and support to pass my Energy and Water bill. I look forward to President Trump signing my bill into law.""

Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, ""Today's passage of the Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Act sends a strong message that House Republicans are determined to advance President Trump's America First policy agenda by reducing energy costs, protecting America's public lands, and reversing harmful Biden-era regulations. As Chairman of this subcommittee, I am pleased that this bill protects important programs that states and local communities rely on. This legislation fully funds the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and prioritizes funding for Indian Country and Wildland Fire Management. I am grateful to Chairman Cole for his leadership and my colleagues' support across the House floor. I look forward to this critical legislation getting signed into law by President Trump.""

Supporting President Trump’s War on Drugs

After four years of open borders that allowed astonishing amounts of fentanyl into our communities, Republicans are taking decisive action to combat the spread of this fatal drug on our streets – and restore law and order to cities around the country.

Republicans are supporting President Trump’s fight against fentanyl with robust support for state and local law enforcement.

Republicans are increasing funding for the Drug Enforcement Administration by $63 million in support of the Trump Administration’s efforts to take down drug traffickers.

This legislation strengthens programs that combat child exploitation, protecting our most vulnerable.

Republicans are maintaining the America First ethos the American people overwhelmingly support – we’re making it harder for the CCP to gain a foothold in the U.S. or access any of our national security equipment and technology.

Restoring American Energy Dominance

House Republicans are using the power of the purse to advance the critical priority to restore American energy dominance.

With such incredible resources beneath our feet, Americans should not be dependent on foreign nations for our energy.

This legislation supports one of the largest investments in decades, with a focus on mining production technologies for critical minerals extraction. We are increasing investment in geothermal energy sources, capitalizing on the many domestic energy sources we have in the U.S.

A secure electric grid provides reliable, affordable energy to American families. We are strongly funding cybersecurity efforts to protect our grid from attacks.

Biden-era work spending is gone! We are eliminating the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and zeroing out the accounts for DOE’s Office of Energy Justice and Equity and the EPA’s Environmental Justice program.

Bolstering Our Nuclear Defense Systems

Our nuclear deterrence programs are championed in this legislation, helping to maintain America’s advantage over our adversaries.

We are investing over $20 billion in the continued modernization of the nuclear weapons stockpile and infrastructure.

Republicans are investing not only in the advancement of our own nuclear weapons, but also in our defense and deterrence technologies to defend our people.

This legislation protects our Strategic Petroleum Reserve by banning sales of crude oil to the Chinese Communist Party.

Adversaries in Russia and China should never be allowed in U.S. nuclear weapons facilities. This legislation bans citizens of our adversaries from these facilities.

America the Beautiful

From sea to shining sea, our public lands are beautiful, historic places for people around the world to visit. Proper management and care are necessary to ensure these lands continue to be a resource for every American.

Catastrophic wildfires have torn through American communities in recent years. We are ensuring funds for wildland firefighters to protect our communities from these events.

Visitors to America’s national parks deserve to know they can enjoy these national resources safely. We’re prioritizing emergency response and law enforcement on our public lands to keep Americans safe.

Republicans are honoring our relationship with America’s native tribes by bolstering funding to protect the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women program, as well as increasing funds for Tribal Public Safety and Justice programs.

America First Wins

House Republicans are working hand-in-hand with the Trump Administration to enact the America First agenda across the government. The appropriations process is key to that mission.

Republicans are protecting President Trump’s work by ensuring there are no provisions that impede or restrict his authority.

This legislation rescinds harmful, Biden-era spending on woke, DEI, and energy-inefficient programs.

We are defending the Second Amendment, reversing Biden’s anti-gun overreach, and reducing funding for the ATF.

Protecting the life of an unborn child is a long-held Republican conviction. Our legislation includes legacy riders that prevent DOJ funds from being used to pay for abortions.

This legislation protects the American people and our government from the malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party.

Critical support to the NASA Artemis program will bolster American leadership in space and counter China’s ambitions.

America First policies strengthen the American economy. By reducing government waste and cutting federal spending, Americans will see strong economic growth.

We all can play a role in the Clean Energy Generation, so if you haven’t already, please join us!","From greenspace protection to waste reduction, Athens, Georgia has a reputation as one of the South’s most sustainable cities – but the Classic City’s commitment to climate even goes beyond recycling and composting.

In 2022, Athens-Clarke County (ACC) adopted its Clean and Renewable Energy Plan to guide the city towards meeting community electricity demand with 100% clean energy by 2050 – and all municipal and government properties by 2035. The plan is a culmination of years of work by community leaders and government officials alike, incorporating creative funding ideas and ongoing community input to ensure that every Athens resident can obtain good-paying jobs, receive better healthcare, and pay less for electricity bills in a city with a history of high energy burden.

From establishing a Community Energy Fund in March 2020, to the ACC Commission allocating $750,000 to clean energy projects in September 2025, Athens has shown commitment to its plan so far.

ACC Library Goes Solar – and Charges Your Car

In April 2025, the ACC Library took an exciting step with the installation of new solar panel canopies in its parking lot. The array powers 20% of the library’s annual energy needs, the same as powering 27 homes for an entire year.

The ACC Sustainability Department estimates the solar panels will offset closer to 23% in sunnier months, and about 18% in less sunny months, says Joey Crews, the department’s Energy Program & Conservation Coordinator. By summer 2026, he says, they should have specific data to share with the community, which has been very involved in the process.

The ACC Library is an important part of the Athens Regional Library System, which supports over 240,000 residents across five counties. Powering even a single library with the sun – and thus reducing its dependence on unreliable fossil fuels and utility rate hikes – saves the library system money, so they can put more towards supporting the community.

Incorporating solar power into the success of a community has proved exciting and empowering for residents like Bruce Menke, a Clean Energy Generation member and Athens resident. “There are ample reasons to be excited and optimistic about the reduction in the use of fossil fuels in our community and ongoing programs to transition to safe, sustainable sources of energy,” Bruce says, adding that exciting and publicly-shared local initiatives “focus a bright spotlight on Athens’ efforts to move into the new era of non-emitting power sources.”

Laura Iyer, Founding Director of the Southern Sustainability Institute and Athens resident, agrees that clean energy has become one of the most unifying and hopeful efforts in her community, especially when viewed through an equity lens. “That combination of economic relief, environmental benefit, and community resilience is powerful. It can move us closer to a more equitable Athens,” she says.

Reading and Recharging

Since the library solar canopy was unveiled in April, ACC has installed two of its first DC fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) at the library, powered by the solar panel canopy. This is becoming more common at locations like libraries across the country, as patrons can spend the 20 minutes needed to fast-charge their EVs perusing books.

The chargers have been online since the end of June, and so far, they have provided the community with about 28,500 kWh of EV charge. That’s equal to nearly 3,600 gallons of gas not being used, or 22,600 kg of toxic greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane being diverted from the air we breathe.

Bruce, an EV driver, says that EVs were once a limited presence on local Athens roads and highways, but happily now finds them “very much in evidence” on local roads, a daily reminder of the transition taking place.

Making the Connection to a History of Energy Burden

Athens is no stranger to energy burden, the amount of income spent each month on energy compared to total monthly income.

Georgians have seen electricity prices explode by 40% in the last few years and now pay some of the highest electricity bills in the country, which translates to severe stress on families simply trying to get by, from cooking dinner to doing laundry. In Athens, the number of energy-burdened households has long exceeded national and state averages.

ACC’s Clean and Renewable Energy Plan aims to prepare the community to face rising electricity demand together, through listening sessions, surveys, town halls, multidisciplinary workshops, and more. Even the solar panel canopy at the ACC Library has a role to play.

“Seeing that the Library and the County in general provide resources to County residents,” Joey says, “The avoided energy costs with this project and all of our solar projects aim to reduce the overhead costs of running these facilities. These energy savings can lead to the continuation of programs and resources.”

Add to that a growing number of local groups working to support energy efficiency and solar access for overburdened households, says Laura, and like an electricity grid, it seems everything is connected.

Navigating Policy Setbacks

The ACC Library solar installation was made possible by a community solar grant and funding from Georgia SPLOST, keeping it relatively unaffected by the current federal administration’s attack on climate science and funding. Success through local and state support is encouraging in the wake of these attacks that are making progress feel impossible for communities across the Southeast.

Laura concurs that even with complications at the federal level, Athens continues to move ahead. “We now have solar panels on our libraries, at water treatment facilities, and on schools,” she says. “We have electric buses on the road, more EV chargers coming online… All of this has built a sense that we are capable of shaping our own energy future.”

Athens residents Bruce and his wife Karen are encouraged by the strength and resilience of communities like theirs. Bruce says that as the current federal administration is “incredibly, actively engaged in dismantling efforts at the federal level to transition to renewable energy and is even attempting to increase the use of carbon-emitting fossil fuels, this makes the strong local support of climate action in our community more important than ever.”

Bruce adds that the dramatic decrease in the cost of solar and wind energy, combined with the record-high utility rates in Georgia, has made simple economics a big factor in the transition to renewable energy in Athens – something that policymakers can’t, and shouldn’t, ignore.

What Comes Next?

What does the future hold? Joey shares that there are many exciting clean energy projects to come for Athens residents.

The Sustainability Department will soon explore storage options for the ACC Library solar array. Solar panels have to be paired with some form of energy storage, typically batteries, to operate when the grid is down. Once paired with a battery, the library panels will be able to provide storm resilience by staying online during power outages in Athens.

In the coming months, ACC plans to put $600,000 towards energy resiliency through the Community Energy Fund. The Sustainability Department will work with ACC’s Emergency Management Agency to identify the highest-priority locations to focus on resilient energy solutions.

Athens’ 32-acre Dudley Park will welcome a rooftop solar array on its bathroom, making it a net-zero facility.

Fire Stations 8 and 9 will receive double-axis tracking solar arrays, making them net-zero facilities in terms of energy, though they will still have gas usage that can be electrified/offset in the near future.

While the municipal projects and steady work from the county’s sustainability team have been inspiring and worth a pause for celebration, Laura insists we cannot stop there. “The long-term success of this transition will depend on how well we engage and support the full community, including those who have historically been left out of clean energy conversations,” she says. “What has impressed me most is how many people want to be part of the solution.”

The ACC library solar project has boosted local pride, made the clean energy transition feel less abstract, and given Athens residents like Bruce hope that they can make the city’s Clean and Renewable Energy Plan a reality.

“These efforts build trust,” Laura says. “They show progress is happening even when policy setbacks occur elsewhere.”

“The Trump administration and this Republican-led Congress have been an absolute disaster for the natural world and future generations.","WASHINGTON— The U.S. House of Representatives passed a final spending bill today with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior. The legislation now heads to the Senate where it is expected to pass before President Trump signs it into law.

The bill slashes the EPA’s budget by 4% compared to last year, bringing the agency back to 2012 funding levels when accounting for inflation. The cuts follow a year of unprecedented mass firings by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which fired as much as 25% of EPA staff — more than 3,500 employees — deliberately sabotaging the agency’s ability to protect public health and the environment.

“Congress lit the match by allowing Trump and DOGE to cripple the EPA’s workforce and now it’s pouring gasoline on the fire by gutting the agency’s budget,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This bill hands polluters exactly what they want and guarantees dirtier air, dirtier water, and more communities left unprotected.”

The bill also cuts the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s listing budget by a massive 44%, bringing it to 2004 levels. This will hamstring the program in charge of determining which animals and plants deserve protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Service is currently facing a backlog of more than 400 species awaiting consideration for protection.

The Service lost 18% of its staff under the Trump administration, including more than 500 biologists. Fewer biologists mean the agency has significantly fewer staff tracking the status of plants and animals or working to restore or manage habitats to help wildlife.

“This isn’t just a budget cut — it’s American bumblebees, monarch butterflies and hundreds more species losing their last shot at survival,” said Kurose. “The Trump administration and this Republican-led Congress have been an absolute disaster for the natural world and future generations. Extinction is forever and we don’t have time for this nonsense.”

The final legislation also includes a long-standing poison pill rider blocking Endangered Species Act protections for the greater sage grouse. It does not include an amendment from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would have paved the way for the sale of national parks.",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 15:59:28.252042

Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to sustainable aviation fuel while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production. In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel. With access to local, low carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2035. Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia’s long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

The Jan. 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors. Executives from Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines and Boeing spoke to the importance of aligning the full ecosystem of manufacturers and operators, policy, research, financing and public awareness to scale sustainable aviation fuel and secure the long-term future of aviation. Representative Mia Gregerson highlighted the need to center sustainability and airport communities as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels. Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell underscored the role of research and innovation in advancing sustainable aviation fuel from the lab to commercial deployment, while Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn addressed the state’s investments in clean energy, economic development and partnerships with Tribal nations.

The event also hosted a panel discussion moderated by Tim Zenk, a sustainable aviation fuel expert at Earth Finance, featuring executives Guy Palumbo at Amazon; Andy Billig, board member at SkyNRG; labor leader Jon Holden, Machinists Union, District 751; and Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck. The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

,North Carolina Environment,2026-01-08 19:59:11+00:00,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,$600 million climate bond helps with hurricane relief | UNC-Chapel Hill,Gilberto,,,,,https://www.unc.edu/posts/2026/01/08/600-million-climate-bond-helps-with-hurricane-relief/,"Hurricanes and tropical storms continue to affect the state of North Carolina, with residents’ homes suffering from wind and rain damage.
The bond, aided by the research of Carolina law students, aims to help residents and insurers by providing additional funds for North Carolina homeowners to install fortified roofs.
Insurance companies invest in the fortified roofs, which are constructed with waterproofing features that help to minimize storm damage.
The data is even better with non-named storms, when homes with fortified roofs reported over 60% fewer claims.
These results translate into lower insurance losses, faster recovery for coastal communities and a more stable market for North Carolina homeowners.","Hurricanes and tropical storms continue to affect the state of North Carolina, with residents’ homes suffering from wind and rain damage.

UNC School of Law professor Donald Hornstein set out to mitigate this with the creation of a first-of-its-kind $600 million catastrophe resilience bond, work he did partly in his role as a political appointee to the North Carolina Wind Pool, the state’s $1 billion insurer-of-last-resort at the coast. The bond’s resilience features helped the bond surpass its initial $350 million target.

The bond, aided by the research of Carolina law students, aims to help residents and insurers by providing additional funds for North Carolina homeowners to install fortified roofs. With the help of the Wind Pool’s resilience projects, over 25,000 fortified roofs have been added to homes in the Outer Banks and barrier islands in the past eight years.

Madison Williams ’23, a second-year law student, called the project a “strengthening your roof” program. Insurance companies invest in the fortified roofs, which are constructed with waterproofing features that help to minimize storm damage.

“If someone loses the roof to their house, they lose everything,” said Williams. “If you have a stronger roof, that means when a storm does come, you’re preventing what could be catastrophic damage. You don’t lose all your value, the stuff that can’t get replaced by money. It’s especially important with what seems like longer and more intense hurricane seasons.”

Data from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at NC State shows homes with fortified roofs experience fewer claims and less damage during hurricanes. The data is even better with non-named storms, when homes with fortified roofs reported over 60% fewer claims.

“We help them get back on their feet quickly,” said Hornstein, the Thomas F. Taft Distinguished Professor of Law and director of the UNC Law School’s Center on Climate, Energy, Environment and Economics. “It’s like health insurers taking measures to make sure their insurers are healthy and don’t get sick in the first place.”

More than 30 law students worked on this as a pro bono project, conducting research and sorting through complicated environmental finance information. Many of the students are interested in environmental law and work closely with Carolina Law’s Environmental Law Project. The Law School awarded the project the Pro Bono Project of the Year award in spring 2025.

As a Greensboro native, Williams loves seeing how the bond helps North Carolinians.

“Working with other students was amazing, and it’s so special to know that we had something to do with something with such a large impact,” she said. “I love being able to do something to help my community and the state I grew up in.”

“This is not only helping the insurance companies in regions with major storm damage, but it’s also helping people protect their houses on the coast,” said Williams.

Section 110 of the Clean Air Act requires that states assume primary responsibility for assuring attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) once the federal agency has established them. Each state is therefore required to formulate, subject to EPA approval, an SIP designed to achieve each NAAQS.

The SIPs will contain the measures and actions the state proposes to undertake to attain each NAAQS. These measures or actions must be enforceable through state regulations.

The states are generally free to make their own choices as to how they will attain the NAAQS through their SIPs. Further, the SIPs are in theory dynamic documents which the state can choose to change as it continues to determine the appropriate means of attaining or maintaining the various NAAQS. The SIP and subsequent revisions must be reviewed and approved by EPA to determine if the relevant criteria in Section 110 are met.

They were the first to propose that ""refundable tax credits,"" such as the advanced manufacturing production tax credit under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), should be recognized as exceptions under the global minimum tax. Through multilateral meetings and bilateral consultations, they secured an agreement among OECD member countries. As a result, they helped reduce the additional tax burden for companies expanding overseas in new industries such as secondary batteries and electric vehicles.

On this day, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Koo Yooncheol encouraged the first Sohwakhaeng recipients, stating, ""The Sohwakhaeng program is meaningful in that the organization shares and supports experiences of handling work a bit more proactively, rather than just focusing on grand achievements. We will continue to support the establishment of small acts of proactive administration as a new culture within the ministry.""",https://cphoto.asiae.co.kr/listimglink/6/2026010809470283466_1767833222.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:02:58.683802

Anger over proposed hyperscale data centers has driven residents in countless communities to flood once-quiet municipal board meetings and vent their frustrations, driven largely by increasingly unaffordable electricity bills, environmental pollution concerns, and the potential loss of their community's rural character.

Residents' anger hasn't been in vain either, as numerous communities have succeeded in their pushback against the power-hungry developments.

Reports estimate that around $64 billion in nationwide data center developments were either blocked or delayed between 2024 and the first few months of 2025, according to data center research firm Data Center Watch. That figure ballooned to nearly $100 billion in blocked developments between late March 2025 and June 2025 alone, around two-thirds of the projects Data Center Watch was tracking during that time.

The pushback and ever-growing prevalence of hyperscale data centers drove researchers at Houston's Rice University to dig into why developers choose rural areas as the location for their builds. They examined the data center market between 2018 and 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, to illustrate what it looked like when supply and demand for data center services were relatively stable.

They found that hyperscale data center developers often choose to build in rural communities rather than urban locations, not to create jobs and increase a community's economy, but because of low costs and abundant land.

""Local governments often try to lure data centers with tax incentives, betting they will create high-tech jobs,"" the university said in a press release about the research. ""But the study suggests other factors matter more to cloud providers, including construction costs, network connectivity and access to reliable, affordable electricity.""

The researchers said there's little evidence to show developers will spread hyperscale data centers to any areas outside of a small number of low-density locations.

They also said their findings support ongoing speculation that, as computing demand shifts to artificial intelligence, location decisions will begin to concentrate in the hands of these hyperscale developers.",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/c81180eb-6548-4b99-8cea-59f5c0f5a9bd/20251221T034053/c81180eb-6548-4b99-8cea-59f5c0f5a9bd_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:03:20.970005

Newsom ran on a promise of building 3.5 million new housing units; the state has fallen far short of that.","Gov. Gavin Newsom promoted California as an antidote to the Trump agenda on Thursday, telling lawmakers during a wide-ranging State of the State address that California still leads in a host of critical areas such as manufacturing, technology, education and agriculture.

“Every year, the declinists, the pundits and critics suffering from California derangement syndrome look at this state and try to tear down our progress,” he said, instead pointing to technological advancements and engineering talent as a metric of his administration’s success.

“California’s success is not by chance — it’s by design. We’ve created the conditions where dreamers and doers and misfits and marvelers with grit and ingenuity get to build and do the impossible.”

He touted a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office.

The address is his first State of the State to lawmakers in the Assembly chambers since 2020. He used it as an opportunity to highlight progress on some of his most ambitious promises on housing affordability, expanded health care coverage, universal pre-kindergarten and going fossil fuel-free. Some haven’t yet been met.

He targeted the Trump administration on a range of issues, including excessive policing and immigration raids, saying the state “faces an assault on our values unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime.” And in a common talking point for Newsom recently, he indirectly criticized the president for deprioritizing clean energy as China dominates electric vehicle production, and pointed to his own visits to international climate conferences.

“In California, we are not silent. We are not hunkering down. We are not retreating. We are a beacon. This state is providing a different narrative,” he said.

On homelessness, the reduction in the number of Californians sleeping on the street, in vehicles and in other places not meant for habitation is an important figure for the governor as he seeks to show improvement on one of California’s most stubborn challenges in his final year in office.

A humanitarian and public health crisis and the most visible consequence of California’s housing shortage, Newsom is sure to face national criticism on homelessness should he make an expected presidential run in 2028.

But the reduction came after years of increases in homelessness despite Newsom’s campaign promises to address the issue and his administration pouring over $24 billion into it during his two terms. In 2024, the year before the announced reduction, homelessness in California hit a record high: 123,974 were unsheltered while 63,110 were sheltered. That year, homelessness also spiked nationally.

Newsom did not announce the number who were homeless overall in 2025. The federal government in the coming weeks is expected to release the results of the 2025 homeless census for each state, including California. In the meantime, many California counties have already released their individual results. Several, including Contra Costa, San Diego and Los Angeles, indeed are showing progress.

He touted his administration’s focus on sweeping street encampments and building new mental health facilities paid for with Prop. 1, a $6.3 billion bond he promoted and which voters approved in 2024.

He also spoke about making the state more affordable, an issue over which Democrats and Republicans nationally are jockeying for credit after the 2024 presidential election showed voters were heavily motivated by the high cost of living.

He plans to seek out policies in his final year in office to crack down on large-scale investors buying up houses, forcing would-be homebuyers to compete — a day after Trump also announced a similar effort. It’s a new area for him in housing policy, after years seeking to boost construction. Newsom ran on a promise of building 3.5 million new housing units; the state has fallen far short of that.

Newsom also ran on a promise of a universal public health care system; he has since shifted to expanding access to Medi-Cal, the state health program for low-income residents that faces punishing federal cuts under Trump. On Thursday, he will tout the state’s production of $11 insulin as one way his administration has tackled health care costs.

Projecting a rosier budget outlook

The address was also a preview of Newsom’s last budget proposal, to be released Friday.

Though the state began the year facing an estimated $18 billion deficit and remains threatened by federal cuts, Newsom said revenues have come in $42 billion higher than expected — a “windfall” officials mostly attribute to stock market gains and the artificial intelligence boom.

That could allow him to avoid difficult fights with Democratic lawmakers over major cuts to programs in his final year in office, while maintaining funding for banner Newsom administration priorities like expanding public school to include all four-year-olds and providing more funding for community colleges.

With a rosier-than-expected financial picture, Democrats will be sure to jockey for additional funding for their favored programs or to reverse scheduled cuts to Medi-Cal coverage for low-income undocumented immigrant adults they made last year. But Newsom will propose instead to put $7 billion into reserves and $11 billion toward pension obligations.

And as Democrats debate a proposal to tax the wealthiest Californians to generate more revenue (an idea Newsom opposes), the governor instead will propose to renew a business development tax credit that has been often used by the technology and manufacturing sectors.

Executive Summary

Ever since Thomas Edison’s enterprise laid 80,000 feet of copper wires under streets in Lower Manhattan in 1882, lighting up one square mile, copper has proved its mettle as the metal of electrification. In the century and a half since then, as copper has gone on to wire the world, the staggering growth in consumption has turned it into one of the most important materials of modern civilization. But, without significant adjustments, copper supply faces a growing challenge of keeping up with the accelerating pace of electrification.

The importance of copper has been underlined over the last half decade as a number of countries have deemed it a “critical metal”, including, in 2025, the United States (US). And with good reason. Copper is the connective artery linking physical machinery, digital intelligence, mobility, infrastructure, communication, and security systems. All of this has made the future availability of the metal a matter of strategic importance. The United States’ designation of copper as a critical mineral underlines its essential role in enabling the infrastructure, technologies, and security systems that will shape the coming decades.

S&P Global's comprehensive study identifies a transformative trajectory for copper demand, projecting a surge from 28 million metric tons in 2025 to 42 million metric tons by 2040 – a 50% increase that underscores the metal's pivotal role in multiple technological and economic domains. However, meeting the call on copper confronts significant supply obstacles both above and below ground. The study projects a potential 10 million metric ton copper shortfall by 2040 without meaningful supply expansion. This demand growth – and addressing the looming challenges to meeting it – is what this report is about.

But what is driving this demand? It arises from the fact that copper is essential for the generation, transmission, and use of electricity. But the demand for copper will outrun supply unless there is major adjustment across the copper supply system.

Here, in short, is the quandary: copper is the enabler of electrification, but the accelerating pace of electrification is an increasing challenge for the metal.

In S&P Global’s base case, global electricity demand will increase by nearly 50% by 2040. And this surging electrification is advancing around the world. In the United States, for a quarter century, electricity consumption hardly rose year over year, but it is now beginning to grow at what could be 2.5% annually. In China – with an electricity market more than double that of the United States – it will grow at 3.2% per year between now and 2040. In India, it will be 4.2% per year.

The demand for copper is growing along four vectors, each of which adds to the pyramiding call on copper. The newest to emerge is one that was not even evident four years ago and yet today is highly visible in terms of global transformation for both work and life. That, of course, is artificial intelligence (AI). While AI has long been in development, it only “broke through” in November 2022, with the debut of ChatGPT. That launched the “AI Race”, which runs on electricity. In 2025, half of US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is attributed to AI spending – largely on computer chips, data centers, and the electric power systems on which they run.

This explosive growth of AI and data centers has introduced a new, rapidly expanding vector of copper demand. Data centers are electricity-intensive, and their proliferation is driving massive investments in both direct copper use (for power delivery, cooling, and IT infrastructure) and in the electric grid infrastructure that supports them. By 2030, data centers alone could rise from today’s 5% to 14% of US electricity demand, with copper a critical enabler all along the way. What is still to play out is the indirect impact of AI in terms of the electric infrastructure needed to meet the enormous demands of users – and the impact that AI will have in generating industrial, commercial, creative, and personal applications that will lead to further cycles of copper demand.

While AI is creating a new vector of copper demand, it is not the largest by any means. But the reason that we call this paper “Copper in the Age of AI” is because the requirements of AI underline the essential and foundational role of expanded electricity supply – and thus the need for more copper.

It is “core economic demand” that we cite as the first vector – from appliances and computers to construction and manufacturing – going back to when Thomas Edison’s light bulb candles and kerosene lamps. And this vector of demand – the largest – continues to grow. In the developing world, a combination of urbanization, rising incomes, and changing building practices means electricity use and thus more copper. One vivid example: the developing world is projected to add as many as two billion new air conditioners by 2040. In the United States, the reshoring of manufacturing and the resulting growth in electricity consumption is driving electric utilities to add more generation, more transformers, and more transmission and distribution lines.

A second vector of copper demand has only emerged over the last decade – “energy transition and addition.” Electric vehicles (EVs) require 2.9 times more copper than a conventional car, and the population of EVs is growing. The number of electric cars sold worldwide in 2025 was 25% greater than total new cars sold in the United States, the world’s second largest new car market. Solar and wind require a lot of copper, and over 90% of the new electric generating capacity installed in 2025 worldwide was solar and wind. Another new demand for copper is for the batteries being deployed to store renewably generated electricity. Transmission and distribution systems are being expanded worldwide.

But energy transition takes another form as well – it is also populations in the developing world moving from wood and waste for their heating and cooking to commercial energy, including electricity. Africa is home to almost 20% of the world’s population but is grossly underserved in terms of electricity. Copper will be integral to the systems that are rolled out to meet the need for electricity across that continent.

The final vector of current copper demand is defense. Rising geopolitical tensions and the electrification of military systems and the battlefield itself are driving up spending on defense and the push for new technologies. The investment in these technologies and systems is “inelastic” – given the national security stakes. Notable is the pledge by NATO members to increase defense spending to five percent of GDP. Modern weaponry, communications, and infrastructure are increasingly copper-intensive, and defense-driven demand is projected to triple by 2040.

And now a possible new vector of demand is on the horizon – humanoid robots. There is much variance in projections for their scale by 2040 – varying from tens of millions to hundreds of millions to a billion or more. Whatever the actual number, these humanoids will not just be wired – but heavily wired – with copper.

Demand versus supply

Even as global demand is accelerating along these vectors, current supply is on course to decline as existing resources age. Without meaningful expansion of supply, the result could be a 10 million metric ton shortfall by 2040.

Figure ES- 1. Total copper market balance (2020–2040)

MMt Cu

Meeting the growing deman d is fraught with challenges both above and below ground. The supply response is multi-faceted but constrained:

Mined copper – “primary supply”: Mining faces declining ore grades, rising costs, and increasingly complex extraction conditions. Without significant new investment, output from existing mines will decline, and the pipeline of new projects is hampered by long development timelines – averaging 17 years – resulting from permitting delays, and above-ground risks such as regulatory uncertainty, environmental activist opposition, shifting government terms, and rising costs.

Recycling – “secondary supply”: While copper’s recyclability offers additional supply, such secondary supply alone cannot close the gap. Even with very aggressive improvements in collection and processing, recycling could provide at best only about a third of total supply by 2040, leaving a substantial shortfall.

Processing criticality: Smelting and refining capacity, especially concentrated in China, have become critical nodes in the supply chain. The economics of processing are increasingly precarious, with treatment and refining charges under pressure and with regional disparities in operating costs and regulatory environments. The geographic concentration – estimated at 40% to 50% of total capacity – amplifies systemic risks and exposes the supply chain to geopolitical shocks.

Substitution and trade risks

What distinguishes copper from other metals is its exceptional conductivity of electricity – exceeded only by a precious metal, silver. This conductivity, along with the metal’s durability and recyclability, makes substitution difficult in most applications. While aluminum, plastics, and fiber optics compete in select uses, copper remains the preferred and/or essential material for safety, performance, heat management, and sustainability. Substitution, miniaturization and “thrifting” (using less copper per application) are limited by technical and economic factors, and the bulk of feasible substitutions are considered to have already occurred. The price ratio of copper to aluminum remains elevated, but further displacement may be limited without major technological breakthroughs.

Governments are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of stable and competitive mineral supply chains. Emerging modes of international cooperation and the growing role of sovereign wealth funds are offering new approaches to secure and diversify critical mineral supplies.

Policy, innovation, and the path forward

This report underscores the urgency of policy action, investment, and innovation across the copper value chain. Meeting rising demand in the coming decades will require considerable effort and innovation across the entire value chain:

Accelerating mine development: Streamlining permitting and rationalizing judicial reviews, fostering stable investment frameworks, and leveraging new technologies are essential to shortening development timelines and unlocking new supply.

Expanding processing capacity: Diversifying smelting and refining capacity beyond current hubs, incentivizing innovation, and aligning tariffs and industrial policy are critical to reducing systemic vulnerabilities – but also come with challenging economics and additional costs as well as regulatory obstacles.

Enhancing recycling: Investment in collection infrastructure, regulatory incentives, and international cooperation can boost recycling rates, but cannot replace primary supply growth.

Talent and skills: Addressing the talent gap in mining and processing is vital, as the industry faces a wave of retirements and declining enrollment in technical programs.

Copper’s role as the linchpin of electrification, digitalization, and security in the age of AI is both an opportunity and a challenge. The intersection of accelerating demand, constrained supply, and concentrated processing capacity creates systemic risks that require responses from policymakers, regulators, industry, and investors. The choices made in the coming years will determine whether copper remains an enabler of progress or becomes a bottleneck to growth and innovation.

This report seeks to provide a foundation for understanding these dynamics and for charting a path toward the resilient, sustainable copper value chain that is required for the future.

Key Findings

Copper demand & electrification

The world is electrifying: global electricity consumption will increase by almost 50% by 2040 – faster than any other form of energy

Global copper demand is projected to rise 50% by 2040, growing from 28 million metric tons today to 42 million, driven by four vectors: core economic demand, the energy transition and addition (renewables, EVs, grid expansion), AI and data centers, and defense modernization

Core economic demand and energy transition and addition are the largest drivers of copper consumption through 2040, with China and APAC leading demand growth

AI and data centers is a key new demand vector given data centers’ electricity intensity, direct copper use, and rapid growth in the industry

Asia will account for 60% of incremental demand, while North America and Europe see smaller but meaningful surges tied to digitalization and clean energy

Copper supply

Without improvement in above ground risks and significant new investment, a 10 million metric ton supply shortfall is projected by 2040

Without new mine development or expansion of existing assets, primary mined supply could increase from 23 million metric tons in 2025 to a peak of 27 million in 2030, then decline to 22 million by 2040

Average copper ore grades are falling, making extraction more complex and expensive, especially in major producing regions like South America

While recycling could possibly meet up to a quarter of total demand by 2040, it cannot close the gap – primary mined supply remains essential

Processing & supply chains

The copper supply chain is highly concentrated, making global supply and pricing vulnerable to disruptions, policy shocks, and complex trade barriers

China accounts for 12 of the 29 million metric tons of global smelting capacity – and this is growing, likely leading to further concentration of processing

Treatment and refining charges (TCRCs) are at historic lows, squeezing margins and threatening the viability of less competitive smelters

Above ground challenges

Average copper mine takes 17 years from discovery to production, with much time spent on permitting, environmental reviews, and community consultations

Inflation, lower ore grades, and deeper and more remote mining increase costs, raising the copper price needed to incentivize new supply

Shifting government terms, tariffs, and regulatory frameworks create uncertainty, slowing investment and project development

The mining sector faces a growing skills gap, with retirements outpacing new entrants and declining enrollment in technical programs

The United States designated copper as a critical mineral in November 2025 reflecting its unique role as the metal of electrification in a world that is being increasingly electrified. The need for copper will grow substantially in the years ahead in order to meet the myriad demands. Yet on its current track, copper supply will fall short with a resulting impact on economic activity, overall growth, and technological advancement. Understanding the complex and challenging interplay of future supply and demand of copper is what this study is about. It is also about understanding how to overcome obstacles in order to facilitate investment and timely development of new supplies.

Copper continues to do what it has primarily done for a century and a half – enabling the lighting of homes and offices and factories, the cooling through air conditioning and the delivery of heat. Today, it is also the connective artery powering physical machinery, digital intelligence, infrastructure, communication, and the movement of people and goods. Ensuring copper’s supply is no longer a question of mining policy; it has become a systemic challenge that touches technology, energy, security, and geopolitics.

In 2022, S&P Global conducted a comprehensive study on The Future of Copper that defined a new era and a new role for copper. For decades, the metal has been dubbed the dour “Dr. Copper” because variations in demand for such uses as construction, lighting, and machinery would be an early warning sign of an impending slowdown or recession. But our 2022 study pointed to a new category of demand – what we called “energy transition demand” resulting from the rise of solar and wind power, expanding sales of electric vehicles, and the drive to electrification as a result of climate policies. In that study, we assessed the substantial additional call on copper resulting from the overlay of energy transition demand on top of core economic demand.

This new study responds to a critical development since 2022 that is driving change – the accelerating pace of electrification. Copper is the essential, highly conductive metal for the endless miles of wiring in buildings and the wiring of every electric motor found in household appliances and industrial machinery, cementing its role as foundational to everyday living. As sectors like construction and manufacturing proceed with digitalization and further electrification, making buildings ""smarter"" and processes more connected, the demand for copper is intensifying. And while conventional autos use copper, electric cars use 2.9 times more copper, and 22 million of those EVs were sold worldwide in 2025, compared to only about 10,000 just 15 years earlier in 2010.

In this new study, we identify a third category that has only emerged since 2022. This is AI demand, resulting from the surge in investment in “intelligence factories” – otherwise known as data centers – and the infrastructure and ecosystems that support them. The impact is expected to be very substantial. S&P Global estimates that, for instance, the data center share of total electricity demand in the United States will rise from 5% today to as much as 14% by 2030, just half a decade away. This will require a substantial expansion in electric power infrastructure. Indeed, electricity is often described as the major constraint on AI. In turn, the availability of copper could be a constraining factor on expanding that essential flow of electricity (as well as data center equipment itself) – and thus on the roll-out of AI and the promise it holds for efficiency and innovation.

We also point in this new study to yet a further call on copper coming from the global surge in defense spending and the development of new types of weapon systems that depend on advanced electronics, sensors, propulsion, and communication systems. When combined with AI’s defense applications, ensuring reliable copper supply has become as central to national security as it is to industrial policy, AI, and clean-energy transition strategies.

These categories of demand are cumulative. Through 2040, S&P projects global electricity demand to grow nearly 50%, compared to 2025 levels. Every new megawatt and every new line of digital code ultimately depend on copper. AI systems draw vast amounts of power that must flow through copper conductors linking processors, memory, and cooling systems. Electric vehicles require 2.9 times more copper than conventional cars. Wind, solar and transmission systems cannot function without it, and the same is true of advanced weapons and surveillance systems, the effectiveness of which depend on compact, high-conductivity materials.

Strategic criticality

These demands of electrification make copper not just a question of supply but one of strategic criticality. Moreover, copper is essential because the alternatives are limited when it comes to better fit, price, or performance. While aluminum, graphite, or fiber optics can be substituted in some uses, they cannot compete with copper’s superior conductivity, durability, and versatility. Copper consumption can also be reduced through thrifting – using less copper due to design changes or technological advances. Much of the feasible substitutes for copper that can reduce demand for certain end uses are apparently already in use, leaving limited scope for new displacement.

What does all this mean in terms of numbers? The demand section will present our findings on how consumption will drive an unprecedented surge in copper use. This section includes a “teach-in” on varieties of data centers and their impacts on demand.

The supply section assesses the challenges to meet rising copper demand through new mine development, processing, refining, and recycling. Declining ore grades, regulatory and permitting delays, unbounded litigation, and the concentration of smelting capacity – all these have created structural constraints that could lead to persistent shortfalls and sharper competition for supply and possibly supply shocks. The supply section includes a “teach-in” about the processing system, the complexity and challenges of which are not well recognized.

Our study also assesses risks, including the geographic concentration of mining and refining, which drives disproportionate influence over offtake prices and costs while amplifying volatility and exposing vulnerabilities in global supply chains.

This report provides a foundation for policymakers, regulators, investors, industry participants, and the broader public to understand copper’s essential role in the age of AI – as the linchpin of electrification. It sets out how accelerating demand, constrained supply, and concentrated processing capacity intersect. The analysis underscores what can be done to expand mining investment and new supply and to also stimulate innovation and competition in the supply chain.

Copper is among the most critical metals of the 21st century, essential for a world that is increasingly electric. Across the global economy we see major growth in demand for electricity, whether for power hungry data centers enabling AI, the global shift to electric vehicles, the 2 billion air conditioners that will be installed, or the electrified weapons of the future. To meet the global power demand of 2040, the world will need to build the equivalent of roughly 330 Hoover Dams, or over 650 one-gigawatt nuclear reactors each year between now and then.1 Copper is the material enabling this massive growth in power demand – unlocking the age of AI and the electrified future of which it is characteristic.

Copper uses are broadening into areas that are both transformative and strategic for the global economy. Our study finds that the call on copper will grow from 28 million metric tons a year in 2025 to 42 million metric tons by 2040 – an increase of 50% above current levels.

Figure 1. Global copper demand by sector (2025–2040)

Million metric tons copper (MMt Cu)

These developments will generate a call on copper that is far higher than the current capacity to deliver the metal without significant adjustments. This signals a fundamental shift in global industrial infrastructure. Later in this study we will turn to how this demand can be met. But, first, why is demand growing?

Four Key Sectors Driving Unprecedented Demand

Core economic demand – “Dr. Copper”2

Energy transition and addition

The explosive growth of AI and data centers

Defense modernization

Across all four vectors, this growth in electricity relies heavily on copper as its essential conductor. Economic growth; the accelerating pace of electrification; increasing power consumption; the expansion of renewables; and the resulting need to build, modernize, and/or renew transmission and distribution infrastructure – all these will drive major increases in copper consumption in the years ahead. AI, of course, has emerged as the new key driver behind the surge in data center construction, representing growth in copper demand of 2 million metric tons from 2025 to 2040 for IT infrastructure and its associated power generation requirement. And increasing government defense spending focused on electrified equipment – such as drones, telecommunication systems, and advanced missiles – will make copper essential to national security.

Figure 2. Net change in global copper demand by vector (2025 vs. 2040)

Change in demand by sector, MMt Cu

The global landscape for copper demand is rapidly evolving. Between 2025 and 2040, China and the rest of Asia are expected to account for 60% of the world’s copper demand growth, fueled by the swift adoption of electric vehicles, clean power generation, expanded electrification of buildings and infrastructure, and the extension of electrical grids. In North America and Europe, the race to build AI data center capacity and the expansion of solar, wind, and electric vehicles will serve as the primary engines driving copper consumption. Meanwhile, the Middle East is projected to see one of the highest compound annual growth rates in copper demand, approximately 4% per year through 2040, albeit from a smaller base. This worldwide surge will be shaped by policy-driven initiatives, including investments in renewable energy, grid modernization, data centers, and industrial diversification strategies embedded in national development agendas.

On a global scale, the push to renew, expand, and upgrade transmission and distribution lines – as electrification accelerates in countries and regions – will require over $7.5 trillion in grid investments. Copper is central to this transformation, supporting the movement of electricity that drives economies, fuels technological progress, and links infrastructure worldwide. The magnitude of these investments highlights copper’s essential and unmatched contribution to economic progress, energy transition and addition, and digitalization.

2.1. Methodology

We analyze copper demand through the following four primary vectors:

Core economic demand – “Dr. Copper”: Traditional demand sectors which are core to economic growth: construction, cooling, electric appliances, fossil power generation, internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles,3 machinery, and non-vehicle transportation segments (rail, shipping, aviation)

Energy transition and addition demand:4 Electric vehicles (EV), battery storage, renewable power capacity (wind, solar), transmission and distribution (T&D)

AI & data center demand: Data center ecosystem, including data center operations and power infrastructure to connect data centers to the grid

Defense demand: Spending on defense equipment and infrastructure and the roll‑out of new technologies and weapon systems

Later in the study, we point to a likely fifth vector that would emerge in the second half of the next decade – humanoid robots.

This study uses a bottom-up approach to quantify demand at its point of consumption, not production. For example, we quantify copper use in vehicles sold, not produced, to estimate a country or region’s copper demand. An electric vehicle manufactured in China and then exported to a different country would count as copper consumption for that end country, not China. In an interconnected world, finished products containing copper, whether vehicles or appliances, are often traded between countries. Quantifying copper demand from an end-use consumption perspective enables a better estimate of the embedded demand for the metal and the potential shortages or surpluses countries could be facing due to disruptions across the supply chain. As a result, the quantified demand is based on finished demand for copper rather than refined demand or semi-finished5 products demand.

2.2. Core economic demand – “Dr. Copper”

Core economic demand (also known as traditional demand) continues to be the backbone of copper consumption in our forecast. Its range of uses is well known and has been familiar for many decades. Falling under this category are the following:

Construction: electrical plumbing and wiring

Machinery: motors, generators, and industrial wiring

Cooling: heat exchangers and coils for optimal thermal conductivity

Electric appliances: wiring and connectors in household items (refrigerators, washing machines, TVs, and lighting)

Transport: railways, airplanes, and traditional internal combustion engine vehicles

Fossil power generation: tubing and cooling systems, generator winding, and power cables

It is because of the sum economic impact of these varied uses that the metal has earned the sobriquet of “Dr. Copper.” Variations in demand and the price of copper are often seen as signals of economic vitality or recession.

Let’s take Dr. Copper apart, starting with construction. Construction will continue to accelerate globally, expanding copper use. In addition, a combination of rising populations, hot weather, and growing GDPs is driving fast adoption of air conditioning. Rising spending power and broader access to electricity are unlocking new demand for electric appliances, while expansion of industrialization and transportation is further increasing copper demand for machinery and other uses.

Beyond specific segments, core economic demand has historically been linked to broad economic development. Copper is a key material for the generation and transmission of power, which is a direct contributor to economic growth. Access to power enables productivity, supports industrial clusters and transportation systems, and improves living standards. For example, during China’s rapid economic growth in the first two decades of this century, the government’s substantial investments in power infrastructure and urban expansion significantly drove copper consumption to record levels. This illustrates how the demand for reliable power and electrification, facilitated by copper, underpins industrial productivity and economic growth.

Overall, core economic demand globally is forecast to increase by 2% annually, from 18 million metric tons in 2025 to 23 million metric tons by 2040. Construction and machinery continue to be the largest contributors to core economic demand, while demand for ICE vehicles declines due to the growing share of EVs.

Figure 4. Core economic demand for copper (2025–2040)

Construction

Global copper consumption due to construction increased significantly in the 2000s and 2010s, driven largely by the extraordinary Chinese economic expansion that followed its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Twenty million people were moving each year from the countryside to cities; they needed places to live and work, and that turned cities into building sites. Urbanization, rural electrification, and growing car and appliance ownership resulted in burgeoning hunger for the metal. A typical eight-story building uses around 20 metric tons of copper, mostly in wires and pipes. One after another, such buildings were going up across China at a very fast pace. Between 2000 and 2010, China built an average of 3 billion square meters of new gross floor area per year.6 To get a sense of the scale and the impact, that is equivalent to adding each year 5 to 6 full New York Cities’ worth of construction7 Between 2000 and 2025, China's share of global copper consumption in construction increased from 34% to nearly 40%. Over the same period, India’s share rose from just 4% to 11%. Together, these numbers signal the sheer scale of construction happening in these countries versus other parts of the world.

Building codes around the world are also changing, favoring copper for safety-critical applications. For instance, the International Building Code in the US now emphasizes non-combustible materials for plumbing and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, making copper a preferred choice over plastics. Similarly, the revised British building fire safety standard BS 9991 strengthens requirements for fire-resistant internal components, encouraging copper piping in residential buildings. Electrical codes also continue to mandate copper wiring for its unmatched conductivity and durability, reducing overheating and fire risks. These changes collectively position copper as the safest and most reliable material for modern building compliance. Climate policy is also playing a role in the push for electrification that is driving increased copper consumption. For instance, a pending law in New York State would require all-electric for new homes, banning natural gas for heating and cooking. While controversy surrounds this proposed new law, this may point to a new trend in climate policy that will add to the increase in global electricity demand.

Going forward, Chinese annual building additions are slowing, owing to high vacancy rates and oversupply of housing, but will be offset by increased urbanization and construction in Southeast Asia and India. Copper consumption in construction is forecast to grow by 1.7% annually between 2025 and 2040, from 7.5 million metric tons to 9.7 million metric tons. Asia (including China) accounts for roughly 60% of this total copper in construction consumption by 2040.

Machinery & others

Machinery and other related end uses are a sizeable driver of copper demand historically and into the future. Motors, generators, and associated industrial wiring are used in machines and equipment to produce, process, and transform goods central to the global economy. An example of the continuing electrification of machinery is found in the oil and gas industry, where electric motors are substituting for diesel engines in hydraulic fracturing that produces shale oil and gas.

Altogether, copper’s malleability, durability, resistance to corrosion, and thermal conductivity make the metal a preferred choice for machinery equipment of all kinds.

In addition to industrial uses, this category includes demand for a range of machinery‑based end uses, including non-vehicle transportation systems such as trains, subways, light rail, aircraft, and others, as well as agricultural equipment. Mass transit systems, for example, are a major consumer of machinery-based copper. Modern electric trains, subways, and light rail transit rely heavily on copper for power cables, signaling systems, motors, and overhead wiring due to its superior electrical conductivity and reliability. The transition to electrified public transport further cements copper's role as an essential material supporting the infrastructure of future cities.

Total demand for copper in machinery, including mass transit systems and other industrial sectors, is forecast to grow by 2% annually from 6.8 million metric tons in 2025 to 9.1 million metric tons in 2040.

Cooling and appliances

Copper consumption for cooling equipment and appliances has nearly doubled since 2010 to reach a combined 2.3 million metric tons in 2025. Demand for these end uses typically grows in line with population and economic development. As countries become more populous and average spending power increases, the ability to purchase air conditioning and modern appliances rises. At the same time, the average number of occupants per household drops, leading to a rise in the total number of households and resulting increase in the market size for this type of household equipment. Since 2000, global population has increased by more than 30% to reach 8.2 billion people today, while the average number of people living in each household has dropped from 3.5 to fewer than three. Asia, especially China and India, has been the key driver for rising cooling and appliance demand as populations have grown rapidly and hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty through rapid economic development.

Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, once wryly called air conditioning “the single most important invention of the twentieth century” because of what it enables in terms of productivity in the tropics.8 Cooling equipment will be a key driver of copper demand, rising 3.4% annually to reach 2.2 million metric tons by 2040. Between 2025 and 2040, the number of air conditioning units globally is expected to rise from 2.5 billion to over 4.5 billion, with continued growth accelerating in the developing world as incomes rise, access to electricity improves, and air conditioning costs come down.

Similarly, demand for appliances including refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, and computers, bolstered by price decreases, will drive further copper demand in the coming years. Copper demand is expected to grow annually by 4.5% for refrigerators, 2.4% for washing machines, and 2.4% for TVs between 2025 and 2040, reaching a total of 1.5 million metric tons.

Figure 6. Copper demand from cooling and appliances (2010–2040)

MMt Cu

Internal combustion engine vehicles

One big exception to the growth trends described above is traditional automobiles. In contrast to the other segments of Dr. Copper, copper demand for ICE vehicles will decline in the coming years, falling 5.5% annually between 2025 and 2040. This decline is driven largely by the increasing penetration of EVs into the market and slowing ICE vehicle sales in key regions around the world. As a result, ICE new vehicle sales are expected to drop from 50 million in 2025 to 22 million in 2040. While the EV ambitions of the early 2020s have tempered in Europe and North America, that is not at all the case in the world’s largest auto market, China, and Chinese-built EVs are gaining market share in much of the world.

A typical ICE passenger vehicle contains roughly 25 kg of copper per vehicle,9 mostly used in the electrical wiring harness that connects the different features (including HVAC modules, powertrain systems, emission control systems, etc.) and electrical controls. Copper is also used in windings on the alternator and on the low voltage battery.

S&P Global forecasts that the ICE vehicle fleet will peak in 2026. This is not only because of growing competition from electric vehicles, but also because of increasing utilization of vehicles through things like ride hailing and car sharing, as well as longer vehicle lifespans. As a result, copper demand associated with ICE vehicles is expected to fall from 1.3 million metric tons in 2025 to just 0.6 million metric tons in 2040.

Fossil power generation

The second exception to the general trajectory of Dr. Copper is in conventional electricity generation. The consumption of copper for fossil fuel power generation is forecast to decline as increased renewables lead to fewer fossil fuel-based capacity additions. While global natural gas demand will continue to grow reaching 165,000 billion cubic feet in 2040 given the new rise in power demand, annual capacity additions of all fossil fuel-based power generation peaked in 2010. Going forward, the total fossil fuel-based power additions are expected to decline by -5% per year, from 147 gigawatts per year in 2025 to 66 gigawatts in 2040, due to a combination of policy changes and increased competition from renewable alternatives. A limited increase in new natural gas capacity from 77 gigawatts per year in 2025 to a peak of 90 gigawatts in 2029 is more than offset by a substantial reduction in new coal additions, falling from 68 gigawatts to just 15 gigawatts per year over the same period. From 2030 onwards, annual additions of both sources are forecast to decline through 2040.

While fossil fuel-based power generation covers a range of technologies and configurations, plants typically average roughly 3.3 metric tons of copper per megawatt, primarily used in electrical wiring, generators, transformers, and other conductive equipment. Given the decline in annual capacity additions, copper demand for fossil fuel-based power generation is forecast to fall from 0.5 million metric tons in 2025 to 0.2 million metric tons in 2040 – a 6% average annual decline.

2.3. Energy transition and addition demand

A decade and a half ago, a second major vector of copper demand began to emerge. This was when solar and wind, decades in development, started to become competitive and gain scale, and when electric cars began to appear in showrooms in the United States and China. This emergence tracked the beginning of the electrified future. In the years since, solar panel costs have declined by 90%, largely because of the vast expansion in panel manufacturing in China. Globally, the current manufacturing capacity is now roughly double the global market size. Over the same years, wind turbines have grown in size and capacity. The adoption of these technologies has been advanced by strong government policies, regulations, and subsidies.

S&P Global coined the term ‘Energy Transition Demand’ in its 2022 report, The Future of Copper, to quantify copper demand from the main sectors focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions directly and indirectly. These sectors included transmission and distribution lines for wider electrification, clean technologies for renewable power generation, and electric vehicle adoption.

Today, these sectors are accelerating not just to address emissions, but to meet the needs of an energy sector pivoting towards a more electrified future. This shift to electrification is aimed at reducing dependence on fossil fuels, with renewables driving new power capacity additions. Global electricity demand is forecast to grow by 2.7% annually from 2025 to 2040 in S&P Global’s Base Case scenario outlook. This shifting energy mix with a greater focus on electricity will drive a substantial increase in future copper demand.

Figure 7. Global final energy demand

Million metric tons of oil equivalent (MMtoe)

Copper’s role in the energy transition arises from its exceptional conductivity (only silver is better as a conductor), durability, and recyclability. It is used in power cables, transformers, inverters, switchgears, busbars, and a range of renewable energy systems including solar photovoltaic (PV) modules and batteries.

Figure 8. Energy transition copper demand by sector (2020–2040)

MMt Cu

S&P Global forecasts that energy transition demand will be the largest source of copper demand growth between 2025 and 2040, requiring an additional 7.1 million metric tons of annual copper demand between now and 2040. This demand will increase from 8.5 million metric tons in 2025 to 15.6 million metric tons in 2040, an annual growth of 4.1%.

Leading the charge in energy transition copper demand growth from 2025 to 2040 are China (+1.9 million metric tons copper), Asia Pacific (+1.6 million metric tons) and Europe (+1.4 million metric tons). These regions will see copper demand growth driven primarily by the wider adoption of electric vehicles and increased spending in renewable capacity additions, driven by regulations, policies, and increased competitiveness of renewable technologies.

Figure 9. Energy transition copper demand by region (2020–2040)

MMt Cu

The challenge for electric infrastructure

The world is electrifying. By 2040, we expect that over 21,000 gigawatts of power generating capacity will be operational, producing 48 petawatt-hours (million gigawatt-hours) of electricity. To meet this, the industry will need to add the equivalent of roughly 330 Hoover Dam power plants, 30 of the giant Three Gorges Dam power plants, or over 650 one-gigawatt nuclear reactors each year between now and 2040.10 Over 92% of the net generating capacity additions in 2024 were renewable – two-thirds of that in one country, China. By 2040, solar PV, wind, and battery storage11 will account for 62% of the installed capacity and 47% of power generation by source. Renewable technologies continue to have lower capacity factors, which force an overbuilding of systems and of capacity. While natural gas and coal will continue to play a significant role in meeting energy demands and maintaining a stable power supply, the increasing integration of renewable energy sources requires a more reliable and upgraded power grid to manage the variability of electricity generated. It should be noted that the recent surge in orders for natural gas turbines and the renewed turn to nuclear power – both fission and now the potential for fusion – could modulate the trajectory of renewables.

Transmission and distribution

Copper is used extensively in transmission and distribution infrastructure. While aluminum is often used for overhead cables due to lower cost and weight, copper is preferred for underground applications given its greater conductivity, higher density, and smaller cross section. Copper is also an essential component of grid transformers, with copper windings playing a key role in carrying large currents with minimal energy loss.

Figure 12. Transmission & distribution network system

The share of underground T&D lines is expected to increase as subsurface cables are less vulnerable to weather and fire-related risks, require lower maintenance, and better suit the aesthetic and space constraints of growing urban areas.

While metal intensity will vary with cable voltage, cross-sectional area, and amperage, typical underground transmission lines will use 19,500 kg of copper per kilometer of transmission cable and 3,700 kg of copper per kilometer of distribution cable.

The overall growth in power demand and the role of renewables in the power mix create major challenges for the grids, including:

The increasing age of power grids – average grid ages in key regions range between 20 and 50 years – highlights a pressing need for replacement and modernization

The nearly 50% increase in global power demand by 2040 compared to 2022 levels, driven by electrification

The necessity to extend and expand the grid to better match generation and consumption centers, and to enhance grid flexibility, which is becoming an increasingly important requirement

The presence of connection bottlenecks for renewables – highlighting the need for additional transmission and distribution lines to ease these bottlenecks

To connect growing power generation capacity to consumers, a cumulative $7.5 trillion investment is required in transmission and distribution lines between now and 2040.

Figure 13. Global T&D investment outlook (2020–2040)

Real 2024 US$, billions

Annually, an average of $130 billion in transmission line investment and $338 billion on distribution line investment will be needed. Roughly 30% of North American and Asian distribution lines are underground, along with 80% of European distribution lines. Copper represents 66% of the total cable weight for underground cables. Overall, the growth in transmission and distribution spending could drive annual copper demand up to 7.1 million metric tons annually by 2040, a twofold increase compared to 2020.

Subsea Cables

Subsea transmission cables are connecting generation to power-short regions. As countries transition to renewable energy sources, the variability of these resources creates a pressing need for reliable power balancing. This has driven an increase in intercountry and interregional electricity transfers, enabling regions with surplus renewable and nuclear generation to support those facing shortfalls. In Europe, high-voltage subsea cables connect nations such as Norway, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Germany. Similarly, proposals for cross-border transmission links in Southeast Asia, such as that between Singapore and Indonesia, are aimed at further connecting the ASEAN power grid and will require subsea connection. A notable example is the AAPowerLink, a subsea cable system connecting Australia with Singapore and Indonesia. The project is proposed to extend approximately 4,300 km and is expected to require at least 70,000 tons of copper based on S&P Global estimates.

Material choice is a crucial factor, and copper conductors are often preferred because their superior conductivity allows for smaller cross-sectional areas, reducing the overall amount of material needed without compromising performance. Aluminum wires, less expensive and lighter, have limited corrosion resistance, which is an important consideration for offshore environments where exposure to saltwater and harsh conditions can significantly impact durability and reliability.

Renewable power generation

Over the past 10 years, global generating capacity of solar PV, wind, and battery storage has increased by 20% annually, from a total of 600 gigawatts in 2015 to 3,800 gigawatts in 2025. Renewable energy technologies have achieved global cost competitiveness, driven by subsidies and incentives, technological innovation, and economies of scale. In the United States, the Trump Administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” eliminated many of the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act but still provided select safe harbor provisions for many projects to continue. And it appears that solar and onshore wind will still be robust competitors without subsidies.

S&P Global forecasts that installed solar PV capacity could reach up to 7,500 gigawatts globally by 2040, up from 2,300 gigawatts in 2024. Copper is used across all solar PV components, including the module, inverters, cables, and transformers. Overall, solar systems use about 2.2 metric tons of copper per megawatt of solar PV installed.

Figure 16. Copper content in solar PV

An average of 600 gigawatts of solar PV modules could be installed annually through 2040. This will drive copper demand from solar PV to average 1.1 million metric tons per year, accounting for improvements in module efficiencies (which have a small negative impact on copper content per megawatt of installed PV capacity).

Figure 17. Copper content in wind turbines

Wind turbines are also copper intensive. Copper is used within the turbine, cables, in switchgears, and in transformers. For offshore wind, copper is the preferred metal for subsea cables due to its higher corrosion resistance, being less prone to material fatigue when subjected to movement and the forces of the ocean, and being heavier, which provides greater stability on the seabed.

The wind industry – particularly offshore wind – has faced recent setbacks due to increased cost of capital, permitting delays, and a shifting policy environment. Between 2023 and 2025, 21 offshore wind projects were cancelled worldwide, representing approximately 10 gigawatts of generation capacity. However, S&P Global forecasts a long-term increase in installed wind capacity as power demand continues to rise. An estimated 250 gigawatts of new wind capacity is expected to be added annually between 2025 and 2040, roughly 15% of which would be offshore. This would account for up to 0.4 million metric tons of copper required for wind capacity additions on an annual basis by 2040, up from 0.2 million metric tons in 2025.

The growth in renewable energy capacity will also drive the need for battery energy storage systems (BESS) to provide storage capacity and dispatch capability to an increasingly variable grid. Copper foil is used as the anode current collector inside the shell of lithium-ion batteries, which are forecast to remain the dominant BESS technology through 2040. In the battery pack and system level, copper is used for power transfer via busbars and cables.

Duration continues to be a key focus area for technology development associated with BESS. Increases in battery duration will lead to more cells in the battery modules and thus more copper in the battery. S&P Global forecasts annual BESS capacity additions to grow by 2.7% annually between 2025 and 2040, reaching 169 gigawatts by 2040. This means an increase in annual demand for copper from 0.3 million metric tons in 2025 to 0.5 million metric tons by 2040.

Electric vehicles

As previously discussed, there will be increasing displacement of conventional ICE vehicles by EVs. This has major significance for copper because electric vehicles use 2.9 times more copper than ICE vehicles. Copper is pervasive in electric vehicles: in the internal wiring (harnesses), capacitors (battery packs), and electric motors (e-motors). EVs cannot function without copper.

Figure 24. Global weighted average of copper intensity in passenger vehicles

Note: The weighted average copper intensity was calculated by dividing global copper demand by global vehicle sales for each technology.

For non-battery components, the calculation used the copper content of major systems such as the powertrain system, transmission system, chassis, electronic controllers, and body, adjusted for vehicle size by country.

The Future of Copper 2022 study highlighted key differences in copper consumption by vehicle size. This new report now highlights that two additional trends are driving growth in copper consumption in electric vehicles:

1. Preference for heavier, larger vehicles: The average weight of vehicles is growing as more consumers prefer SUVs to smaller vehicles like sedans or compact cars. Heavier vehicles need larger battery sizes, which themselves are more copper intensive.

2. Shift of battery chemistry to more lithium iron phosphate (LFP): Improvements in LFP cost competitiveness and energy density, coupled with their growing adoption in EVs has increased the share of LFP compared to nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) as the preferred battery chemistry in EVs.12 LFP batteries are on average 73% more copper intensive than nickel-rich batteries (NMC or nickel cobalt aluminum, NCA) because they require more cells to reach the same voltage, thus more copper foil in the collector.

Not every country will have similar copper intensity in their vehicle fleets. Consumer preferences and battery choice have a major impact on the copper intensity found in battery electric vehicles (BEV) sold into the market. US electric vehicles, for example, have the highest copper intensity due to US preference for large vehicles and longer range, compared to other countries. But limited adoption of large EVs in the US has at least for now marginalized demand for these vehicles. These regional differences are applied to our outlook for copper demand for electric vehicles.

Government and corporate EV ambitions in many cases have been tempered, notably in the US and to a lesser extent in Europe. In the US, government support for EVs is being dismantled. Key auto industry groups in Europe are pushing for “recalibrated” EU vehicle emission targets they now view as “no longer feasible”, uncompetitive, and threatening to the viability of the European industry. Several automakers have downplayed – if not scaled back – previously announced EV sales ambitions.

And yet, EV sales in 2025 are on pace to outperform globally the initial assessment in The Future of Copper four years ago. In 2025, China became the first “EV majority” auto market, with BEV and plug-in hybrids (PHEV) share of new light vehicle (LV) sales climbing from 7% in the first quarter of 2021 to 54% in the third quarter of 2025. New Chinese-made electric vehicles offer consumers a comparable – or better – value than conventional ICE vehicles. Improvements in battery performance for LFPs, deployment of ‘megawatt’ chargers, and battery swap stations have also contributed to a consumer mindset shift. At the same time, the regulatory environment has strongly pushed Chinese auto buyers, especially in cities, to EVs.

The global BEV and PHEV share of LV sales globally is projected to reach 55% by 2035. Without China, the global share would be 41% in 2035. The six main drivers of this shift are: 1) price parity achieved in China, with public chargers becoming more ubiquitous; 2) continued regulatory measures in China to promote EVs; 3) decline in the ‘BEV premium’ in Europe with tighter EU CO2 regulations and intensifying competition from Chinese automakers; 4) more EV models in the US without federal policy support; 5) continued improvements in battery performance and costs; and 6) aggressive marketing of inexpensive Chinese EVs across the developing world.

Figure 26. EV share of total light vehicle sales

%

As a result, EV-based copper demand is forecast to increase at an annual rate of 5.8% in the decades ahead. Annual demand is set to grow from 2.6 million metric tons of copper in 2025 to 6.3 million metric tons in 2040. This will more than offset the shrinking demand from ICE vehicles. The copper demand for all vehicles, including ICE vehicles, is forecast to increase from 4 million metric tons in 2025 to 6.9 million metric tons in 2040.

Energy addition

While the concept of energy transition – shifting from conventional fuels to renewables – remains central in developed economies, parts of the world are experiencing a different dynamic: energy addition. In many developing countries, the focus is not on replacing existing energy sources, but on expanding access to modern energy for populations who currently rely on traditional biomass like wood and waste for cooking and heating. This process of energy addition involves building new infrastructure and increasing the supply of commercial energy, including electricity and liquefied petroleum gas, to meet basic needs and support economic development.

This expansion of energy access brings with it significant implications for copper demand. As more people gain access to electricity, the need for transmission lines, distribution networks, and power generation facilities grows. For these regions, energy addition is unfolding alongside global efforts at energy transition, and the two processes are likely to coexist for decades. Recognizing this multidimensional reality is important for understanding the full scope of future copper demand and has been modeled in this study, as both energy transition and energy addition will shape the evolution of the world’s energy system.13

2.4. AI & data center demand

The third vector of demand came into clear view less than half a decade ago: the wave generated by the explosive growth in data centers serving AI and cloud computing.

Although the lineage of data centers can be traced back to mainframe computers, it was the rise of the internet and then cloud computing that created the modern data center industry. But the transformative moment came on November 30, 2022, with the release of Chat GPT, which attracted 100 million active users within two months. Artificial intelligence had been evolving over decades, but now it leaped to front and center. What has become known as an “AI Arms Race” set companies against each other for pole position – and the US in competition with China. The leading tech companies as a group spent over $400 billion in capital investment in 2025, largely on chips and the data centers that would house them.

The starting point is simple: AI is electricity intensive. The need to train large language models and then make them available to users requires data centers at a wholly different and much bigger level in terms of scale and complexity. The president of one of the major AI companies described the generation of artificial intelligence as the “manufacturing of electricity into intelligence.” S&P Global estimates that the data center demand for US electricity will rise from 5% of total electricity demand in 2025 to as much as 14% by 2030. Others have even higher numbers. But will that electricity supply be accessible and available? The CEO of a major tech company declared that “the biggest constraint [on the advance of AI] is power”. The race for AI has unleashed a fevered dash for power supplies. The gas turbine industry that sold only a single unit in 2022 has an order book as of 2025 of well over $100 billion.

Copper is essential both for the data centers themselves and for providing their required electricity. In this vector, we examine the call on copper in two parts: the direct requirements for copper in data centers and their immediate environs, and the associated impact on the electric power supply system.

The future of data center growth

AI, and particularly GenAI,14 is transforming the data center industry, with total installed capacity for all data centers set to grow from 100 gigawatts in 2022 (the year of the release of ChatGPT) to roughly 550 gigawatts by 2040. The release of ChatGPT catalyzed a major boost in AI and GenAI workloads and rapid hyperscaler expansion. Hyperscalers are expected to spend more than $2.5 trillion in capital expenditure through 2030 to execute on their AI strategies. Much of this investment is aimed at infrastructure to meet AI efforts. While energy consumed per query has improved significantly – often approaching a 1:1 ratio or better compared to prior generations – the overall power demand continues to rise because modern AI Graphics Processing Units (GPU) draw substantially more power per chip and require denser, more intensive configurations. New data center capacity is increasingly reliant on these AI GPUs, which require anywhere from 2 to 10 times more power than previous chip generations. This drives an increase in power required for data centers. While traditional servers require anywhere from 5-15 kilowatts per rack, AI servers can require more than 100‑1000 kilowatts per rack. Moreover, the heat generated by the racks means that more cooling will be required for AI configurations, necessitating a switch towards liquid cooling systems.

Our data center forecast is constantly evolving with new developments and industry shifts occurring in the AI race. S&P Global’s current outlook,15 applied for this study, assumes an unconstrained view of data center capacity additions between now and 2040 in which power supply is assumed to meet data center demand. In this outlook, overall installed capacity is forecast to be 3.6 times current capacity by 2040. The fastest growing data center archetypes are AI training data centers, which are expected to grow by 24% annually and add an incremental 170 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2040 compared to 2025. AI use (or inferencing) data centers are also expected to grow significantly, at a 6% annual rate between 2025 and 2040.

Figure 30. Global data center cumulative capacity (2020–2040)

A teach-in on data centers and their archetypes

Data centers are hardly uniform: they vary in size, demand, workload type, and strategic requirements. For differentiating the impact of data centers on copper demand, S&P Global has defined five main data center archetypes in this study. Each of these data center types has different use cases and requires different levels of redundancy across equipment to ensure continuous operations.

For more information on data centers, see Appendix A: Data Centers 101.

There is significant uncertainty about the outlook for AI and for data centers. S&P Global’s current view assumes new use cases of AI will appear beyond current AI training data centers. AI, for example, is poised to transform smart buildings into fully agentic systems capable of autonomous decision-making across energy, maintenance, space, and comfort management. The path towards this future illustrates an industry in evolution: AI-driven applications could change buildings, cities, and transport beyond current outlooks.

On an annual basis, S&P Global forecasts that up to 30 gigawatts of new data center capacity will be installed every year worldwide through 2030. This means that 15 new hyperscaler data centers, each of an average size of 2 gigawatts and worth $10 billion in capital expenditure, will be installed annually. A new wave of annual capacity additions will likely occur from the 2030s onwards as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities require additional data centers for calculation and processing.

Figure 32. Annual data center capacity additions (2020–2040)

GW capacity additions

Given this particularly high degree of uncertainty around data center growth, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for rapid changes in the industry. In addition to the base case, a low case was developed in which data center capacity additions are reduced in countries with power-constraints, grid limitations, and/or permitting challenges. In contrast, a high case was also developed in which the accelerated adoption of liquid cooling improves power usage effectiveness (PUE), allowing data centers to increase capacity in more grid constrained regions. This high case also accounts for the upside potential for faster ramp-up in robotics. Based on these cases, the potential data center cumulative capacity ranges from a low of 438 gigawatts to a high of 630 gigawatts by 2040.

The many roles of copper in data centers

Copper is used for power distribution inside the data center facility. Data centers are typically space-constrained, creating elevated fire hazards because of the heat generated by servers. Copper, due to its higher density and better fire safety properties, is preferred over aluminum for power distribution inside the facility. For server cooling, air conditioning units or fan walls have historically been used in data centers, but there is an increasing trend towards using newer liquid cooling technology to facilitate cooling distribution. These liquid cooling technologies are likely to become the standard for AI. Like traditional systems, they can use cooling towers and cold plates which are both copper intensive. As a result, the shift from air conditioning units to liquid cooling towers is unlikely to impact copper intensity for cooling, other than the much larger size of the new data centers.

Overall, the copper intensity in data centers will vary based on the redundancy requirement for each piece of equipment for the different archetypes. While the copper intensity of a single component may be lower, in practice data centers are often built with redundant backup systems which may include the minimum required capacity plus one additional (“N+1”) or twice the minimum capacity (“2N”). This analysis accounts for these common redundancies, potentially resulting in higher total data center intensity estimates than those that do not. These redundancy requirements can also drive further differences in copper intensity by data center archetype. For example, an AI training data center in China will have a copper intensity of 47 metric tons of copper per megawatt installed,17 while the global average crypto data center will only have a copper intensity of 21 metric tons per megawatt installed.

Figure 34. Data center archetype description

mt Cu per MW installed

Quantifying copper demand from data centers and AI relies on three major variables:

Outlook for annual data center installations by archetype

Technology/substitution of copper in the data center by alternative materials

Copper requirement outside of the data center ecosystem but critical to the functioning of AI data centers (e.g., power delivery and connections)

The one end use where S&P Global sees a shift away from copper in data centers is for interconnect cables between racks. There is an increasing shift in wiring material from copper to fiber optics. This could result in a decline of overall copper intensity in data centers by 4 to 5 metric tons per megawatt, which is of limited impact compared to the overall copper intensity of 30-40 metric tons per megawatt for non-crypto data centers.

Copper connecting power to data centers

The surge in data centers is creating an increased need for power generation and transmission to connect data centers to the grid. Their high-power consumption creates a need for additional investments across the power ecosystem. To account for the copper demand related to the power grid but specifically allocated to data center demand, S&P Global quantified the load of data centers on the grid and reviewed their impact on transmission and distribution copper demand. Most data centers, because of their requirement for high voltage power, are directly connected to transmission lines instead of distribution lines. The associated impact on metals is thus more aluminum than copper. However, due to their significant share of national power loads, data centers are assigned a proportional share of both transmission and distribution copper demand to account for infrastructure expansions needed to serve aggregated demand and increase grid reliability. For the additional power generation required by data centers, hyperscalers typically buy Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) locally, which generate investment and/or consumption of clean power from renewables. The copper-related demand for associated power infrastructure to data centers is estimated at 1.0 million metric tons per year by 2040, with 0.5 million metric tons associated with renewables deployment and 0.5 million metric tons attributed to T&D lines (mostly underground transmission where these are applied).

Power constraints for data centers

The rapid growth of data centers is creating significant challenges for existing power infrastructure, which in turn limits the pace at which new power-hungry data center capacity can be deployed. Expansion plans could be challenged by power availability as data centers become a burden on the grid, particularly for the United States and key European countries. In the US, data center demand could reach 14% of total power consumption by 2030.

In Europe, data centers account for a smaller share of the continent’s total power use, but key countries with dense data center concentration will be significantly impacted. Ireland’s share of total power consumption for data centers could reach as high as 23%, followed by the United Kingdom at 11% and the Netherlands at 8%. China, the rest of APAC, and the Middle East and Africa, in contrast, are likely to see more modest ratios around 2-4%. However, at the country level, Singapore and Malaysia may be more constrained given limited power infrastructure and rising data center demand. Government-driven initiatives are fueling data center growth in the Middle East, leveraging partnerships with hyperscalers and providing access to land and competitive electricity prices – although the region’s climate conditions drive increased energy demand for cooling.

To address power constraints, data centers are exploring multiple on-site power alternatives and co-location that can reduce grid pressure. These strategies include grid interconnection with backup diesel generators, behind-the-meter generation systems, co-location near power plants, and fully off-grid solutions utilizing renewables, natural gas, or a combination of both.

However, each approach presents unique challenges, particularly around renewable energy’s intermittency, the need to meet 24/7 load profiles, and significant infrastructure requirements. The feasibility of these alternatives will ultimately depend on factors such as local regulations, land availability, and technological innovation.

The impact of AI demand on copper

Overall, data centers and AI create a new vector of demand for copper in the next decade. Power access is essential to data centers, and copper is essential to power access. Copper demand for data centers is forecast to increase from 1.1 million metric tons in 2025 to 2.5 million metric tons by 2040. AI training data center-related copper demand will account for 58% of total copper demand in data centers by 2030. Data centers for robotics and autonomous vehicles could lead to growth in copper demand beyond 2035 as annual capacity additions for AI training stabilizes.

In keeping with the scenario analysis outlined above, S&P Global has also assessed a range of possible outcomes for future copper demand. For each scenario, the intensity of copper use by end market remains constant, while variables such as power availability and the pace of AI and data center adoption shift. The result: depending on how these forces play out, annual copper demand in 2040 could be anywhere between 1.7 and 2.7 million metric tons – a span that underscores both the uncertainty and the scale of the challenge ahead.

In addition to the direct impacts on power demand and data center equipment, AI has the potential for a much broader indirect impact on copper, both demand and supply. However, given the early development stage of AI, attempting to quantify these indirect impacts of future use cases would be premature and outside the limits of this study.

Humanoid robotics – a fifth vector?

Humanoid robotics is a fast-growing frontier in industrial technology. Unlike industrial stationary robots programmed to perform repetitive tasks, humanoid robots combine the cognitive power of AI automation with the mechanical capabilities of robots to interact with their surroundings, performing tasks that require human-like movement and adaptability.

Figure 37. Illustrative uses of copper in humanoid robots

Copper is critical in humanoid robot production due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, which are important for efficient energy management. The metal is used in primary batteries for anodes, cathodes, connectors, and terminals, and in electrical wiring for power transfer to motors, actuators, sensors, and semiconductors. Copper winding in motors and actuators is essential for creating the necessary magnetic fields for movement, while its use in sensors and semiconductors enhances signal integrity and processing speed. Specialized copper products, like copper foils and copper-clad laminates, provide additional strength and corrosion resistance. Typically, humanoid robots contain 4 to 8 kg of copper, a meaningful portion of the ~60 kg total robot weight.

Although technology is still in its early stages, multiple companies are already advancing from pilot initiatives toward full-scale manufacturing. Some project that there could be 1 billion to 10 billion humanoid robots in operation by 2040. Other outlooks by financial institutions assume that between 250 and 500 million humanoid robots will be in operation by then. Yet, others have more conservative estimates. One billion humanoid robots in operation by 2040 would mean about 1.6 million metric tons of copper required annually, or 6% of current copper demand. This new technology, and its adoption at scale, would potentially lead to a meaningful new draw on copper.

2.5. Defense demand

Copper is critical in humanoid robot production due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, which are important for efficient energy management. The metal is used in primary batteries for anodes, cathodes, connectors, and terminals, and in electrical wiring for power transfer to motors, actuators, sensors, and semiconductors. Copper winding in motors and actuators is essential for creating the necessary magnetic fields for movement, while its use in sensors and semiconductors enhances signal integrity and processing speed.

Other outlooks by financial institutions assume that between 250 and 500 million humanoid robots will be in operation by then. Yet, others have more conservative estimates. One billion humanoid robots in operation by 2040 would mean about 1.6 million metric tons of copper required annually, or 6% of current copper demand. This new technology, and its adoption at scale, would potentially lead to a meaningful new draw on copper.

Figure 39. Global defense spending (2010–2040)

Real 2024 US$, trillions

While available information on the material demands of defense-related applications is limited, public information shows that copper is the second most consumed metal by the US Department of Defense behind aluminum.18 New spending will trend toward modern equipment and infrastructure rearmament, which requires large volumes of copper. As the overall copper intensity of defense equipment rises, its role as a critical material for the industry will be solidified. Today, equipment and infrastructure represent 30% of total NATO spending, but given the rearmament and modern geopolitics, this number is set to increase. Moreover, the warfare of the future is more dependent on technology than traditional forces, as demonstrated with drone-led tactics in recent wars.

Copper is a critical material for defense applications due to its versatility in electronics, propulsion, structural systems, and weaponry. As a result, it has quickly become indispensable in both conventional and modern military applications.

In general, there are three main categories of copper demand in defense, each with a different strategic profile and impact on copper consumption:

High-volume, low-copper intensity uses. This includes items such as ammunition, one of the most traditional copper uses in the sector. Copper is present in ammunition casing and has steady demand due to the volume needed by militaries around the world.

Low-volume, high-copper intensity equipment. This includes tanks, aircraft, ships, and submarines. For example, a Trident nuclear submarine can contain up to 90 metric tons of copper,19 but only a handful are produced globally every year. These low-volume, high-intensity demands are key to future copper demand: as technology advances, these items will require more copper for sensors and wiring but are difficult to substitute with alternatives like aluminum given copper’s conductivity and resistance to corrosion.

The underlying modern defense technology and infrastructure that enables modern warfare. Infrastructure is required to power and control drones, radar, communications, and all kinds of other systems. Although copper intensity is less documented for these more sensitive end uses, it can be high and a major factor in total defense-related copper demand. As seen in the recent war in Ukraine, tactical drones and unmanned aerial vehicles have been critical on the frontlines. These new technologies have relatively low copper intensity, but given the increasing volume, the required enabling infrastructure (network, communications, control centers, etc.) will make copper an ever more critical material.

Copper is a key material across the defense sector, including, for example:

Combat vehicles: Copper is used in electronics in all sorts of combat vehicles, including amphibious ones, with infantry vehicles containing up to 800 kg of copper. Aluminum lacks the conductivity and heat resistance of copper as a suitable alternative.

Missiles and explosives: Copper is used in guidance, propulsion, and launcher wiring, with missile launch systems containing roughly 270 kg of the metal. Copper enables heat resistance and compact systems compared to aluminum, which can overheat and cause signal loss and requires bulkier systems.

Shipbuilding: Copper is used in submarine propulsion and electronics, as described above. Copper’s resistance to seawater corrosion is particularly important, as seawater can cause rapid erosion in aluminum.

Annual copper demand from the defense sector is projected to reach nearly 1 million metric tons by 2040, roughly triple today’s levels. Demand is driven by two underlying drivers: increased defense spending and an increasing share of equipment and infrastructure as part of that spending (from 33% in 2025 to 42% in 2040). Much of this growth will be driven by the US and NATO allies, with the US remaining the single largest source of demand. China’s demand will remain significant but will trail the US at the country level. If Russia continues to spend 7%-plus of its GDP on weaponry, it too will be calling more on copper. Given the central role of defense as a national-security priority industry, rising copper requirements are likely to intensify efforts to secure supply chains, particularly for refined copper and key alloys. While defense will still account for a small share of global copper consumption, it is strategic, inelastic, and difficult to substitute.

2.6. Why copper is the preferred metal – the limits of substitution

Copper is unique for its exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity, making it vital for power systems and electronics. It resists corrosion, has natural antimicrobial properties, and is infinitely recyclable without losing quality, supporting sustainability. This rare combination of efficiency, durability, hygiene, and recyclability sets copper apart from most other metals. Aluminum has only 60% the conductivity of copper, which means wires must be thicker to move the same amount of power, and, as a poorer conductor of heat, it sometimes requires more insulation.

However, like many metals, copper competes with other types of material for many different end-uses. Research and development influence the progression of materials, affecting competition among metals like copper and alternatives including plastics, aluminum, and fiber optics. Technological advancements can alter standards related to performance, cost, and sustainability, requiring each material to adjust and seek new applications to remain applicable in changing industries.

Copper substitution and copper thrifting could reduce the demand for copper, compared to our current outlook for copper demand. Copper substitution is defined as a replacement of copper by another metal or material for a specific end-use. Copper thrifting reflects innovation- and improvement-based reduction in copper intensity for specific end uses. Substitution and thrifting occur when copper is too expensive compared to viable alternatives, when an alternative material has higher performance than copper for a similar cost, or when technological innovation can help reduce cost of production for similar performance levels.

The looming supply deficit and higher prices for copper will likely lead to some levels of substitution and thrifting where feasible and safe to do so to reduce demand for specific end uses. However, many of the technologies and end users of copper have already gone through efforts to reduce their exposure where possible, so the potential for future substitution and thrifting is likely more limited.

For some end uses, such as data centers, substitution options are minimal. While aluminum can be substituted in high-voltage delivery related to utility-scale transmission, within high-density AI cluster facilities copper is described as “non‑negotiable” due to space constraints and thermal conductivity. Aluminum cables require larger cross sections, which may impede airflow in dense server racks. With the move toward liquid cooling and cold plates as demand for more efficient cooling grows, copper’s thermal properties make it superior to aluminum in data-center use, even if the aluminum is cheaper.

Recent surveys have shown that the main drivers of copper substitution are material cost, weight, and theft.20 However, trade issues, economic nationalism, and security concerns can also drive substitution. S&P Global has identified various end uses of copper that could be subject to substitution:

Figure 41. Copper substitution possibilities

Key substitution risks will be price driven. On a like-for-like basis, copper remains more attractive to the user because it is safer, recyclable, and denser than its alternatives. The key areas of potential substitution are: 1) air-conditioning units (HVAC), 2) transformers, 3) vehicles, and 4) construction, where cost competitiveness of material and products is high, and copper represents a large portion of the cost. Any shift of demand to another metal or material might create price pressure on that alternative, rebalancing the respective market.

Historically, copper-consuming industries have used a copper-aluminum price ratio as a guide for when the risks of substitution were high. For many years, the industry would look to specific price ratios between copper and aluminum prices (between 3.5 and 4) as a tipping point at which the copper industry would face higher risk of substitution. As the market has evolved in recent years, the use of a single ratio has become more complicated.

2.7. Dealing with uncertainty and the impact on copper demand

Demand forecasting relies on assumptions made across multiple variables in each sector of demand. This report presents S&P Global’s view of the most plausible trajectories of demand and supply based on our market research and data. Through our analysis we have identified several major areas of uncertainty which could influence the outlook for overall copper demand. These uncertainties are as follows:

AI and data center infrastructure: The pace of AI-driven computing expansion and resulting data center development creates substantial uncertainty. Key variables include power infrastructure capacity, clean energy deployment, and the balance between AI computing needs and broader economic power requirements.

Renewable energy deployment: Solar power capacity is the most pivotal driver of copper demand uncertainty given the scale and copper-intensity, with wind and batteries also playing an important role. Critical factors include policy changes, investment confidence, grid constraints, and the resulting potential for dramatic swings in annual capacity additions of new solar, wind, and battery storage.

EV transition: Copper demand in transportation hinges on complex interactions between EV adoption rates, technological developments, and regional market strategies. Key uncertainties include the presence or absence of policy incentives, battery chemistry, charging infrastructure, manufacturing costs, and divergent national approaches to electrification.

Energy technology transitions: The competition between renewable energy technologies and traditional fossil fuel generation creates significant demand volatility. Uncertainty remains surrounding the potential rate of fossil fuel displacement, or whether natural gas, gas and nuclear power play a more prominent role in new generation capacity additions.

Defense and national security: Defense-driven copper demand introduces a unique layer of uncertainty, characterized by strategic imperatives for technological modernization, geopolitics, and secure metal processing within national or allied borders.

Trade and industrial policy: Tariffs, quotas, licensing requirements, and product standards change the trade calculus in the global copper markets. Changes in industrial policy, including subsidies for strategically important sectors and regulatory standards, similarly alter the economics of these markets increasing uncertainty.

Grid T&D infrastructure: Capital allocation for grid upgrades remains highly variable, with uncertainties around constructing underground (copper) versus overhead (aluminum) transmission lines.

Macro-economic and urbanization: Global economic conditions and urbanization rates could vary widely, impacting copper demand particularly for both the construction and appliance sectors.

In considering these uncertainties, our analysis aims to present the most plausible outlook for copper demand, drawing on thorough research and sector expertise. For each factor, we have incorporated base case assumptions that reflect current trends and informed judgment as described in the sections above, rather than relying on extreme scenarios. Our estimates reflect what S&P Global judges at this time as the most likely trajectory for copper demand.

Copper stands at a pivotal moment. Global demand is accelerating along the four vectors we explored. Yet current supply is on course to decline as existing assets age. Without meaningful expansion of supply, this could result in a 10 million metric ton shortfall by 2040. This emerging gap represents systemic risk for global industries, technological advancement, and economic growth.

Figure 42. Total copper market balance (2020–2040)

MMt Cu

Figure 42 tells the story of how the copper market will go from a balance in 2025 to a shortfall in 2040 without adjustments. Today, demand and supply remain largely balanced at roughly 28 million metric tons. But by 2040, as discussed above, worldwide copper demand will rise to reach a total of 42 million metric tons. While primary mined supply increases in the near-term, output from existing mines falls as they age. Without new mine development and expansion of existing assets, today’s primary mined supply could decline from 23 million metric tons to 22 million metric tons by 2040. While a potential increase in copper supply from recycling from 4 to 10 million metric tons by 2040 could help close the gap, a shortfall of another 10 million metric tons will remain. To close the gap, a concerted effort – along with the proper policy, technology enablers, and investment – will be needed to increase primary mined supply from 23 million metric tons in 2025 to at least 32 million metric tons by 2040.

Figure 43. Three areas of focus for the copper supply chain challenge

Achieving this growth will be complex as the copper mining sector faces challenges both above and below ground. This includes declining ore grades; rising costs for energy, labor, and other inputs; increasingly complex and difficult extraction conditions; and pressures from investors and governments. It also includes above-ground challenges such as permitting, environmental activism,21 and extended project timelines. Meeting rising demand in the coming decades will require exceptional effort and innovation throughout the entire value chain as the industry contends with the dual imperative of increasing supply from naturally declining existing mines while also developing new mines to boost capacity.

Production from existing mines is forecast to peak in 2030 unless there is further investment in capacity expansion. Therefore, strategies to bolster copper supply need to center on prolonging the output of current operations, bringing new mining projects online, and harnessing the potential for increasing end-of-life copper recycling. To enable these changes and to avoid supply chain disruptions, copper ore processing capacities will also need to expand as the key node linking supply and demand.

Figure 45. Copper mined production from operating assets (2010–2040)

MMt Cu

The industry is faced with a dual imperative: maintaining output from operating mines to counter natural decline, while simultaneously enabling new capacity to meet expanding global demand. Converting identified but undeveloped reserves typically requires 15 to 20 years of exploration and development, concurrent with price assumptions that will support billions of dollars of investment and the availability of appropriate technologies (see box The steps to a new mine below). This combination of time and price incentive heightens the challenge to discover, develop, mine, and produce major new sources within the 2040 timeframe of this study. Most accessible copper has been, or is being, mined already. That underscores the importance of enhancing production from existing mines, pursuing efficiency gains, and accelerating regulatory processes and incentives for new developments. It also suggests that new supplies will require exploration and are expected to be more expensive and technically challenging.

Reserves vs. Resources

Resources are the speculative total amount of a naturally occurring commodity that exist that could potentially be extracted but haven’t been classified as producible reserves because they are not economic to produce at current price assumptions and current technologies and/or because of obstacles above ground.

Reserves are the portion of a resource that have been identified, confirmed, and can be economically and technically extracted.

The supply gap is at risk of growing

S&P Global data indicates that many deposits that could become possible projects have been identified and could contribute to meeting demand, but mine expansions and new development need to be accelerated to address growing copper requirements. To make that possible, governments and industry will need to align and collaborate on policies, permitting, technology, and investment in order to bring mine expansions and new",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/GettyImages-2183037636 3?$responsive$,N,,2026-01-08 17:00:54.277122

“By passing and signing the CRGA Act, Illinois lawmakers and Gov.","After passing through the Illinois state legislature late last year, Gov. JB Pritzker today signed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act.

As energy-intensive data centers expand and capacity prices spike further, Illinois is expecting to see significantly rising electricity bills for communities across the state. The CRGA Act addresses these challenges by strengthening the state’s renewable portfolio standard and ensuring that the state stays on track to meet its clean energy goals. By incentivizing new storage buildouts and VPP programs, Illinois communities will be better protected from rising energy costs and a strained energy grid.

Solar Powers Illinois — a partnership between the Illinois Solar Energy and Storage Association (ISEA), Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), and Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA) — released the following statement on CRGA being signed into law.

“Today, Illinois became the first state to pass comprehensive legislation to address the electricity affordability crisis as Gov. JB Pritzker signed the CRGA Act. CRGA is a critical step toward lowering Illinois’ rapidly rising energy bills over time while continuing to grow the state’s economy and clean energy workforce pipelines.

By investing in solar, energy storage, and virtual power plants, CRGA will save consumers $12 billion on electricity bills over the next 20 years, create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs across the state, invest in the Illinois economy, and help achieve Illinois’ goal of having a 100% clean grid.

CRGA will also strengthen opportunities for the nearly 6,000 Illinoisans who work in the solar industry and create new jobs in construction, manufacturing, sales and other positions for people entering the field.

This legislation cements Illinois’ national leadership in ensuring residents and businesses have access to an affordable, reliable, and clean power grid, building upon the legacy of previous landmark energy legislation including 2017’s Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) and 2021’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).”

The CRGA Act includes requirements to add multiple gigawatts of battery storage to the grid, increasing consumer access to home efficiency rebates, increasing funds for low-income energy efficiency programs, adopting grid-enhancing technologies and reducing bottlenecks in the process to develop and improve transmission lines.

“By passing and signing the CRGA Act, Illinois lawmakers and Gov. Pritzker took decisive action for consumers and the state’s economy by recognizing the importance of energy storage and renewable energy for our collective futures,” said Jeff Danielson, Vice President of Advocacy for the Clean Grid Alliance. “CRGA solidifies Illinois as one of the country’s clean energy leaders, protecting the gains made previously by the Clean and Equitable Jobs Act and helping to manage the surge in electricity demand primarily from data centers. Together, these policies will positively benefit the state’s economy and provide significant relief for consumers in the process.”

CRGA is expected to save consumers at least $13 billion in electricity costs over the next 20 years according to an analysis from the Illinois Power Agency (IPA). The provisions contained in the law will also address the challenges facing Illinois outlined in the recently-released IPA Resource Adequacy Study Report as the state looks to solve reliability and power availability concerns.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/solar-powers-illinois.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 15:00:15.117370

The proposed 4.4 gigawatt gas-fired plant would generate enough power for more than 3 million homes and emit more greenhouse gases each year than all the cars on Pennsylvania’s roads, according to the groups appealing the permit.

Clean Air Council, PennFuture, and the Sierra Club said the state Department of Environmental Protection made several errors by granting the permit, including failure to follow its own environmental justice policy by not adequately engaging with the surrounding community and accepting flawed methodology for the amount of emissions the plant will create.

They also say letting this plant go forward is a violation of the state’s Environmental Rights Amendment, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment for Pennsylvanians today and into the future.

Lawrence Hafetz, legal director for Clean Air Council, said public health will suffer if the plant is allowed to be built as proposed. He said the added pollution could especially harm vulnerable groups and people with respiratory conditions, such as asthma.

The appeal also said the applicant, Homer City Generation, failed to show the benefits of the project would “significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs.”

“ Most of that power will likely go to the data center, which is a private company as opposed to that power going to the public grid,” said Sarah Gordon, a staff attorney at Clean Air Council. “And so there’s a really different calculation in the cost benefit analysis of that pollution.”

Hafetz was critical of what he said is the DEP’s piecemeal approach to permitting. He said the power plant is only one part of the planned 3,200-acre data center campus.

“ You can’t look at the environmental impacts of a project unless you look at the totality of the project,” Hafetz said.

Gordon said they believe it’s DEP’s duty under the Environmental Rights Amendment to do a comprehensive review of the entire project, including water use and noise pollution.

Hafetz said it appears the DEP prioritized speed over accuracy in reviewing the permit application.

Gordon said a Right-to-Know request of communication about the Homer City project found that a DEP staffer said the goal was “to provide a concierge level of service.”

“DEP’s job is to protect us and to protect Pennsylvania residents who are living alongside these major industrial projects. Their duty is not to be a concierge for industry,” Gordon said.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has made quick reviews of permit applications a priority in his administration. DEP has long been criticized, mainly by Republican lawmakers, for slow permit processing. The agency reviews more than 45,000 permit applications every year.

The Shapiro administration launched the PAyback program in November 2023, which promises to refund companies their permit fees if their application is overdue for review by DEP. The administration also opened the SPEED program this year, which aims to give applicants flexibility by allowing a professional outside DEP conduct the initial review of the application.

These bills would restore consumer choice and limit government overreach into American homes. By reducing unnecessarily burdensome regulations, these proposals would lower compliance costs and improve affordability for households across the country if enacted into law.

The Energy Choice Act

H.R. 3699, the Energy Choice Act, introduced by Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY-23), would prohibit state and local governments from banning or limiting access to and usage of any energy source sold in interstate commerce, including fossil fuels.

This is not hypothetical. The state of New York and several municipalities around the country have enacted laws or regulations that restrict or outright ban natural gas connections in new construction, many of which are facing legal challenges. Whenever supply is reduced via government action, which laws like that do by restricting which sources of energy consumers can use, prices will typically increase in response.

With power grids increasingly strained by growing power demand, banning a source of energy like natural gas would increase reliance on electricity for heating and cooking, making power bills higher and add further strain to the grid. This bill would maintain consumer freedom and choice in the market while preventing governments from exacerbating the problems the energy grid faces.

The Homeowner Energy Freedom Act

H.R. 4758, the Homeowner Energy Freedom Act, sponsored by Rep. Craig Goldman (R-TX-12), would repeal wasteful grant programs established in sections 50122, 50123, and 50131 of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and rescind any remaining unobligated funds. Those provisions originally allowed up to $5.7 billion in grants (a CBO score for the savings of rescinding unspent funds is not yet available).

One of these IRA programs provides grants to state and local energy offices to incentivize them to adopt building codes that meet or exceed the energy conservation standards set in the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC). Adopting those standards, openly declared to be a stepping stone to a net-zero agenda, can add between $20,000 to $31,000 in building costs per house which would increase housing prices anywhere these codes are adopted. The federal government should not be spending hundreds of millions of dollars incentivizing local governments to adopt costly energy efficiency regulations. This bill would prevent further funds from being used for this purpose.

The Don’t Mess With My Home Appliances Act

The Don’t Mess With My Home Appliances Act, introduced by Rep. Rick Allen (R-GA-12), would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) to ensure that appliance standards are not overly burdensome. The proposal would remove the requirement that the Department of Energy (DOE) review and tighten appliance standards every six years and would instead allow the DOE to revoke standards that prove too costly or are not “economically justified.” When only new regulations can, and indeed must, be promulgated under the EPCA, but old regulations cannot be revised or repealed, regulations become increasingly burdensome in what is known as the “ratchet effect”. This provision opens the door for agencies to remove standards where costs outweigh benefits.

This legislation would also strengthen the test for whether a standard makes economic sense. Under the bill, any new standard issued by the DOE would need to produce at least a 10 percent reduction in energy or water use as well as not impose additional net costs on consumers over the first three years of use, once purchase, installation, maintenance, disposal, and replacement costs are considered. As a safeguard, the bill would require DOE to reassess any new standard within two years to determine whether its projected costs and benefits were accurate and to modify or repeal the rule if they were not.

In its regulatory analysis, the DOE would no longer be permitted to rely on speculative “social costs” of greenhouse gas emissions and would instead focus on direct impacts on consumers and manufacturers. Under the Biden Administration all appliance regulations began including calculations of “climate benefits” from reducing the social cost of carbon. This led to more burdensome regulations being implemented based on a standard with shaky calculus and vague benefits. Removing the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions from the cost-benefit calculus allows decision makers to focus their analysis on the economic and technical aspects of potential new standards, providing a more concrete standard for regulatory review.

While the bill allows new regulations to be promulgated and standards updated, it would remove the requirement for the DOE to periodically do so and changes what factors are included in the regulatory analysis. The goal of this is to limit any new regulations or standards to ones that are economically and technically justified rather than being implemented due to mandatory review requirements and relying on vague factors.

If they run on clean power, AI can grow without pushing emissions higher.
Its environmental impact will depend on the energy systems behind it and the investment choices made today.
The difference lies in how quickly clean energy scales and how decisively sustainability is integrated into digital growth.","Artificial intelligence is no longer a niche technology story. By 2026, it will become a defining force for energy systems, emissions pathways, and long-term climate strategy. BlackRock’s 2026 Global Outlook makes this clear: AI is now deeply tied to sustainability outcomes.

The rapid expansion of AI infrastructure is changing how electricity is produced, where capital flows, and how climate risks are managed. At the same time, AI offers tools that could improve efficiency and reduce emissions across the global economy. The challenge is timing and scale. AI’s energy demand is rising fast, while clean energy systems are still catching up.

How these two trends intersect will shape the climate impact of digital growth.

AI’s Power Appetite Is Growing Fast

AI systems require massive computing power. Large language models, real-time data processing, and advanced analytics all depend on data centers that operate around the clock. As these systems scale, electricity demand rises sharply.

BlackRock expects AI-driven investment to become a structural source of power demand by 2026. This demand will not be temporary. It will be embedded into the global energy system for years to come.

And the climate risk is straightforward. If data centers rely on fossil-fuel-heavy grids, emissions rise. If they run on clean power, AI can grow without pushing emissions higher. This makes energy sourcing one of the most important climate decisions in the AI economy.

Clean Power Becomes Core Infrastructure: Will Capital Allocation Shape Climate Outcomes?

AI is changing the role of clean energy across the global economy. Renewable power is no longer just a climate solution. It is becoming essential infrastructure for digital growth.

As AI systems scale, data centers require a stable, reliable, and continuous electricity supply. Solar, wind, nuclear, and energy storage offer long-term supply with lower carbon exposure. Because of this, companies are increasingly locking in long-term clean power agreements. These contracts help cut both price volatility and emissions risk.

From an investment perspective, this shift is already reshaping capital flows. AI-driven growth is accelerating investment in clean energy assets that are directly linked to digital infrastructure. Clean power is no longer treated as a sustainability add-on. Instead, it is emerging as a core business requirement.

More importantly, this trend highlights a deeper issue. Where capital flows will determine whether AI supports or undermines climate goals. Investment in clean generation, grid expansion, energy storage, and low-carbon baseload power will become increasingly critical as digital demand rises.

BlackRock’s report underscores the growing role of long-term capital in shaping sustainable outcomes. Climate-aligned finance can help steer AI growth toward cleaner and more resilient systems. However, this only works if investments follow clear standards and credible emissions reporting.

Without transparency, sustainability claims lose credibility. And without credibility, the link between AI growth and climate progress begins to weaken.

The Carbon Cost Comes First

While AI may support long-term efficiency, its early climate impact is not positive. Building AI infrastructure requires heavy upfront investment in data centers, servers, transmission lines, and advanced chips. These rely on steel, cement, and energy-intensive manufacturing.

Emissions rise during the construction phase. BlackRock highlights this imbalance clearly. Capital spending happens now, while productivity and efficiency gains arrive later.

This timing gap matters for climate strategy. Without efforts to cut emissions during construction, AI risks locking in higher near-term emissions even if long-term benefits follow.

AI’s Role in Cutting Emissions

Despite these risks, AI also offers powerful tools to support decarbonization. AI systems can improve grid management, predict renewable output more accurately, and reduce energy waste across industries.

In transport, AI can cut fuel use through smarter routing and logistics. In manufacturing, it can optimize processes and lower energy intensity. Across supply chains, it can reduce waste and improve resource efficiency.

The climate benefit depends on scale. Small efficiency gains applied across large systems can deliver meaningful emissions reductions. BlackRock sees productivity growth as a key pathway for lowering emissions intensity over time.

In the IEA’s “Widespread Adoption” case, AI-enabled solutions could cut up to 1.4 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO₂ emissions per year by 2035—about 5x more than data center emissions in that same year.

The Energy Transition Faces Pressure

AI and the energy transition are now tightly linked. One cannot advance without the other.

The report also warns that power grids, transmission networks, and permitting systems remain major constraints. If these systems fail to expand fast enough, AI demand could strain the electricity supply and slow decarbonization.

This risk is already visible in regions where data center growth outpaces grid upgrades. Without faster investment in clean generation and infrastructure, AI could compete with other sectors for limited low-carbon power.

Rethinking Diversification: Is Climate Risk Concentrated in AI Investments?

AI is changing how investors think about risk. Many assets now depend on the same digital and energy infrastructure, which makes them more vulnerable to climate events. Heatwaves, water shortages, or grid failures can disrupt multiple sectors at once, creating concentration risk that traditional diversification may not fully address.

BlackRock’s outlook highlights the need for investors to look beyond labels and focus on real-world dependencies and climate exposure. In an AI-driven economy, resilience is becoming just as important as returns, as the stability of digital and energy systems directly influences financial performance.

Private Markets as a Climate Accelerator

Much of the infrastructure required to support AI and sustainability sits outside public markets. Grid upgrades, energy storage, and efficiency improvements often rely on private capital, which can move faster and take on longer-term investment horizons.

This makes private markets well-suited to fund climate-critical infrastructure linked to AI growth. At the same time, strong governance is essential to ensure these investments meet emissions targets and genuinely support sustainable outcomes. Without oversight, the promise of private capital may fail to deliver real climate impact.

Redefining Growth in 2026: Can AI Deliver Sustainable Value?

Markets alone cannot resolve the tension between AI growth and climate goals. Government policy plays a decisive role in shaping outcomes. Faster permitting, modernized grids, and support for low-carbon power can remove bottlenecks and ensure digital expansion aligns with sustainability targets.

Thus, AI is redefining what sustainable growth means. It is no longer just about increasing economic output; it is about boosting efficiency, improving resilience, and reducing emissions intensity.

By 2026, AI will no longer be climate-neutral. Its environmental impact will depend on the energy systems behind it and the investment choices made today. BlackRock’s message is clear: AI can either exacerbate climate risks or help manage them. The difference lies in how quickly clean energy scales and how decisively sustainability is integrated into digital growth.

In the AI era, climate strategy is no longer optional. The alignment between policy, capital, and technology will determine whether AI strengthens or undermines the energy transition.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2705814407.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 14:00:43.139273

Highlights of the bill:

Starts a critical statewide battery storage procurement target of 3 gigawatts by 2030 that will save customers money and speed the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. This battery storage investment is estimated to power at least half a million homes for 24 hours during times of need.

Strengthens and increases utility electric energy efficiency goals and investment, roughly doubling Ameren’s programs and increasing ComEd’s by 25 percent. The utilities’ minimum income-qualified spend requirement is tripled to 25 percent of total spending, which will be a near $137 million per year investment for ComEd customers and an average of $55.5 million a year for Ameren customers

Provides initiatives to expand the efficiency of the state’s transmission system and accelerate the connection of energy storage to the power grid.

Establishes a state Integrated Resource Plan that gives the state more power to reduce skyrocketing wholesale power costs and chart its own energy destiny through rigorous energy modeling, consumer analysis, and the approval of the Illinois Commerce Commission.

Strengthens gas energy efficiency programs that help Illinois families reduce their utility bills by allowing Nicor, Peoples, and North Shore Gas to pursue increased energy reduction goals. For the first time, codifies robust minimum requirements for income-qualified programs, including a directive to spend 80 percent of said budgets on comprehensive, whole-home programs that provide no-cost rebates on weatherization and highly efficient technology.

Introduction

In November 2025, Virginia’s retail electricity market regulator, the State Corporation Commission (SCC), approved a new electricity rate class for large-scale customers, notably artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Requested by Dominion Energy and starting in January 2027, affected customers must pay for at least 85 percent of contracted distribution and transmission demand and 60 percent of generation demand.

The measure is designed to protect other ratepayers from rising electricity costs associated with dramatic data center expansion in the Commonwealth. AI data center power demand in Virginia has contributed to an 833-percent increase in the 2024 PJM (a regional transmission organization) auction prices for the 2025–2026 market and is estimated to drive up the Commonwealth’s energy demand by 183 percent by 2040.

This insight explains Virginia’s new rate class for data centers and the main factors driving this regulation and provides an overview of the historic electricity price trends in the Commonwealth.

Virginia’s New Rate Class for Data Centers

Virginia’s retail electricity market is largely regulated by the State Corporation Commission (SCC), which oversees Dominion Energy in Virginia, the other two investor-owned electric companies, and a number of electric cooperatives—which are not-for-profit organizations owned and operated by their members.

Dominion Energy, the largest utility company in Virginia, currently serves about 450 data centers among its approximately 2.7 million customers in the state. The company is required to get approval from the SCC to increase the electricity rates it charges as well as the authorized rate of return on its equity.

In November 2025, the SCC approved Dominion’s request to create a new rate class, “GS-5 rate class,” for the largest electricity users—including data centers, which use over 25 megawatts (MW). This new rate class takes effect in January 2027. Additionally, the SCC requires that these customers “pay a minimum of 85 percent of contracted distribution and transmission demand, and 60 percent of generation demand” to “help insulate ratepayers from the costs around the rapid build-out and construction of infrastructure to support businesses such as data centers.”

The SCC also partially approved Dominion’s request for increased rates on customers and rate of return. Instead of Dominion’s requested base-rate increases of $822 million in 2026 and $345 million for 2027, the SCC has allowed an increase of $565.7 million in 2026 and $209.9 million in 2027. This would lead to monthly increases of $11.24 in a typical residential customer’s electricity bill in 2026 and $2.36 in 2027.

Regarding the rate of return on Dominion’s equity, the SCC rejected Dominion’s request for a 10.4 percent increase, instead approving a slight increase to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent.

Dominion will require the new rate class of large-scale customers to sign a 14-year contract, regardless of whether they actually end up building the data centers or using all the power they estimate they will need. This requirement is aimed at shielding other customers from incurring part of the rising costs from data centers or other large-scale customers.

Earlier last year, Ohio and Oregon approved similar measures to require data center customers to pay a minimum percentage share of the electricity they estimate they need, even if they use less.

Factors That Motivate the Creation of a New Rate Class for Data Centers in Virginia

AI data centers are sharply boosting Virginia’s power demand

A previous American Action Forum’s (AAF) insight explained why AI data centers are so energy hungry. Electricity demand from AI data centers is estimated to jump from 4.4 percent of total U.S. electricity consumption in 2023 to 6.7–12 percent by 2028. Driven by data centers, Virginia’s energy demand is set to skyrocket 183 percent by 2040, compared to just 15 percent without the growth from AI data centers.

Virginia’s wholesale market (which involves the sale of electricity between utilities and electricity traders) is part of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM), a regional transmission organization that coordinates wholesale electricity activities across multiple states including Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia.

The Dominion Energy delivery zone of PJM (DOM Zone) includes Dominion Energy’s transmission territory in Virginia and parts of North Carolina. Summer peak load across PJM is estimated to rise by 48 percent from 2025–2045, exceeding the current generating capacity in PJM by around 45,000 MW.

DOM Zone’s summer peak load is estimated to increase significantly faster than that across the PJM—by 121 percent between 2025–2045. Additionally, for both summer and winter peak load forecasts, DOM Zone is highest among all those in PJM, around double the average load growth across the PJM area over a 10-, 15-, and 20-year period.

As shown in Figure 1, PJM has adjusted its load forecasts for the DOM Zone significantly upward for the past few years, with the steepest jump between the forecast in 2022 and 2023 primarily driven by data centers’ growing demand.

Concerns of higher electricity costs for residential consumers

Surging electricity prices are garnering significant media attention and fueling political debate at both the state and federal levels. U.S. national retail electricity prices increased at a drastic 10-percent nominal growth rate over the first half of 2025. Some states saw larger increases in nominal retail electricity prices from July 2024 to July 2025, such as the District of Columbia (24.5 percent), Maine (22.9 percent), and New Jersey (21.6 percent).

There is significant opposition to the expansion of data centers from local communities. The Data Center Watch reported that community resistance has successfully blocked or delayed $64 billion in data center projects nationwide as of March 2025. In Virginia alone, there are 42 activist groups and 12,000 petition signatures pushing back against the development of data centers.

Local residents typically express concerns about the impact of data center infrastructure in their communities. Common complaints include the negative aesthetic impact of data center infrastructure, heavy water demand, increased noise levels, and environmental concerns. Chief among these concerns, however, are fears that data centers will place a strain on the electricity grid and drive up utility bills for households.

In 2023, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLAR) commissioned an independent study of the impact of data centers in Virginia. AAF’s previous analysis provided an overview of the report’s 20-year projection of Virginia’s future generating capacity and whether it will be able to meet the AI data centers’ growing demand.

The JLAR study concludes that “[d]ata centers are currently paying their full cost of service, but growing energy demand is likely to increase other customers’ costs.” It lists several reasons why that might be the case. First, fixed costs of building substantial new generation and transmission infrastructures to satisfy the rising data center demand will need to be recovered from all customers. Second, power demand outpacing supply will likely drive up electricity prices. Third, utilities’ import of power from other sources will make them more vulnerable to spikes in energy market prices.

Historic Electricity Price Trends in Virginia

What factors affect the utility bill for consumers?

Utility bills are calculated differently based on the customer’s rate schedule, which varies by customer type and energy use patterns. Generally, utility bills are comprised of three sections: electricity supply charges, distribution service charges, and taxes, fees, and charges. Electricity supply charges consist of generation, transmission, and fuel costs, altogether accounting for roughly two-thirds of an electric bill. The distribution service charge covers the cost of equipment and infrastructure used to deliver electricity from local substations to customers.

Additionally, utility bills include several additional charges. The deferred fuel cost charge is a mandatory charge required by the Virginia SCC, allowing utilities to recover previously incurred, unanticipated fuel charges in future billing periods. Utility bills also include various taxes and fees required by the Commonwealth. Most of these charges are calculated based on the customer’s consumption.

Retail electricity price trends

Electricity prices in Virginia across sectors have been nominally increasing since 2000, with sharp increases from 2007–2009 and 2021–2022 (Figure 2). Adjusting for inflation, however, reveals that retail electricity prices in Virginia have not shown significant growth. The inflation-adjusted average price in 2025 (as of July) is 11.29 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is not much higher than the inflation-adjusted price from 2001, at 11.20 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Source: Energy Information Administration

Electricity price trends are more varied when examined by customer sector. As shown in Figure 3, residential and industrial electricity inflation-adjusted prices have increased between 2001–2025—by 0.96 cents per kilowatt-hour for residential and 1.48 cents per kilowatt-hour for industrial. Meanwhile, commercial inflation-adjusted prices showed the opposite trend, decreasing from 10.60 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2001 to 9.42 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2025.

Capacity market price trends

The capacity market under PJM coordinates wholesale electricity among power generators and utilities for reselling the electricity to consumers. The major goal of a capacity market auction is to reward power suppliers that invest in capacity to meet future peak load requirements to ensure reliable operation of the grid. Notably, capacity auctions do not reflect the prices of energy purchased, but the ability to produce energy when needed.

While the impacts of increased power demand by data centers may not yet be prominent in historic retail electricity price trends, signals of increased energy demand have appeared in PJM capacity auctions.

In 2024, the clearing price of the 2025–2026 capacity auction increased by 833 percent from the previous year. The following 2026–2027 auction held this past July saw a further increase of 22 percent, clearing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-approved cap of $329.17/MW-day, but was expected to be 18 percent higher if the cap did not exist (Figure 4). The sharp jump in the auction prices was largely driven by “data center expansion, electrification, and economic growth.”

PJM stated that it expects this capacity price increase to translate to a year-over-year increase of 1.5 to 5 percent for customer bills. In its 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, Dominion stated that elevated capacity prices “reflect the urgency of resources adequacy concerns not just for the DOM Zone but across PJM.”

Looking Forward

The ultimate impact of Virginia’s new electricity rate class for large-scale data centers is not clear, but it holds major ramifications for the Commonwealth. The aggressive buildout of data centers will depend on the ability of investors to recover costs. Household ratepayers are likely to remain sensitive to any proposal that could shift costs to them. The SCC has shown its willingness to reject rate increases sought by Dominion. Dominion and the policymakers who oversee it will be challenged as they attempt to keep up with the soaring data center demand without raising electricity bills significantly for residential customers.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/electricity-4575187_1280.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 13:13:40.028944

Many communities throughout Louisiana are already facing the damning effects of industrial pollution, and most of these communities are rural, low-income communities.

Policymakers are greenlighting the way for Big Tech corporations to profit from tax exemptions and other state funding programs, while Louisiana residents suffer the consequences. Louisiana residents are at the intersection of corporate greed and environmental sacrifice. Historically, Louisiana officials have placed big corporations such as oil and refinery over the health and safety of its people and environment. This shift to cater to the technology industry is not different, and the environmental impacts are not inevitable. They are the result of continued political choice to cater to big corporations, with no regard for the devasting effects it brings. It is beyond time for policy reform to protect Louisiana and its residents from bearing the cost of big business expansions.

Louisiana policymakers showed their continued disregard for its citizens and environmental health by passing legislation that would give data centers 30 years of tax exemptions, instead of the 20 years that were previously decided. These tax exemptions are being given to companies that will create only about 50 permanent jobs and invest only $200 million over the course of the tax exemptions. The Legislative Fiscal Office warned that these tax exemptions and deals for data center companies will drain revenue from the state, which could be tens of millions of dollars each year. That money could be going to improve environmental health through energy efficiency initiatives and support public health.

At a time when Louisiana is facing environmental health impacts that are impacting its air and drinking water quality as well as its coast, it is important to name the environmental risks associated with these data center expansions. The large Meta data center that is under construction in Richland Parish is estimated to emit 5,862 tons of CO2 per year, which is equal to the emissions of 1,108 U.S. homes. In addition to the increase emissions of greenhouse gases, these large data centers also will require Entergy to build three new fossil fuel plants to meet their energy consumption needs.

One of these fossil fuel plants is set to be built in Cancer Alley, which is already dealing with high levels of air pollution tied to cancer health outcomes in the region. The data centers also use large amounts of water to cool the facilities, and a large center can consume up to five million gallons of water per day, which is close to the amount used for a town the size of the entire Richland Parish. Not only do these centers use valuable water supply they also release warm and hot water back into nearby ecosystems such as streams, lakes and groundwater which change their temperature. The environmental effects of these data centers are multifaceted.

However, we have a chance to raise awareness throughout Louisiana and push for protective regulatory reform. Organizations and advocacy groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Alliance for Affordable Energy have already been using public testimony and litigation to bring to the forefront the concern about environmental health concerns these centers pose on Louisiana. They have been pushing for transparency throughout the process of approval and for regulatory agencies and offices to provide the public with information regarding the potential risks.

We can and should require more be done on the state-level since they have been the main people signing pieces of legislation in favor of Big Tech and not their constituents. We can push for legislation that requires full public transparency of energy infrastructure, which would include emissions estimates and cost impacts.

We need to make the state require these companies to provide third party mandatory environmental and health impact assessments before approval can be granted, as well as community representation in regulatory hearings to ensure those affected have a voice in the process. It should also be required that these big corporations fund clean energy initiatives and environmental restoration projects in the state for the 30 years they will be able to receive tax exemptions.

These data centers were praised by legislators as high-tech economic development; however, Louisiana can embrace technological growth without the price being the health of the environment and residents. We cannot continue to expand the use of fossil fuels knowing the implications just for the sake of big corporations, especially when those corporations do not put their fair share back into protecting Louisiana.

Raising awareness is vital to demanding policy change to protect public health. When residents, health professionals, environmentalists, and advocates publicly call out regulatory decisions that do not put them first, politicians are forced to do their jobs to protect us all.

Louisiana state legislators should be enacting policies that push for technological development while also aligning with sustainability, transparent regulations, and environmental justice. Until they start doing that, we must all continue to organize, inform, and demand that leaders choose pathways that power innovation without compromising clean air, safe water and community health. History has taught us we cannot trust our future in the hands of these politicians, and we must continue to fight for the Louisiana we all deserve, present and future residents.",https://static2.richlandtoday.com/data/wysiwig/favicon-16x16%281%29.png,N,,2026-01-08 15:00:45.573064

Under the agreement, Tokyo Century and KIC will acquire a 100% interest in the project, with Tokyo Century holding a 50% equity stake. Oriden, the project developer, operates under the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Group and is a US-based renewable energy company. The investment follows Tokyo Century’s earlier moves in June 2024, when it invested in a US renewable energy fund and acquired development rights for solar power plants in the country.

The project involves the construction of a solar power plant with an installed capacity of approximately 20 MW in Pennsylvania. Commercial operations are scheduled to begin in October 2026. Once operational, the plant will be jointly operated by Tokyo Century and KIC.

Tokyo Century expects the project to generate long-term and stable revenue, supported by a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) signed with the Philadelphia Energy Authority for the plant’s entire output. The company also plans to improve project profitability by leveraging tax incentives available under the US Inflation Reduction Act.

The companies said the investment aligns with expectations of sustained growth in electricity demand in the United States, driven by factors such as increased use of artificial intelligence and the rapid expansion of data centres. Average annual electricity demand growth in the US is forecast at 3.4% through 2040, positioning renewable energy as a key solution to meet future demand.

KIC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kyushu Electric Power Company, has an established track record in overseas power generation projects. Following this transaction, KIC’s total equity ownership capacity across its global portfolio will reach approximately 2.79 GW. Oriden, headquartered in Pennsylvania, develops, finances, constructs, owns and operates renewable energy projects across the US.

Tokyo Century said the partnership with KIC and the MHI Group represents an important milestone in strengthening its renewable energy business in North America. The companies will continue discussions on potential future collaborations.

How did you do?

Score for question 2 Score for question 4 Score for question 5 Score for question 5 Score for question 5

Question 1 of 5

The Trump administration is rescinding the “endangerment finding.” What is it?

Answer: The endangerment finding enables the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate climate emissions as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

Question 2 of 5

Which sector is the top source of U.S. climate emissions?

Answer: Transportation is the sector producing the most climate emissions in the United States.

If the EPA rescinds the endangerment finding, they would undercut the basis for the agency's climate emissions standards on cars and trucks.

In addition to cutting climate emissions, these standards were helping curb some of the air pollution coming from the tailpipe of cars and trucks — a form of pollution responsible for thousands of premature deaths every year.

Question 3 of 5

Climate emissions harm human health by ...

Answer: All of the above are human health impacts associated with climate emissions.

Burning fossil fuels is the top driver of climate change and is also extremely dangerous to human health.

The annual cost of burning fossil fuels to our public health in the U.S. is a staggering $820 billion.

Climate change is increasing extreme weather events, worsening wildfires and smoke, and expanding the footprint of infectious diseases.

Question 4 of 5

How many years after scientists first identified the mechanics of global warming did the U.S. government announce the endangerment finding?

Answer

In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first quantified how carbon dioxide contributed to a greenhouse effect in Earth’s atmosphere. Oil companies knew about the link between burning fossil fuels and climate change as early as the 1950s.

By the 1990s, the scientific community came to a general consensus on human-caused climate change.

In 2009, the EPA finally brought U.S. policy in line with 113 years of science with the endangerment finding.

Question 5 of 5

The Supreme Court has already weighed in on the endangerment finding.

Answer

The landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Mass. v. EPA in 2006 solidified the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, leading to the EPA’s endangerment finding in 2009.

Then, Earthjustice and our partners successfully defended the endangerment finding against a fossil fuel industry challenge more than a decade ago, culminating in the Supreme Court denying a final appeal by industry.

What’s next?

Earthjustice will pursue every legal avenue to defend the endangerment finding and ensure the federal government is meeting its obligations to keep us safe from climate change.

Why the EPA’s endangerment finding matters, and the major safeguards that depend on the endangerment finding

The stakes could not be higher.

Tell the federal government you support the endangerment finding and actions to reduce climate pollution.

“I believe the science supporting the causes of climate change, the impacts on our world, and the steps that must be taken to stop this disaster.

“The world needs the U.S. to be a power in stopping the actions that cause climate change.”

C. H.

Santa Rosa, California

“I’m a meteorologist with two degrees in atmospheric science.

The great majority of the most qualified scientists in my field believe human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, much of which come from burning dirty fossil fuels like oil and gas, as well as other short-sighted irresponsible human actions like mass deforestation are responsible for a dangerous climate change and that urgent action is necessary to avoid the worst impacts.”

K. C.

Marquette, Michigan

“I am beyond worried about climate change, as I see the destruction it is causing around the world.”

S. H.

Minneapolis, Minnesota

“Climate change is a fact, not a hoax.”

E. T.

“Our analysis shows that the vast majority of New Yorkers are missing out on savings and economic opportunities across the state due to delays in implementing the Clean Air Initiative,” said Kate Courtin, Senior Manager for State Climate Policy & Strategy.
""The data is clear that the Clean Air Initiative is a potent job creator and economic development tool.” said Jonah Kurman-Faber, Founder and Principal at Greenline Insights.

Household savings, job creation and economic output benefits are approximately doubled under a higher ambition scenario modeled.","NEW YORK — New Yorkers will realize significant economic benefits, including household savings and new job creation, with the Clean Air Initiative, a new report from Environmental Defense Fund and Greenline Insights finds.

The report comes as New Yorkers continue to await the launch of the Clean Air Initiative: an economywide cap-and-invest program that works by simultaneously putting a limit on the tons of pollution companies can emit — “cap” — while requiring them pay for each ton of emissions, funding clean energy projects that create health and cost-saving benefits for communities — “invest.” At the same time, energy affordability remains an issue that’s top of mind for New York voters.

“Our analysis shows that the vast majority of New Yorkers are missing out on savings and economic opportunities across the state due to delays in implementing the Clean Air Initiative,” said Kate Courtin, Senior Manager for State Climate Policy & Strategy. “The sooner this program is implemented, the sooner communities will see billions in investments that will expand access to cleaner, cheaper energy, cut pollution and create healthier, more resilient communities.”

The report finds that, over its first decade, the Clean Air Initiative would deliver:

$6.9 billion in net savings, or an average of $1,060 per household earning $200k per year or less — about 85% of households in the state.

Over 300,000 new jobs, with job growth strongest in fields like construction and transit as a result of investments in clean transportation services, decarbonization of buildings, and the build-out of clean energy infrastructure.

$48 billion in economic growth supported by program investments across the state.

""The data is clear that the Clean Air Initiative is a potent job creator and economic development tool.” said Jonah Kurman-Faber, Founder and Principal at Greenline Insights. “The program's investments play to the state's economic strengths and provide meaningful financial benefits to an overwhelming majority of the population.""

Analysis of the Clean Air Initiative’s impact across New York's ten economic development regions shows that all regions of the state experience economic gains from CAI-funded investments:

Regions experiencing the highest per-household net savings for working families include Mid-Hudson, Western New York and Long Island.

Per-capita growth and job creation are strongest in rural regions (e.g. North Country, Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier), and absolute levels of these benefits occur in major population centers (e.g. New York City, Long Island and Mid-Hudson).

The study also finds that increased ambition would drive even greater benefits.

Brookfield and Google just signed the largest hydropower deal in world history

Hydropower can sometimes get lost in the shuffle when it comes to new developments like EV charging stations or electrification efforts, but 2025 saw the largest corporate clean energy contract for hydroelectricity in history. It highlights the different ways some of the bigger players in tech are looking to secure 24/7 carbon-free power required for their AI needs. By committing over $3 billion to a framework for up to 3,000 MW of capacity, Google is moving beyond sources like wind and solar to secure power that matches the around-the-clock demands of its data centers.

Perhaps more significantly, the capital will be used to relicense, overhaul, and modernize century-old facilities like the Holtwood and Safe Harbor dams in Pennsylvania. It’s a development that sets a new precedent for private-sector investment, but also proves that meeting the demand associated with AI doesn’t just have to be about creating something new, but can instead be focused on upgrading existing renewable assets.

NextEra CEO warns against scorning renewable generation amidst long lead times for gas and nuclear development

NextEra Energy is the world’s largest electric utility holding company, which is just part of what made what CEO John Ketchum said in March of 2025 so notable. At CERAWeek by S&P Global in Houston, Texas, Ketchum said that relying solely on natural gas and nuclear to meet the demands of AI is a non-starter in the near term, as supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages have pushed the lead times for new gas plants to 2030 and beyond. By positioning solar, wind, and battery storage not just as green alternatives but as the only commercially viable bridge available to prevent a massive power affordability crisis, Ketchum sought to reframe the energy debate from an ideological battle to one of industrial pragmatism.

It’s a concept that comes up on a regular basis on This Week in Cleantech, but his message underscored the forces that are compelling traditional energy giants to look at renewables as the only solution fast enough and cheap enough to keep the American grid from buckling.

This Meta AI data center mega project demands $6 billion in electric infrastructure. Who will pay for it?

Further connected to the incredible and insatiable demand for energy, a deal from back in February represents a historic intersection of the AI arms race and national energy infrastructure, while also being one of the largest private capital investments in Louisiana’s history. The 2GW mega project will require $6 billion in new electrical infrastructure, underscoring the power and requirements we’re talking about with next-generation AI, which are now comparable to the loads of entire cities.

The project is designed to transform a rural landscape into a high-tech hub and generate thousands of construction jobs, but it’s also sparked debate over funding.

Battery manufacturer bails on highly-anticipated $1.2B lithium-ion plant in Arizona, CEO and founder steps down

We’ve seen countless stories about supply chain delays and what it means to address them, but the cancellation of a battery project in Arizona highlights the challenge on a whole different level. The decision by KORE Power to scrap its $1.2 billion KorePlex gigafactory highlights the difficulty companies are facing when trying to scale up, especially as rising construction costs and shifting federal loan priorities create a “valley of death” for capital-intensive projects.

KORE Power’s retreat reflects a broader industry trend where speed-to-market and capital preservation outweigh build-from-scratch goals that had previously been spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act. It will cost Arizona thousands of promised jobs, but also serves as a warning that without consistent policy, it’s going to be a challenge for the United States to produce batteries and other critical products that are essential to its re-shoring strategy.

Understanding Trump’s executive order declaring a national energy emergency and its current implications

We could have listed this piece first, but given all that’s happened since this news dropped in April, listing it last felt more appropriate. President Trump’s “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” marked the first time in the history of the United States that a president has declared a national energy emergency to bypass established regulatory frameworks, effectively centralizing control over the American power sector. By invoking the National Emergencies Act and the Defense Production Act, the administration fast-tracked fossil fuel, nuclear, and mineral projects while explicitly excluding wind and solar from the emergency definition.

We saw the ramifications of this news across 2025 and will undoubtedly continue to see them through the rest of the administration. It’s part of what is driving an unofficial federal mandate for utilities to focus on reliability and affordability at the expense of clean energy efforts that had been the focus of previous administrations. It represents a radical shift in energy policy that prioritizes traditional baseload resources as a matter of national security, which already has and will continue to compel legal battles over executive overreach and the future of the energy transition.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fact4.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:59:47.850162

This advancement in alloy development will also play an integral role in ensuring a supply of reliable, affordable material needed to produce substantially greater amounts of electricity and meet the demands of America’s increasingly power-hungry, data-driven economy.

The Lab’s NiCrMoNb (nickel-chromium-molybdenum-niobium) alloy possesses a unique combination of corrosion/oxidation resistance and elevated temperature mechanical properties and allows for improved durability over currently available alloys.

NETL’s breakthrough in alloy development was achieved through the development of three patents.

US 11,827,955 is the original patent issued and covers the composition of the alloy.

US 12,264,383 is the divisional patent covering the heat treatments for the alloys, including homogenization heat treatment and aging heat treatment. Homogenization is a heat treatment process used in metal alloys to achieve a more uniform chemical composition by allowing alloying elements to redistribute evenly through diffusion. The process involves heating the alloy to a high temperature, close to its melting point and holding it there for a specific duration before slowly cooling it. This creates a more stable, consistent and workable internal structure, enhancing mechanical properties and preventing product failure from areas of extreme softness or brittleness.

US 2025/0243564 is the newest patent application. It outlines NETL’s heat treatment schedule for the materials and the need for high chemical homogeneity. This is a result of the homogenization heat treatment.

“Such robustness is necessary to meet the changing needs that contemporary alloys were never designed to meet,” said Martin Detrois, a research scientist with NETL’s Structural Materials Team. “Future power plant designs are expected to operate at higher temperatures to meet the increasing demand for affordable and reliable energy. These developments are crucial to the United States leading the world in energy development and innovation.”

The advantages of NETL’s NiCrMoNb alloy aren’t limited to use in power plants.

“The same manufacturing principles behind the development of our NiCrMoNb alloy during the past four years can be applied to a host of other industries apart from coal-fired power plants,” Detrois said.

“These include natural gas, aero engines, power generation systems using fluids, nuclear power plants and molten salt reactors. The variety of potential uses and the cost savings involved make NETL’s NiCrMoNb alloy an attractive option to commercial users,” Detrois said.

“The electric school bus pilot project was an important first step in bringing GreenPower manufacturing and their high-quality jobs to New Mexico,” said EDD Cabinet Secretary Rob Black.","SANTA FE, NM — Electric vehicle manufacturer GreenPower Motor Company today announced an agreement with the New Mexico Economic Development Department (EDD) to establish operations in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, a small community along the U.S.-Mexico border about 20 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas.

Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, with facilities in Southern California and West Virginia, GreenPower manufactures and distributes all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty vehicles serving the cargo and delivery market, shuttle and transit markets, and the school bus sector.

The new 135,000-square-foot facility in Santa Teresa will serve as the company’s base for North American operations and its U.S. corporate headquarters. The move is expected to generate more than $200 million in economic impact for New Mexico over the next 10 years and create more than 340 jobs. The company plans to start setting up operations at the facility in Q1 2026 and begin production by June 1, 2026.

Fraser Atkinson, GreenPower CEO, told IEN the company plans to manufacture both the Type A Nano Beast and Type D Beast school buses as well as the Mega Beast school bus at the new plant. The company will also make its commercial line of Class 4 all-electric vehicles. GreenPower's long-term focus in the region will also include its vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology and charging systems.

The Type A Nano Beast school bus has a 118 kWh battery, a range of up to 140 miles and a 24-passenger capacity. The Type D has a 194 kWh battery, 150-mile range and capacity for 90 passengers. The Mega Beast has a 387 kWh battery, a 300-mile range, and the potential for greater uphill climbing power and V2G energy storage, according to the company's website.

GreenPower is the only electric vehicle OEM that manufactures both an all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission Class 4 Type A and the larger Type D school bus, according to Atkinson.

The company will receive a $5 million Local Economic Development Act (LEDA) award from the state and $4.6 million in job training incentive funds from the state's Job Training Incentive Program (JTIP). The company also qualified for a $1.36 million Rural Jobs Tax Credit (RJTC) and $3.65 million in New Mexico’s High-Wage Jobs Tax Credit program.

Santa Teresa's Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) designation had a significant impact on the company’s decision.

""A key factor in making the decision was Santa Teresa’s Foreign Trade Zone designation, which impacts how tariffs are applied and paid,"" Atkinson said. ""The FTZ allows GreenPower to streamline customs procedures and cost-effective import and export operations. Most importantly, it allows the company to take financial advantage of the designation related to inventory, parts and distribution.""

GreenPower uses contract manufacturing for parts and components outside of the U.S. Atkinson said the Santa Teresa FTZ provides GreenPower with a unique competitive advantage over other electric school bus manufacturers.

The designation also provides access to the North American Development Bank (NADBank), a financial institution established and capitalized equally by the U.S. and Mexico to finance environmental infrastructure projects along the border.

In 2025, GreenPower worked with EDD to launch the state’s first all-electric, zero-emission school bus pilot project at two Las Vegas public schools and a Santa Fe charter school. The ongoing two-year pilot program supports New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act, which aims to transition the state toward a 100% zero-carbon electricity supply by 2045.

“The electric school bus pilot project was an important first step in bringing GreenPower manufacturing and their high-quality jobs to New Mexico,” said EDD Cabinet Secretary Rob Black. “The real-world data and insights we are gaining from the pilot project will help inform New Mexico’s electric school bus roll-out and specifications, ensuring that fleets are safe, efficient and tailored to the unique needs of local districts.”

GreenPower will offer dealer-level pricing to the state for its Class 4 all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission commercial vehicles.

Cattle and other ruminant livestock are significant sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas; making them a high-impact target for short-term climate mitigation.

Reducing cattle-based methane emissions can be achieved through animal feed modification, improved manure management, and silvopasture practices.

The Global Methane Pledge is a key component of the broader strategy for agricultural methane reduction, creating an international force committed to a 30% reduction in global methane emissions by 2030.

When thinking about tackling greenhouse gases, look to your dinner plate. Cattle, pigs, chickens, and other livestock are all sources of methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and 27–30 times more potent over 100 years.

Cattle in particular produce significant amounts of methane because they are ruminant animals. The stomachs of ruminant animals contain a compartment called the rumen, which ferments partially-digested food to make it digestible. This fermentation produces enteric methane, which cattle emit when they burp.

Agriculture accounts for 40% of all manmade methane emissions, most of which are attributed to livestock. And according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s 1990-2023 Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks report, cattle produced 96% of all enteric fermentation methane in the United States in 2023. Globally, enteric methane from livestock accounts for about 60% of agricultural methane emissions and 25% of all human-caused methane emissions. In terms of the greatest single sources of methane emissions, livestock are second only to natural gas and petroleum systems (see the graphic below).

U.S. Methane Emissions by Source. Credit: U.S. EPA. Note: LULUCF stands for ""Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry.""

These emissions have real, felt consequences for the United States. Although methane’s atmospheric lifespan is shorter than carbon dioxide's (7 to 12 years versus hundreds of years), its greater warming potential leads to more immediate environmental repercussions. As a major greenhouse gas, methane fuels increasing global temperatures, more intense extreme weather, and more frequent droughts worldwide. Methane can also trigger the formation of tropospheric ozone (a major component of smog), which can cause or worsen health conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. However, methane’s shorter life span and greater potency offer opportunities to slow the rate of climate change in the short term if its emissions are reduced.

Reducing Methane Through Cattle Diet Alterations

Methane emissions from cattle can be tackled by going straight to the source—altering cattle diets with feed additives that inhibit methane or modify rumen fermentation. Methane inhibitors, like 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) and bromoform (found in red seaweed), reduce methane by changing the chemical structure of the key drivers of methane formation during the cattle digestion process. Seaweed is the most effective methane inhibitor, reducing emissions by more than 90 percent, followed by fatty acids and 3-NOP. Rumen fermentation modifiers, like ionophores, tannins, and essential oils, cause changes in the rumen environment, which improve the productivity, health, and digestive efficiency of the animal.

While bromoform-rich red seaweed is more effective in reducing emissions than 3-NOP, 3-NOP is more widely tested and approved, having received official approval in more than 65 countries. But the cost of adding 3-NOP to cattle feed is about $100–150 per animal per year, hindering large-scale use. Financial support mechanisms can help balance these costs. For example, several farms in the United States are using carbon credit programs to adopt 3-NOP. These farms track and report the emission reductions they achieve through 3-NOP use, creating carbon credits that are purchased by companies that need to offset their own emissions.

Red seaweed is being further explored as a possible feed additive, but synthetic bromoform has proved to be more effective, and will likely be more affordable. Red seaweed additive costs an annual $300–500 per animal, which is significantly more expensive than 3-NOP and very likely more costly than synthetic bromoform. However, synthetic bromoform use poses several challenges, including health risks if cattle are misdosed, harm to the ozone layer if the compound is released, and health risks to the people handling the compound. If used carefully, however, bromoform provides a compelling opportunity for methane reduction. Bromoform has not yet been widely approved for use in its natural or synthetic state, though trials are underway. One such trial—the longest and largest for seaweed additives for dairy cattle to date—found that seaweed reduced enteric methane emissions by an average of 52% and up to 90%. After this successful trial, the California Department of Food and Agriculture authorized the commercial use of a seaweed-based supplement, Brominata, as a cattle feed additive in 2022.

Reducing Methane through Manure Management

Although the majority of livestock methane emissions come from enteric fermentation, or cattle burps, 9.2% come from livestock manure. If left alone to decompose in place, manure releases high levels of methane into the atmosphere. These emissions may be reduced or even eliminated through anaerobic digestion, daily spread, or pasture-based management.

Anaerobic Digesters

Anaerobic digesters use microorganisms to break down manure and other organic materials in a zero-oxygen container, capture and optimize methane released from manure breakdown by producing biogas. The process also creates digestate, which can be used (if properly treated) as animal bedding or fertilizer. On the other hand, anaerobic digesters require regular maintenance and management, have high upfront costs, and the process involves strict permitting requirements.

Daily Spread

Daily spread involves spreading manure across cropland on a daily basis. Manure contains methane-producing microbes that thrive in low-oxygen environments. Spreading the manure outside in an oxygen-rich environment (as opposed to letting it pile up in a barn) renders the microbes inactive, facilitating low methane-emission decomposition. Daily spread is best suited for smaller farms in warmer climates, where manure can be distributed all year round.

Pasture-Based Management

Pasture-based management keeps cattle in fenced pastures, rotating them consistently between different grazing areas to spread their manure evenly. This practice is also very effective at reducing manure-based methane emissions, but it works best in areas where the cattle can be kept outside year-round with adequate feed. Limitations include inclement weather, increased labor and planning, and difficulties in protecting the quality of water bodies in grazing areas.

Mitigation through Silvopastoral Systems

Silvopasture refers to the practice of grazing livestock alongside trees. It has been used around the world for millennia, and provides benefits such as carbon dioxide sequestration, increased biodiversity, improved soil health, erosion mitigation, and a wider variety of food for livestock.

In addition to its environmental benefits, silvopasture offers a slew of economic benefits, including diversified economic opportunities in both the agricultural and timber markets and increased shelter and protection for livestock (shade from the trees reduces livestock heat stress while also improving pasture quality). Farmers also benefit from greater economic security, since the livestock provide a short-term revenue stream while timber provides a longer-term revenue source. This makes silvopasture a good opportunity for small-scale farmers.

Cattle-Produced Methane Reduction on the Global Stage

At the 2021 United Nations climate summit (COP26), President Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen introduced the Global Methane Pledge, which called on countries to take voluntary actions to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. Methane emissions were also a focal point of the 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil. As Brazil is the third-largest cattle producer in the world, agricultural methane emissions are a high-priority topic for the COP30 Presidency. Outside of official negotiations on the Global Methane Pledge at COP30, non-party organizations also held methane-related presentations, including one about the path to lowering livestock emissions. The Global Methane Pledge now has 159 participating countries, plus the European Commission.",,N,,2026-01-08 14:01:00.896154

No clean-energy loopholes: Utilities would be barred from using data center demand as a justification to weaken Michigan’s clean-energy laws.
His campaign said his opponents have supported tax exemptions for data center development without enforceable protections for ratepayers or the environment.
The campaign also emphasized that El-Sayed has never taken campaign contributions from utility companies that could benefit from rapid data center expansion.","With proposals of large-scale data centers spreading across Michigan, U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed on Thursday released what he called “terms of engagement” aimed at protecting communities from higher utility bills, grid strain, and environmental harm.

El-Sayed, a progressive Democrat running in the 2026 Senate primary, said at least 15 data center projects have been proposed across the state in the past year, including a planned 1.4-gigawatt facility tied to Oracle and OpenAI. His campaign said a project of that size would consume more electricity than the entire city of Detroit.

“We’ve watched as data center projects have proliferated up and down our state, raising alarm and concern about the impacts on water resources, electric bills, and safety,” Abdul said in a statement. “That’s because our local utilities have bought off the politicians who are supposed to regulate them–and because there simply hasn’t been the leadership to take on powerful corporations. These terms of engagement represent the bare minimum that data center projects should be able to guarantee if they want to move into our communities.”

He argued that utility companies are pushing to fast-track approvals without adequate oversight, even as residents face rising rates and persistent reliability problems.

The plan targets investor-owned utilities such as DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, which El-Sayed said have a history of rate hikes without improvements in service. His campaign accused utilities and developers of “steamrolling” local governments and regulators as communities scramble to understand the long-term impacts of energy-hungry data centers.

Under El-Sayed’s “Our Communities, Our Terms” framework, data center projects would be required to meet a series of conditions before receiving approval:

No rate hikes: Data centers would be required to pay for their own energy demand, preventing costs from being passed on to residential ratepayers.

Community transparency: Local residents would have a meaningful role in approvals and in negotiating community benefits.

Energy reliability guarantees: Projects would need enforceable commitments to improve, not weaken, grid reliability, funded by data center revenues.

Jobs guarantees: Developers would face penalties if promised local jobs fail to materialize.

Water protection: Data centers would be required to use closed-loop cooling systems to limit water use and pollution.

Community benefits agreements: Binding agreements would be required to deliver tangible benefits, such as grid upgrades, buried power lines, and improvements to water infrastructure.

No clean-energy loopholes: Utilities would be barred from using data center demand as a justification to weaken Michigan’s clean-energy laws.

Enforceability: All commitments would have to include clear penalties for noncompliance.

El-Sayed is competing in the Democratic primary against U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak. His campaign said his opponents have supported tax exemptions for data center development without enforceable protections for ratepayers or the environment.

The campaign also emphasized that El-Sayed has never taken campaign contributions from utility companies that could benefit from rapid data center expansion.

A former Detroit health director and Wayne County health executive, El-Sayed has built his Senate run around challenging corporate power and prioritizing public health, affordability, and environmental protection. His campaign said the data center policy is part of a broader push to ensure that large infrastructure projects deliver measurable benefits to the communities that host them, rather than shifting costs onto residents.

Investment Implications Across Development Stages Silver critical mineral designation creates multiple investment thesis layers that extend beyond traditional precious metals analysis.
Comparative Analysis Across Critical Mineral Classifications Silver critical mineral designation occurs within a comprehensive framework that includes both traditional strategic materials and newly recognised industrial inputs.","Strategic resource management has evolved beyond traditional commodity frameworks as governments worldwide recognise the intersection between economic security and materials access. Supply chain vulnerabilities exposed through recent geopolitical tensions have fundamentally altered how policymakers evaluate domestic production capabilities versus import dependencies. The systematic classification of materials as strategically essential reflects this transformation, where economic continuity and national security considerations converge around specific mineral resources that demonstrate both supply vulnerability and industrial irreplaceability.

Modern economies depend increasingly on materials that combine monetary store-of-value characteristics with indispensable industrial applications. This dual-nature creates unique policy considerations as governments balance market mechanisms against strategic intervention requirements. When traditional precious metals evolve into critical manufacturing inputs for defence systems, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced electronics, their classification transcends historical monetary frameworks to encompass broader security implications.

The silver critical mineral designation represents this analytical evolution, where a metal traditionally viewed through precious metals pricing dynamics now commands attention as an essential industrial input experiencing structural supply constraints. Understanding this transformation requires examining how regulatory frameworks evaluate material criticality, what policy mechanisms support domestic production capacity, and how these changes create new investment opportunities across the development pipeline.

Strategic Classification Criteria Transform Silver's Policy Status

Critical mineral designation operates through systematic evaluation frameworks that assess materials across multiple strategic dimensions. The Energy Act of 2020 established comprehensive criteria requiring materials to demonstrate economic essentiality to manufacturing capabilities, supply chain vulnerability through import dependence, and strategic importance to national security applications. Furthermore, the critical minerals executive order has reinforced this silver critical mineral designation, which qualified across all three evaluation criteria, joining an expanded list that reflects evolving technology requirements and strategic priorities.

Economic Essentiality Assessment examines silver's role in manufacturing processes where substitution proves technically challenging or economically prohibitive. Industrial applications consume approximately 539 million ounces annually according to The Silver Institute's World Silver Survey 2024, representing 45% of total global demand. Solar photovoltaic manufacturing requires approximately 130-150 milligrams per cell, translating to 15-20 grams per standard residential panel, creating persistent demand that proves relatively inelastic to price fluctuations.

Supply Chain Vulnerability Analysis reveals America's significant import dependency for silver requirements. The U.S. Geological Survey reports that domestic production covers approximately 40% of consumption, creating 60% net import reliance that exposes strategic industries to potential supply disruptions. However, this dependency ratio places silver among materials requiring policy intervention to enhance supply chain resilience.

Strategic Application Requirements demonstrate silver's irreplaceable properties across defence systems, semiconductor manufacturing, and critical infrastructure. The metal's superior electrical and thermal conductivity, combined with corrosion resistance, makes it essential for radar systems, missile guidance components, and electronic warfare equipment where reliability cannot accommodate substitute materials.

Primary Silver Supply Concentration Creates Geographic Vulnerabilities

Global silver production demonstrates concerning concentration patterns that justify strategic policy intervention. According to USGS data, Mexico produces 6,300 metric tons annually (approximately 202 million ounces), representing nearly 25% of world mine production. China contributes 3,600 metric tons whilst Peru adds 3,500 metric tons, creating a three-country concentration that supplies over 50% of global production.

Import Source Dependencies for the United States reveal additional concentration risks:

• Mexico: 41% of U.S. silver imports

• Canada: 31% of foreign sourcing

• Peru: 9% of import volumes

• Other sources: 19% distributed across multiple countries

This geographic distribution, whilst more diversified than some critical minerals, still creates potential chokepoints during regional instability or bilateral trade disputes. Silver's industrial applications in defence systems, semiconductor manufacturing, and renewable energy infrastructure make supply disruptions particularly problematic for strategic industries requiring operational continuity.

Processing Concentration Concerns compound raw material supply risks. China's significant role in global silver refining capacity creates additional dependency layers beyond mining operations. Raw silver concentrate requires sophisticated processing to achieve industrial-grade specifications, creating bottlenecks that extend beyond extraction activities into value-added manufacturing stages.

Industrial Applications Drive Critical Status Recognition

Silver critical mineral designation reflects the metal's irreplaceable role across multiple strategic sectors experiencing rapid growth. Unlike traditional precious metals valued primarily for monetary properties, silver's designation emphasises expanding industrial applications that demonstrate technical superiority over alternative materials.

Solar Photovoltaic Manufacturing Creates Structural Demand Growth

Solar energy deployment represents silver's largest and fastest-growing industrial application. The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2023 projects that solar PV capacity could triple by 2030 under current policies, driving sustained silver consumption growth. Each standard residential panel requires approximately 15-20 grams of silver for electrical connectivity, creating direct correlation between renewable energy expansion and silver demand.

Technological Efficiency Improvements in solar manufacturing have reduced silver content per panel through paste formulation advances and printing process optimisation. However, total sector demand continues growing as installation volumes expand faster than per-panel reduction rates. The Silver Institute reports solar photovoltaic applications consumed 161 million ounces in 2023, representing approximately 30% of industrial silver demand.

Thrifting Technology Limitations prevent unlimited silver content reduction without compromising panel efficiency and durability. In addition, silver's unique combination of electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and corrosion resistance makes it technically superior to alternatives like copper or aluminium for critical electrical connections where performance and reliability standards cannot accommodate substitution.

Semiconductor Manufacturing Drives Advanced Technology Demand

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 authorised approximately $52 billion to support domestic semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing. This massive investment in domestic production capacity creates additional strategic demand for silver used in advanced chip manufacturing where performance requirements exceed alternative materials' capabilities.

Electronics and Semiconductor Applications consumed approximately 70 million ounces of silver in 2023, including circuit boards, electrical contacts, and advanced packaging applications. Domestic semiconductor manufacturing expansion under CHIPS Act funding creates additional demand for reliable silver supplies that meet strict quality and security requirements.

5G Infrastructure Development and telecommunications advancement require silver's superior electrical properties for high-frequency applications where signal integrity proves critical. Advanced communication systems cannot accommodate performance compromises that substitute materials would introduce.

Defence Systems Integration Requires Domestic Supply Security

Military applications incorporate silver into radar systems, electronic warfare equipment, and guidance systems where reliability and performance specifications exceed civilian requirements. These applications require domestic sourcing to maintain operational security and supply chain integrity, making foreign dependency particularly problematic for defence procurement.

Classified Defence Consumption volumes remain undisclosed for security reasons, but the strategic importance of silver in defence electronics creates policy imperatives for domestic production capacity that extend beyond purely economic considerations. Consequently, this reinforces the broader defence materials strategy that prioritises supply chain security.

Medical Device Manufacturing leverages silver's antimicrobial properties in surgical instruments, wound dressings, and implantable devices. The global medical silver market reached approximately $2.8 billion in 2023, with healthcare supply chain security emerging as a national priority following pandemic-era disruptions.

Market Structure Justifies Policy Intervention Logic

Silver markets demonstrate unique structural characteristics that distinguish them from typical commodities and justify government intervention through critical mineral frameworks. Traditional market mechanisms prove inadequate to address supply constraints created by the metal's unusual production profile and demand characteristics.

By-Product Production Creates Supply Inelasticity

Approximately 70-75% of silver production derives from base metal by-products where silver represents secondary economic value rather than the primary revenue driver. This production structure creates fundamental supply inelasticity that prevents traditional price signals from quickly incentivising increased output.

Supply Response Disconnection occurs when copper, zinc, or lead prices decline, causing primary metal operations to reduce production regardless of silver price levels. For instance, this creates scenarios where silver supply decreases even during periods of elevated silver prices, violating typical commodity market relationships between price and production incentives.

Primary Silver Mines represent only 25-30% of global production, limiting the sector's ability to respond to price signals through dedicated silver-focused operations. These pure-play operations cannot compensate for supply disruptions from the larger by-product segment that responds to different metal price dynamics.

Mine Development Constraints have limited new supply growth as extended permitting timelines, capital intensity requirements, and historically depressed prices discouraged exploration investment over the past decade. The Silver Institute reports that global silver markets have experienced supply deficits in recent years, with 2023 showing an estimated 184 million ounce deficit.

Physical Market Tightness Indicates Structural Imbalance

COMEX Silver Warehouse Stocks tracked by CME Group have declined significantly, indicating physical market tightness that reflects genuine supply constraints rather than speculative positioning. Traditional commodity markets typically see inventory rebuilding during price increases, making silver's continued tightness particularly notable for market analysts.

Above-Ground Silver Stocks face additional pressure from expanding industrial consumption that reduces available supplies for investment and monetary purposes. Unlike gold, which accumulates in central bank reserves and private hoarding, silver experiences continuous industrial consumption that permanently removes material from available stocks.

Recycling Contribution Limitations provide some supply augmentation but cannot fully offset primary production deficits. Secondary silver recovery from electronics and industrial applications requires sophisticated processing and proves economically viable only during elevated price periods.

Federal Support Mechanisms Create Investment Opportunities

Silver critical mineral designation unlocks comprehensive federal support frameworks designed to incentivise domestic production capacity and reduce strategic import dependencies. These mechanisms operate through multiple policy channels that fundamentally alter project economics for qualifying silver operations.

Defence Production Act Authorities Enable Direct Investment

The Department of Defence announced approximately $600 million in Defence Production Act Title III funding for critical minerals processing and production infrastructure through fiscal years 2022-2024. These authorities enable direct government investment in domestic silver mining and processing infrastructure through loan guarantees, purchase agreements, and rapid capacity expansion funding.

Project Eligibility Requirements for DPA support typically require domestic location, strategic value demonstration, and capability to meaningfully impact supply chain security. Projects demonstrating substantial production potential receive preferential consideration for major programme participation versus small-scale producers.

Coordinated Agency Support through the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council provides streamlined approval processes for covered infrastructure projects, including critical mineral developments. The FAST-41 permitting process enables coordination among federal agencies, though specific timelines for silver projects remain project-dependent.

Tax Incentive Structures Improve Project Economics

The Inflation Reduction Act provides Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits for critical mineral extraction and processing facilities, with credits up to 30% of qualified expenditures. Section 45X manufacturing credits potentially benefit qualifying silver production operations, though specific eligibility criteria require regulatory guidance implementation.

Enhanced Depletion Allowances and accelerated depreciation schedules specifically targeting critical mineral operations improve project returns and competitive positioning versus international alternatives. However, these mechanisms compound over project lifespans, creating substantial value premiums for domestic assets.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credits under Section 45X provide production-based incentives for critical mineral processing, potentially benefiting silver refining and value-added manufacturing operations that support domestic supply chain integration.

Strategic Stockpiling Programmes Provide Demand Support

Government stockpiling initiatives create potential demand buffers that provide price floor mechanisms and long-term offtake security for domestic producers. Federal agencies can establish inventory targets that support market stability whilst reducing supply chain vulnerabilities, though specific silver stockpiling programmes require verification with recent government announcements.

Procurement Preferences in government contracts may favour domestic silver suppliers for strategic applications, creating market access advantages that international competitors cannot replicate. Defence contractors and infrastructure developers benefit from preferential sourcing arrangements that enhance revenue predictability.

Geographic Positioning Maximises Policy Benefits

Not all silver projects qualify equally for critical mineral support mechanisms. Geographic location, ownership structure, and operational characteristics determine eligibility for various government programmes and incentive structures that create competitive advantages for strategically positioned assets.

Premier North American Jurisdictions Command Valuation Premiums

The Fraser Institute's Annual Survey of Mining Companies 2023 ranks Nevada 2nd globally in the Investment Attractiveness Index, providing regulatory certainty, established infrastructure, and favourable tax frameworks that support premium project valuations. Nevada accounts for approximately 75% of U.S. gold production and significant silver by-product output.

Idaho Silver Production ranks among top U.S. producing states with established mining culture, experienced workforce, and proven regulatory frameworks that accelerate project development timelines. The Silver Valley region hosts historic high-grade silver deposits with existing infrastructure that reduces capital requirements.

Texas Jurisdiction Benefits include 20% corporate tax rates and business-friendly regulatory environment that creates competitive advantages for qualifying projects. The state's location adjacent to established mining regions provides access to experienced service providers and supply chain networks.

Canadian Provincial Frameworks in British Columbia and Ontario offer additional North American exposure with established mining codes, environmental standards, and political stability that international investors prefer for long-term capital deployment.

Processing Integration Enhances Strategic Value

Domestic Processing Requirements for certain Defence Production Act projects and CHIPS Act funding require domestic processing and value-added manufacturing to qualify for maximum support. Concentrate export models may not qualify for strategic programmes designed to enhance domestic supply chain integration.

Value-Added Manufacturing capabilities that produce industrial-grade silver products domestically align with supply chain sovereignty objectives and qualify for enhanced support mechanisms versus raw material export strategies.

Refining Capacity Development addresses critical processing bottlenecks by reducing dependency on foreign refining services, creating additional margin opportunities and strategic value for integrated operations.

Investment Implications Across Development Stages

Silver critical mineral designation creates multiple investment thesis layers that extend beyond traditional precious metals analysis. Government support mechanisms fundamentally alter risk-return profiles for domestic silver projects whilst creating competitive advantages versus international alternatives.

Development Stage Projects Benefit from Enhanced Economics

Risk-Return Profile Improvements through tax incentives, loan guarantees, and accelerated depreciation schedules enhance internal rates of return and reduce capital requirements for qualifying operations. These benefits compound over project lifespans, creating substantial value premiums versus projects without government support eligibility.

Financing Access Enhancement via government loan guarantee programmes reduces project finance costs and expands available capital sources beyond traditional mining finance markets. The Department of Energy's Loan Programmes Office has authority to provide guarantees for critical mineral projects under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

Permitting Timeline Acceleration through coordinated agency approval processes addresses historical development bottlenecks that have constrained project advancement. Predictable regulatory pathways reduce execution risk and enable more aggressive development schedules.

Operating Producers Gain Competitive Market Positioning

Offtake Security Benefits through government procurement preferences and strategic purchasing agreements provide revenue visibility that supports expansion planning and reduces market risk exposure. Federal demand creates price floor mechanisms that enhance cash flow predictability for strategic planning.

Market Access Advantages emerge as domestic producers gain preferential treatment in government procurement, infrastructure development, and strategic partnership opportunities. Critical mineral status creates competitive positioning that international suppliers cannot replicate.

Expansion Funding Support through various federal programmes enables capacity increases and productivity improvements that enhance operational leverage to commodity price movements whilst maintaining strategic supply chain positioning.

Comparative Analysis Across Critical Mineral Classifications

Silver critical mineral designation occurs within a comprehensive framework that includes both traditional strategic materials and newly recognised industrial inputs. Understanding comparative policy treatment provides context for silver's positioning within broader resource security strategies.

Rare Earth Elements Receive Maximum Support Intensity

Rare earth elements demonstrate 74% import dependency with extreme Chinese supply dominance, creating the most comprehensive support frameworks due to acute vulnerability and limited alternative sources. Silver's 60% net import reliance creates similar strategic concerns whilst offering more diversified sourcing options.

Dedicated Funding Programmes for rare earth development exceed support available for other critical minerals due to the strategic importance of these materials for defence and advanced technology applications. Silver benefits from general critical mineral programmes rather than material-specific initiatives.

Copper's Concurrent Designation Demonstrates Electrification Focus

Copper's addition to the USGS critical minerals list in 2024 marks the first time this major industrial metal received critical designation, reflecting increased focus on electrification infrastructure requirements. Both copper and silver benefit from renewable energy deployment policies and infrastructure investment programmes.

Shared Policy Support for electrification metals creates synergistic opportunities for polymetallic projects containing both silver and copper, potentially qualifying for multiple support programmes and enhanced government interest.

Infrastructure Investment Alignment through various federal programmes supports both metals' roles in renewable energy systems, electric vehicle charging networks, and power grid modernisation initiatives.

Uranium's Strategic Classification Provides Defence-Focused Support

Uranium's critical mineral status emphasises defence and energy security priorities through specialised support mechanisms focused on nuclear fuel cycle security. Silver's defence applications provide similar strategic value propositions, though less specialised than nuclear-specific programmes.

National Security Implications create policy support that transcends purely economic considerations, providing stability and continuity across changing political administrations for materials deemed essential to defence capabilities.

Mill Capacity Expansions increase throughput capabilities to handle growing ore reserves whilst improving operational efficiency through economies of scale and processing optimisation.

Aggressive Exploration Programmes focus on expanding existing resources and discovering new deposits within established mining districts, providing organic growth opportunities that utilise existing infrastructure and expertise.

2026 Catalyst Timeline Creates Systematic Value Recognition

The silver sector approaches 2026 with multiple technical and economic catalysts concentrated across the development pipeline, providing systematic de-risking opportunities and valuation re-rating potential as projects advance through critical development milestones.

Updated Mineral Resource Estimates incorporating 2023-2024 drilling programmes will demonstrate resource growth and grade improvements from high-grade discoveries, providing quantified metrics for comparing assets against peer companies and establishing updated project economics.

Technical Reports with Preliminary Economic Assessments enable comparative analysis through standardised metrics including net present value, internal rate of return, and payback calculations that facilitate institutional investment analysis and project ranking methodologies.

Reserve Estimate Releases qualify companies to publish formal production guidance under regulatory standards, providing revenue forecasting capabilities that support advanced-stage project financing and strategic partnership discussions.

Mid-Year Development Advancement Milestones

Construction Commencements following completed engineering eliminate typical development delays and provide immediate progress toward production startup, creating visible advancement that supports continued market interest and institutional participation.

Aggressive Drilling Programmes targeting 20,000-36,000 metres demonstrate systematic resource expansion efforts designed to grow existing deposits whilst testing exploration targets that provide additional upside potential beyond current development plans.

Metallurgical Test Work Completion de-risks processing strategies through demonstrated recovery rates and flowsheet optimisation, providing technical validation that supports project financing and reduces development execution risk.

Third Quarter Operational Milestones

Facility Commissioning including paste backfill plants and processing expansions enables throughput increases and operational efficiency improvements that translate directly into production growth and enhanced cash flow generation.

JORC-Compliant Resource Conversions through systematic drilling campaigns provide international reporting standard compliance that expands potential investor base and facilitates institutional participation from global mining funds.

Production Rate Increases from capacity expansions and operational optimisation create visible operational leverage that demonstrates management execution capabilities whilst providing enhanced commodity price exposure through increased production volumes.

Strategic Investment Framework for Critical Mineral Exposure

The convergence of structural supply deficits, expanding industrial applications, and comprehensive government support mechanisms creates a compelling investment framework that extends beyond traditional precious metals characteristics. Moreover, the critical minerals strategy has evolved to address growing supply chain vulnerabilities whilst recognising silver's dual role as both monetary asset and strategic industrial input.

Multi-Layered Value Proposition

Supply Security Premium emerges as domestic projects command valuation benefits through reduced regulatory risk, enhanced financing access, and government support eligibility that justify premium multiples versus international competitors facing potential silver tariffs impacts.

Industrial Demand Growth Acceleration through renewable energy deployment, semiconductor manufacturing expansion, and defence spending increases creates structural consumption growth independent of monetary policy cycles, providing demand stability during economic uncertainty.

Policy Support Optionality provides downside protection through government intervention mechanisms whilst maintaining upside exposure to commodity price appreciation, creating asymmetric risk profiles that distinguish critical mineral investments from traditional commodity exposure.

Institutional Validation through growing participation demonstrates recognition of sector investment merits, with institutional ownership percentages rising organically through open-market purchases and oversubscribed capital raises attracting established mining-focused investment managers.

Development Stage Risk-Return Optimisation

Resource Growth Leverage in exploration and development-stage companies typically provides greater sensitivity to metal price movements than producing companies with fixed cost structures, creating enhanced upside participation during favourable commodity cycles.

Government Support Access for domestic projects provides additional optionality through potential financing assistance, permitting acceleration, and procurement preferences that reduce development risk whilst enhancing project economics through multiple policy channels.

Discovery Economics Validation by companies demonstrating low-cost resource addition rates generates meaningful leverage in rising price environments, with efficient exploration programmes creating substantial resource bases at compelling per-ounce discovery costs.

Technical De-Risking Progress through systematic advancement of metallurgical testing, engineering studies, and permitting processes creates visible milestone achievement that supports continued institutional interest and reduces execution uncertainty.

The convergence of structural supply deficits, expanding industrial applications, and comprehensive government support mechanisms creates a compelling investment framework for silver assets positioned to benefit from this evolving policy landscape. Furthermore, understanding the broader context of silver supply challenges reinforces the strategic importance of domestic production capabilities. Projects demonstrating domestic production capabilities, processing integration, and strategic end-market exposure offer optimal positioning for investors seeking leveraged exposure to both precious metals appreciation and strategic resource policy support.

First, faster interconnection will be essential for data centers and other large loads to fully leverage VPPs’ speed and flexibility.
VPPs are ready to take center stage in this story, helping power data centers today while scaling up to meet the grid’s needs for decades to come.","Jesse Cohen, Mark Dyson and Lauren Shwisberg are colleagues within RMI’s Carbon-Free Electricity practice.

These days, it seems every power sector conversation leads back to data centers. Their boom is fueling electricity demand projections we haven’t seen in decades — with some forecasts suggesting nationwide demand could double by midcentury. Getting the power online to support this growth is no easy task, with projects stuck in interconnection queues that can stretch for years.

That’s if we can even get our hands on new power supply. A backlog in gas turbine deliveries and the limited availability of emerging options like geothermal and advanced nuclear power means the hunt for alternatives is urgent.

Fortunately, a solution already exists — one that can add fast, flexible capacity without building new gas plants or other major infrastructure. Virtual power plants, or VPPs, can meet rising demand in months rather than years.

VPPs are grid-integrated, dispatchable aggregations of distributed energy resources such as batteries, electric vehicles, smart thermostats and other connected devices. Despite the futuristic name, VPPs are already in use across the country. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, roughly 30 GW of VPP capacity is deployed today, with potential reaching up to 160 GW by 2030. That would be enough to cover about 20% of peak demand.

From grid edge to center stage

For VPPs to reach their full potential, more investment will be needed. Data center companies — which are set to invest close to $3 trillion in American infrastructure by 2030 — could be the perfect group to boost this market.

Done right, data center-funded VPPs could deliver broad benefits: data centers get faster, lower-cost power; utilities get flexible tools for planning smarter grid growth; the VPP industry gets the capital it needs to scale; and communities benefit from new distributed energy resources that deliver bill savings and resilience.

Reaching the scale required to meet soaring load growth will require new commercial models that let VPP providers, data centers and utilities efficiently share risk and unlock capital quickly. In our new policy brief, How Virtual Power Plants Can Help the United States Win the AI Race, we outline three:

Model #1: Data center-funded, utility-managed VPPs

In this model, a data center funds a utility-operated VPP — either directly, by sponsoring a project, or indirectly, by contributing to the utility’s demand-side management budget. In return, the utility grants the data center expedited interconnection.

Think of it as an evolution of the green tariff. In a traditional green tariff, the utility bundles electricity and renewable energy credits to match a customer’s load. Applied to data centers, the bundle could include a third attribute: speed-to-power.

This model works well where utilities want to retain control over planning and operations while tapping data center capital.

Model #2: Flexible ‘capacity credits’ for VPPs

Here, the utility or market operator first answers a question: Every time we add a megawatt of VPPs, how many megawatts of new demand can we support? The answer to this question determines the “capacity credit” that VPP owners can sell to data centers. Data centers can then bring this capacity credit back to the utility or market operator to get a faster interconnection.

The key advantage of this model is that it creates a new market linking VPP deployment to data center interconnection. This could allow for faster scaling than a model based on the utility facilitating contracts directly between data centers and VPP owners.

Calculating the capacity credit and verifying the VPP performs as needed are real challenges. However, we think that they are solvable, as utilities and market operators already do similar analyses to credit conventional power plants in capacity markets and integrated resource planning.

Read More in Grid Security & Reliability

Model #3: VPPs as reliability reinforcements

In the last model, the utility or grid operator establishes a flexible interconnection agreement with a data center that has made an investment in a VPP.

Under a flexible interconnection agreement, a utility allows data centers to connect faster if they agree to reduce their grid demand during specific hours. Most flexible interconnection concepts assume that flexibility would come from other solutions, like load curtailment or onsite generation. But offsite flexibility — contracted through VPPs — could provide the same reliability benefits, often for a fraction of the cost.

The policy unlock

Once we have the commercial models, we’ll need regulatory innovations that match their scale of ambition.

First, faster interconnection will be essential for data centers and other large loads to fully leverage VPPs’ speed and flexibility. Some regions, like Oregon and the Southwest Power Pool, are addressing this issue by piloting fast-track interconnection reviews when large loads and generators submit joint applications.

Second, to capture VPPs’ full value, regulators, utilities and market operators can promote integrated planning. VPPs can serve many purposes — from deferring upgrades to real-time balancing — but only if utilities and markets coordinate their planning and share the data developers need to target their investments.

Finally, policy must protect other customers. Several states are already designing large-load tariffs to prevent cost shifts, allowing users to bring their own generation or requiring minimum usage payments, long-term contracts and exit fees to reduce stranded-cost risks.

Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said: “The UNFCCC underpins global climate action.
It brings countries together to support climate action, reduce emissions, adapt to climate change, and track progress.
The decision by the world’s largest economy and second-largest emitter to retreat from it is regrettable and unfortunate.”","U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. will withdraw from a wide range of major international climate, clean energy, sustainable development, and other global cooperation organizations, including the landmark UN climate treaty, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), calling them “contrary to the interests of the United States.”

The announcement follows an Executive Order released by President Trump in February 2025, directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to review all international intergovernmental organizations in which the U.S. participates through funding and support, as well as all conventions and treaties. In a statement announcing the administration’s plans on Wednesday, Rubio said that the U.S. will withdraw from 66 organizations, describing them as “a sprawling architecture of global governance, often dominated by progressive ideology and detached from national interests,” and calling out “DEI,” “gender equity” and “climate orthodoxy” in particular as driving international organizations to “serve a globalist project rooted in the discredited fantasy of the ‘End of History.’”

The Trump administration’s move would make the U.S. the first country ever to pull out of the UNFCCC, a treaty with near-universal international participation, ratified in 1992. The UNFCCC is the parent treaty to landmark climate related agreements including the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which committed industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with agreed targets, and the Paris Agreement in 2015, a legally binding treaty requiring countries to set climate goals in line with the global goal to limit the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and calling on developed nations to provide financial assistance to less developed countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement during his first term in office, and again at the beginning of his second term, after President Biden returned the U.S. to the treaty in 2021. More recently, in a September speech at the U.N., Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

In a statement released following Trump’s announcement, Simon Stiell, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC called the U.S. move “a colossal own goal” that will make the country “less secure and less prosperous.”

Stiell added:

“It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses and infrastructure harder each year, and as oil, coal and gas volatility drives more conflicts, regional instability and forced migration.

“It will also mean less American manufacturing jobs, while every other major economy ramps up its clean energy investments, powering economic growth and energy security, and pushing renewables past coal as the world’s top energy source last year.”

In addition to the UNFCCC, the presidential order directs U.S. federal agencies and departments to with draw from organizations including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the key UN body focused on providing global policymakers with scientific assessments on climate change, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), which supports international cooperation to advance the adoption of renewable energy, and other climate and sustainable development groups including the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, the Global Forum on Migration and Development, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the International Energy Forum, the International Solar Alliance, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, UN Oceans, and the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, among others.

Environmental groups sharply criticized the Trump administration’s announcement, warning that the move would isolate the U.S., to the detriment of its own economic interests. Environmental Defense Fund Executive Director Amanda Leland said:

“The Trump administration’s retreat from the effort to reduce pollution and climate disasters will hurt the American people and businesses. It will turn over leadership to other countries, and the United States will get no say in these critical decisions.”

Representatives from other governments also criticized the move. Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, said:

Across Indiana, lawmakers and leaders are rolling out proposals that could affect classrooms, commutes, and the city skyline. While each issue targets a different area, together they show how policy decisions shape daily life for Hoosiers.

Indiana Lawmakers Target Ultra-Processed Foods in Schools

First, Indiana lawmakers are considering a bill that would restrict ultra-processed foods in schools that receive federally funded meal benefits. The proposal focuses on specific chemical additives found in these foods rather than banning entire products outright.

Supporters say the bill aligns with updated federal nutrition guidelines. As a result, they believe it could encourage healthier eating habits among students. In addition, schools would have to disclose ingredient lists on menus for greater transparency.

However, critics argue the bill lacks clarity. Some also worry it could unfairly impact meat products or create challenges for school food suppliers. If lawmakers approve the bill, it would take effect during the 2027–28 school year.

Governor Braun Pushes to Turn I‑70 Into a Toll Road

Meanwhile, transportation policy is also under review. Governor Mike Braun is seeking federal approval to convert I‑70 into a toll road. To move forward, the Indiana Department of Transportation has submitted a tolling waiver request.

Under the proposal, passenger vehicles would pay between four and seven cents per mile. However, Indiana drivers would receive toll transponders at no cost. The plan mainly targets out-of-state drivers who regularly travel through Indiana.

State leaders say tolling could help offset revenue losses caused by fuel-efficient and electric vehicles. Still, the proposal has raised concerns among drivers who rely on I‑70 for daily travel.

Downtown Indianapolis Set for Ritz‑Carlton and Live Nation Venue

At the same time, downtown Indianapolis is preparing for a major transformation. A Ritz‑Carlton hotel and a Live Nation-operated music venue are officially moving forward near Gainbridge Fieldhouse.

The project is being developed by Boxcar Development LLC, led by Herb Simon and the Simon family. It will replace the former CSX Building at South Pennsylvania and East Georgia streets.

City officials say the January 7 groundbreaking represents years of planning and collaboration. Governor Braun praised the development, noting it strengthens Indiana’s appeal as an amenity-rich destination for visitors.

It remains to be seen if the EV entrants from the last quarter in 2025 will make it a record year for EV sales in South Africa.","South Africa’s EV landscape is shifting gears as 2025 draws to a close. The Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI), alongside the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) and the uYilo eMobility Programme at Nelson Mandela University, co-ordinated the e-Mobility Energy Drive in October to promote EV adoption.

A road trip from Johannesburg to Gqeberha gathered real-world data on charging, energy consumption and infrastructure readiness, which will be used as research by the DSTI and SANEDI.

Acting Chief Director for Hydrogen and Energy at DSTI, Mandy Mlilo, says the initiative proves that clean mobility is not just a vision for the future; it is happening now.

“Through strategic partnerships with SANEDI, uYilo and Volvo, we are building public confidence in electric mobility, advancing our just energy transition goals and reducing our national carbon footprint,” says Mlilo.

WesBank, which offers vehicle finance and insurance solutions, argues that South Africa’s New Energy Vehicles (NEV) growth is more likely to come from the micro-mobility segment rather than high-end SUVs.

Valued at around R244 million ($14.3 million) in 2024 with about 3,800 units sold, which is roughly 10% of the two- and three-wheeler market, the sector has expanded by 20% year-on-year, according to its research.

With its lower upfront costs, cheaper ownership and local assembly potential, micro-mobility could form the foundation of South Africa’s EV adoption, it says.

But the arrival of Chinese automakers is a significant development for South Africa’s NEV landscape.

In September, BYD launched its highly anticipated compact city EV, the Dolphin Surf, at R339,000 ($19,865) for the Comfort model and R389,000 ($22,795) for the Dynamic, making it the first EV priced under R400,000 ($23,439) in South Africa.

This is notable, considering the launch price of the BMW i3 in 2015 was R525,000 ($30,760), and when adjusted for inflation, would cost ~R860,000 ($50,387) today.

It may be called the Dolphin Surf in South Africa and Europe, but in China, it’s the Seagull, which has sold over a million units globally since its April 2023 debut. BYD has not yet released local sales figures.

However, the company plans to install between 200 and 300 public chargers nationwide in 2026, making it the first Chinese EV maker to invest in local charging infrastructure, including ultra-fast 1MW chargers.

Geely has made a return to South Africa this November, shifting away from a previous distributor model, with the launch of the Geely EX5. The line-up includes a full electric and plug-in hybrid variant, priced between R630,000 ($36,900) to R800,000 ($46,847).

Another Chinese brand Changan, via distributor Jameel Motors South Africa, opened a flagship Pretoria branch in October 2025, with plans to rollout 25 dealerships nationwide.

It will sell hybrid, EV and ICE offerings, including the Hunter REEV, a range extender electric vehicle double cab; the all-electric Deepal S07; the petrol powered CS75 Pro SUV; and the Alsvin budget sedan aimed at the e-hailing segment.

In the same month, Chinese newcomer Leapmotor, through a joint venture with Stellantis, launched the C10 REEV, a family SUV EV with a petrol generator back-up with an extended range of up to 970km. The C10 is priced at R759,900 ($44,500), showing that the market remains oriented toward premium segments, but with a practical hybrid-electric bridge for long-distance travel.

According to the Automotive Business Council’s (Naamsa) year to date sales figures from Q1 till Q3 2025, there were 769 BEVs sold, compared to the 830 last year over the same period, with Volvo alone selling 348 of its EX30 models in 2024.

Today, Waterkeeper Alliance sent a letter to the Administrator of the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Lee Zeldin, calling on him to stop approving pesticides that contain or generate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Zeldin recently approved new PFAS-containing pesticides, including cyclobutrifluram and isocycloseram. In the letter, Waterkeeper Alliance notes that these approvals, along with Zeldin’s inconsistent representations of what constitutes a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance, undermine science and contradict his own voting record in Congress, allowing the chemical industry to evade oversight.

PFAS, commonly known as “forever chemicals,” contaminate drinking water sources, accumulate in soil and crops, and resist breaking down in the environment and human body, allowing these toxins to persist and accumulate for decades. Experts have linked exposure to cancer, immune suppression, reproductive harm, and impaired brain development of infants and children. Despite a growing body of scientific data raising concerns about the environmental and health risks associated with these chemicals, Zeldin’s EPA approved cyclobutrifluram for use on turf, ornamentals, romaine lettuce, cotton, and soybean seed, and approved isocycloseram, a new broad-spectrum insecticide, for use on citrus, potatoes, and Brassica vegetables. More approvals are expected.

“Approving new pesticide uses that introduce PFAS would lock in permanent pollution, transferring the costs of contamination from the chemical industry to communities, utilities, and taxpayers. Pesticide applications are a direct pathway for PFAS into surface water, groundwater, and the food system,” the letter warns.

Waterkeeper Alliance points to Zeldin’s reversal on the scientific definition of PFAS, which he previously supported in Congress, as evidence of alignment with the chemical industry’s interests. As a Congressman, he supported the 2022 and 2023 National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs), which defined PFAS as chemicals with at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom. By voting for those NDAAs, Zeldin supported the science-based definition of PFAS, which has been adopted by at least 24 states and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); however, he now claims single fluorinated compounds are not PFAS.

Recent polling shows that 92% of voters across the political spectrum believe protecting clean air and safe drinking water should be treated as a top priority. Beyond public opinion, the agency has a statutory responsibility to protect public health and the environment.

“No community should experience worse health outcomes because EPA has failed to enforce the law against corporate polluters. EPA must immediately reject any pending or future pesticide registrations that contain PFAS or degrade into them, and revoke existing approvals that perpetuate this scientifically documented toxic contamination. Anything less would be an explicit choice to allow permanent, preventable harm. Communities across the country are demanding protection from PFAS, not the expansion of their use,” the letter concludes.",https://waterkeeper.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/favicon-150x150.png,N,,2026-01-08 11:01:34.768063

AI Is Quietly Becoming an Energy Decision for SMBs AI adoption is often framed as a software or productivity choice, but research suggests its operational footprint is increasingly physical.
Energy Exposure Is Becoming a Competitive Variable Unlike large enterprises, SMBs often lack the scale to hedge energy costs or absorb volatility.
For SMBs, this means sustainability is increasingly evaluated through practical questions: Can the business support digital growth without destabilizing energy costs?
Executives who treat sustainability, AI, and energy as separate domains may struggle to control costs and maintain resilience.","For many small and mid-sized businesses, sustainability strategy has historically been treated as a reporting or compliance exercise—important, but secondary to growth, margins, and operational execution. That separation is breaking down. As AI adoption accelerates and energy costs become more volatile and localized, sustainability decisions are increasingly intersecting with core business operations in ways SMB leaders can no longer sidestep.

The shift is being driven less by regulation and more by infrastructure reality. Research from International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that electricity demand from data centers, AI workloads, and digital services is rising faster than grid capacity additions in many regions, tightening supply and amplifying price volatility. While much of this demand is attributed to hyperscalers, the downstream effects are already reaching smaller firms through higher commercial rates, constrained interconnections, and new utility cost structures.

For SMB executives, the implication is direct: decisions around AI, energy procurement, and sustainability are converging—whether planned or not.

AI Is Quietly Becoming an Energy Decision for SMBs

AI adoption is often framed as a software or productivity choice, but research suggests its operational footprint is increasingly physical. Analysis from McKinsey & Company shows that AI training and inference workloads can be several times more energy-intensive than traditional enterprise computing, depending on model size, utilization rates, and deployment architecture.

For SMBs adopting AI through cloud platforms, this energy intensity is largely invisible—until it shows up in service pricing, demand charges, or constrained access to reliable power. Cloud providers are already passing through higher infrastructure costs, and utilities in several regions are revisiting rate structures to account for data-driven load growth.

This creates a new reality for SMB leaders: AI adoption is no longer energy-neutral. It has cost, resilience, and sustainability implications that increasingly sit alongside traditional IT decisions.

Energy Exposure Is Becoming a Competitive Variable

Unlike large enterprises, SMBs often lack the scale to hedge energy costs or absorb volatility. Yet research from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that commercial electricity prices are diverging sharply by region, driven by grid congestion, infrastructure age, and demand growth from digital services.

For SMBs operating in energy-constrained markets, this divergence can materially affect operating margins. Facilities running AI-enhanced analytics, automation, or customer platforms may face higher peak charges or reliability concerns that directly impact uptime and service delivery.

In this context, sustainability strategy begins to overlap with risk management. Energy efficiency, load management, and on-site generation are no longer framed only as environmental actions—they are becoming tools for cost control and operational continuity.

Sustainability Is Shifting From Narrative to Operational Proof

What distinguishes the current moment is not rising ESG expectations alone, but the growing emphasis on execution. Research from World Economic Forum (WEF) highlights that buyers and investors are increasingly focused on operational indicators—energy use, resilience planning, and data governance—rather than high-level sustainability commitments.

For SMBs, this means sustainability is increasingly evaluated through practical questions:

Can the business support digital growth without destabilizing energy costs?

Are AI-driven efficiencies offset by higher infrastructure exposure?

Is sustainability embedded in operational planning, not just messaging?

Larger customers and partners, facing their own scrutiny, are cascading these expectations downstream. SMBs unable to demonstrate basic alignment between sustainability goals, energy management, and digital strategy may find themselves disadvantaged in procurement, partnerships, or financing discussions.

Why This Matters Now for SMB Leaders

The convergence of sustainability, AI, and energy is accelerating faster than most SMB planning cycles account for. Unlike regulatory shifts, this convergence is being driven by infrastructure constraints and market pricing—forces that move quickly and unevenly.

Early 2026 is shaping up as a transition point. AI adoption is no longer experimental, energy markets are increasingly localized and constrained, and sustainability expectations are becoming operational rather than symbolic. For SMBs, the risk is not falling behind on ESG rhetoric, but misaligning growth strategy with the physical and financial realities that now underpin it.

Executives who treat sustainability, AI, and energy as separate domains may struggle to control costs and maintain resilience. Those who integrate them into a single strategic lens—linking digital adoption to energy planning and sustainability execution—will be better positioned to compete as constraints tighten.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260107-082227-4f4-sustainability%20pressures%20for%20SMBs.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 15:00:40.947739

Moves in the US and Europe to pull back from electric cars hand Chinese automakers more opportunity to cement their lead in the transition away from internal combustion engines.

In two blows to the outlook for EVs, the European Commission in December abandoned its effective ban on combustion engine vehicles by 2035. A day earlier, Ford Motor Co. announced it would take $19.5 billion in charges tied to unwinding much of its EV strategy.

Those retreats create a gap that Chinese carmakers can fill, with companies like BYD Co. and Xiaomi Corp. making rapid advances with in-cabin technology, advanced driver-assistance systems and ultra-fast charging to further strengthen their position as leading producers of EVs.

“It’s really sinking in that the US or EU can’t catch up,” said Daniel Kollar, head of the automotive and mobility practice at consultancy Intralink Group.

Analysts at BloombergNEF last year forecast that global sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid cars will increase to 25.4 million vehicles in 2026, with China accounting for roughly two-thirds of the total.

The researcher’s outlook for the US is relatively bleak: It’s expecting plug-in car sales to plunge 30% in the final quarter of this year to the lowest since 2022. For next year, BNEF is projecting little or no growth due to the removal of federal tax credits for EV purchases and weakening of US fuel economy and emissions standards.

Europe is a key market for Chinese EV brands in search of growth and higher margins to offset a slowdown and long-running price war at home. While the backing away from the combustion engine ban and scaling back of incentives supporting EVs in the region could dent demand, Chinese cars still have room to maneuver, according to Yale Zhang, managing director of consultancy Automotive Foresight.

“It won’t have a direct impact,” Zhang said of the policy changes announced this week. Even with Europe’s tariffs, Chinese carmakers “have enough edge to compete.”

One of the main sticking points for drivers looking to make the switch to an electric car is price, an area where Chinese manufacturers have an advantage. BYD earlier this year launched the Dolphin Surf in Europe, a fully electric hatchback that sells for less than €23,000 ($27,000).

“There’s some real inefficiency in terms of European carmakers moving quickly and getting things done, and Chinese automakers going global shines a light on that,” said Colin McKerracher, BNEF’s head of clean transport.

The European Commission’s moves to dilute its ban on tailpipe emissions by 2035 shows a lack of will to do the “correct but difficult thing,” Zhang said. While it looks on the surface to be a positive move for European manufacturers, it will “inevitably lead to laziness and complacency.”

To be sure, Chinese EV makers are facing their own challenges, including slowing demand at home, intensifying competition and regulatory scrutiny. BYD’s total sales have fallen for three consecutive months, and the company is still producing one plug-in hybrid with a gas engine for every battery-only EV.

Chinese authorities are also reining in unreasonable price cuts and pressing carmakers to pay their suppliers faster, which could affect sales and cash flow.

While Chinese EVs have effectively been locked out of the US by punitive tariffs, they’re steadily making inroads in markets including South America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. A lack of competitive models from European and US automakers risks ceding those markets to Chinese players.

“In an era where you have to move really fast on new tech and new competition, you have to be fit for the task,” McKerracher said.

The United States set a new benchmark in global energy markets in 2025, exporting a record 111 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas. The milestone makes the US the first country to surpass the 100-million-ton threshold in a single year, reaffirming its position as the world’s largest LNG supplier.

The total places the US roughly 20 million tons ahead of Qatar and represents a nearly 23 million ton increase over 2024 figures. The growth was driven by new export capacity and sustained high utilization across major terminals throughout the year. LNG now represents one of the fastest-growing sectors of US energy exports, with demand rising across global markets seeking supply security and diversification.

Infrastructure expansion and utilization gains

Much of the surge in volume came from recently completed infrastructure projects. Plaquemines LNG, developed by Venture Global, began exports in late 2024 and shipped 16.4 million tons in 2025 alone. The facility’s rapid scale-up helped close a critical supply gap as global LNG demand intensified.

Other export terminals, including those operated by Cheniere Energy, ran at consistently high utilization rates, with December 2025 setting a monthly record of 11.5 million tons shipped. High throughput levels allowed the US to respond quickly to market demand, particularly in Europe, where energy security remains a priority.

New capacity additions are expected to continue in 2026, led by the first train at Golden Pass LNG, a joint venture between ExxonMobil and QatarEnergy. Smaller projects already online are also ramping up output, suggesting that 2026 could again challenge previous export records.

Global markets and shifting demand

Europe remained the largest buyer of US LNG throughout 2025, continuing to replace Russian pipeline gas and stabilize winter energy supply. In December alone, European countries imported around 9 million tons of American LNG, more than any other region.

Turkey significantly increased its purchases in the final months of the year, buying more US LNG in December than all of Asia combined. Asia imported just 1.23 million tons during the month. Egypt also emerged as a notable buyer due to domestic shortages, adding further geographic diversity to the US export profile.

This global reach is a reflection of US LNG’s flexible pricing and commercial structures. Free-on-board contracts, spot sales, and short-term agreements have made US cargoes attractive to buyers seeking to manage volatility and respond to short-term energy needs.

Supply strength and strategic positioning

The rise of the US as a top LNG exporter has been underpinned by its vast domestic natural gas reserves, sourced primarily from shale plays. This supply advantage allows exporters to offer competitive pricing and rapid delivery. The country’s Gulf Coast infrastructure is also well-positioned to serve both Atlantic and Pacific markets efficiently.

In less than a decade, the US has transformed from a net LNG importer to a dominant exporter. Its ability to quickly approve and build new capacity, combined with a commercially nimble approach to contract terms, has shifted global LNG dynamics in its favor.

Energy security remains a central driver for importers, particularly in Europe. The geopolitical reshuffling of global gas flows following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated the move toward LNG as a substitute. US exporters have capitalized on this trend, providing flexible supply at scale.

Outlook for 2026 and beyond

Looking ahead, the US LNG sector is expected to expand even further. Full output at Plaquemines LNG is anticipated in 2026, and the Golden Pass facility is preparing to begin production. Together with other projects in the pipeline, these additions could push annual exports well beyond current records.

Analysts expect global LNG demand to remain strong, driven by energy diversification, emerging market growth, and the need for reliable power generation as coal plants retire. The US remains well positioned to supply this demand, thanks to its scale, contract flexibility, and infrastructure momentum.

As the global LNG market evolves, the role of the United States is becoming increasingly strategic. The record 111 million tons exported in 2025 not only confirms the strength of US natural gas supply but also marks a new era in global energy trade, one where flexibility, reliability, and infrastructure speed are reshaping the competitive landscape.

I genuinely think that a prudent approach to managing American fossil fuel resources is preferable to treating the oil and gas industry like cigarette manufacturers.
Burning fossil fuels creates significant amounts of pollution, both particulates and greenhouse gases.
Given the actual state of technology, it’s a win-win-win for the American economy, for climate, and for American national security to try to get people to use American fossil fuels rather than imports from other countries.
In other words, the only people allowed to talk on American energy policy are funded by climate NGOs.","On December 18, I published an op-ed in the New York Times arguing that Democrats should approach the American oil and gas industry more like successful center-left coalitions in Norway, Canada, and Mexico do with their own fossil fuel industries. That is to say, broadly speaking, that Democrats should invest money and political capital in trying to reduce consumption of fossil fuels — especially by promoting technological changes that move the needle on global emissions — rather than in trying to stifle domestic production.

The argument is in part political.

Mark Carney and Claudia Sheinbaum have totally different political styles, but neither thinks it would be viable to win elections in resource-rich countries while opposing their countries’ natural resource industries.

Jared Polis, Michelle Lujan Grisham, and Josh Shapiro are the governors of the three blue states where fossil fuel extraction is most economically important, and they all support their states’ fossil fuel industries. And no one’s going to win in redder states like Ohio, Alaska, and Texas with a stance that’s to the left of Democrats in Colorado, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. And since there’s no path to a Senate majority that doesn’t involve winning those redder states, the national party may as well stop banging its head against the wall of an impossible supply-side agenda and focus on what it can achieve.

But my argument is also substantive.

I genuinely think that a prudent approach to managing American fossil fuel resources is preferable to treating the oil and gas industry like cigarette manufacturers. Burning fossil fuels creates significant amounts of pollution, both particulates and greenhouse gases. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, but a genuinely prudent approach involves both holding the industry to a high standard in terms of things like methane leaks and electrification of the actual extraction operations, and then also pushing for the resulting cleaner fossil fuels to be treated preferentially in global markets.

Oil and gas are not like tobacco or heroin, where net-net the world would be better off if they didn’t exist. We should try to build a world in which burning all these fossil fuels isn’t essential for a prosperous global economy, but such a world does not currently exist. Given the actual state of technology, it’s a win-win-win for the American economy, for climate, and for American national security to try to get people to use American fossil fuels rather than imports from other countries.

My original article wasn’t as detailed as a Slow Boring piece would be, but the point of publishing in the Times is to reach a broad and influential audience.

And I think I succeeded in a way that clearly scared some of the major green groups, which is one reason the piece attracted a lot of pushback, including most notably a long thread from Representative Sean Casten that I know circulated widely as a quasi-official rebuttal.

So I wanted to take the opportunity here on S.B. to respond in detail (perhaps tediously so) to my critics because, while I concede that the tradeoff of writing a sweeping ideas piece in the country’s premier newspaper is that the text had to be breezy, I believe the ideas are bulletproof.

The danger of epistemic narrowing

Many critics complained that I’m not an energy policy expert and/or alleged that I must be on the take from the fossil fuel industry.

I am, obviously, funded first and foremost by the more than 20,000 subscribers to Slow Boring, not by any industry. I do derive some income (less than 5 percent in total) from paid speaking, and I did one gig last year for TC Energy, a company that has significant natural gas interests along with some in wind, solar, and nuclear. If you want to believe that corrupted my judgment, I suppose I can’t prove that it didn’t. But I can tell you that I got a slightly more lucrative gig speaking at a Bloomberg Philanthropies event, and that my former Bloomberg News column was more lucrative than public speaking, and that Michael Bloomberg is a big funder of anti-fossil fuel advocacy campaigns that I don’t really agree with.

But these accusations weren’t restricted to my own supposed conflicts of interest. When actual expert Jesse Jenkins said that he mostly agreed with my take, Jeff Hauser of the Revolving Door Project claimed that he has an unacceptable conflict of interest because he started a company to deliver clean power to data centers and other large loads.

The basic idea here is that you should only listen to narrow energy specialists, but only those who don’t work with or receive funding from major producers or consumers of energy. In other words, the only people allowed to talk on American energy policy are funded by climate NGOs.

My conscience is clear, but my plea to Democratic Party elected officials and congressional staffers would be to consider how crazy this is.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7OU1!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9dc9649e-77ee-4124-8432-bdb4fd701cd4_8198x5465.jpeg",N,,2026-01-08 11:01:58.508966

Input from the communities most vulnerable to power outages will be crucial to ensuring grid investments address existing inequities.
At the same time, utilities and states must invest in renewable energy, moving away from the fossil fuels driving climate change and extreme weather.","CHICAGO (January 8, 2026)—Over the last decade, extreme weather events were the cause of the top 10 worst power outages in the central United States, according to new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). As climate change brings about more frequent and intense extreme weather events in the coming years, electrical grid operators such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), states and utilities must ensure the grid is adequately prepared. Failure to prepare for future extreme weather will mean more outages for more customers.

“MISO is in the middle of building the grid that communities will depend on for power for the next 50 years,” said Sam Gomberg, associate director of transmission policy at UCS and a report author. “What the region has experienced with extreme weather over the past decade, and what climate science is telling us to expect over the coming decades, should be a warning bell to MISO, states and utilities responsible for keeping the lights on.”

In reviewing the 100 worst power outage days in the central United States between 2014 and 2024, UCS found that 100% were caused by extreme weather. These outages left hundreds of thousands of customers without power, sometimes repeatedly and for days at a time. The top 10 worst outage events, measured by peak number of customers affected, left between nearly 800,000 and 1.6 million customers without power. The most damaging events were nearly always caused by multiple weather events occurring within a short period of time, like the August 2020 Midwest Derecho that produced more than 20 tornados. Sequential storms like back-to-back Hurricanes Laura, Delta and Zeta in 2020 pose another type of challenge, leaving hardly any time for communities to recover between events.

“When we look at the data, we see that the worst power outages in our country’s heartland are driven by extreme storms—and the best available science affirms climate change is making those storms worse,” said report co-author Dr. Susanne Moser. “As grid-damaging storms occur more frequently, areas directly affected have little time to rebuild before the next extreme weather event and end up spiraling into deeper and deeper vulnerability. Understanding the risks this poses for the electricity grid—and investing in the grid to mitigate those risks—is a question of safety for people and their families.”

The impacts of power outages caused by extreme weather are not borne equally. Disasters worsen social inequalities in compounding ways, displacing people from their homes, draining financial resources and reducing access to health care and emergency services. Power disruptions disproportionately harm low-income, the elderly and medically vulnerable individuals, which is why building a resilient electricity grid must center equity and the needs of those most at risk of being harmed by an outage.

“Extreme weather events can no longer be shrugged away as acts of God or system anomalies that we have no power to foresee or plan for,” said Dr. Rachel Licker, lead author of the report. “Many parts of the central United States are projected to experience increases in severe thunderstorms, including derechos and hailstorms, and greater rainfall from hurricanes that make landfall. Some parts of the region may see more intense snowstorms, as well. Policymakers need to increase the electricity grid’s resilience to worsening climate change-fueled extreme weather or people will lose electricity, heat and air conditioning when they need it most. Failure to act is negligence that some could pay for with their lives.”

The UCS report recommends grid planners assess future climate risks facing the central United States and develop strategies to limit disruptions to the grid. States, utilities and regional transmission organizations must go beyond reacting to extreme weather as one-off disasters and instead plan for and adapt to changing climate and weather patterns to build a more resilient grid. Input from the communities most vulnerable to power outages will be crucial to ensuring grid investments address existing inequities. At the same time, utilities and states must invest in renewable energy, moving away from the fossil fuels driving climate change and extreme weather.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-08 10:13:03.279492

The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 requires each inspector general to prepare an annual statement summarizing what the inspector general considers to be “the most serious management and performance challenges facing the agency” and to briefly assess the agency’s progress in addressing those challenges.

We identified eight top management challenges for the EPA for fiscal year 2025:

Mitigating the causes and adapting to the impacts of climate change. The EPA has prioritized addressing climate change as a core aspect of its mission to protect human health and the environment. It therefore needs to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote resiliency and adaptation, address cumulative and disparate impacts, and develop international partnerships.

Integrating and implementing environmental justice. Achieving environmental justice remains a whole-of-government focus and necessitates that the EPA harness agencywide coordination and make cross-program decisions that weigh cumulative risks and impacts to the communities that the Agency serves.

Safeguarding the use and disposal of chemicals. The public must be able to trust the EPA’s ability to identify the risks of using chemicals, including pesticides, and to provide safeguards for and verification of proper disposal, management, or remediation of toxic substances.

Promoting ethical conduct and protecting scientific integrity. To ensure public trust and program integrity, the EPA’s decision-making and program implementation must be grounded in sound scientific principles and its employees, especially its senior officials, must adhere to rigorous ethical standards.

Managing grants, contracts, and data systems. Effective management of grants, contracts, and related data is critical to reducing the risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and noncompliance with funding requirements, especially as the risks increase with the influx of $100 billion in supplemental appropriations under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act.

Maximizing compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The EPA’s monitoring and enforcement activities remain below ten-year averages, while the Agency’s ability to maximize compliance faces difficulties related to variations in permitting, management of delegated state programs, incorporation of environmental justice concerns, and uncertainties that may result from recent court decisions.

Overseeing, protecting, and investing in water and wastewater systems. The EPA has oversight responsibility for strengthening and securing the cyber and physical infrastructure at tens of thousands of public drinking water systems and publicly owned wastewater treatment systems. This critical infrastructure faces various threats from cyberattack, theft, vandalism, and other risks that can affect public health and leave communities vulnerable to the loss of clean water and drinking water.

Recruiting and retaining staff for new and existing programs. The EPA faces difficulties recruiting and retaining the number and caliber of employees it needs to accomplish its mission. The recent influx of supplemental appropriations underscores the Agency's need to complete workforce planning and support human capital development to maintain and grow its workforce so it can implement existing and new programs.

The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 requires each inspector general to prepare an annual statement summarizing what the inspector general considers to be “the most serious management and performance challenges facing the agency” and to briefly assess the agency’s progress in addressing those challenges.

We identified six top management challenges for the EPA for fiscal year 2026:

Managing contracts, grants, and associated data systems. Grants and contracts constitute a significant portion of the EPA’s annual budget. Effectively monitoring and managing grant and contract awards requires the EPA to maintain quality data that can be used to measure and track performance; ensure compliance with funding requirements; and reduce the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, Agency data systems that have poor quality data inhibit our ability to provide effective oversight of grant and contract awards.

Meeting statutory requirements for ensuring the safe use of chemicals. The public must be able to depend on the EPA’s ability to identify the risks of using chemicals and pesticides. Resource constraints, inefficient review processes, statutory deadlines, and expanded requirements for assessments and testing challenge the EPA’s ability to protect human health and the environment from potential chemical and pesticide risks.

Managing information technology modernization. The EPA may encounter challenges when modernizing its data systems and platforms, including when updating its numerous legacy systems, implementing cybersecurity measures, automating its processes, and adopting new AI technology. Ensuring continued support for EPA data systems and platforms is critical to preserving the quality of the Agency’s scientific and programmatic data.

Maintaining mission efficiency and effectiveness during organizational change. As part of a broader initiative to reduce the size of the federal government while also increasing accountability, the EPA reduced its workforce and initiated a comprehensive restructuring effort. The EPA needs to effectively manage the risks that the restructuring may have on its mission and operations, as well as ensure that its statutory mandates are fulfilled.

Managing cooperative federalism and state oversight. The EPA often delegates the primary responsibility of implementing and enforcing federal environmental laws to states. The EPA oversees these delegated responsibilities to ensure that state implementation meets minimum federal standards and that states expend federal dollars appropriately. The EPA needs to manage cooperative federalism principles to ensure that states consistently implement and enforce federal environmental laws.

Preparing for and responding to natural and manmade disasters. The EPA has prioritized increasing the speed, efficiency, and effectiveness of the Agency’s response efforts to natural and manmade disasters. Disasters like wildfires, flooding, train derailments, and hurricanes can adversely affect environmental infrastructure and leave behind hazardous materials. The frequency and costs of these events may challenge the Agency’s ability to adequately prepare for and respond to disasters that could impact critical environmental infrastructure and human health.

A local utility for the Panhandle Abraham insists Xcel has to go.","CANADIAN — Salem Abraham may not have memorized every utility pole in the Texas Panhandle, but he knows precisely which ones shouldn’t be there.

He’s mapped them across more than 300 miles in this region of treeless grassland, plateaus and canyons.

These structures have been marked as defective or dangerous by their owner, Xcel Energy, the Minnesota-based electric utility that powers much of the Panhandle. They are evidence, Abraham said, of Xcel’s failure to upkeep its infrastructure. And as long as they remain that way, tagged and unreplaced, each one of them is another wildfire waiting to happen, Abraham said.

“I think there are more fires in our future,” said Abraham, a business mogul who has taken a sharp interest in Xcel’s inspection operations. “And we’re going to keep having fires until we get the poles fixed.”

Nearly two years ago, a damaged utility pole owned by Xcel sparked the state’s largest wildfire in history, killing two people, scores of livestock and charred more than a million acres.

Abraham said the ranchland is just as vulnerable to more devastation. He said Xcel has put profits over safety, and that the cities damaged by the wildfires must demand that the utility do more to protect the region.

Abraham is using his largess to do that. He has created a new company that is leading a group of 11 Panhandle towns to put pressure on Xcel to upgrade its poles and other electric infrastructure.

Abraham and the constellation of cities are also laying the groundwork for a possible takeover of the electric utility.

The coalition, which includes the cities of Canadian, Borger, and Perryton, was announced in December, following the news that Attorney General Ken Paxton was suing Xcel. The lawsuit alleges Xcel misrepresented its safety commitment and ignored warnings about its aging infrastructure. It seeks compensation for property damage and other civil penalties.

“It makes sense to me that if you do such a bad job running something that you kill people, burn down houses, destroy billions in property and millions of acres, that you might get fired,” Abraham said. “Anyone working at their job that screws up that big should get fired.”

Xcel vehemently disputed Abraham’s claims.

Adrian Rodriguez, the president of the company’s Texas and New Mexico offices, said the company has taken dramatic measures to bolster its infrastructure, including expanding and implementing wildfire mitigation plans, replacing 1,400 poles immediately after the fires and adopting a $500 million taxpayer-funded plan to bolster wildfire protections required by the Texas Legislature.

Xcel, Rodriguez added, has also paid out hundreds of millions in financial claims, settled multiple lawsuits while negotiating more, and briefed emergency management officials across the Panhandle to include them in the company’s plans.

“We have engaged our community, and have achieved a high number of resolutions with those who were directly impacted by the Smokehouse Creek fire,” Rodriguez said.

A local utility for the Panhandle

Abraham insists Xcel has to go.

“I think the communities don’t really trust them anymore,” Abraham said. “I think we’ve got reason not to trust them. And I’m talking about the Minnesota bosses … because the local people, they’re our friends.”

A fourth-generation Canadian resident, Abraham grew up on his family’s ranch. The family has been in the ranching business for more than 100 years. He has built his own small empire that focuses on buying and selling other ranches, oil and gas properties and wind rights.

He established a company, Don’t Burn Me Services LLC, which the cities hired to consult on the process, according to documents obtained by The Texas Tribune. Agreements with each of the cities state that Abraham’s company “will recommend alternatives” for each city’s existing electric services.

Should his plan succeed, Abraham would split any profits a new utility makes with the cities — 65% for cities, and 35% for him.He’s also poised to recoup $2 million he expects to spend on the effort.

There are at least two different legal paths that could yield such an outcome.

Local government officials could issue a condemnation, triggering a legal process to take control of Xcel. The process allows cities to take over electricity distribution. To provide electricity, the region can establish locally run electric cooperatives — like Abraham’s — which function as nonprofits and elect boards. Abraham said it would be up to the cities whether to ultimately acquire Xcel’s electricity-providing infrastructure and equipment.

Paxton’s lawsuit could end with a settlement agreement with Xcel, which the attorney general’s office would negotiate, and could compel the utility to reach a similar result.

Whether the cities will follow Abraham all the way is an open question. The cities have signed the agreements and approved resolutions that could set up a seizure of Xcel’s operations. However, at least two city managers who spoke to the Tribune raised doubts it would come to that.

Borger City Manager Garrett Spradling said the utility was going “in the right direction.”

“We want to make sure that they are complying in a responsible way,” Spradling said. “We want to make sure that we’re taking a more active role in the oversight and making sure that what they are supposed to be doing is getting done and not just paper pushed through files.”

Borger, a town of about 12,000 people, is 50 miles north of Amarillo.

Replacing Xcel would be a complicated and remarkably expensive task, said Jimmy Glotfelty, former commissioner of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which regulates the state’s electricity.

Cities would have to function as a utility to maintain poles and wires, buying trucks and hiring workers to address infrastructure issues. Local officials would need to issue bonds or public loans to cover upfront costs. They’d have to learn how to buy and sell electricity and open call centers to interact with their consumers. It could take billions of dollars to achieve, Glotfelty said.

“All of those things are the responsibility of the investor-owned utility, and they’re very hard to replicate,” Glotfelty said. And the reason the companies are run that way, he added, “is because of the challenge with replicating them, and that makes it very hard for the consumer.”

Municipalities and electric cooperatives can — and sometimes do — provide utility services. But state law makes it even more burdensome to establish or take over an existing utility, as it is tilted to favor the free market, Glotfelty said. Nearly 80 electric co-operatives provide electricity services in Texas.

“The Legislature has decided over the years that they don’t want a bunch of new electric utilities in the state,” he said. “So they pass laws that make it harder for new electric utilities to come into our state and build things.”

Abraham, who is footing the bill for consulting and legal costs for the cities, said he believes that the outcome of Paxton’s lawsuit could result in a settlement by which Xcel covers the cost of the transition. The fines against Xcel exceed its ability to pay, which Abraham said makes it more likely that Xcel will agree to his terms.

“If Attorney General Paxton takes it over and basically says, ‘You guys have lost your company because you have so many fines,’ I bet we could get a good deal from him,” Abraham said. “Electrical engineers should run an electric company, and we have those in Texas, and they can run it well, and we can fix our utility and get back to living life and not have fire season anymore.”

Xcel plans on staying

Rodriguez, the company’s Texas and New Mexico president, said the company has taken ongoing measures to bolster its infrastructure and make cities safer, including implementing a wildfire mitigation plan, revamping pole inspections and adopting a legislatively required $500 million system to install more advanced technology.

Rodriguez said they would not heed calls to leave — and noted that more wildfires in the Panhandle had been started by unregulated power lines privately owned by oil and gas operators.

Xcel — which also provides energy in eight other states — could lose as many as 277,300 customers in Texas across 80 communities.

As part of its mitigation plan, the company created a meteorological monitoring system to identify conditions that lead to wildfires. This office is tasked with producing real-time forecasts and identifying long-term trends, including analyzing wind speeds and their relationship to outages and fires. Workers also installed cameras with artificial intelligence that can detect wildfires and alert nearby cities when they do. They’ve also implemented software that calculates risk for different wildfire scenarios.

It also adopted a wide-ranging infrastructure overhaul that includes wildfire-resistant equipment to reduce ignition risk and moves certain electrical distribution systems underground.

Xcel, in a statement, said there are 80 remaining priority one poles, which the utility brands with red tags. Those poles, which the utility replaces “on an expedited basis,” aren’t in high wildfire risk areas, the statement said. It costs between $1,000 to $2,000 to strengthen a pole. Replacing it altogether can exceed $15,000. Xcel has 1,338 poles, it said, that are due for replacement. Many of those are low priority, the company said.

“Since 2021, we’ve replaced more than 19,000 poles and invested over $111 million toward the safety and reliability of our wooden poles,” said Eran Moore, director of distribution design at Xcel Energy. “This is an investment in infrastructure that protects customers and communities while maintaining reliable electrical service during weather events.”

The utility’s plan additionally addresses pole replacements, transmission equipment monitoring and power shut-offs. Wood poles are inspected visually every 12 years. Older poles receive additional care, including remediation of rot. Xcel will increase aerial inspections of transmission equipment, as currently, those inspections don’t gather enough information. The areas surveyed will be divided into tiers, depending on wildfire risk. Xcel will also rebuild transmission lines.

“I certainly hope that we can bridge whatever misunderstanding or gap that there is for the work that we are doing and for which many of these communities have been a part of,” Rodriguez said.

Another city leader told the Tribune they trusted Xcel with the improvements but wanted more oversight. And they, too, said Xcel should remain as the local utility.

The utility should be afforded the chance to demonstrate how they’ve improved and strengthened their services, said Colby Waters, interim city manager of Perryton, 119 miles north of Amarillo. Waters said Xcel had been a responsible utility in his town of 8,500 and that the company always addressed the city’s concerns.

But he said Perryton’s City Council believes there could be negligence concerning the maintenance of the poles, and that the coalition awards give them more power to negotiate with Xcel — and to pay more attention to its Texas customers.

“Personally, I don’t like the idea of a governmental entity exercising eminent domain unless it is a really dire situation,” Waters said. “I think the City Council agrees that there potentially is negligence. There is a concern that maybe Xcel could be running their business differently in Texas.”",https://www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251229-Canadian-EH-39-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:02:02.073435

While Geely technically already maintains a U.S. presence through its ownership stakes in Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus, the automaker is now openly evaluating whether to expand further with some of its Chinese brands. The potential U.S. market push was presented to attendees at the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Geely showcased a broad selection of vehicles from its global portfolio.

As reported by Autoline, Geely head of communications Ash Sutcliffe was at CES to answer questions about the automaker’s potential foray into the U.S. market. According to Sutcliffe, CES was viewed as a global technology stage and a chance to introduce U.S. media to the design and technology of Geely’s products.

While a bit vague on the details, Sutcliffe said Geely is currently assessing expansion opportunities across multiple global markets. The company remains dominant in China, is growing rapidly in Southeast Asia, and is already well established in Europe. The United States, however, remains a pretty big question mark. Looking ahead, Sutcliffe said the automaker expects to make a decision regarding a potential U.S. market entrance within the next 24 to 36 months.

That all said, significant obstacles remain. Tariffs and broader trade policy represent some of the largest barriers facing Chinese automakers seeking U.S. entry. Sutcliffe acknowledged those challenges, and while the automaker has yet to engage with any U.S. states directly when it comes to domestic manufacturing, it could potentially leverage existing American production capacity through Volvo, which already operates a manufacturing facility in South Carolina.

Vehicle connectivity and data security are another major concern for Chinese automakers entering the U.S. market. Sutcliffe addressed those issues as well, stating that the automaker would comply with all U.S. data protection laws and regulatory requirements if it were to sell vehicles in the country.

All told, a potential Geely expansion into the U.S. could have huge implications for General Motors, which has faced numerous challenges when it comes to scaling its EV business. Although GM has had several notable successes as of late, Geely’s Chinese EVs could directly compete with GM’s electric offerings while applying pricing pressure in segments where GM is still trying to stabilize.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Geely-auto-show-January-2026-002.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:02:19.264674

Various Greenlee says 2022 GOP gubernatorial loser Tudor Dixon is primed for a comeback, perhaps as a lieutenant governor nominee.
The former Republican state House speaker’s corruption trial is slated for September 2026.","This time next year Michiganders will have a new governor and U.S. senator. It’s not hyperbole, then, to suggest that we’re heading into one of those pivotal cycles that can determine the state’s direction for decades to come. How will it all shake out? For our annual feature, we assembled a sextet of political soothsayers — Adrain Hemond, Jer Staes, Donna Givens-Davidson, Charlie LeDuff, Jason Roe, and Scott Greenlee — to tell us what their crystal balls tell them. (And next year, we’ll see whether any of it comes true.)

Can Mike Duggan win the governor’s race? Sure, but…

The now former Detroit mayor has no day job, piles of campaign cash, and the field effectively to himself until the two parties vote for their nominees in August. Plus, he’s running as an independent at a time when the public has soured on the nasty tone of partisan politics and gridlock in Washington, D.C., and Lansing. He’s also, according to GOP strategist Jason Roe, “running the best campaign of all the candidates in the race.”

“He’s as popular in the suburbs as he is with Detroit residents, and he has the perception of having been a very successful mayor,” Roe says.

Roe and Daily Detroit podcast host Jer Staes seem most optimistic about Duggan’s chances. “He’s well-timed for it,” Staes says. “If it’s the 2024 or 2028 cycle, maybe not, but this cycle is the Goldilocks year for someone like him.” And GOP campaign strategist Scott Greenlee also believes he’s “one of the few people strong enough due to name ID and fundraising ability to win a major race as an independent.”

Still, he’s running against history and some logistical issues. Many Michiganders vote straight ticket by habit, and persuading them not to will be exceedingly difficult, says Donna Givens-Davidson, executive director of the Eastside Community Network. “He’s trying to do it the hard way,” agrees Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond.

Podcaster Charlie LeDuff is especially skeptical: “Who’s going to be drawn to a big-city boss from Detroit? You’re gonna pull loads of people from Escanaba with billboards? Mathematically, I don’t see it. But yeah, there’s always a chance.”

Who will replace Gary Peters in the U.S. Senate? Probably Mike Rogers.

Republicans are poised to renominate ex-Rep. Mike Rogers, who narrowly lost to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin in 2024 despite President Donald Trump’s win in the state by 80,000 votes. The leading Democratic candidates — state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens, and epidemiologist Abdul El-Sayed — will spend the next eight months vying for the nomination. LeDuff says that helps Rogers: “Everything’s lining up his way. But more interesting is what kind of Democrat we get. A progressive? A centrist? It’s all very delicious.”

Greenlee agrees: “He came as close last time to winning a U.S. Senate seat as any Republican had since Spence Abraham in 1996, and he’s ready to roll. Unlike last time, the party is united behind him, too.” Roe doubts any of the Democrats will have the same statewide name ID or appeal.

Tellingly, none of the liberals on the panel are especially confident about their side’s chances, and they note that the outcome is probably most likely to hinge on current unknowns about the economy and mood at the midpoint of Trump’s second term. Rogers “won’t have the president’s coattails, but the Democrats have a contested primary,” Hemond says. “In gambling terms, this is about as close to a pick ’em as you get.”

Will trade relations with Canada impact Michigan’s economy? Absolutely.

Our panelists agree on that — but disagree on how. Hemond called the tariff standoff “extraordinarily bad for Michigan” because “the supply chain is bound up with the Detroit River. It will be extremely economically painful for Michigan.” Givens-Davidson and Staes both believe the feud will have long-lasting effects as Canada builds up its trade relations with China. “It is very hard for Canada or any country to take us as a serious negotiation partner right now,” Staes says. “I really hope that something happens, but the longer this trade dispute goes on, the more it hurts Michigan Republicans in the state, in the Senate, and in the Legislature.”

The tariff supporters among the panel have a different take. Greenlee thinks a new U.S.-Canada trade deal is coming that will be more favorable to American manufacturers because “more jobs will naturally be created.” LeDuff says that whatever pain the state endures was necessary to force a fairer trade relationship.

Roe agrees things will calm down: “There is a lot of interest from the business community and from the governments of both nations to put this hostile environment away.”

What blast of Michigan’s political past will make big news in 2026? Various

Greenlee says 2022 GOP gubernatorial loser Tudor Dixon is primed for a comeback, perhaps as a lieutenant governor nominee. “She’s been vetted, she’s been through the battles, and her name ID is still strong,” he says. LeDuff chooses former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, predicting he’ll “endorse somebody that is just so, so wackadoodle.” Staes believes former GOP Congressman Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump, will emerge as “the glue of a very disparate” post-Trump Republican coalition.

And while all of those choices are speculative, Hemond’s is ironclad: Lee Chatfield. The former Republican state House speaker’s corruption trial is slated for September 2026. “Particularly given some of the salacious nature of the allegations against him for which he is not on trial, I expect that that trial is going to get a lot of media coverage,” Hemond says.

Which Detroit pro sports teams will go to the playoffs? All of them. Who will go the furthest? The Lions

Partisans can find common ground: Our teams are great! And even though we asked these questions in late October before the Lions’ loss to the Vikings and second loss to the Packers, when we checked in with the panelists in early December, most stood their ground. “I said what I said,” says Givens-Davidson. Staes is not as confident, “As a lifelong fan…you never give up the ship — but it’s 70/30 they do not make the playoffs.” The group also thinks the Tigers have World Series potential if, as Roe urges, “they get some bats.”

Will Gov. Gretchen Whitmer praise or criticize Trump in her final State of the State? Neither

The governor spent 2025 trying to work with the White House, sometimes with humiliating results. Our panelists mostly agree that she’ll keep that up with an eye toward getting things done in her final year in office. “I don’t believe that she sees any wisdom in focusing on him,” Givens-Davidson agrees.

Greenlee believes she may want to praise him but won’t because that would hurt her should she run for president in 2028. “It would probably be a Democratic political misstep that would be held against her in the future,” he says. Roe doubts she has any kind words but says that she’s “made a calculation not to spend her last years in mindless fights with Trump.” She will eventually “position herself as an anti-Trump crusader within the party, but she’ll put that off until the last minute.”",https://cdn.hourdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2026/01/burning_questions_main_illustration_by_ryan_olbrysh.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:00:19.268550

Solar shingle manufacturer GAF Energy laid off 138 employees and closed its R&D facility in California in December.","2025 was marked by a radical economic shift for the U.S. solar industry, with a shorter window for federal subsidies and a presidential administration that is actively halting renewable energy developments. Import tariffs, universal inflation and high interest rates for project financing have also dampened the recent solar boom.

Bankruptcies, furloughs and layoffs have accompanied this sea change in the market, affecting installers, manufacturers and other groups within U.S. solar. Environmental business group E2’s latest “Clean Economy Works” analysis reported that as of October 2025, nearly 30,000 jobs that would have been created from new major clean energy projects were canceled.

Employment numbers in the solar and storage industries hit a record high to start 2025. The “National Solar Jobs Census 2024” determined that 464,053 people worked in U.S. solar and storage at the beginning of the year, more than triple the amount of people employed in the U.S. coal industry.

“Since these job totals are as of 2024, they do not reflect the seismic federal policy shifts that have occurred since a new presidential administration took office in January 2025 … we anticipate that this 2024 baseline will provide an important comparison point for how these policies have impacted the solar and battery energy storage industries when 2025 employment data is gathered in the coming year,” the report states.

Now, the Trump administration is shifting the ambitions of President Joe Biden’s clean energy policy back to fossil fuel sources. The total impact of this hasn’t been measured yet, but the effects on domestic solar are already apparent.

U.S. solar bankruptcies and layoffs

From a Solar Power World review of Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notices issued by state offices, at least 1,691 people working in U.S. solar were reportedly laid off in 2025, but these documents do not account for every job lost in the industry.

Two months into Trump’s second term, national solar leasing company Sunnova laid off 300 people — about 15% of its staff — citing high-interest financing and policy uncertainty as the reasons for workforce reduction. Then in June, Sunnova filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, leaving the market with millions of dollars owed to creditors, including its installer clients, and shedding a staff of more than 1,000 people. Sunnova’s assets and business operations were acquired by GoodFinch Management and are now under operations of its subsidiary Solaris Assets.

In a similar market segment, Spruce Power, a third-party residential solar financier, laid off 40 people and closed its Denver, Colorado, office in August, claiming the decision was based on company savings.

In August, former PosiGen CEO Peter Shaper sent a memo to nearly all employees informing them that their jobs were terminated. Per WARN notice filings, 293 PosiGen employees were laid off in Connecticut, Louisiana and Pennsylvania. PosiGen’s company mission was to expand access to solar energy by installing projects for low-to-middle income customers.

According to the employee termination notice, PosiGen intended to stay in business if it could find other financing sources, even recently obtaining a $600 million investment by private equity firm Brookfield Asset Management. But ultimately, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November.

“Hundreds of employees, including myself, were laid off with little warning,” said a former PosiGen employee who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Contractors and partners were left unpaid. Families who trusted our mission of ‘Solar for All’ were left in limbo.”

Blue Ridge Power, the EPC subsidiary of developer Pine Gate Renewables, issued layoffs for 517 employees between its Asheville and Fayetteville, North Carolina, businesses in September. David Sanders, president of Blue Ridge Power, again blamed “regulatory and capital market environments” as the primary causes for workforce reduction at the EPC.

Then in November, Blue Ridge’s parent company Pine Gate Renewables filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, selling off its businesses and its portfolio of solar and energy storage projects, with a pipeline of 10 GWDC underway.

Beyond installation and onto factory floors, the domestic solar manufacturing segment also experienced layoffs and closures in 2025.

Meyer Burger laid off 355 employees in May at its recently opened solar panel assembly factory in Goodyear, Arizona. Less than a year after beginning operations, the 1.5-GW PV module factory shuttered, with the company attributing the closure to funding issues.

Increased component detainment by Customs and Border Protection reportedly caused solar panel manufacturer Qcells to furlough 1,000 employees and lay off 300 more from its two plants in Georgia.

Powin Energy, an energy storage company based in Oregon with a global installed capacity of more than 17 GWh, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June. Solar shingle manufacturer GAF Energy laid off 138 employees and closed its R&D facility in California in December. Oliver Koehler, CEO of another solar shingle manufacturer SunTegra, decided to cease operations in October.

“We’ve been impacted by tariffs from the first containers we had on the water, literally going back to 2014,” he said in a feature published in October.

Mosaic, a solar and home improvement financier, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June. Vote Solar, an industry advocacy group based in California, laid off 11 people in August. And design platform Aurora Solar reportedly laid off 58 people in January 2025, according to state WARN notices.

The effect of federal opposition to solar has reached practically every corner of the industry. Perhaps not every job lost or company closure can be solely attributed to the Trump administration rescinding the subsidies that once bolstered the industry, but companies are largely citing this hostility to PV as the primary factor.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/swift-current-installer-stock2.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 09:59:00.146512

Toyota electrified vehicle sales reached 1,183,248 units for the year, an increase of 17.6% compared with 2024 and equal to 47% of total TMNA U.S. sales.

The results reinforce the central role hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery-electric vehicles play in Toyota’s U.S. product strategy, it said.

Toyota EV Sales

While full-year Toyota electrified vehicle sales posted strong growth, momentum softened late in 2025. In the fourth quarter, TMNA sold 290,840 electrified vehicles, a 1.9% year-over-year decline. Electrified models represented 44.6% of quarterly sales volume.

December followed a similar trend. TMNA sold 104,088 electrified vehicles during the month. Volume remained essentially flat year over year, accounting for 45% of total monthly sales.

Toyota Brand Posts Record Electrified Nameplates

Electrified vehicles drove much of Toyota’s brand-level performance. The Toyota division sold 1,051,397 electrified vehicles in 2025, an increase of 19.0%. Electrified models represented 49% of Toyota brand sales.

Despite late-year softness, Toyota recorded best-ever sales years for several electrified nameplates. Those included Corolla Hybrid, Camry Hybrid, 4Runner Hybrid, Land Cruiser Hybrid, Sequoia and Tacoma.

Fourth-quarter Toyota electrified sales declined 1.9%. December electrified volume fell 1.2%.

Lexus Electrified Sales Set New Record

At the luxury level, the Lexus division delivered its best full-year sales result. Lexus sold 131,851 electrified vehicles in 2025, an all-time high. Volume increased 7.2% and represented 35.6% of Lexus brand sales.

Unlike the broader TMNA trend, Lexus electrified vehicle sales rose 9.9% in December. Fourth-quarter Lexus electrified volume declined 1.6%.

“We attracted many new buyers drawn to our advanced technology and growing electrified offerings,” said Andrew Gilleland, senior vice president of Automotive Operations Group at Toyota Motor North America.

Electrification Footprint Continues to Expand

TMNA currently offers 30 electrified vehicles across Toyota and Lexus dealerships. The lineup includes a wide mix of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric powertrains.

In 2025, the company also advanced its long-term electrification investments. TMNA launched its first U.S. battery plant in North Carolina and continued investing across multiple U.S. manufacturing facilities.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Jan. 7, Del. Rip Sullivan (D-Fairfax) and Sen. Lamont Bagby (D-Henrico) announced they plan to introduce a bill during this year’s General Assembly session that would require Virginia’s power companies to increase the amount of energy they can store, typically in batteries.

However, Republicans said the cost of battery storage systems, which the power companies will pass on to ratepayers in the form of a rider, will negate any potential cost savings.

(Black PR Wire) Mayor Mary Sheffield is wasting no time making history—again. Just four days after taking the oath of office, Mayor Sheffield announced today that Detroit will be the largest city in the nation to participate in Michigan State University’s Rx Kids, a transformational mom and baby cash prescription program designed to strengthen family financial security and improve health. With an estimated 8,000 babies born in Detroit each year, this historic expansion signals a bold new chapter for Detroit—setting a new national standard for how cities show up for families when it matters most.

“Detroit has always been a city that leads with heart and courage, and today we are once again setting a national standard by ensuring that every mother has real support, and every baby has a strong start,” said Mayor Sheffield. “ I spoke many times during my campaign about a renewed focus on key quality of life supports that directly impact Detroit families. I am proud to say that as Mayor of Detroit, I have fought hard to bring Rx Kids to Detroit, and have made it a priority to launch this transformational program in the first 100 days of my administration. ""Mayor Mary Sheffield today announced the reappointment of five experienced city government leaders with proven track records in key areas of Public Safety, Finance, Law, and Human Resources.

Enrollment for Rx Kids in the City of Detroit is anticipated to open within the first 100 days of Mayor Sheffield’s Administration. For many families, income drops and financial stress peaks during pregnancy and infancy—one of the most consequential periods for lifelong health and wellbeing. Rx Kids responds by providing a $1,500 cash prescription during pregnancy, followed by $500 per month throughout the baby’s first six months. With no strings attached, the program trusts families with the resources they need during one of the most critical and financially vulnerable periods of parenthood.

Rx Kids is a program of Michigan State University, led by Mona Hanna, MD, MPH, pediatrician and associate dean of public health at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. The program is administered by the international leader in cash transfers, GiveDirectly.

Rx Kids is a public–private partnership made possible by historic, bipartisan support from the State of Michigan, which committed $250 million for expansion of the program over three years in the FY2026 budget, matched by philanthropic, corporate, and local partners.

“RxKids is the nation’s first-ever program that puts $4,500 directly in the pockets of new moms to help them care for their babies while improving their finances and health, and I’m so proud that Mayor Sheffield is expanding it into Detroit,"" said Governor Whitmer. “As families face the squeeze right now from high grocery, health care, and housing costs, we need to work together to make a real difference in their lives and ensure every baby born in Michigan gets a fair shot at a good life. With today’s expansion, we’re making it easier for every family with a newborn in Detroit to keep a roof over their head, put food on the table, and see a doctor when they need one. We will continue finding new ways to drive down costs, reduce poverty, and help more moms and babies live happy, healthy lives.”

The City of Detroit is investing $500,000 annually for three years ($1.5 million total), alongside generous support from The Skillman Foundation, GreenLight Fund Detroit, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, The Kresge Foundation, Skyline Foundation, Ballmer Group, General Motors, Jamie and Denise Jacob Family Foundation, Max M. & Marjorie S. Fisher Foundation, Community Foundation of Southeast Michigan, and Huntington Bank—with opportunities for additional match funders to join prior to launch. The annual $4 million private and public local investment will potentially result in $105 million in cash payments to moms and infants and could be a huge boost to Detroit businesses and the City’s economy.

As the local Rx Kids Community Champion, the City of Detroit Mayor’s Office will support Rx Kids outreach, engagement and celebration. A unique aspect of the Detroit rollout is the Sheffield administration’s focus on wraparound service partnerships. The Rx Kids community resource page for Detroit will also direct participants to a network of City and partner services that have been streamlined to provide quick and easy program signups.

“We will ensure that basic needs programs such as utility and housing assistance, transportation and even free income tax preparation services are available so that families can either save their funds, add to their funds or use these supports to stretch their cash disbursements as far as they possibly can,” Mayor Sheffield said.

Since its launch, Rx Kids has transformed the lives of nearly 5,000 families in over 20 Michigan communities, delivering more than $20 million in cash prescriptions. Families use the cash prescriptions for essentials like rent, utilities, food, diapers, transportation, and medical care—driving measurable improvements in financial stability, maternal and infant health outcomes, and child welfare, while reducing costly health care utilization and strengthening local economies.

“Thanks to Mayor Sheffield’s bold and compassionate leadership, today marks a historic and groundbreaking moment - the beginning of a new era for moms and babies in Detroit - one that will fundamentally change the trajectory of health, hope, and opportunity from the very start.” said Dr. Hanna. “As a former Detroit pediatrician, I’ve cared for families during some of their most vulnerable moments. This kind of bold, upstream investment doesn’t just improve health for moms and babies - it strengthens families, stabilizes communities, and has the power to lift the health and future of the entire city.”

Mayor Sheffield announced the expansion of Rx Kids to Detroit at a press conference today at Franklin Wright Settlements. She was joined by Dr. Mona Hanna, community partners and pregnant mothers.

Families looking to learn more about Rx Kids should visit RxKids.org. Additional city resources can be found on the City of Detroit website. A future announcement will be made when the program is set to go live and enrollment opens.

About Rx Kids

Rx Kids is a program led by Michigan State University and administered by GiveDirectly. Rx Kids is a public-private partnership made possible with generous support from the State of Michigan and a growing family of funders and supporters.

More potent than any prescribed pill, Rx Kids aims to improve health, hope, and opportunity. Science demonstrates the lifelong consequences of early adversity but also the promise of science-based, community-driven solutions. For many families, income plunges and poverty spikes right before a child is born and remains high throughout the first year. Built on the tremendous success of the expanded Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty to its lowest level in recorded history, and in line with global evidence, Rx Kids boldly reimagines how we care for each other by walking alongside families during the challenging time of pregnancy and infancy.

,EPA,2026-01-08 12:11:50+00:00,Clean Wisconsin,Federal rollbacks could leave wetlands vulnerable - Clean Wisconsin,Clean Wisconsin,,,,,https://www.cleanwisconsin.org/federal-rollbacks-could-leave-wetlands-vulnerable/,"The proposed rule limits federal jurisdiction to wetlands that hold surface water during the “wet season” (a vague phrase found nowhere in the Clean Water Act) and directly touch a river or stream with continuous water during that same period.
Clean water downstream depends on healthy wetlands and seasonal streams upstream whether or not we can see the connection on the surface.
Protecting them is essential to public health and ecological integrity, however several efforts in the past decade to erode our state water protections have been attempted, with some being successful, making ongoing public support for water protections a must.
Therefore, as federal protections weaken, state-level safeguards will play an increasingly central role in defending the surface and groundwaters that sustain our communities.
With your support, Clean Wisconsin will continue to advocate for state and federal groundwater and surface water protections to benefit every Wisconsin community.","It may seem like déjà vu, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released another proposal to sharply limit which waters are protected under the Clean Water Act—one of America’s most important environmental laws. Without changes, the proposed rule would remove federal safeguards from up to 55 million acres of wetlands and potentially millions of miles of streams across the country, leaving many waters vulnerable to pollution, development, and degradation.

The proposed rule limits federal jurisdiction to wetlands that hold surface water during the “wet season” (a vague phrase found nowhere in the Clean Water Act) and directly touch a river or stream with continuous water during that same period. This definition would exclude about 85% of the nation’s wetlands and many miles of headwater streams—particularly those that are seasonal, temporary, or lack a permanent surface connection. These waters play essential roles in filtering drinking water, reducing flood risks, and supporting wildlife and recreation. Losing protections for them puts public health and safety at risk.

This proposal follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA, which upended decades of precedent by re-interpreting the law to find that only wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to federally protected waters fall under the Clean Water Act. This radical interpretation ignored volumes of wetland science demonstrating that connections visible on the surface are only one of several ways in which water systems can be connected. Clean water downstream depends on healthy wetlands and seasonal streams upstream whether or not we can see the connection on the surface.

In Wisconsin, at least 20% of the state’s remaining wetlands—more than one million acres—are considered “geographically isolated,” meaning they lack the direct, permanent surface connection to navigable waters that the proposed rule would require. They could soon lose federal protection. These wetlands are hallmarks of Wisconsin’s Northwoods; they store floodwaters, recharge groundwater aquifers, sustain wildlife, and draw thousands of visitors each year.

Fortunately, Wisconsin is better positioned than many states to protect these wetlands from unregulated filling and destruction. The state became a national leader in wetland regulation when major, bipartisan legislation was enacted in 1991 and 2001 that cemented Wisconsin’s support for wetland protections. This long-standing commitment across political lines has helped to ensure our wetland and groundwater safeguards remain a priority. Under Wisconsin law, “waters of the state” include virtually all lakes, rivers, springs, marshes, ponds, drainage systems—even artificial water bodies. This inclusive definition reflects Wisconsin’s time-honored recognition that water resources are in fact interconnected. Protecting them is essential to public health and ecological integrity, however several efforts in the past decade to erode our state water protections have been attempted, with some being successful, making ongoing public support for water protections a must.

Wisconsin’s Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has affirmed that it will continue regulating non-federally protected wetlands to the extent that our state laws allow even if the proposed rule goes through unchanged. Therefore, as federal protections weaken, state-level safeguards will play an increasingly central role in defending the surface and groundwaters that sustain our communities. Wisconsin has a strong foundation—but maintaining it will require continued vigilance and public engagement. With your support, Clean Wisconsin will continue to advocate for state and federal groundwater and surface water protections to benefit every Wisconsin community.",https://www.cleanwisconsin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WI-wetlands-3.png,N,,2026-01-08 11:01:48.660612

Within this framework, renewable energy remains the dominant source of new capacity additions. Against this backdrop, the US is projected to more than double to around 1.06 TW by 2035 from around 414.5 GW in 2024, reveals GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

GlobalData’s latest report, ‘United States (US) Power Market Outlook to 2035: Market Trends, Regulations, and Competitive Landscape,’ reveals that renewable power capacity growth in the US is supported by state renewable portfolio standards and clean electricity standards, long-term utility integrated resource plans, and sustained corporate power purchase agreement activity from technology, manufacturing, and data centre operators.

Installed solar capacity in the US is projected to increase from around 231.4 GW in 2024 to approximately 737.8 GW by 2035, driven by state procurement targets, distributed generation policies, net billing and net metering frameworks, and large scale utility contracting across key markets such as Texas, California, and the Midwest. Onshore wind capacity is expected to rise from about 156 GW in 2024 to nearly 269 GW by 2035, supported by long term utility offtake agreements and state level clean energy standards in high resource regions.

Offshore wind development has faced repeated policy and regulatory disruptions since the start of 2025, contributing to sustained uncertainty across the project pipeline. Early in the year, federal authorities ordered a temporary halt to offshore construction activity at Empire Wind 1 off New York in April 2025, despite the project having secured federal and state permits and entered construction.

In August 2025, construction activity at the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island and Connecticut was briefly suspended following federal intervention, before a court decision allowed work to resume. The operating environment tightened further that same month when the Department of Transportation cancelled US$679 million in federal funding for offshore wind related port and logistics infrastructure. This sequence of actions culminated on 22 December 2025, when the Trump administration announced the suspension of five offshore wind projects following the halt of federal leasing and project approvals over national security concerns, placing Atlantic coast developments including Vineyard Wind, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Sunrise Wind, and Empire Wind on hold and delaying near term capacity additions.

Coal and oil-fired capacity continue to decline as ageing plants retire, while natural gas and nuclear power remain integral to the US generation mix. Natural gas capacity is projected to increase from around 573.1 GW in 2024 to approximately 620.9 GW by 2035, while nuclear capacity to edge higher from about 97 GW to around 102 GW over the same period.

Mohammed Ziauddin, Power Analyst at GlobalData, commented: “The US power sector continues to attract large scale investment in renewables, supported primarily by state-level clean energy mandates, long-term utility procurement programmes, and sustained corporate power purchase agreement activity. Between 2025 – 2030, renewable investment is expected to reach around US$442.2 billion, reflecting the scale of ongoing solar and wind development across key regional markets. At the same time, continued investment in natural gas and nuclear capacity reflects broader federal and state priorities around domestic fuel availability, industrial growth, and long-term capacity adequacy, including life extensions, and advanced nuclear development.”

Trade and tariff measures introduced in 2025 have added cost pressure and uncertainty across the power sector, particularly for renewable technologies reliant on imported components such as solar modules, wind turbines, batteries, steel, aluminium, and copper. Higher input costs have slowed project timelines, increased capital requirements, and contributed to delays and cancellations across parts of the development pipeline, even as underlying demand for new generation capacity remains strong.

Ziauddin concluded: “Despite policy shifts and tariff-related cost pressures, renewable energy remains the primary driver of capacity growth in the US power sector through 2035. Solar and wind continue to expand at scale, supported by state policies and private sector demand, while gas and nuclear investments address capacity adequacy and longer-term system needs. Together, these trends are reshaping the US electricity system into a more diversified and resilient market over the long term.”

Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.
He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate.
“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.
Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies.","WASHINGTON – The margin for error for Republicans in Congress was slim before the unexpected death Tuesday of Doug LaMalfa, a conservative rice farmer from northern California: 220 to 213.

Along with the resignation Monday of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former supporter of President Trump who held a Georgia seat, LaMalfa’s death means House Republicans can lose two votes on a given bill and still pass it. “It’s not a big majority,” Trump said when asked about LaMalfa’s death. “But it’s a unified majority, and it’s people that know what it takes to make America great again.”

There are four vacancies in the House, including the former seat of Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey’s governor elect.

Facing a challenging mid-term election period this November – the president’s party on average loses 28 seats in the House of Representatives – Trump and Republicans in Congress, who hold control of both the House and Senate, show no signs of breaking from the swaggering governance style they embodied in 2025, both state-side and abroad.

“Nobody can take us. Nobody,” Trump said Tuesday, days after ordering a military raid to seize Venezuelan president Nicholás Maduro.

Once he became America’s 47th president, in January 2025, Trump governed with a bare-knuckled approach, in particular on immigration and defense policy.

Backed with an immense public following, the commander in chief trained his ire against Democratic-leaning states, like New Jersey, where his administration canceled offshore wind projects, targeted climate grants, threatened transit projects and moved to jail Democratic officials. In the fall, after a group of lawmakers urged U.S. troops to disobey unlawful commands, Trump called their actions “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”

Domestically, Trump and his political allies punished critics, including Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10th), the target of a federal prosecution in Newark, and a New York senator over the Gateway train-and-tunnel project. He subverted the checks and balances built into the U.S. system of government, notably by installing loyalist Alina Habba without seeking her confirmation before the Senate. He refused to rule out a third term in the White House, something the U.S. Constitution bans. He and budget officials repeatedly broke the law, according to non-partisan watchdog groups, including by cancelling public-health grants. And he has surrounded himself with the trappings of a king: a military parade in the summer on his birthday, the bulldozing of the White House’s East Wing for a ballroom in his name and banners of his face on federal buildings.

“It’s just been so chaotic,” McIver said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “I never thought a bunch of grown people would not be able to work together for the betterment of the millions of people we serve.”

Workers in December hammered new letters, adding Trump’s name, into the facade of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts in Washington – an act that drew legal challenges in federal court.

Though Trump campaigned in 2024 as a populist promising to lower costs for the average American, his signature bill Congress passed into law will benefit the rich and hurt the poor, according to economic analysts.

“This is a reverse Robin Hood,” Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at the think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “It is taking money from people who need it the most and giving it to people who need it the least.”

The wealthiest 10% of households will get an average of $13,600 in benefits annually because of the new law, while those in the lowest 10% of the economic system will lose roughly $1,200 each year.

At the same time, that law will remove about 400,000 people in New Jersey from the U.S.’s largest anti-hunger system, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides benefits of $6 a day on average.

Historically, states have not paid the costs to implement SNAP – something the new law changed. And New Jersey is in a small category of states that may be required to pay extra, under language Republicans included during the marathon summer negotiations on the bill.

State legislators in Trenton and Sherrill, a former Democratic House member and the incoming governor, are bracing for the impact the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid, the federal health insurance system for the low-income and disabled, will deliver to the New Jersey state budget.

The state’s Department of Human Services estimates as many as 350,000 people in New Jersey could lose insurance directly due the law, and that, depending on how federal medical taxes are implemented, state hospitals could lose $2.8 billion.

“I think it’s probably fair to say this is the most significant federal legislation affecting Medicaid since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010,” Greg Woods, assistant commissioner at the department, said after passage.

When they wrote the law, Republicans in Congress front-loaded tax breaks for people and held off cuts to these food and health programs, a strategy that may shield their party at the ballot box in November.

“The mindset was just to get people really used to it, to get the states used to having to be more efficient and for the system to work better,” said Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd).

On the environment, Trump and his fellow Republicans in Washington have rescinded or watered down much of the Biden administration’s environmental legacy.

Beyond phasing out tax credits for renewable energy, such as a popular incentive for rooftop solar power, the Trump administration moved to eliminate the legal justification that allows the U.S. to regulate greenhouse gases altogether.

While Congress made sweeping changes to the economy through the Republican tax law, the Trump administration made policy changes that will touch the lives of regular people. It ended a federal program that allowed people to file their taxes for free. It undid a rule that would have limited overdraft banking fees to $5. And it threatened the future of the Gateway project, a lifeline for passenger and freight rail in the Northeast.

“The first thing that comes to mind is Trump’s decision with respect to the Gateway tunnel,” Rep. Nellie Pou (D-9th), reflecting Trump’s second term so far, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “That’s a huge, monumental problem for us.”

During his first term, Trump threatened to launch a barrage of tariffs – taxes on imported goods, passed on to the public. But his economic advisors generally talked him out of it. That was not the case in 2025.

Last year, in an effort to take back wealth “stolen” from the U.S., Trump, who as president can unilaterally impose or end tariffs, issued a barrage of tariffs on countries worldwide that cost the average U.S. household $1,200, according to research Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee, an arm of Congress, released last year.

“There’s obviously an endless litany in the ways people’ve been impacted by [Trump],” Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5th) said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. The tariffs and rising health care costs, after Congress declined to extend subsidies for the 2010 health law known as Obamacare, dominated last year, Gottheimer said.

“There’s nothing that hasn’t been impacted by that,” he said of Trump’s tariff agenda.

Premiums for New Jersey patients covered in the 2010 law will rise an average of 15.9% this year, from 2025 prices, according to state officials. Members of Congress are trying to find a way to extend the subsidies for the health law, a path to passage is hazy.

Perhaps the most striking changes with Trump back in Washington for New Jersey, where about 25% percent of residents were born in another country, came on immigration policy.

The administration moved hundreds of thousands of people through the federal immigration detention system last year and shows no signs of stopping.

The White House is eyeing Roxbury Township in Morris County for a possible new detention center, in addition to the use of a military base in South Jersey to hold then deport immigrants.

Asked this week about Republicans’ chances in the mid-term elections, Trump talked up his immigration policies. “We can’t let them forget that we did such a great job on the border.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/11/donald-trump-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 08:13:57.370407

Still waiting on VinFast assembly plant VinFast is selling cars.
VinFast has postponed opening the North Carolina factory until at least 2028, four years later than the initial target.
The carmaker hasn’t publicly withdrawn from the project, but North Carolina may not wait to find out if it will.
While Toyota’s North Carolina factory will likely someday make batteries for pure EVs, every one coming off the line now are being used in hybrid vehicles.","The nearly $14 billion Toyota expects to spend on its sprawling lithium-ion battery factory in Randolph County represents the largest single investment the company has ever made in North America.

About 2,500 workers at the plant make batteries for Camrys and Corolla Cross SUVs and soon the RAV4. Toyota expects to double its payroll there in the coming decade, as the company shifts away from strictly gas-powered vehicles to more hybrid and fully electric models.

“Around the country, there’s going to be a very good chance that your new Toyota hybrid, plug-in hybrid or electric vehicle will be powered by a battery that comes off the line in this facility,” Gov. Josh Stein said at a grand opening event in November. “We’re seeing our state becoming a national leader in the clean energy economy with Toyota leading the way.”

But the clean energy economy has also faced setbacks in North Carolina. About 16 miles from Toyota, in neighboring Chatham County, the multibillion-dollar plant Wolfspeed built to make materials for its silicon carbide chips used in electric vehicles remains quiet, with fewer than 100 workers.

And the $4 billion factory that Vietnamese carmaker VinFast said would assemble electric SUVs near Moncure remains unbuilt.

The Toyota, VinFast and Wolfspeed factories were announced within a year of each other, when government and company leaders said North Carolina was poised to cash in on the shift to electric vehicles. With EV sales falling far short of expectations, the results have been mixed so far, with some notable successes among high-profile failures.

Wolfspeed bet on EVs hasn’t paid off

Wolfspeed built the John Palmour Manufacturing Center for Silicon Carbide with one product top of mind.

“The electric vehicle has been and will continue to be the driving force behind the broad adoption of silicon carbide,” then-Wolfspeed CEO Gregg Lowe told investors in October 2022, a month after his Durham semiconductor company announced one of the biggest economic projects in North Carolina history: a $5 billion, 1,802-worker materials plant near Siler City.

After five years pivoting his Durham company away from its legacy name (Cree) and legacy business (LED lighting), Lowe was betting Wolfspeed’s unique silicon carbide semiconductor would power widespread EV adoption. “So this past quarter, 90% of the design-ins came from automotive,” he said during that fall 2022 earnings call. “And we’re seeing a tremendous positive adoption of silicon carbide in electric vehicles and a significantly steepening adoption of electric vehicles in the overall automotive market.”

The company used debt to pay for its Chatham campus, which Wolfspeed completed in March 2024 and named after its late cofounder John Palmour. But the money Wolfspeed spent constructing both “The JP” and a chip fabrication site in New York State’s Mohawk Valley contributed to its mounting debt, which exceeded $6 billion by the time Wolfspeed’s board voted to fire Lowe in late 2024.

Last summer, Wolfspeed ended months of speculation and filed for bankruptcy.

In September, the chipmaker emerged from Chapter 11 with new shareholders and a new direction. The word new CEO Robert Fuerle has emphasized is “diversification.”

“In aerospace and defense, Wolfspeed’s high voltage devices are enabling mission-critical systems where performance and reliability matters most,” Fuerle told investors in October. “These programs can diversify our revenue base and highlight the strategic importance of U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing.”

Then, after receiving nearly $700 million through a federal CHIPS Act tax credit this fall, Wolfspeed again underlined its desire to find more uses for its silicon carbide chips. “The company continues to focus on diversifying its power device revenue into key growing segments, including AI data centers, aerospace and defense, and industrial and energy,” Wolfspeed wrote in a Dec. 1 statement, “in addition to continuing to support the electric vehicle (EV) market.”

Wolfspeed’s dreams of hiring 1,800 workers in Chatham County are, for now, distant. As it careened toward bankruptcy, the company reduced its total headcount by almost a third — from more than 5,000 to 3,400, with layoffs impacting both its main Durham campus and the JP site.

The Siler City site isn’t running close to capacity, with Wolfspeed telling investors this fall that “underutilization” between the JP and Mohawk Valley plants cost the company around $47 million. “It’s built for high demand,” said one former Wolfspeed employee at the Siler City campus, who was laid off from the company in 2025. “A lot of the demand is still going through Durham (facilities).”

This former employee, who requested anonymity when discussing their work experience, estimated fewer than 100 people report to the Chatham County facility. During a weekday in late December, a News & Observer reporter drove by the plant, a stretching gray complex accented with Wolfspeed’s signature purple.

From the highway below, the factory parking lot looked empty.

A nascent EV industry begins to take hold

The electric vehicle business has paid off for North Carolina in other ways, however.

Two years ago, Kempower shipped its first EV charging system from a new factory in Durham, where the Finnish company established its North American headquarters. A few miles away, IONNA, a start-up created by eight of the world’s largest car companies, is working to build a national network of charging stations with 30,000 plugs by the end of 2030.

Both companies received state incentive packages worth up to $3 million for locating in North Carolina.

More recently, Scout Motors, a new subsidiary of Volkswagen, announced it would establish its corporate headquarters in Charlotte. The company, which is reviving an American brand that disappeared in 1980, will make electric trucks and SUVs at a plant in South Carolina and says it plans to create 1,200 jobs at its headquarters in Mecklenburg County.

If it meets its jobs and investment goals, Scout stands to receive $46.5 million in state tax rebates over 12 years.

Electric vehicles have also positioned North Carolina at the center of a potential “battery belt” spanning the Southeastern United States.

Between 2021 and 2024, the state landed Toyota and a slew of smaller battery component makers. While some of these projects have stalled amid a global glut of lithium-ion batteries, last year saw Toyota launch four production lines in Randolph County and the China-backed Green New Energy Materials move machinery into its battery component separator factory north of Charlotte.

Still waiting on VinFast assembly plant

VinFast is selling cars. On Tuesday, the young electric vehicle maker announced it had doubled its deliveries in 2025, to nearly 200,000.

But 85% of those deliveries took place in its home nation of Vietnam, where the company’s billionaire CEO is the country’s wealthiest person.

At least some of the remaining sales occurred in the Triangle, where a VinFast franchise dealership has operated for more than two years. Temporary signs still hang about the doorway of Leith VinFast, the only dealership in the Cary Auto Park to not have permanent signs. About 20 electric SUVs with dealer plates were in the parking lot recently.

Many more would need to be sold across the U.S. to justify VinFast’s initial plans to build a 7,500-worker vehicle and battery plant nearby in southeastern Chatham County. Founded in 2017 as a gas-powered carmaker, VinFast moved four years later toward exclusively producing fully electric SUVs as it sought land for a massive North American factory.

The speed of this search surprised North Carolina officials, but few raised concerns publicly when, in March 2022, VinFast announced it would open a plant near Moncure.

VinFast’s North American headaches began about a year later when reviewers slammed its inaugural VF8 model, which some within the company acknowledged was rushed. Robust sales never arrived. The company has reportedly lost more than $10 billion since pivoting toward electric vehicles, and by 2025, it had shifted resources away from the U.S. and toward new Asian factories.

“I truly wish we could have realized the full scope of the ambitious plans we initially set out to accomplish,” VinFast’s U.S. spokesperson wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing he had left the company in November.

VinFast has postponed opening the North Carolina factory until at least 2028, four years later than the initial target. But even this appears uncertain, as no construction has begun. The carmaker hasn’t publicly withdrawn from the project, but North Carolina may not wait to find out if it will.

In November 2022, the N.C. Department of Commerce entered an agreement with VinFast that gave the state the right to buy all or part of the company’s 1,765-acre site should it miss hiring and construction deadlines. Under the schedule, obtained by The N&O, VinFast must start making cars by July 1, 2026, to avoid a potential buyback, something it can’t do.

“My team in the Department of Commerce is in regular talks with VinFast to understand what its plans are and what that means for that site,” Gov. Stein told The N&O during a phone interview in November.

To attract VinFast in 2022, North Carolina and Chatham County combined to offer the EV maker more than $750 million in economic incentives, to be realized through tax rebates only if VinFast achieved its goals. The General Assembly also included $450 million in the incentive package for upfront site improvements, which state leaders frame as a worthy land investment regardless of which manufacturer ultimately builds there.

State and local governments offered similar incentives to Toyota worth $438.7 million. The package included a grant for creating jobs and money to prepare the site for construction and build roads and two highway interchanges off U.S. 421, the second of which opened this week.

Toyota popularized battery-powered cars in the United States with the Prius. But it has taken a more cautious approach to EVs than other companies, putting more emphasis on hybrids that combine internal combustion engines with electric motors. While Toyota’s North Carolina factory will likely someday make batteries for pure EVs, every one coming off the line now are being used in hybrid vehicles.",https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/rn52q7/picture314237258/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3A-LEAD.JPG,N,,2026-01-08 06:58:35.043570
,Detroit and Evs,2026-01-08 10:45:51+00:00,Raleigh News & Observer,NC set big goals for EV sales a few years ago. A lot has changed since then.,Richard Stradling,,,,,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article313616876.html,"Lower-than-expected sales and financial losses have prompted automakers to scale back their plans for electric vehicles.

They acknowledged that changes in government policy would hurt EV sales in the near-term.
Through his campaign, he did not respond to requests for comment about EV sales in North Carolina.
One final note about the market for electric vehicles: It may get a boost from another transportation technology that’s on the horizon — self-driving vehicles.","In January 2022, fewer than 36,000 of North Carolina’s 8.6 million registered cars and trucks were electric vehicles — either battery electric or plug-in hybrids.

That was the month that then-Gov. Roy Cooper issued an executive order setting a goal of growing that number to 1.25 million by 2030. Executive Order 246 also said the state would strive to have EVs represent half of all new vehicle sales by 2030.

They were ambitious goals, part of a broader strategy to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. But they reflected a growing expectation at the time that drivers would eagerly trade gas-powered cars and trucks for cleaner electric models, with backing from government policies and incentives.

Car companies such as Ford, Kia and Volkswagen were spending tens of billions retooling factories and developing new models of electric cars, SUVs and pickups, including an electric version of the best-selling Ford F-150. General Motors had announced a year earlier that it would stop making petroleum-powered vehicles altogether by 2035.

The outlook for EVs has changed a lot since then.

Lower-than-expected sales and financial losses have prompted automakers to scale back their plans for electric vehicles. GM no longer has a firm date for phasing out the internal combustion engine, and last month Ford said it had stopped making the all-electric F-150 Lightning and will replace it with a hybrid model that includes a gas-powered motor.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration and Congress have removed regulations and incentives meant to prod the country toward an electric future. Most notable for consumers was the elimination on Sept. 30 of a $7,500 tax credit toward the purchase or lease of a new EV.

EV sales hit new records in September, as buyers pounced before the end of the tax credit. Sales then plunged 50% in October, according to Cox Automotive, and were about 30% lower than the same month a year earlier.

It’s too soon to tell what the true market is for EVs in the U.S., says David Christ, who heads sales and marketing for Toyota in North America. Speaking at Toyota’s new battery plant near Greensboro this fall, Christ noted that tens of thousands of people still bought EVs in the weeks after the tax incentive went away.

“There’s no doubt there’s a market,” he said. “It will definitely be down, because $7,500 is a lot of money.”

The sharp decline in October sales marks the beginning of an adjustment period as the EV industry learns to live without government incentives, wrote Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive.

“This correction will separate manufacturers with genuine cost advantages from those dependent on subsidies,” Streaty wrote. “Success will hinge on production discipline, pricing realism, and focus on the fundamentals: cost, confidence and convenience. The market isn’t retreating; it’s recalibrating to its natural pace.”

That pace may be considerably slower than anticipated in 2022. The number of zero-emission vehicles registered in North Carolina has grown steadily since Cooper set his goal but still represented only about 7.5% of new car sales in the second quarter of 2025, according to Atlas Public Policy.

And at 137,156 by the end of October 2025, North Carolina is nowhere near on track to top 1 million registered zero-emission vehicles by the end of the decade.

Car companies still bullish on EVs long term

It was hard to detect much pessimism about electric vehicles at a media event last month at the Durham headquarters of IONNA, a company that’s building a nationwide network of EV charging stations.

IONNA was founded in 2023 by eight of the world’s largest auto manufacturers: BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. The goal is to help reduce the anxiety among car buyers about finding places to charge an electric vehicle, said Yuval Steiman, director of eco-mobility and market research for Hyundai USA.

“It will just be like going to a gas station now,” Steiman said. “It will just be there, and we won’t have to worry about it. It won’t be a reason not to buy an EV.”

Steinman and representatives of six of the seven other manufacturers took part in the IONNA event (only Honda was missing). They acknowledged that changes in government policy would hurt EV sales in the near-term.

But modest sales growth over the next couple of years will allow IONNA and the rest of the industry to build out the charging system the country will need, said Will Hotchkiss, chief operating officer for GM Energy, a subsidiary that integrates the electrification of home and auto.

“This gives us an opportunity to mend the nets when the fish are out,” Hotchkiss said. “So that ultimately when EV volumes do pick back up — because they will — we’ll be ready.”

Manufacturers say consumer sentiment gives them reason for optimism. A J.D. Power survey in October found that nearly 60% of people shopping for a new car or truck said they were likely to consider an EV. A separate J.D. Power survey of current EV owners earlier in the year found that 94% would stick with an electric vehicle the next time.

Those EV owners will bring others along, said Orth Hedrick, executive director of product management for Kia America.

“What we find from most of our consumers, the Kia owners that go from a gas to an electric car, they become advocates. They tell neighbors and their friends,” Hedrick said. “And once they get in one, they don’t want to come back.”

Can EVs win buyers without government tax credits?

In other words, the industry expects to benefit from converts like Paul Knudson, who teaches sociology at Methodist University in Fayetteville. Knudson was attracted to EVs because they’re efficient and better for the environment. The $7,500 tax credit helped him buy a more expensive Cadillac Lyriq last spring.

But it’s the feeling behind the wheel that will keep Knudson an EV driver.

“I just really like how smooth the drive is, how quiet it is,” he said. “And then the surge of torque, the surge of power, especially on hills. Driving in the mountains, it’s just so much better. Hopefully I’ll never have to go back to an internal-combustion car.”

The federal tax credit helped Jacob Bolin buy a base-trim Chevy Equinox EV for less than $30,000. Bolin works for Plug-in NC, a statewide organization that works to promote electric vehicles, and says he thinks the EV industry has matured enough and offers a wide enough range of cars and trucks that it will weather the loss of the tax credit.

One key, Bolin said, will be offering more affordable EVs, something automakers are starting to do. As it discontinues its pricey and money-losing all-electric F-150 Lightning, for example, Ford is investing about $2 billion in a Louisville, Kentucky, plant where it will make a new line of affordable EVs, starting with a $30,000 midsize pickup in 2027.

But even Bolin is skeptical that there will be 1.25 million registered EVs in North Carolina by 2030.

“Right now, if you made me bet my paycheck on it, I would say probably not,” he said.

Cooper’s EV goal was actually his second; in 2018, he issued an executive order that set a goal of 80,000 registered zero-emission vehicles by 2025, along with efforts to install more public EV chargers. The state met that goal more than a year early.

“We knew the private markets were shifting to electric vehicles so we set bold goals that would help North Carolina communities be ready,” Cooper said in the spring of 2024. “Now it’s happening even faster than we anticipated.”

Cooper finished his second term as governor later that year and is now considered the leading Democrat in the race to replace U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis. Through his campaign, he did not respond to requests for comment about EV sales in North Carolina.

One final note about the market for electric vehicles: It may get a boost from another transportation technology that’s on the horizon — self-driving vehicles. Autonomous taxis from companies such as Waymo, Tesla and Zoox are spreading in cities across the South and West, and so far, all of them are electric.",https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/l54uqw/picture314217454/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MAIN.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 05:59:44.940255

“We’ll follow market demand,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina, following a plant opening celebration in November.","Between 2021 and 2024, North Carolina welcomed a parade of lithium-ion battery factory projects promising to hire hundreds, if not thousands.

They were from companies you know, like Toyota, and ones you might not, like Forge Nano, Green New Energy Materials, Dai Nippon Printing and Epsilon Advanced Materials. Each was to be their manufacturer’s first U.S. battery facility, and North Carolina supported them with tax incentives, to be realized once these battery and battery component makers reached their respective hiring goals.

Then in August 2024, North Carolina officials celebrated another massive battery headline when the California startup Natron Energy committed to create 1,000 jobs at a future $1.4 billion sodium-ion battery “gigafactory” on a long-dormant site in rural Edgecombe County.

“I know that we’re walking through a door that will transform this amazing place that I call home in a positive way,” then-Gov. Roy Cooper said during Natron’s introductory event. “North Carolina is becoming the heart of the booming ‘battery belt.’”

The concept of a regional “battery belt” spanning the Southeastern United States came into greater focus when the election of President Joe Biden inspired rosy forecasts on how many Americans would swap their gas-powered cars for more energy-efficient electric vehicles. The Biden-backed Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 encouraged EV sales (through a $7,500 federal tax credit) and stipulated that the lithium-ion batteries powering these vehicles be U.S.-built.

Southern states drew an outsized number of the incoming battery projects, offering a cocktail of local incentives, available workers, available land and relatively cheap energy. Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina each announced electric vehicle battery plants in the early 2020s, with North Carolina adding its own sizable notches to the belt.

Lithium prices were climbing in December 2021, when Toyota unveiled plans to open a hybrid and electric battery factory on a megasite south of Greensboro, near the small Randolph County town of Liberty. It was to be the Japanese car company’s first foreign battery plant.

This announcement was followed months later by an even bigger jobs deal. The Vietnamese startup VinFast vowed to create 7,500 jobs at an incoming electric vehicle and battery factory in southeastern Chatham County.

Then, within seven months straddling 2023 and 2024, Forge Nano, Green New Energy Materials, Dai Nippon Printing and Epsilon Advanced Materials all said they were coming to various sites across the state. Forge picked the Triangle for a 200-plus-job “gigafactory.” Epsilon identified the coast. Green New Energy Materials and Dai Nippon Printing found locations north of Charlotte.

“We are extremely excited to launch Forge Battery in the Battery Belt,” Forge Nano CEO Paul Lichty said in a statement at the time.

NC battery projects: Delayed, uncertain futures

Now entering 2026, the lithium-ion battery picture looks very different — though Forge Nano’s planned gigafactory in Morrisville looked much the same on the first weekday of the new year: silent, without a car in the parking lot or sign of machinery within.

As manufacturers rushed into the battery sector earlier this decade, actual EV consumer adoption, while increasing, fell below projections. This caused a battery oversupply, exasperated by aggressive Chinese production. Material prices as a result plummeted; a metric ton of lithium today costs less than a quarter of its peak price in late 2022. According to Bloomberg’s strategic research division, lithium-ion battery pack prices reached a record-low in December, at $108 per kilowatt-hour.

Sinking lithium prices may have already contributed to the downfall of the biggest North Carolina jobs project of 2024, Natron Energy’s sodium-ion battery campus. The clear advantage sodium-ion holds over lithium-ion, its abundance, has been undercut by lithium oversupply. “Lithium carbonate prices have crashed by more than 70% over the past several years, negatively impacting the business case for sodium-ion batteries,” S&P Global wrote in June.

In an internal email last September obtained by The News & Observer, Natron officials informed staff their company was going out of business.

Lithium-ion manufacturers whose plans hinge on people driving EVs lost White House allies when President Donald Trump retook office in January 2025. On his first day, Trump rescinded a Biden executive order that called for half of the new cars and trucks sold in the U.S. in 2030 to be emissions-free. With the later passage of his One Big Beautiful Bill, Trump succeeded in removing the electric vehicle tax credit championed by his predecessor.

The emerging Southern battery belt has taken hits. In June, the zero-emissions battery cell maker AESC stopped building a $1.6 billion plant in South Carolina, citing “policy and market uncertainty.” A joint venture between Ford and the South Korean company SK On dissolved in December, with Ford exiting a planned battery site in Tennessee — and SK On expecting to focus more of that plant’s resources on stationary energy storage.

In North Carolina, the status of the battery belt projects are mixed, though there are some similar signs:

Epsilon Advanced Materials has delayed the launch of its 500-worker graphite anode material plant near Wilmington from 2026 to 2028, with CEO Sunit Kapur citing “regulatory requirements, customer alignment, and current market conditions” in an emailed statement.

The Japanese lithium-ion battery pouch producer Dai Nippon Printing had committed to creating 352 jobs at a new plant 50 miles northeast of Charlotte in the unincorporated Davidson County community of Linwood. Production would focus on lithium-ion battery pouches to power EVs. Dai Nippon, under its state incentive grant agreement, said it would hire starting this year and through 2029. In an emailed statement, company spokesperson Yusuke Kitagawa wrote, “We are monitoring trends in the EV market and will move forward at an appropriate time. We regret that we cannot disclose further details at this stage.”

In January 2025, Forge Nano spokesperson Will McKenna told The News & Observer his Colorado company planned to open its Morrisville facility this year, when it would make niche EV batteries for aerospace and defense applications. The factory currently appears unoccupied. Forge representatives did not respond to multiple emails requesting a site update for this story.

VinFast has delayed its promised North Carolina vehicle factory until at least 2028 — four years later than the company’s initial timeline — as VinFast has shifted resources to Asia following lowly North American sales. Under a previous agreement, North Carolina will gain the right to purchase the Chatham County megasite from the automaker starting in July.

Battery Belt wins

North Carolina’s embrace of the battery belt has already delivered investments, jobs and batteries. Near the end of 2025, Chinese-backed Green New Energy Materials installed machinery into its battery component separator factory north of Charlotte, in the unincorporated town of Denver. “They are hiring, planning for production and hope to begin operations early in the first quarter of 2026,” wrote Kara Brown of the Lincoln County Economic Development Association in an email.

Toyota has delivered North Carolina’s biggest battery splash to date, shipping its first car batteries from Randolph County last spring. The site currently employs around 2,500 workers and runs four hybrid battery production lines. Toyota officials foresee the local headcount exceeding 5,000 by 2034 as it expands to 14 lines.

Each line can be made to produce hybrid, plug-in hybrid or all-electric vehicle batteries. Toyota has prioritized hybrids over fully-electric cars — both globally and at its North Carolina factory — a decision executives say has been profitable as the EV market softened.

“We’ll follow market demand,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina, following a plant opening celebration in November.

North Carolina will keep itself open to businesses that support fuel efficient vehicles, Gov. Josh Stein said during a Dec. 3 press conference on the state economy. “I’m still bullish on electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, hybrid cars,” he said. “Clearly, the market has dipped a little bit. The demand isn’t quite as high as what initial expectations were.”",https://www.newsobserver.com/public/latest-news/nljuj2/picture314237653/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/LEAD.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 06:58:38.261552

The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide.
In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide.","Ethylene oxide was once considered an unremarkable pollutant. The colourless gas seeped from relatively few industrial facilities and commanded little public attention.

All that changed in 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency completed a study that found the chemical is 30 times more carcinogenic than previously thought.

This story was originally published by ProPublica

The agency then spent years updating regulations that protect millions of people who are most exposed to the compound. In 2024, the EPA approved stricter rules that require commercial sterilisers for medical equipment and large chemical plants to slash emissions of ethylene oxide, which causes lymphoma and breast cancer.

It was doing what the EPA has done countless times: revising rules based on new scientific knowledge.

Now, its ability to do that for many air pollutants is under threat.

In government records that have flown under the radar, President Donald Trump’s EPA said it is reconsidering whether the agency had the legal authority to update those rules.

Chemical companies and their trade organisations have argued that the EPA cannot reevaluate hazardous air pollution rules to account for newly discovered harms if it has revised them once already.

It doesn’t matter if decades have passed or new information has emerged.

If the EPA agrees, environmentalists fear that the decision could have wide implications, significantly curbing the EPA’s ability to limit nearly 200 pollutants from thousands of industrial plants. The next time new science reveals that a chemical is much more toxic, or that the amount of pollution released from a factory had been underestimated and would cause legally unacceptable health risks, the agency would not be able to react.

“It’s a poor reflection on this administration’s claim that they are actually interested in clean air,” said Ana Baptista, a professor of environmental policy and sustainability management at The New School. “By saying we’re no longer going to consider science, it’s abdicating your mission.”

The EPA didn’t address ProPublica’s questions about the ethylene oxide reevaluation or its broader implications. Instead, the agency pointed to a March press release about how it was reconsidering multiple air pollution rules issued by President Joe Biden’s administration, including the ones for chemical plants and commercial sterilisers. “EPA is committed to using the gold standard of science during these reviews,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Since day one, EPA has been clear that providing clean air, water, and land for all Americans is a top priority.”

The EPA’s reconsideration focuses on the Clean Air Act, the country’s most powerful air quality law, which regulates hazardous air pollutants for different types of industrial operations. There’s a specific rule for oil refineries, for instance, and another for steel mills. Within eight years after each rule is published, the EPA is required to conduct an assessment, called a residual risk review, to decide if an update is necessary.

These assessments use detailed data on the quantity of emissions coming from each facility, the toxicity of each chemical and other information on how the chemicals are released and dispersed in the air. The combined data reveals how the emissions put local residents at risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, reproductive harm and other health problems.

If the EPA determines the overall risks exceed what’s allowed under the law, the agency must tighten the rules.

The Clean Air Act doesn’t say whether the EPA is required to conduct additional residual risk reviews after the first one. Nor does it specifically prohibit the agency from doing so.

As far back as 2006, the EPA under President George W. Bush asserted that the agency had the right to revisit and revise the rules based on risk.

The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide. The office estimated that nearly half a million Americans were exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from industrial emissions by chemical plants, commercial sterilisers and other facilities pumping out ethylene oxide.

In its report, the inspector general’s office advised the agency to “exercise its discretionary authority to conduct new residual risk reviews” as needed when “new data or information indicates an air pollutant is more toxic than previously determined.” (The inspector general was a Trump appointee.)

The EPA had already conducted the first, mandatory risk reviews for large chemical plants and commercial sterilisers in the early 2000s. In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide. Ultimately, the EPA determined the health risks were unacceptable and revised the rules to lower them. The agency asserted that the Clean Air Act “does not limit our discretion or authority to conduct another risk review should we consider that such review is warranted.”

According to the EPA’s estimates, the new regulations for chemical plants under the 2024 revised rule would cut the number of nearby residents who are exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from 90,000 to 3,000.

But the chemical industry opposed the stricter rules. Industry representatives disagreed with the EPA’s new assessment of ethylene oxide, contending that it overestimated the risk the chemical posed, and argued the agency didn’t have the authority to conduct those risk reviews. In a 2023 letter, the American Chemistry Council said “the Agency has erred in conducting a new risk review,” as “the plain text” of the Clean Air Act “indicates that EPA actually lacks this authority.”

Similarly, the Louisiana Chemical Association submitted public comments on the chemical plant rule stating the “EPA has no statutory authority to conduct a second risk review” and that doing so was “arbitrary and capricious.”

David Cresson, president and CEO of the association, told ProPublica that the trade group supports “protecting the public’s health through regulatory frameworks that are lawful, while remaining based in sound science.”

Brendan Bradley, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said the organisation had no further comment on the issue.

After Trump was inaugurated, one of his appointees to the EPA let the industry know the agency was conducting a “reconsideration” of the two rules focused on ethylene oxide emissions. Last spring, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator Abigale Tardif, a former oil and gas lobbyist, hinted at how the EPA might challenge those rules.

In letters addressed to trade groups representing commercial sterilisers and chemical plants, Tardif said the agency was reconsidering multiple issues related to the rules, including the “EPA’s authority and decision to undertake a second residual risk review” under the Clean Air Act, as well as “the analysis and determinations made in that review, and the resulting risk standards.”

Tardif didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The agency also filed a regulatory notice about its plans to revise the 2024 chemical plant rule. Citing the part of the Clean Air Act that deals with the updated rule assessments, the notice said the EPA had “identified items for reconsideration around its CAA section 112(f)(2) residual risk review authority.”

While the stricter ethylene oxide rules are technically still in effect, the Trump administration has exempted dozens of large chemical plants and steriliser facilities from following them as the agency works through a formal process that is widely expected to result in watered-down standards.

If the Trump EPA does decide it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, the agency might still have the authority to strengthen hazardous air pollution rules by using a separate part of the Clean Air Act, said Abel Russ, a senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. That section of the act allows the EPA to update a rule if agency scientists conclude that better pollution-control technology is affordable and available. But limiting the agency’s ability to conduct residual risk reviews would be a serious blow to the act, Russ said, “kneecapping” the agency’s authority over these toxic pollutants.

Environmental groups will almost certainly sue if the EPA concludes it does not have the legal authority to revise hazardous air pollution rules more than once based on risk. Russ called industry’s comments absurd and said they don’t account for the reality that our knowledge of industrial pollution is changing all the time.

As ProPublica reported in October, the agency recently received clear evidence that many industrial facilities are leaking far more pollution than the companies that own them previously reported. In 2023, researchers who conducted their own air monitoring in the industrial corridor of Louisiana known as Cancer Alley found much higher concentrations of ethylene oxide than expected. For more than half the areas they sampled, the local cancer risk from ethylene oxide would be unacceptable if residents were exposed to these concentrations over a lifetime.

If the EPA decides it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, it would find itself in the position of not being able to take action even if the agency confirmed similar results.

“The whole premise of risk assessment is that it’s based on the best available science,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project. As our knowledge grows, researchers tend to find that chemicals are linked to additional health effects, she added, so blocking these updates “pretty much ensures” the EPA is underestimating the risks.",https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/629d9808-994e-49ad-84a6-7f394de0e76a.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:01:53.915527

“This road poses an imminent and serious threat to the constitutional rights of this species,” the judge wrote in his decision.
“The judge agreed there is a very high risk,” Redín Guerrero said.
“The scientists and the community already had the studies,” Redín Guerrero said.
But, Redín Guerrero said, “it’s because we have the rights of nature that this species has a chance.”","An Ecuadorian court has blocked construction of a highway after ruling it poses an imminent and irreversible threat to the rights of a critically endangered toad, a decision that underscores the country’s unique constitutional protections for nature.

The opinion, issued Sunday by Judge Milton Gustavo Hernández Andino of a provincial court in Pujilí, suspended all work on the planned highway, citing the risk it poses to the Jambato harlequin toad—a species found nowhere else on Earth but in the parish of Angamarca, in Cotopaxi province.

Ecuador is the only country in the world whose constitution recognizes nature’s rights to exist, regenerate and be restored, though hundreds of court rulings, local laws, nonbinding declarations and other initiatives worldwide recognize nature’s rights in some form.

The Jambato harlequin toad is recognizable by its bright orange belly and glossy black back. Water is essential to its survival. During the breeding season, females lay their eggs in clear streams and rivers, the tadpoles developing beneath riverbed stones. Protecting the toad’s interconnected terrestrial and aquatic habitats is critical to its survival.

Once thought to be extinct, the Jambato harlequin toad was rediscovered in 2016 by a child in Angamarca. Scientists estimate the population to be somewhere between 92 and 359. Because its numbers are so small, research suggests the species may have limited genetic diversity, making it less capable of adapting to new threats.

The Ecuadorian court found that the highway project, which had been slated to begin its most intensive phase on Jan. 5, would cause “massive earthmoving,” debris dumping and disturbances in nearby streams where the toads reproduce, potentially irreversibly damaging or destroying their only known habitat.

“This road poses an imminent and serious threat to the constitutional rights of this species,” the judge wrote in his decision.

The Ecuadorian government, Hernández Andino added, “must prevent and restrict activities that cause the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems or permanent alterations of natural cycles.”

He ordered all use of heavy machinery halted until comprehensive environmental studies on the road’s projected impact on the Jambato harlequin are completed and a species protection plan is approved. The court also found that provincial authorities had relied on an environmental certificate intended for low-impact maintenance work, despite the project’s significant repercussions in an area designated for special conservation.

“Despite early warnings and formal requests made since 2024 by organizations such as the Jambato Alliance, provincial and environmental authorities have responded only partially or have shirked their responsibilities,” the opinion said.

The Cotopaxi province did not respond to requests for comment. It is not immediately clear whether provincial authorities will comply with the court’s order—locals in Angamarca reported that officials moved heavy machinery to construction sites earlier this week.

“Defending Life in All Its Forms”

Ecuador is one of the most biologically diverse nations on Earth. Its ecosystems, from Angamarca’s high-altitude wetlands to the Amazon rainforest, are home to plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth, with new species still being discovered.

Local environmental defender Nayerli Cañizares Barragán said the ruling offers hope and stands as a symbol of the ongoing fight to defend nature and humans’ environmental rights.

“This ruling reminds us that defending life in all its forms is indeed worthwhile,” said Cañizares Barragán, a volunteer with the nonprofit Jambato Alliance, speaking in Spanish.

The lawsuit, a request for “precautionary measures” to stop a violation of rights, was brought by lawyer Gustavo Ricardo Redín Guerrero on behalf of the toad. Under Ecuadorian law, anyone can act to enforce nature’s rights.

Redín Guerrero said the decision reflects a core attribute of Ecuador’s rights-of-nature jurisprudence: When there is a risk of extinction, the burden of proof shifts to the government to prove with scientific certainty that its proposed action will not lead to that outcome. Under conventional environmental law, the burden generally rests on environmentalists.

“The judge agreed there is a very high risk,” Redín Guerrero said. “So he ordered the government to stop the road until they can prove it will not endanger the species.”

The case was filed on Saturday, after the province of Cotopaxi posted videos on social media announcing that new construction would begin on Jan. 5. The court issued its decision on Sunday evening.

“You move the road a few meters, you protect the river. Development and conservation are not opposites.”

— lawyer Gustavo Ricardo Redín Guerrero

Redín Guerrero, along with local community members, the Jambato Alliance and the nonprofit Ecuadorian Coordinator of Organizations for the Defense of Nature and the Environment, acted swiftly because they had proactively conducted years of scientific research in the high-altitude wetland ecosystems in the region.

“The scientists and the community already had the studies,” Redín Guerrero said. “Without that work, we couldn’t have done anything.”

He said the highway could be built without endangering the toad by rerouting sections away from rivers and sensitive habitat, with only minimal additional costs.

“We’re not against the road,” he said. “We are saying: Stop construction until there is scientific information that guarantees this species will not go extinct.”

He added: “You move the road a few meters, you protect the river. Development and conservation are not opposites.”

The ruling draws on precedent from Ecuador’s Constitutional Court, including the landmark “Los Cedros” case, which held that the rights of nature requires government officials to apply the precautionary principle, which means that in the absence of adequate scientific evidence, it is better to avoid certain risks that could lead to irreversible damage to ecosystems.

In its Los Cedros opinion, the Constitutional Court invoked Ecuador’s rights of nature laws to protect a cloud forest ecosystem hosting critically endangered species, including Atelopus frogs.

Impinging on those species’ right to exist, the Constitutional Court said, “is a violation of such magnitude that it would be equivalent to what genocide means and implies in the field of human rights.”

The Constitutional Court emphasized that safeguarding endangered species from the outset is essential, noting that their presence signals the health of the broader environment. “Once a species is extinct, the laborious process that has taken nature sometimes millions of years results in an irreparable loss of diversity and knowledge,” the Los Cedros opinion said.

What will happen to both the planned highway and the Jambato harlequin toad remains to be seen. But, Redín Guerrero said, “it’s because we have the rights of nature that this species has a chance.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1229864066-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 09:59:06.628349

Agriculture and food systems will be central to both imperatives and Africa, home to 65% of the world's uncultivated arable lands, will be pivotal.

Morocco's experience highlights how food security and decarbonization are interconnected technologically, socially and economically.

The world faces a dual challenge: feeding a population expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050 while drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture and food systems, responsible for nearly one-third of global emissions, are central to both imperatives.

Africa is pivotal in this equation: it holds around 65% of the world’s uncultivated arable land, yet remains a net food importer. Unlocking this potential requires a model combining soil health, clean energy, resource efficiency and inclusive growth.

Strengthening food security while decarbonizing value chains through sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, innovation and inclusive investment is a key opportunity for Africa’s sustainable future. Across the continent, new models connecting clean energy, circularity and smart agriculture are emerging – with Morocco at their forefront.

Morocco’s pivotal role in food security

As one of the world’s leading producers and among the top five global exporters of fertilizers, Morocco stands at the heart of the food security and climate action nexus in Africa. With around 70% of global phosphate reserves and vast renewable energy potential, the North African country is also well placed to pioneer a new model of sustainable agricultural growth.

Phosphates, together with nitrogen and potassium, form the three essential nutrients underpinning productivity and global food security. Beyond their agronomic value, sustainable phosphate-based fertilizers improve nutrient efficiency and help farmers adapt to climate stress.

Morocco offers a unique position as both a major agricultural producer and a leading supplier of customized low-carbon fertilizers. Home to one of the world’s foremost innovators in low-carbon fertilizer technology, the country exemplifies how feeding humanity and decarbonization are not competing but converging imperatives.

In line with its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC), Morocco has committed to cutting emissions by 21.6% unconditionally and up to 53% with international support by 2035, compared to a 2010 baseline. The phosphate industry represents 9% of Morocco’s mitigation target of 2035, underscoring its role in the low-carbon transition.

Challenge of balancing food security and decarbonization

Rising demand strains fertilizer supply chains, particularly phosphate-based nutrients, a vital element for soil fertility. To meet this demand, producers worldwide are ramping up capacity.

Morocco’s global phosphate-based fertilizer leader, OCP Group, has launched a major investment programme to increase production from 12 million tons in 2024 to 20 million tons by 2027, while targeting carbon neutrality on three scopes by 2040. This is even though the phosphate industry is a hard-to-abate sector.

Yet higher production means higher emissions, creating a core dilemma: how to meet rising food demand while cutting emissions. Meanwhile, decarbonization technologies remain largely immature and costly – carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) can cost 50-200/Tco2 USD, according to the International Energy Agency – while rising energy costs, water scarcity and uneven access to technology deepen this challenge, particularly in the Global South.

For Africa, this highlights the need to diversify decarbonization pathways through investment in cost-effective technologies, renewable energy, green hydrogen and efficient resource management.

Driving transformation through energy, innovation and inclusion

Over the past decade, Morocco has anchored its energy transition in clean power, with landmark projects demonstrating how the country leverages its abundant solar and wind potential as a strategic advantage. In 2023, renewables (mainly solar and wind) accounted for 22% of total electricity generation – with Morocco aiming to reach 52 % by 2030.

This ambition extends to industry, where clean energy is a key driver of decarbonization. Morocco is on track to deploy several strategic projects, including one from OCP Green Energy (OGE), which is rolling out an ambitious renewable energy investment programme with a total planned capacity exceeding 1.2 GW that is aimed at supplying mining and industrial operations with 100% clean power by 2027.

The first phase of this programme consists of 202 MWp from solar farms at the largest photovoltaic power plant currently in operation in Morocco, which already supplies desalination and key industrial sites, advancing national climate goals and reducing fossil-fuel dependence.

In parallel, OCP Green Water (OGW) aims to meet all industrial water needs through desalination and reuse. With such business cases, coupling renewables with sustainable water use, Morocco is building an integrated model that cuts emissions and saves resources.

This momentum is being further accelerated through green hydrogen and ammonia. Morocco’s abundant renewable energy resources, including strong solar potential, consistent coastal winds and access to seawater for desalination, position the country among those with the highest potential for competitive green hydrogen production. Green hydrogen and ammonia will also support production of low-carbon phosphate-based fertilizers, aligning the country’s energy and food ambitions.

By combining renewable energy, green hydrogen and precision agriculture, Morocco is pioneering a low-carbon fertilizer model that cuts emissions and enhances efficiency.

OCP also carefully considers the impact of its programmes on people and communities, as they are integral to the transition. Programmes like Tourba and Al Moutmir, for example, use farmer-centred models to deliver science-based, low-carbon agricultural practices and technical assistance that help farmers adopt regenerative methods. Early results are promising, with up to 23 % yield gains, profitability increases of over 50 %, and up to 1.4 tons of carbon sequestered per hectare.

These programmes foster shared-learning among farmers, agronomists and researchers to develop climate-resilient solutions, showcasing scalable models across Africa that integrate renewable energy and low-carbon fertilizer into value chains, creating jobs, boosting yields and improving soil health.

A blueprint for global action to strengthen food security

Technology alone is not enough. To make decarbonization strengthen global food security, it must be accessible and affordable for farmers, especially in developing regions. Inclusive policies should ensure Global South participation, extending subsidy schemes for green hydrogen or low-carbon fertilizers to African producers.

Given the structural and technological barriers of phosphate-based fertilizer production to decarbonize all its hard-to-abate processes, a dedicated policy framework is needed to support innovation and targeted investment.

Risk-sharing mechanisms and clear market signals are key. Initiatives that return up to 50% to 80% of carbon credit revenues to farmers align local incentives with global goals, while low-carbon fertilizer standards and consumer demand create stable markets that reward sustainable food systems.

Morocco’s experience shows that food security and decarbonization are interconnected technologically, socially and economically, and require careful consideration of the energy, water and social implications of meeting this dual challenge. By combining renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and inclusive finance, Morocco provides a blueprint for developing countries to lead this transition.

Our world depends on the energy we produce. Clean energy generation provides the power we need while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping mitigate the worst effects of climate change.

What are greenhouse gases? Greenhouse gases are pollutants that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Reducing our carbon footprint and using more clean energy sources helps us limit the impacts of climate change and protect the planet for future generations.

Examples of Clean Energy

The conversation around clean energy is often limited to wind power and solar energy. However, there are other types of clean energy beyond wind turbines and solar panels. Clean energy can also be sourced from nuclear resources, geothermal and even water. Clean energy examples include:

Nuclear Energy

Nuclear energy is traditionally generated through a process called nuclear fission. Atoms are split apart to form smaller atoms, creating heat. The heat that’s created is then used to boil water into steam, which powers an electricity-creating turbine. It’s one of the reliable sources of emissions-free energy available.

Hydroelectric Energy

Hydroelectric energy, or hydropower, is created using the force of running water. As the water moves, it spins the blades in a turbine, which then powers the generator that produces energy. Hydropower also offers benefits beyond electricity generation, supporting flood control and irrigation.

Solar Energy

Solar energy works by using solar panels to absorb and trap sunlight. An inverter then converts the sunlight into AC electricity.

Wind Energy

Wind is another abundant and easy-to-access energy source. To create wind energy, air flows across the blades of large turbines, causing them to rotate. That motion is harnessed and converted into electricity.

Geothermal Energy

Geothermal energy is produced using heat from within the Earth's core. Wells are drilled into the ground, which enables water to recirculate through wells to generate steam. The steam is then used to power turbines that generate electricity.",https://www.constellationenergy.com/content/dam/constellationenergy/hero-banner-image/About-Constellation-Banner.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 06:58:12.089879

That opportunity lit a path Benjamin had not fully considered before.

Though his electrical engineering background gave him a strong foundation, he quickly realized that the solar photovoltaics world was a different field altogether. “I had the theory, yes,” he explained “But solar requires more, real hands-on skills, current knowledge, and a mindset shift. That’s what the Better Education for Africa’s Rise project gave me.”

Through intensive capacity-building workshops, practical sessions, and curriculum integration, Benjamin obtained up-to-date knowledge of solar system design, sizing, installation, testing and commissioning. What began as curiosity turned into conviction. He decided to fully shift his trade from a traditional electrical engineer to a renewable energy specialist.

Beyond personal growth, Benjamin has witnessed a paradigm shift at Kaiboi. Thanks to UNESCO’s BEAR project, the solar PV curriculum was redesigned to emphasize practical training over theory. Students can now work with real equipment, solve live problems, and leave with job-ready skills. As a trainer, Benjamin believes this hands-on approach is critical. “You cannot teach solar with slides. You need tools, panels, testers, and real experience.”

I. Background

The DC title V operating permit program is implemented through its “Operating Permits and Acid Rain Programs,” codified in 20 District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Chapter 3. The EPA initially granted full approval of the DC title V operating permit program effective on November 30, 2001. See 66 FR 52538 (October 16, 2001). However, in a notice of deficiency (NOD) published in the Federal Register on December 21, 2001 (66 FR 65947), the EPA notified the District of Columbia of EPA's finding that the District's provisions for providing public notification of permitting actions did not fully comply with the requirements of the CAA and its implementing regulations. On April 4, 2003, the District of Columbia submitted revisions to the public notification requirements of the operating permit program and adequately resolved the deficiency identified in the 2001 EPA NOD (December 21, 2001, 66 FR 65947). The EPA subsequently determined that the District of Columbia maintains final full approval of the Clean Air Act title V operating permit program. See 68 FR 18581(April 16, 2003).

On May 30, 2024, DOEE submitted a revision to 20 DCMR Chapter 3 for approval into the state's EPA-approved title V program. DOEE revised 20 DCMR Chapter 3 to update fees for 40 CFR part 70 operating permits (“major source” or title V permits). Additionally, the DOEE revision clarified and resolved errors in the existing regulations, including adding a definition for the term “relevant emission units.” The revision also reorganized some sections in Chapter 3 with no substantive change in content.

DOEE's updated fee collection schedule is designed to ensure sufficient funding for its title V program, in order to cover all reasonable costs required to implement and administer the DOEE Title V Operating Permit Program as required by 40 CFR 70.9(a) and (b). Title V program costs include those for activities such as reviewing and processing operating permits and preconstruction permits, conducting inspections, responding to complaints and pursuing enforcement actions, emissions and ambient air monitoring, preparing applicable regulations and guidance, modeling, analyses, demonstrations, emission inventories, and tracking emissions. Under 40 CFR 70.9(a), an approved state or local title V operating permits program must require that the owners or operators of 40 CFR part 70 sources pay annual fees, or the equivalent over some other period, that are sufficient to cover the permit program costs and ensure that any fee required under 40 CFR 70.9 is used solely for permit program costs. The fee schedule must result in the collection and retention of revenues sufficient to cover the permit program implementation and oversight costs. See 40 CFR 70.9(b).

Following the District of Columbia's municipal rulemaking process, DC revised its State Operating Permits Program under title V of the Clean Air Act through a rulemaking titled Air Quality Permit Fees and Synthetic Minor Permitting Program (effective June 5, 2020, 67 DCR 006789-006825). Through this rulemaking, DOEE revised fees for 40 CFR part 70 operating permits—major sources or title V permits—in 20 DCMR Chapter 3. Additionally, Chapter 3 was revised to clarify and resolve errors in the existing regulations, including adding a definition for the term “relevant emission units.” The District requests the EPA approval of Air Quality Permit Fees and Synthetic Minor Permitting Program as a revision to the District of Columbia's title V program, as required under 40 CFR 70.4(i). This submittal also satisfies one of the action items from DOEE's FY2023 Clean Air Act Title V Program Evaluation, dated September 6, 2023, which required DOEE to submit this regulation as a title V program revision within 12 months of the report date.[ ] The DC submission indicates that it is necessary to update its fee collection schedule, otherwise DOEE would not be able to fully fund its title V program.

II. Summary of Title V Program Revision and EPA Analysis

In its May 30, 2024 submittal, DC sought the EPA approval of its revisions to 20 DCMR Chapter 3 into its title V program. DC's revisions to 20 DCMR Chapter 3 revised fees (Section 305) for its title V operating permit program. The revision reorganized three sections in Chapter 3 with no substantive change in content, including section 300 on applicability, section 301 on permit applications, and section 303 on permit issuance, renewal, reopening, and revision. The revision also clarified and resolved errors in the existing regulations, including adding a definition for the term “relevant emission units.” DOEE's initial submission also included revisions in 20 DCMR Chapter 2 sections 200, 202, and 210 to create a synthetic minor permitting program, and added new section 211 to establish general construction and operating permit fees. However, in a May 28, 2025 supplemental letter which is included in the docket for this action, DOEE clarified its request so that only the revisions in 20 DCMR Chapter 3 found in Air Quality Permit Fees and Synthetic Minor Permitting Program will be incorporated as a revision to the District of Columbia's title V program, as required under 40 CFR 70.4(i).[ ]

In 20 DCMR Chapter 3 section 305, DOEE restructured 40 CFR part 70 sources permit application fee (section 305.1) and annual fees based on the total tons of actual emissions of each regulated pollutant (section 305.2, section 305.3). Section 305.5 requires that owners or operators of sources accepting federally enforceable emission limits pursuant to sections 200.6 and 300.3(c) shall pay a permit application fee (original and renewal applications) of five thousand dollars ($5,000). Section 305.6 stipulates that DOEE use the Consumer Price Index for annual increases of fees charged under sections 305.2 and 305.3. Other subsections of section 305 are related to when and where to pay and penalties for failure to pay on time. DOEE added a definition of “relevant emission units” in section 399 (Definitions and Abbreviations).

With this fee schedule change, DOEE indicates that it can ensure that fees will remain sufficient to cover the costs of administering the plan approval application and operating permit process as required by section 502(b) of the CAA. Without this fee update, DOEE's title V program is vulnerable and may not be able to sustain its title V operating permit program in a manner that is consistent with Federal requirements. If funds were to become ( printed page 656) insufficient to sustain an adequate title V program in DC, the EPA may determine that DOEE has not taken “significant action to assure adequate administration and enforcement of the Program” and take subsequent action as required under 40 CFR 70.10(b) and (c). This determination could lead to the EPA withdrawing approval of the DC title V operating permit program. Were that to occur, the EPA would have the authority and obligation to implement a Federal title V operating permit program in DC pursuant to 40 CFR part 71. The withdrawal of program approval could also lead to the imposition of mandatory and discretionary sanctions under the CAA. See 42 U.S.C. 7509(b).

The EPA reviewed DOEE's submittal for consistency with the presumptive minimum fee rate outlined in the September 17, 2024, EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards memorandum,[ ] as well as the requirements of 40 CFR 70.9(b)(2), and determined that DOEE met the requirements of CAA section 502. The EPA also determined the submittal is consistent with applicable EPA requirements in the title V operating permit program of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.9 for the collection of sufficient title V fees to cover permit program implementation and oversight costs. This rulemaking proposes to approve DC's revision of its title V fees in order to ensure the fees collected are sufficient to fund DC's title V program.

III. Proposed Action

Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(i)(2), the EPA is proposing to approve as a revision to the District of Columbia title V operating permit program. DOEE's May 30, 2024 submittal revised DC's title V fee structure in order to ensure sufficient fees are collected each year adequately and continually fund DC's title V program. The revisions meet the relevant requirements of section 502 of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4 and 70.9. The EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this document. These comments will be considered before taking final action.

IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

Under the CAA, the Administrator approves title V operating permit program revisions that comply with the Act and applicable Federal Regulations. See 42 U.S.C. 7661a(d). Thus, in reviewing title V operating permit program submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. This action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this action:

Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866:

Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.);

Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.);

Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4);

Does not have federalism implications as specified inExecutive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);

Is not subject toExecutive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program;

Is not a significant regulatory action subject toExecutive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and

Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.

In addition, the proposed rulemaking is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).",https://www.federalregister.gov/assets/open_graph_site_banner.png,N,,2026-01-08 05:59:41.120184

Cliff Bentz, R-Ontario, said Oregon is facing a future shortage of electric power and will need to make difficult policy changes — including reconsidering nuclear energy — to meet growing demand.
“I asked them directly if they have enough power to meet demand around here,” Bentz said in an interview with The Bulletin.
According to Bentz, the energy problem is centered on limited transmission capacity and restrictions on in-state power generation.
Wind and solar tax credits On renewable energy, Bentz expressed skepticism about tax credits for wind and solar projects, arguing they are no longer necessary for the industry to succeed.
Energy demand in Oregon is expected to rise due to population growth, electrification and data center development, according to utility forecasts.","Rep. Cliff Bentz, R-Ontario, said Oregon is facing a future shortage of electric power and will need to make difficult policy changes — including reconsidering nuclear energy — to meet growing demand.

Bentz, whose district spans most of central and eastern Oregon, said utilities have told him they do not expect to have enough electricity to meet future needs. He said he raised the issue last week in a meeting with PacifiCorp (parent company of Pacific Power), one of the region’s major utilities.

“I asked them directly if they have enough power to meet demand around here,” Bentz said in an interview with The Bulletin. “And the answer was no.”

Energy shortages could hobble economic growth in Central Oregon, where the population is growing and electrification of buildings is on the rise. Data centers near Prineville also consume large amounts of electricity for artificial intelligence applications.

Growing challenges

The Oregon Public Utility Commission, which regulates the state’s three investor-owned electric utilities, said utilities currently have sufficient electricity to meet near-term demand but acknowledge growing challenges ahead.

“The electric utilities’ Integrated Resource Plans project mid- to long-term load growth from new sources like large data centers, which will require significant investment in new energy resources to meet demand,” PUC spokesperson Kandi Young said in an email.

According to Bentz, the energy problem is centered on limited transmission capacity and restrictions on in-state power generation. While the Bonneville Power Administration plays a central role in moving electricity across the Northwest, Bentz said the agency is not responsible for producing new power.

“Bonneville is in the transmission and marketing business, not generation,” he said. “If you put BPA in the generation business, you immediately create all kinds of legal and political problems.”

Young said transmission development is a shared responsibility involving state regulators, federal agencies and regional planning organizations. About 75% of Oregon’s transmission system is owned by the Bonneville Power Administration, a federal entity outside the PUC’s jurisdiction.

BPA spokesperson Kevin Wingert said the agency is responding to a surge in requests to connect new generation to the grid. BPA is currently studying 61 gigawatts of large generator interconnection requests — more than double the region’s anticipated electric load of 26.19 gigawatts in 2026.

“To put that in perspective, the anticipated regional load for the Pacific Northwest in 2026 is about 26 gigawatts,” Wingert said.

Bentz said Oregon’s energy policies compound the challenge. The state restricts nuclear power and does not allow new natural gas plants, leaving utilities increasingly dependent on imported electricity. That approach only works if the transmission system is expanded, he said.

“We can import power, but that requires wire,” Bentz said. “And transmission is already a bottleneck.”

Wingert said BPA expects to release an initial study report within the next month detailing how proposed generators could be interconnected and what transmission upgrades may be needed. He said BPA has identified up to 20 gigawatts of generation that could potentially be fast-tracked and online by 2030, depending on developer readiness and infrastructure improvements.

Nuclear option

Bentz said Oregon should revisit its constitutional restrictions on nuclear energy, which were adopted decades ago amid concerns over safety and radioactive waste. He argued advances in technology, including small modular reactors and improved waste management, have changed the landscape.

“The safeguards we have now didn’t exist when that prohibition was put in place,” he said. “We need to change our constitution so that option is available.”

Bentz referenced a proposed small nuclear reactor project near Corvallis that received federal regulatory approval but was ultimately shelved due to high costs. He said similar projects may become viable as technology improves and demand for electricity continues to grow.

While state law restricts certain types of generation, Young said utilities are required through the PUC’s Integrated Resource Planning process to evaluate all available resource options and demonstrate how they will meet demand in a least-cost, least-risk manner while complying with state and federal policy.

Any large new generation project — whether renewable or otherwise — would be subject to competitive bidding requirements and regulatory review to determine whether it is prudent and in the public interest before costs could be passed on to customers, she said.

Wind and solar tax credits

On renewable energy, Bentz expressed skepticism about tax credits for wind and solar projects, arguing they are no longer necessary for the industry to succeed. He pointed to Oregon’s former Business Energy Tax Credit program as an example of what he described as poorly designed incentives that benefited financial institutions more than energy production.

“Solar has reached the point where it can stand on its own,” Bentz said. “At this stage, the tax credits often end up as profit for banks and investors, not new generation.”

He also said U.S. energy policy must contend with China’s heavy subsidies for solar panel manufacturing, which he described as a major barrier to domestic production.

Bentz said he supports changes to federal permitting laws to speed construction of power lines, generation facilities and other infrastructure. Without reform, he warned, energy projects can take decades to move forward.

“If we don’t streamline permitting,” Bentz said, “we’re not going to build what we need in time.”

Wingert said BPA is working to shorten transmission project timelines from a decade or more to about five to six years. He cited Idaho Power’s Boardman-to-Hemingway transmission line, which took roughly 18 years from proposal to construction, as an example of the challenges involved.

Young said recent federal policy changes have added uncertainty to new energy development. New permitting requirements for renewable projects, the elimination of certain federal tax credits and the cancellation of previously approved grants have increased costs and could delay both generation and transmission projects, she said.

Energy demand in Oregon is expected to rise due to population growth, electrification and data center development, according to utility forecasts. Bentz said those trends make it urgent for state and federal leaders to reassess long-term energy strategy.

“This isn’t ideological,” he said. “It’s practical. We have to have enough power.”",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/74021026de442727cbc6e199cda5f14b.jpg?w=1000,N,,2026-01-08 03:12:29.285599

Artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the data center landscape, and JLL anticipates AI workloads will represent half of all data center capacity by 2030.

The explosive growth will require up to $3 trillion in total investment over the next five years, including $1.2 trillion in real estate asset value creation and approximately $870 billion in new debt financing, marking an infrastructure investment supercycle.

“We’re witnessing the most significant transformation in data center infrastructure since the original cloud migration,” said Matt Landek, Global Division President, Data Centers and Critical Environments at JLL. “The sheer scale of demand is extraordinary. Hyperscalers are allocating $1 trillion for data center spend between 2024 and 2026 alone, while supply constraints and four-year grid connection delays are creating a perfect storm that’s fundamentally reshaping how we approach development, energy sourcing and market strategy.”

AI Drives Transformation

AI workloads could represent 50% of all data center capacity by 2030, compared to approximately 25% in 2025. JLL anticipates a critical inflection point in 2027 when AI inference workloads will overtake training as the dominant requirement.

“We’re witnessing the emergence of an entirely new infrastructure paradigm where AI training facilities demand 10x the power density and command 60% lease rate premiums over traditional data centers,” said Andrew Batson, Global Head of Data Center Research at JLL. “Beyond the economics, AI has become a matter of national strategic importance, driving countries to develop domestic capabilities through sovereign infrastructure investments that represent an $8 billion CapEx opportunity by 2030.”

AI chips are projected to grow their total revenue share from 20% to 50% of the semiconductor market by 2030, with custom silicon expected to capture 15% market share as hyperscalers develop their own processors. The future could include emerging technologies like neuromorphic computing for ultra-efficient inference tasks that could reduce infrastructure demands and enable data centers to be more power-efficient.

Regional Growth Patterns, Construction Delays

The Americas will maintain its position as the largest data center region, representing about 50% of global capacity and achieving the fastest growth rate through 2030. The Asia-Pacific region (APAC) is projected to expand from 32 GW to 57 GW, while Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) will add 13 GW of new supply driven.

Each region faces distinct market dynamics that will shape development strategies. In APAC, colocation is leading growth, while on-premise capacity is projected to decline 6% as enterprises continue cloud migration. EMEA’s growth forecast is fueled by strong demand from hyperscalers, with growth concentrated in established European hubs like London, Frankfurt and Paris, alongside emerging Middle Eastern markets pursuing digital transformation strategies. The U.S. continues to drive most activity in the Americas, accounting for about 90% of regional capacity.

“The U.S. market is experiencing a fundamental shift in development strategy, with developers moving toward phased developments of hundreds of megawatts to gigawatts and demanding a preference for single-tenant hyperscale leases over multi-tenant colocation where possible,” said Andy Cvengros, Executive Managing Director and Co-Lead of JLL’s U.S. Data Center Markets. “This reflects the scale and urgency of demand we’re seeing, where speed to power in 2027 for new developments has become the primary criteria driving site selection as traditional location and cost factors take a back seat to energy availability.”

Despite developers preordering materials up to 24 months in advance, more than half of data center projects in 2025 experienced construction delays of three months or more. The average equipment lead time globally is now 33 weeks, a 50% increase from pre-2020 levels. The industry is responding through modular construction solutions, with annual sales of modular systems and micro data centers projected to reach $48 billion by 2030.

“The increase in equipment lead times is affecting APAC just as it is globally, but strong pre-commitment levels demonstrate continued confidence in the market,” said Glen Duncan, JLL Data Center Research Director, Asia Pacific.

Energy, Sustainability Challenges

Energy sourcing remains a critical challenge, with average grid connection lead times exceeding four years in primary markets. Due to utility interconnection delays and mounting pressure from rising grid electricity costs, some operators are moving to directly fund their own energy generation, and several markets have implemented de facto “bring your own power” mandates, including Dublin and Texas.

Data centers are also adopting diverse regional energy strategies to address grid constraints. Natural gas is projected to play a major role in alleviating grid constraints in the U.S., both for temporary bridge power and increasingly for permanent on-site power generation. The four primary hyperscalers already fully matching their U.S. data center portfolios with renewable energy. In EMEA, projects combining renewables and private wire transmission can reduce the cost of power for tenants by 40% compared to the grid.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are gaining momentum, enabling cost-effective handling of short-duration outages and positioning the technology as a dynamic grid asset to speed up interconnection timelines. Additionally, solar-plus-storage will become a key component of global data center energy strategies by 2030, with renewable energy costs projected to outcompete fossil fuels across all major regions.

“As regulatory and stakeholder expectations around renewable energy sourcing increase globally, data center operators will face heightened scrutiny over their energy procurement,” said Martin Jensen, EMEA Division President, Data Centers at JLL. “While renewables like solar and wind remain the dominant focus of clean energy strategies, power sources such as nuclear are gaining attention for their ability to provide reliable electricity and help balance sustainability requirements with operational continuity; however, significant new nuclear capacity is unlikely to be widely deployed before the 2030s.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/adobestock_823417311.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 13:13:48.638557

TRANSCRIPT

The Public News Service daily newscast, January the 7th, 2026.

I'm Mike Clifford.

On the fifth anniversary of the pro-Trump mob attack on the Capitol, the Trump administration created a new page on the White House website that represented Trump's most brazen vignette to rewrite the history of the January 6th riot, aimed at absolving him of responsibility.

That is the take from the New York Times.

The report the site blames Capitol Police officers who defended lawmakers that day for starting the assault, and former Vice President Mike Pence, who rejected falsehoods about the 2020 election for allowing the results to be certified.

CNN notes Trump is long sought to whitewash the violence and vandalism committed on January 6.

Meantime, many banks, financial firms, and insurance companies have made bold public commitments to do their part to rein in climate change.

But the Pulitzer Center for Investigative Reporting has revealed that those same companies are financing the search for new sources of fossil fuels and new infrastructure to burn them.

According to Global Scientific Consensus, tapping any new oil and gas reserves will likely produce catastrophic outcomes.

Josephine Moulds, a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, says there's enough oil and gas already in the pipeline to fuel a clean energy transition.

We've got enough in terms of the projects that we've already got running.

We've got enough to keep us going as long as we shift over to solar and wind and all of the other renewables.

Companies continue to promote their climate commitments and argue that if they didn't do business with corporations searching for new places to drill, they wouldn't be able to work with any existing oil and gas company.

President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and has put the brakes on US efforts to transition to clean energy.

The administration is also making good on campaign promises to ramp up oil and gas production and has laid claim to the world's largest oil reserves in Venezuela.

I'm Eric Galatas.

And California continues to lag behind other states on many issues affecting child well-being.

That's according to the new 2026 Children's Report Card.

Researchers from the non-profit Children Now looked at 30 indicators of health, education, child welfare, early childhood, and online safety, and awarded the Golden State a C- or below on nearly half the issues researched.

Kelly Hardy with Children Now says one of the lowest grades came in early intervention and special education.

There's not enough support for special education so very low numbers of special education teachers compared to what's needed and the kids who are being identified for support are often just not getting the support that they need.

The state also got a D for student connections with adults because California schools have fewer teachers, counselors, nurses, and other support staff per student than almost any other state.

I'm Suzanne Potter.

This is Public News Service.

People concerned about voting rights say they are prepared for continued attacks on state elections in 2026.

The Trump administration has now filed lawsuits against 18 mostly Democratic-led states demanding access to voter registration lists, including driver's license information and partial Social Security numbers.

Jen Lancaster with the League of Women Voters of Maine says that information could be used to create a national database exploited to make false claims of voter fraud.

We're very proud to fight back and stand up for Maine voters, their right to their own privacy and to push back against a pretty unlawful demand.

The White House has proposed expanding the federal SAVE program which checks immigration status to also confirm voter eligibility.

But Lancaster says it's been found to wrongly flag U.S. citizens.

The Department of Justice says it needs voter information to ensure states are complying with federal election laws.

I'm Katherine Carley.

And the popularity of collecting vinyl records hints that the public isn't completely content with owning things digitally.

Library leaders in North Dakota say the renewed passion is leading more people to look into their physical media offerings.

Andrea Plaker leads the Williston Community Library.

She and her fellow directors around the state report elevated activity and people requesting library cards.

Blaker explains some users feel that options like e-books aren't for them and word of mouth is fueling interest in physical copies.

There is a huge craze out there right now, right?

And people are getting out there more and they're saying like, ""Oh, there's all these great authors and talking to each other about, ""Oh my gosh, did you read this great book?""

The American Library Association confirms that younger generations are making frequent use of their local branches.

National Library Week isn't until April, but Laker says libraries like hers will amplify community messaging in February through special programs.

I'm Mike Moen.

And finally, an historic Dallas church can keep its rainbow-painted front step without following a unanimous decision by the Dallas Landmark Commission.

Leaders of Oak Lawn United Methodist Church say they painted the steps the colors of the Progress Pride flag as a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ community after Governor Greg Abbott ordered Rainbow Crosswalks be removed across the state.

Compared to a standard pride flag, a progress pride flag features more colors and represents more communities.

During a hearing before the commission, Senior Pastor Rachel Griffin Allison said painting the steps was not an act of defiance.

Our intention was and remains simple to communicate to every person who approaches our building that they are seen safe and well.

However, this year’s demo suggests Sony Honda Mobility is focusing on getting the fundamentals right before hitting California's roads later this year.","Sony Honda Mobility showed off the AFEELA 1 electric vehicle again at CES this year. If, like me, you saw it last year, the experience will feel very familiar. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The AFEELA 1 still looks polished, still leans hard into its identity as a rolling entertainment hub, and still feels more like a Sony product than a traditional car. What’s different is that this year is less about flashy new features and more about refinement.

Sony Honda Mobility used its CES keynote to reiterate its vision of ""mobility as a creative entertainment space,"" positioning AFEELA 1 as a car built around time spent inside it, not just getting from point A to point B. Sitting inside the EV again, that philosophy is obvious. The panoramic dashboard display remains the centerpiece, spanning the entire cabin and serving as the primary interface for navigation, media, and apps.

Alongside the AFEELA 1, Sony Honda Mobility also showed off a SUV-style prototype, dubbed AFEELA Prototype 2026. Despite its name, the company says this prototype will likely reach production in 2028 at the earliest. It appeared to be essentially the same as the AFEELA 1, only in SUV form, though Sony Honda Mobility is remaining tight-lipped on further details at this stage. We'll just have to wait to find out more information on AFEELA 1's younger sibling as it gets closer to production.

In the meantime, the AFEELA 1 has plenty to keep us entertained — literally. One of my personal favorite features of the AFEELA 1 is its PlayStation Remote Play. If you already own a PS5, you can stream games to the rear seat displays using a DualSense controller. I got to test it for the first time after it was teased last year, and the connection wasn't too bad. Obviously, it was unable to stream in 4K, but there was no noticeable input lag and it held up reliably even in a crowded demo environment. It’s still very much a ""you already need to be bought into the PlayStation ecosystem"" feature, but it works more consistently now than it did before.

The AI assistant, AFEELA, is also back, and it’s still best described as competent but unremarkable. Sony Honda Mobility frames it as a “personal agent” powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI, meant to support natural conversation and personalization over time. In practice, it behaves like a standard in-car assistant. It can open apps, set destinations, adjust settings, and respond to basic contextual prompts. It complemented my shirt using the cameras in the car, so that was nice.

Where the AFEELA 1 does feel improved is in the fundamentals. The interior runs more smoothly overall, with faster screen responses and fewer hiccups when switching between apps. The cabin feels quieter and more composed, and it's clear Sony Honda Mobility is prioritizing comfort and stability over experimental features.

That sense of polish also extends to how Sony Honda Mobility is positioning the AFEELA 1 as a productivity space. Beyond entertainment, the car supports apps like Zoom, letting you take video calls from inside the cabin. The camera angle is a bit off, so be aware that you may not look your best when it's on. They demoed it for us, and the camera was wide enough to capture the entirety of the car, rather than framing you like a laptop webcam.

All of this refinement comes at a premium. The AFEELA 1 is priced starting at $89,900, with higher trims exceeding $100,000, firmly placing it in the luxury EV territory. At that price, one's expectation should be higher than just being able to function properly. However, this year’s demo suggests Sony Honda Mobility is focusing on getting the fundamentals right before hitting California's roads later this year.

PureField Ingredients operates a 55 MMgy ethanol plant in Russell, Kansas. If approved, the permit would allow for the capture and geological sequestration of up to 150,000 metric tons of CO2 annually for a period of 12 years—equating to a total permitted injection volume of 1.8 million metric tons of CO2. The CO2 would be injected into the Arbuckle Group, a porous underground geologic formation, at a dept of 3,448 feet below ground surface.

According to the EPA, the proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project includes monitoring wells within and above the injection zones, as well as soil vapor, seismic and ecology stress observation stations.

During the 12-year injection period and for 50 years after injection has ceased, the permit would require PureField Carbon Capture to test and monitor the condition of the wells, injection pressure, and the location and size of the injected CO2 plume.

A public comment period on the draft Class VI permit is open through Feb. 1. The EPA will also hold a public availability session and a public hearing on Jan. 22 in Russell, Kansas. Additional information is available under Docket ID EPA-R07-OW-2025-3852 on the Regulations.gov website.

The administration instructed the State Department last February to review U.S. support for all global agreements and organizations.","President Trump on Wednesday said he was withdrawing the United States from the international treaty that forms the basis for global cooperation in the fight against climate change.

What is the UNFCCC treaty?

Established in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, is the treaty that sets a legal framework for international negotiations to address climate change. Under the treaty’s umbrella, nations gather every year to hammer out how they can collectively slow down the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, which is caused principally by the burning of coal, oil and gas.

After years of negotiation, led in part by the United States and China, countries of the world agreed in 2015 to each set their own targets to reduce rising greenhouse gas emissions. That’s known widely as the Paris Agreement, because it was reached at a meeting in Paris under the auspices of the Convention on Climate Change.

The convention has an office in Bonn, Germany, and a staff of around 450. The United States customarily pays for around 20 percent of its core budget. Last year, when the Trump administration withdrew the U.S. contribution, the philanthropist and former Mayor Michael Bloomberg filled the gap.

Who else is a party?

Since 1992, 198 countries have approved or ratified the convention. The United States was the first industrialized country to join, after ratification by the U.S. Senate.

Does a U.S. withdrawal matter?

It makes the United States an outlier. It matters with regard to America’s standing in the world, especially in the eyes of vulnerable countries that correctly point out that the United States is responsible for the largest share of the cumulative climate pollution heating up the Earth’s atmosphere.

Once the U.S. is out of a treaty, it may be hard for it to get back in. Some experts believe a future president could easily rejoin the treaty. Others say the U.S. Senate would need to ratify it again, a vote that requires a two-thirds vote, which may be an elusive task in today’s polarized politics.

The announcement said the withdrawal would take a year to go into effect.

Why now?

Beginning on 2025 tax returns, new car buyers who qualify can take a new deduction of up to $10,000 in car loan interest during a given tax year.

The so-called ""no tax on car loan interest"" promise has enough dents and dings to leave plenty of car buyers upset when they discover they won't qualify for the much-publicized tax break on their 2025 income tax returns.

Who is being left on the side of the road?

Lower-income households who don't have much cash to buy a more affordable used car — many use their tax refund cash for a down payment — cannot get a federal income tax deduction on interest paid in 2025 for higher-rate used car loans taken out last year.

Yep, used car loans don't count.

And if you lease? Forget it. The new deduction for car loan interest that went into place under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act does not apply to leases, either.

Leasing is a big deal in Michigan — as well as some other states including New Jersey, New York, and California — where a large percentage of new car sales involve leases, not new car loans.

In Michigan, nearly 53% of new vehicles sold in the third quarter of 2025 involved a lease, not a car loan, according to data from Experian. Michigan ranked No. 1 for leasing in that quarter; closely followed by New Jersey at 49.7% and New York at 43.7%.

By contrast, according to Experian, 5% or fewer of new vehicles sold in the third quarter involved a lease in states such as Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Many times, manufacturers will advertise special lease deals that are available only in Michigan, according to David Lawrence, director of finance and development for the LaFontaine Automotive Group in Highland, which has 45 dealerships in Michigan. He noted that leasing is popular in Michigan in part because so many people work in the auto industry or have family members who do and can qualify for extra discounts.

The No. 1 question to consider when it comes to claiming the car loan interest tax deduction, though, is: Where exactly was your car or truck built?

Many people cannot answer that question on the spot. But do not even bother to try to snag a tax break on car loan interest until you do a little research.

You cannot claim the new tax deduction for car loan interest, if the new car you bought in 2025 had its final assembly outside of the United States.

How to find out where your car was built

If you think you might qualify for the car loan interest deduction, first dig out the window sticker that was on the new car you bought in 2025 — known as the Monroney label, named for Sen. Almer Stilwell “Mike” Monroney. The Oklahoma Democrat pushed for legislation to give consumers detailed upfront information via window stickers in 1958.

The sticker will tell you where the car was built. Don't assume anything. Find the exact location of final assembly for your make and model.

For many consumers, it can be difficult to discern whether a car's final assembly was in the United States, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Some Detroit Three vehicles, for example, can have final assembly outside of the United States.

""One model of that trim may be built in Mexico, and the other trim may be built in America. It's sometimes may even be trim-specific,"" Lawrence said.

That's why you must refer to the Monroney label, he said.

And remember, production can move around, too, from one year to another.

""Manufacturers have been adjusting their manufacturing locations a lot over the past few years,"" said Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group consulting firm in East Lansing.

What many might not realize is that popular brands, such as Toyota and Honda, have assembly plants in the United States. Yet some popular models don't qualify for the new tax break because their final assembly isn't in the United States, including the Toyota Tacoma, the Honda HR-V, the Chevrolet Equinox, the Kia K4 and the Ford Maverick, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.

Taxpayers who cannot find their vehicle's window sticker can turn to the VIN Decoder tool at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. You plug in the VIN from your vehicle and the model year.

It works well. Look for ""plant information"" for final assembly.

If the vehicle was assembled in the United States, buyers will need to include the VIN on Schedule 1-A to claim the deduction. See the top of page 2 of Schedule 1-A dubbed ""No Tax on Car Loan Interest.""

You'd claim the ""total additional deductions"" from Schedule 1-A, line 38, on your 1040 form, line 13b.

A key point: Someone can claim a deduction for car loan interest even if they opt for the standard deduction, as most people do, or if they itemize other deductions on Schedule A.

How much can you save in taxes from car loan interest?

Beginning on 2025 tax returns, new car buyers can take a new deduction of up to $10,000 in car loan interest during a given tax year. The deduction would reduce your taxable income in a given year, if you qualified.

Most people do not pay anything close to $10,000 in interest a year on a new car loan. How much you save will depend on how much of the interest you paid in 2025 qualifies for the tax deduction and your specific income tax rate.

Typically, those who qualify might see tax savings in a year that could range from around $300 to $900 for many new car buyers, Anderson said.

Car loan interest payments tend to be front-loaded in the first year of the car loan, so you'd likely see the biggest deduction in the first year of the car loan.

The deduction will get lower in future tax years as they pay off the loan over time, Anderson said.

The deduction is only available on tax returns for 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 currently. If you took out a six-year, new car loan in 2025, for example, you would not receive a break during the last two years of that car loan.

Remember, the car loan interest deduction only lasts through tax year 2028, which may not necessarily be through the life of your particular car loan.

The deduction only applies for car loans taken out after Dec. 31, 2024, through Dec. 31, 2028.

Several rules apply to car loan interest deduction

While many car buyers will be thrilled to get a tax break on their car loan interest, figuring out who actually qualifies could prove to be excruciatingly painful.

For some, it's not quite as tortuous as trying to rebuild your car's transmission. But it could be close.

Higher income households tend to buy more new cars, but many taxpayers could discover that their incomes are above the income limit required to qualify for the deduction for the interest they paid on new car loans.

The deduction phases out by $200 for each $1,000 — or a fraction of — of modified adjusted gross income above $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for joint filers.

In simplest terms, the deduction for auto loan interest is no longer available at a modified adjusted gross income of $150,000 for single filers and $250,000 for joint filers.

An example listed by Jackson Hewitt online: A single person with a qualifying auto loan and a modified adjusted gross income of $120,000 would only be eligible to claim up to $6,000 of the car loan interest deduction instead of the maximum of $10,000.

The limit is based on ""modified adjusted gross income,"" not regular adjusted gross income, meaning it's not always simple to figure out.

Did you owe more than your trade-in car was worth?

One shocking quirk will apply to far more new car buyers than many would imagine.

We're talking about buyers who owed more on their car loan than their trade-in vehicle was worth. Sometimes, consumers who are upside down on a car loan are able to roll over some of what they owe on an old loan into the new car loan. In most cases, the borrower also must bring money to the table to help offset the negative equity, Drury said.

The average down payment for consumers with a negative equity trade-in during the third quarter of 2025 was $2,721.

When it comes to the new tax break for car loan interest, you're not able to deduct interest paid on any negative equity that was rolled into the new car loan, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting in Riverwoods, Illinois.

""The negative equity does not disqualify the entire loan,"" Luscombe said, ""only the negative equity portion of the loan.""

On Dec. 31, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed guidance on the deduction for new car loan interest under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed into law July 4 by President Donald Trump.

Trump initially rolled out the idea for a new tax break on car loans during a 2024 campaign stop at the Detroit Economic Club.

The Dec. 31 proposed guidance specifically refers to loans involving ""negative equity.""

The amount of the loan that qualifies for the new car loan deduction is what is used to buy the new car — and the negative equity in that car loan is not viewed as something directly related to the new passenger car or truck, according to the IRS guidance.

It's not a small point. A growing number of consumers are trading in cars and trucks that are worth much less than the amount of money they still owe on their old auto loans.

More than one in four new vehicle trade-ins were ""underwater"" or ""upside down"" in the third quarter of 2025, which was a four-year high, according to research from Edmunds.

In the third quarter last year, Edmunds noted that 28.1% of trade-ins toward new car purchases had negative equity, up from 26.6% in second quarter last year and 24.2% in first quarter last year.

The average amount owed on upside-down loans hit a record $6,905 in third quarter, edging past the previous high of $6,880 set in first quarter of 2025.

The IRS proposed guidance lists a complicated example of a taxpayer who obtained a $50,000 car loan on a vehicle that qualifies for the tax deduction. Let's say the consumer had $4,000 for the down payment but traded in a car that had $6,000 of negative equity.

In this case, the consumer is rolling $2,000 of negative equity into that new car loan. The down payment is subtracted from the $6,000 of negative equity.

In this example, the IRS notes that $48,000 would qualify for what it calls a ""specified passenger vehicle loan"" and $2,000 in that $50,000 car loan would not apply when calculating the tax break. The interest paid in a given year on $48,000 loan in this example would be deducted on Schedule 1-A.

The proposed guidance could change, but Luscombe said that it seems unlikely regarding negative equity situations.

Some key tax tips for claiming the car loan deduction

If you believe you qualify for the new deduction for car loan interest for a car loan taken out in 2025, experts offer these tips:

Get paperwork in order as early as you can. Tax professionals will ask that you bring the original loan and financing agreement, which would show the amount financed, whether the loan is a first lien, and whether there are any add-ons that would not qualify for a tax break, according to Elizabeth Young, director for tax practice and ethics with the American Institute of CPAs.

To qualify, the car loan must be secured by a lien on your car or truck. And that new car or truck must have seen its final assembly at a factory in the United States.

Insurance, including extended warranty coverage that was bought as an add-on, would not qualify as part of the car loan deduction, Young said.

Be prepared to bring in the VIN to your tax preparer so that the VIN can be reported on Schedule 1-A. The VIN often can be found on the purchase contract, insurance card for your auto insurance, the window sticker that was on the car when you bought it, or your state registration.

You want to make sure the VIN you report on Schedule 1-A is accurate. ""If the VIN isn’t reported on the tax return, then there is no deduction,"" Young said.

Filing electronically can help, she said, because it would reduce the risk of omitting the VIN field from Schedule 1-A.

You can now see Schedule 1-A online; it's a new form that's needed for four new tax deductions — car loan interest, overtime, tips and a special deduction for taxpayers 65 and older.

Add up the interest: You're not deducting the entire monthly payment. You're deducting the interest paid each month. You're not deducting the amount of the entire loan, either.

""It is for the interest paid on the loan during the tax year; it is not the value of the loan itself,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt.

For 2025 tax returns, the IRS said lenders can offer an online portal to buyers for spotting total amount of interest paid on new car loans in 2025.

Drivers also can review monthly statements or an annual statement that breaks down interest payments. ""Like most loans, you should be able to obtain a year-end total interest paid statement from the loan company,"" said George Smith, a CPA with Andrews Hooper Pavlik in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

Lenders will be required to issue a 1098-VLI document that is a ""vehicle loan interest statement"" that will be used to claim a tax break on car loan interest paid in 2026 and after. But 2025 is viewed as a transitional year so lenders have the option of not issuing a 1098-VLI for interest paid in 2025 on new car loans.

""The best support to have would be a statement from the lender showing the interest paid on the car loan for 2025,"" Luscombe said.

Under the proposed regulations, he said, the lender would be required to issue that statement to the taxpayer by Jan. 31, 2026.

""However, for the 2025 year, the IRS has waived penalties on the lender for failure to provide the statement. Also, the statement is not required for interest totaling less than $600,"" Luscombe said.

If the statement is not received, the taxpayer will still be required to report information for interest paid on Schedule 1-A to claim the deduction.

Lawrence, of LaFontaine, said dealers are frequently helping customers who misplaced paperwork get copies at tax time and remain prepared to do so. A retail installment contract, he said, shows specific information, such as interest, when a loan is secured at the dealership.

If you secured the loan on your own, you'd need to reach out to the bank or credit union where you obtained the loan.

The RD-108 — or application for Michigan Title & Registration — shows who actually owns the vehicle.

In 2025, the NADA notes, new car buyers should expect to receive car loan information by the end of January on a monthly statement, through their lender’s online portal, or through some other communication from the lender.

Pay attention to the details: The car loan deduction can trip you up when it comes to some in specific instances.

For example, ""the buyer must be the first owner of the vehicle, but it can be any vehicle type, including electric and plug-in hybrid,"" Steber said.

Luscombe agreed that taxpayers wouldn't qualify for a tax break in situations where the car had another registered owner before the taxpayer. ""Say, for example, if the dealer titled the vehicle for use as a loaner vehicle to customers whose vehicles are in for repair,"" Luscombe said.

What if you refinanced the car loan? ""If a qualifying vehicle loan is later refinanced,"" the IRS notes, ""interest paid on the refinanced amount is generally eligible for the deduction.""

Proof of how you use the car: Strong noted that you'll need evidence that the car or truck is for personal use to claim the deduction on car loan interest. As a result, she said, be prepared to confirm that more than 50% of the expected use is personal.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/06/PDTF/88044864007-carloaninterest.jpeg?crop=3658,2059,x0,y21&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-08 02:12:25.200422

Against the backdrop of the UK’s ambition to expand low-carbon hydrogen production to 10GW by 2030, the Summit provides a platform for industry leaders, policymakers, and investors from the UAE and UK to explore collaborative solutions. The Summit will showcase how the UAE’s expertise in renewable energy and large-scale Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) projects can help scale the UK’s green hydrogen market, laying the groundwork for strategic partnerships and cross-border investment.

Leading market analysts insist that the “hurricane of hype” on green hydrogen has now settled into a new phase of market realism during the past two years, prompting the UK to push a more ambitious development agenda with low-carbon hydrogen at the forefront of its energy plans.

Increasingly confident statements from leading UK Government figures highlight a transition from stated intent to actual movement on scalable projects and investments. Sarah Jones, the UK’s Minister of State for Industry, recently confirmed this stance. “I am convinced hydrogen must be at the heart of our plans to grow the economy and to become net zero by 2050,” she said. “Already, Government and industry are delivering real projects to kickstart the UK hydrogen economy.”

The UAE is well placed to benefit from, and actively fuel, the growth of the expanding UK green hydrogen industry.

Dr Carole Nakhle, the CEO of Crystol Energy and Secretary General of the Arab Energy Club, will speak at the Summit next week. She added: “The UK and the UAE share a long-established strategic relationship that goes far beyond energy, but hydrogen is now a natural extension of that partnership as both countries pursue industrial decarbonisation and long-term growth. After the initial surge of enthusiasm, the hydrogen market has entered a more sober and disciplined phase, where scale, capital strength, technical expertise, and genuine long-term commitment will determine who succeeds. For that potential to translate into delivery, the UK will need a clear and stable regulatory framework that gives international partners such as the UAE the confidence to commit capital at scale and over decades.”

In a two-part roundtable discussion last year, the World Future Energy Summit hosted leading figures from both countries’ clean energy companies, industry groups, and financial and governmental bodies. The participants concluded that there is extremely fertile ground for deeper UAE-UK collaboration on green hydrogen development. Their specific suggestions included:

Accelerated co-funding of UK-based projects, with special investment vehicles agreed between both governments to alleviate risk and promote further public/private partnership opportunities.

Targeted support for promising startup technologies, lifting them out of “pilot purgatory”.

Clearer government signals on regulatory support and appropriate incentivisation for green hydrogen development, ranging from tax breaks and subsidy mechanisms to guaranteed offtake agreements.

Using UAE expertise to develop low-carbon hydrogen hubs in appropriate UK locations, where production facilities can be powered by renewables and tied into industrial decarbonisation efforts.

Tapping into growing global demand for “clean” data centres by co-locating them with a combination of renewable energy production and CCUS to boost the efficiency of all industrial activities within the hub.

With their overlapping interests, ambitions, and areas of expertise, the years 2026-2030 could represent a new phase of UAE-UK collaboration on green hydrogen. In a recent edition of the World Future Energy Summit podcast series, Future Energy Insights, Frank Wouters, Chairman of the MENA Hydrogen Alliance, explained how these next few years will be pivotal for the UAE and wider GCC region to capitalise on their production efforts to date.

“While the Gulf countries built their economies on hydrocarbons, they didn’t do it purely for export purposes – they used those resources to fuel major industrial development,” he said. “The beauty of hydrogen is its utility; you can replace the hydrocarbons across all industrial activities to clean them up, and these economies are primed to plug in green hydrogen at scale.

“GCC economies are investing heavily into this approach, and now the Gulf’s ability to produce scalable, low-cost green hydrogen makes it the ideal time to forge closer links with regions looking to offtake, such as Europe and Southeast Asia.”

Upscaling green hydrogen in the UK from pilot projects and isolated case studies into industry-wide integration efforts will require massive, sustained funding. The UK Government’s own projections suggest that a further £9 billion (AED 44.6 billion) of private sector funding will need to be raised to keep its 2030 ambitions on track, primarily through the 27 hydrogen projects that represent the next stage of the government’s flagship hydrogen programme. June 2025 saw the UK Government invest a further £500 million of public funds for the specific purpose of developing hydrogen infrastructure, signalling its long-term commitment to building this nascent industry.

This represents an unmissable opportunity for the UAE to solidify its position as a long-term strategic partner in the UK’s green hydrogen development journey. At home, the UAE has already allocated billions of dollars to upscale its production facilities, such as the Ta’ziz Industrial Hub and a gigawatt-scale hub in the Khalifa Economic Zones Abu Dhabi (KEZAD). These two projects alone represent a £5.2 billion investment.

Abroad, its appetite for funding is growing even faster, as last year saw UAE private interests commit £18.5 billion to a new green hydrogen and ammonia project in Dakhla, Morocco, to develop a facility with a 1 million tonnes per year capacity. Private and public investment sources within the UAE are now primed to flow towards the UK as well, if properly encouraged with a suitable combination of clear government signals and a strong list of viable, de-risked projects.

In another Future Energy Insights episode, Cornelius Matthes, CEO of Dii Desert Energy, outlined the reasoning behind the UAE’s increasing eagerness to grow its own domestic capabilities in green hydrogen, with a view to creating an industry that outstrips local demand and taps into growing global appetite for decarbonisation.

“The UAE has a target of 1.4 million tonnes per year by 2031, but with so many new projects in the pipeline, I’m confident it will exceed that level, even if they don’t all materialise,” he said. “The whole GCC region is one of the few globally that has the right conditions and infrastructure to both develop cost-competitive hydrogen quickly and export it. Proximity to demand centres, established trade links, a strong industrial heritage – there are so many reasons why it makes sense for the region to pursue green hydrogen for the global market as well as its own demand.”

In recognition of its growing role and prominence in the global energy transition, the World Future Energy Summit 2026, which already hosts several leading players in the sector, will once again feature the Green Hydrogen Innovation Hub, a dedicated zone that showcases 20+ startups whose innovations may pave the way to even faster global integration and upscaling.

Standout companies include Advanced Ionics, whose electrolyser technology uses waste heat from industry to create low-cost clean hydrogen for less than $1/kg, directly addressing the cost barrier for heavy industry. Another is Power to Hydrogen, who offer an AEM electrolyser that cuts capital costs by 65 per cent and integrates directly with renewable sources, solving the high CAPEX challenge of traditional systems.

With sufficient planning and close cooperation, the UAE and UK can put their respective resources, expertise, and investment links to the strongest possible use, ensuring that both nations enjoy the benefits of early adoption of green hydrogen. The World Future Energy Summit will explore the growing links between these two nations, and their respective regional markets, in the context of a global transition to cleaner energy sources that fuel faster industrial decarbonisation.

Charles Oppenheimer, the grandson of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is the founder and CEO of Oppenheimer Energy, a developer of nuclear energy projects.","OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — Once a home of the Manhattan Project, the fields surrounded by forested valleys and rolling hills in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, could soon yield another nuclear first.

Concrete foundations and pilings are rising here for what is expected to be one of the first of a new generation of nuclear power plants, known as small modular reactors. The company behind it, Kairos Power, has been developing its technology for almost a decade and is now deep in the throes of construction.

Many companies are racing to build reactors that experts say could, over time, be cheaper than the kind of large nuclear power plants that have been in use for decades. To hear corporate executives and government officials tell it, the world is at the dawn of a new nuclear age that will provide cheap energy and satiate artificial intelligence technology’s staggering appetite for electricity.

At the center of this promise is the idea of shrinking the vessels where nuclear reactions heat water to produce steam used to spin turbines. The components of these smaller reactors, the thinking goes, can be mass-produced and assembled more easily than conventional designs built by a small army of highly skilled workers.

The nuclear power industry has long struggled to complete projects. Almost all U.S. nuclear power plants in operation started generating power decades ago, most before Bill Clinton became president. In recent decades, steep costs and long delays, coupled with concerns about safety, have stymied nuclear energy.

“I think a lot of people recognize the value of what nuclear can bring but are still a little bit nervous about whether it can actually be done,” said Mike Laufer, co-founder and CEO of Kairos Power, which is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. “Credibility can be very hard to earn, but it can be lost very quickly.”

The United States has more nuclear power reactors than any country, but it badly trails in building new ones. In the past decade China has built more than three dozen reactors while the United States completed just two. Those two, at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating Plant near Augusta, Georgia, came years late and cost $35 billion — about three times the original estimates.

President Donald Trump wants new reactors to be a signature achievement of his term. His Energy Department has awarded $800 million for new reactor technologies and $1 billion in loan guarantees to restart the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania. The government is expected to offer billions more.

The Trump family’s social media company is also getting into this business. In December, Trump Media & Technology Group said it planned to merge with a nuclear fusion company, TAE Technologies. Fusion energy is different from fission energy used by all nuclear power plants today, and probably many years from being perfected, energy experts say.

During a recent visit to the Idaho National Laboratory, Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, blamed regulatory hurdles for helping stifle the growth of nuclear energy. He said the creation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission almost 50 years ago had led to excessive bureaucracy.

“Since that date, we have permitted, constructed and brought online two reactors,” Wright said.

Some experts, however, contend the main problem is an industry that has repeatedly struggled to deliver. The hurdles facing advanced reactors are even bigger, the experts say, because they are novel and some require a new kind of uranium fuel that the industry has only limited experience with.

New reactors will also require significant financial investment and federal aid. That might not be a problem given the current bipartisan enthusiasm for nuclear energy, but that goodwill could evaporate if the industry again falters.

“Once again it’s the bright shiny object,” said Peter Bradford, a former commissioner on the NRC and a longtime critic of the high costs and delays that characterize new types of reactors. To be successful, a new design should be able to compete with other types of energy, he added. “Nuclear has just never been able to do that.”

The Race to Lower Costs

Nine years ago, the three founders of Kairos Power began developing their designs, pinning their hopes on a new approach. The three men all studied nuclear and mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where J. Robert Oppenheimer, the leader of the Manhattan Project, once taught.

Kairos executives said they had opted to test each phase of the plant’s development as it progressed, rather than take the approach more common in this line of work: Design, construct and hope for the best.

Unlike conventional nuclear plants, Kairos’ reactor will not have large, domed buildings made of concrete and metal. And steam will not billow from huge water towers. Instead of water, the Kairos reactor will heat salt.

The reactor will rise a bit over about 32 feet. The full commercial design includes two reactor buildings and a turbine with an overall footprint of 60 acres.

The company, which has 540 full-time employees, designs and produces its own components. It makes many of the parts in Albuquerque, New Mexico, about 60 miles from Los Alamos, the ultimate headquarters of the Manhattan Project.

Nuclear projects have been hampered by high costs and the difficulty associated with building a first-of-its-kind project, Laufer said. “And the recent experiences have only reinforced that.”

NuScale, a company that was once expected to deliver the first small reactor, in November 2023 had to cancel a project in Idaho after utilities pulled out of agreements to buy electricity from it because costs had risen too much.

The company said its technology was now advancing through a partnership with ENTRA1 Energy, an owner and developer of power plants. In September, the two companies and the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal government owned power company, announced plans to develop nuclear reactors. The first NuScale units will be built in Oak Ridge and could deliver power by 2030, the company said.

Other companies are pursuing similar projects.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy has plans to build several smaller reactors starting in Ontario. TerraPower, a company backed by Bill Gates, is building a reactor in Wyoming.

Radiant, a startup, says it is set to build this year a portable, micro reactor that will produce enough electricity to power 1,000 homes. Such devices are for special uses like providing energy to data centers or the military.

“If you don’t need a grid connection, we’re a great solution,” said Ray Wert, a company spokesperson.

Like Kairos, Radiant plans to manufacture its reactors in Oak Ridge, home to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the Energy Department’s 17 national laboratories.

Big Backers and a New Fuel

At its site in Oak Ridge, Kairos is working on a test reactor expected to be complete in 2028; a demonstration unit, capable of producing electricity, is aimed for 2030. The company has a contract to supply 500 megawatts of energy capacity — about half the capacity of the typical large-scale nuclear plant — to Google by 2035.

Google’s involvement could make a huge difference. Technology companies investing in AI bring the kinds of money and interest that were missing in the early 2000s when delays and soaring costs last scuppered ambitions for a nuclear renaissance.

Kairos declined to say how much its plant would cost. But the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit research organization, estimated in 2023 that NuScale’s canceled Idaho project, which would have been roughly the same size as the one Kairos is building, would cost about $9.3 billion.

David Schlissel, president of Schlissel Technical Consulting based in Belmont, Massachusetts, and the author of the institute’s analysis, said the cost to build small modular reactors had probably increased since 2023 because everything costs more now, including concrete and construction worker pay. “It’s a different cost environment,” he said.

NuScale said the institute’s 2023 estimates were too high, and that its current costs were competitive with other power projects.

Estimating costs is hard because much about the small reactors is new, including their fuel.

Reactors being built by Kairos and others will run on something called TRi-structural ISOtropic particle fuel, or TRISO, that was developed by the Department of Energy. The TRISO particles are enriched uranium kernels coated with multiple layers of carbon and ceramic.

Thousands of the poppy-seed-size particles are embedded in a graphite matrix to form pebbles the size of golf balls. The TRISO shell confines radioactive material from the uranium as it breaks down and produces heat. With the fuel’s built-in containment system and the molten salt coolant, the reactors won’t need the same costly reinforced containment buildings used in conventional plants, proponents say.

But some scientists are not confident that this new fuel allays all safety concerns. Edwin Lyman, a physicist and the director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the TRISO particles can generate very high heat, which warrants the use of containment buildings.

“In my view, the claims that are being made about TRISO are way oversold,” Lyman said. “We’re really headed toward a very dangerous experiment on the American people.”

But other experts are less worried about the new fuel and reactor designs.

Charles Oppenheimer, the grandson of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is the founder and CEO of Oppenheimer Energy, a developer of nuclear energy projects. He said he was discussing a role as an adviser on plans to revive V.C. Summer, a more traditional, large-scale nuclear power project in South Carolina that was canceled in 2017 after $9 billion had been spent on it.

Oppenheimer said he was also hopeful about the Kairos project, in which he is not involved. “They’ve been executing very well,” he said. “The other ones that are making more noise aren’t building as much. In this game it never counts until you’ve got it running.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/7DTXKpVa.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-08 03:12:34.051249

Prior to Venezuela’s push to keep control over its oil, the country’s oil made up about 15% of the oil refined in America.
But with U.S. control over the country’s oil industry, the amount of Venezuela oil in the U.S. is expected to increase exponentially.
She said she arrived at the realization that the Venezuelan oil crisis was coming long before Trump ever spoke about it.","On Saturday morning, John Beard woke up to news that he’d been dreading, but preparing for: A global oil crisis could hit closer to home in Texas.

The southeastern part of the state is home to more than a dozen oil refineries, and he’d spent decades working at one of them. But after attending more funerals than he could count for loved ones that died from cancer, he began to feel differently about the job.

Beard has spent the past year doing “extensive work” in Europe, warning allies about the dangers of expanding fossil fuels and urging them to prepare to “stand up and push back” against U.S. and industry plans under the Trump administration. He has also been coordinating with local advocates to scrutinize new industrial proposals in Port Arthur, his hometown in southeast Texas, which is home to several oil refineries.

Nearly half of the people living in his neighborhood report living with “poor” health, according to federal data. And the risk for developing cancer caused by air pollution is essentially the highest in the country at 1 in every 53 residents.

Beard fears it may get worse.

For him, the recent U.S. airstrike on Venezuela, which killed at least 40 citizens and has been framed as a push to restore democracy, has landed as something far more familiar: a fight over oil.

Until 2010, Venezuela was one of the world’s largest oil producers, but over the past 15 years the country’s oil production fell sharply as U.S. sanctions crippled its exports and Venezuela’s government limited output to retain control over the resource. Today, Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, a critical resource only becoming more valuable as global supplies tighten and energy demands surge.

President Donald Trump has said the U.S. will be taking over the nation’s oil reserves — keeping some for the U.S. while selling millions of barrels to other countries.

For Beard’s home and dozens of other Black communities along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas, “that’s going to be more pollution and cancer,” the community advocate said. “This is an extenuation of the problem the industry has already created and a fight to make sure there is no way out.”

Texas — particularly Beard’s hometown and neighboring Beaumont — and Louisiana make up the densest regional cluster of large refineries on the planet. And those facilities were originally designed for processing dense, sulfur-rich crude from countries like Venezuela. Years of disruption forced them to rely on Canadian tar sands and Middle Eastern blends, which increased costs for American oil companies. This last push for Venezuelan oil, experts said, is an attempt to restore profitability and strengthen the U.S. supply chain.

Prior to Venezuela’s push to keep control over its oil, the country’s oil made up about 15% of the oil refined in America. Since then, it is about 3%. But with U.S. control over the country’s oil industry, the amount of Venezuela oil in the U.S. is expected to increase exponentially.

“Trump now joins the history of U.S. presidents who have overthrown regimes of oil-rich countries. Bush with Iraq. Obama with Libya,” said Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston. “In those cases, the United States has received zero benefit from the oil. I’m afraid that history will repeat itself in Venezuela.”

Hirs argues that the physical control of reserves won’t translate to cheaper prices at American pumps, rather just increase the bottom lines of oil companies. Trump said he shared his plans to attack Venezuela with the leaders of U.S. oil companies before the bombings happened over the weekend.

Venezuelan crude oil is much worse for the environment than the typical lighter grades used in the U.S. today. “Burning any type of oil contributes to climate change, but Venezuela’s oil is ‘among the dirtiest oils in the world to produce when it comes to global warming,” said Paasha Mahdavi, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

But for refinery operators, the economics are compelling because the heavy crude is $5 to $15 cheaper per barrel.

Every year, 91,000 people die prematurely in the U.S. due to pollution events from the country’s oil and gas industry, according to a landmark yearslong study of health outcomes in communities near oil and gas facilities.

Black and Asian people are most likely to experience these negative health outcomes from oil and gas, which also includes 10,350 preterm births, 216,000 childhood cases of asthma, and 1,610 cancer cases every year. These communities in Texas and Louisiana are hit the hardest by far, the study concluded.

U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Texas said the bombing of Venezuela and the kidnapping of the nation’s president, Nicolás Maduro, is “not what the American people asked for.”

“People can’t afford groceries and millions are losing health care, but this is where his focus is,” she said.

What Will Be the Economic Consequences?

The Trump administration has suggested that American oil companies and workers will be sent to Venezuela to rebuild the oil infrastructure destroyed by years of economic collapse and sanctions. But Beard, who has spent decades watching industrial development promises fail to materialize in his own community, is deeply skeptical.

“What I thought was so funny was to hear the president say that the companies are going to go in there and they’re going to help them rebuild the infrastructure and do this and do that,” he said. “But they’re not doing it here; we have accidents weekly. So what does that tell us about what they think about us?”

Any job growth from increased Venezuelan oil refining is unlikely to reach Gulf Coast communities, despite the billions in industrial investment that flows through the region, experts said.

In the best case scenario, “it will take about a decade and about a hundred billion dollars of investment,” said Francisco Monaldi, who is the director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University in Houston.

Just three companies — Valero Energy, Chevron, and PBF Energy — process 80% of all Venezuelan crude imported to the U.S., and are best positioned to reap the benefits of the U.S. occupation of Venezuela.

Despite southeast Texas and Louisiana seeing over $100 billion in industrial development, the majority-Black communities around these industries consistently rank among the highest in unemployment — a pattern Beard describes as “environmental racism.”

In Lake Charles, Louisiana, there are three major oil refineries, including the Citgo refinery, which is the seventh-largest in the world and already a major refiner of Venezuelan oil.

For years, Debra Ramirez, who has spent her whole life in the area, has driven around with a laminated list of where the oil being refined in her backyard comes from.

She said she arrived at the realization that the Venezuelan oil crisis was coming long before Trump ever spoke about it.

Her community of Mossville, once a self-sufficient enclave with hunting grounds, gardens, and tight-knit neighborhoods where families shared their harvests with one another, was systematically dismantled by the petrochemical plants that surround Lake Charles. Many residents died from cancer-related illnesses and documented toxic blood contamination.

“They destroyed our home, and they can never ever give back,” she said.

For Ramirez, Beard, and others like them, increased Venezuelan crude refining doesn’t represent progress or “America first.”

“This is just the same old extraction and disposability that has already devastated our world,” Beard said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2232052487-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 23:59:31.699163

The demise of the coal industry left much of Appalachia in economic tatters, with lost jobs, spoiled water, and depopulated communities across the coalfields of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. Now, in an ironic twist of the region’s energy history, tech companies and data center developers are eyeing these same rural landscapes with ambitious plans to power the artificial intelligence revolution.

From the hollows of Tucker County, West Virginia, to the former strip mines of Wise County, Virginia, proposals for massive data center complexes are sparking both hope and fierce resistance. Proponents promise economic revitalization and tax revenues for struggling communities. Critics warn of environmental degradation, soaring utility bills for residents, limited job creation, and the stripping away of local control over development decisions.

The stakes are enormous. According to a September 2025 report from the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia initiative, approximately 92 gigawatts of data center capacity are currently in the pipeline across the United States, with seven gigawatts being added monthly by the end of 2024. Traditional data center hubs like Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” are becoming saturated, pushing growth toward rural regions in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky.

Where Data Centers Stand Today

Northern Virginia remains the undisputed capital of the data center world, with roughly 300 operational facilities across Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William counties. Northern Virginia is one of the world’s largest internet interconnection hubs. But capacity constraints and community opposition are forcing the industry to look elsewhere. West Virginia has thrown out the largest welcome mat in the region.

In Appalachia proper, data center development remains nascent but is accelerating rapidly. Southwest Virginia’s Wise County hosts the Mineral Gap Data Center, which came online in 2023 and is powered by a 3.4-megawatt solar array built on former strip-mined land—widely promoted as the first abandoned mine land converted to solar in Virginia. OnePartner ATAC runs a facility in Duffield, Virginia.

In January 2025, developers announced plans for Kentucky’s first hyperscale data center in Louisville, a 400-megawatt campus to be developed by PowerHouse Data Centers and Poe Companies, with utility service from Louisville Gas and Electric. The Lane Report noted the project is expected to begin operations by late 2026. It will likely represent a demonstration of what can be exported to Eastern Kentucky.

Southwest Virginia’s Growing Pipeline

Beyond the Wise County proposals, data center interest is spreading across Southwest Virginia, often into communities with minimal regulatory frameworks to evaluate such projects.

In early December 2025, Wythe County announced its first data center: a 99-acre AI computing campus at Progress Park to be developed by Solis Arx, a newly formed digital infrastructure company led by CEO Rob Noll. Cardinal News reported that county officials project the facility will represent more than $1 billion in total investment. County Administrator Stephen Bear told the Wythe County Board of Supervisors that the project would generate more than $10 million in annual tax revenue by 2028, making Solis Arx the county’s single largest taxpayer.

The company claims its facility will consume only about 2,000 gallons of water daily—roughly equivalent to a restaurant—by using closed-loop and air-based cooling systems rather than the evaporative cooling that can require hundreds of thousands of gallons per day at older facilities. Appalachian Power will provide electricity, with water supplied by the town of Wytheville.

At a December 9, 2025 board meeting covered by Cardinal News, nearly all of the dozen residents who spoke during public comment opposed the project or raised concerns about electricity rates, water supplies, environmental impacts, and the loss of rural character. Resident Hannah Ainsworth questioned the trajectory of such development: “It’s 99 acres proposed today, but what about next year, in three years? At what point is our region unrecognizable?”

Board of Supervisors Chairman Brian Vaught acknowledged a significant vulnerability in how such projects arrive. Wythe County is one of approximately seven Virginia counties that lack zoning ordinances governing where data centers can be built. “So until that’s addressed, if you don’t live in the town of Wytheville or the town of Rural Retreat, one of these could pop up as your neighbor,” Vaught said, according to Cardinal News.

Pulaski County may not be far behind. The 2025 Virginia General Assembly allocated $15 million for site readiness improvements—including road extensions, grading, and natural gas pipeline work—to support what budget documents describe as “up to $3.0 billion in capital investment” through construction of a data center and power plant. The project remains under nondisclosure agreements, with no developer publicly identified, according to Inside Climate News and Cardinal News.

Montgomery County supervisors are also weighing the issue. Cardinal News reported in mid-December 2025 that local officials are considering commissioning a study on data center zoning—a sign that even communities without active proposals recognize the need to prepare for an industry expanding rapidly across the region.

The Wise County Vision: Mine Water Cooling

One of the most ambitious proposals involves transforming 65,000 acres of former coal mining land in Wise County, Virginia, into an energy hub including data centers. A nonprofit venture called Energy DELTA Lab, managed by Will Clear and Will Payne, envisions building a massive 450-acre “Data Center Ridge” on top of old mining lands that could be powered and cooled using billions of gallons of water that naturally replenish in abandoned underground mines.

In a December 2025 report, the Thomson Reuters Foundation detailed how the entrepreneurs hope to prove the feasibility of their idea to Texas-based Energy Transfer, which owns the land managed by Penn Virginia Operating Co. Unlike neighboring areas plagued by acid mine drainage, the Wise County coalfields lack the mineral pyrite that contaminates water. The underground mine water maintains a temperature of 55 degrees or below, roughly 10 to 15 degrees cooler than river water typically used for data center cooling elsewhere in Virginia.

Payne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the water quality makes the site attractive for data center cooling. He acknowledged, however, that the region faces deep skepticism about outside development. “Anyone looking at expanding in the region, there is skepticism because there have been so many stories of promises made but not kept,” Payne said, according to the Reuters report.

Canary Media reported in September 2024 that tax revenues from data centers could help address the region’s fiscal crisis. Will Clear told Canary Media that local government finances face an existential threat without new development. The Virginia Mercury reported in July 2024 that a 36-megawatt data center could provide about $464 million in capital investment and create approximately 40 high-income jobs.

West Virginia’s Controversial Push

West Virginia has become the most aggressive state in pursuing data center development, passing sweeping legislation in April 2025 that strips local governments of regulatory authority over such projects. House Bill 2014, championed by Governor Patrick Morrisey as the centerpiece of his economic development agenda, prohibits counties and municipalities from enforcing zoning ordinances, permitting requirements, noise regulations, or code enforcement on certified microgrid districts or “high-impact” data center projects.

The law also diverts most property tax revenue from data centers away from local taxing bodies to state coffers. Under the final version, only 30% of property tax proceeds go to the host county, with five percent divided among the state’s other 54 counties. The West Virginia Gazette-Mail reported that this formula is estimated to cost counties and school districts millions of dollars.

Upon the bill’s passage, Morrisey declared it “the economic development bill of the session,” according to the Gazette-Mail. “West Virginia is America’s energy state, and this law is going to demonstrate it to the whole country that we are ready for action,” Morrisey said in a statement reported by Mountain State Spotlight.

At least four major data center projects are now publicly known in West Virginia. The most controversial involves Fundamental Data LLC, a Virginia-based company seeking to build a 1,656-megawatt natural gas power plant and data center complex on 500 acres between the towns of Thomas and Davis in Tucker County. The Wall Street Journal reported that the proposed facility could eventually span 10,000 acres across Tucker and Grant counties if fully realized.

Kentucky: Multiple Proposals, Growing Debate

Kentucky’s data center conversation has moved quickly from possibility to reality. Beyond the Louisville hyperscale campus, the Kentucky Lantern reported in August 2025 on a proposed multi-billion-dollar “technology campus” with data centers in Mason County, though key details remain thin, and local reaction has included both hope and skepticism.

In Oldham County, Louisville Public Media reported that residents organized against a proposed hyperscale data center, and the controversy has become a statewide case study in zoning disputes, noise concerns, and rural quality-of-life politics. The fight illustrates how quickly economic development proposals can become community flashpoints when a hyperscale project lands on rural ground.

The Economic Equation

The Promise of Tax Revenue

Proponents argue that data centers represent one of the few realistic options for diversifying Appalachian economies devastated by coal’s decline. The numbers from Virginia’s experience are eye-catching. According to Loudoun County officials quoted by the Citizens Voice in December 2025, data centers generate 35 to 40% of the county’s General Fund revenue, with fiscal contributions jumping from $1 million in fiscal year 2018 to $875 million in 2024. That figure is projected to reach $1.1 billion by fiscal year 2026.

A PricewaterhouseCoopers study cited by Virginia Business found that between 2017 and 2021, data centers contributed $54.2 billion to Virginia’s gross domestic product. Southwest Virginia localities have positioned themselves to capture some of this wealth by implementing the state’s lowest regional property tax rate on data center equipment at 24 cents per $100 of assessed value, compared to $3.70 in Prince William County, according to Virginia Business.

The Jobs Question

Critics contend that data centers deliver far fewer permanent jobs than their industrial footprint suggests. According to an October 2025 report from ReImagine Appalachia, most data center employment is in construction, and those jobs are often contracted from outside the communities where facilities are built.

A typical data center adds up to 1,500 workers during construction but employs only about 50 full-time workers when operational, according to a 2024 Virginia state report cited by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Those permanent positions are primarily security or janitorial staff.

At an April 2025 town hall meeting in Davis, West Virginia, covered by 100 Days in Appalachia, electrical engineer Brian Reed—whose family has been in Tucker County since 1896—challenged the jobs pitch. “$12 an hour isn’t a job, you can’t survive,” Reed said. “The operators in the plant where I work make $43 an hour. That’s a job that makes a difference. So don’t offer jobs that are for security people that are going to starve to death.”

Nationwide, data center employment grew from 306,000 to 501,000 workers between 2016 and 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But more than 40% of those jobs are concentrated in just three states, far from Appalachia’s coalfields, as reported by West Virginia Watch.

Environmental Concerns

The Water Challenge

Data centers rank among the top ten water-consuming commercial industries in the United States. A medium-sized facility can consume around 110 million gallons of water annually for cooling, with some consuming up to 5 million gallons daily, according to a report from the University of Tulsa. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute reported that data centers in Northern Virginia collectively consumed nearly 2 billion gallons of water in 2023, a 63% increase from 2019.

Water consumption varies significantly based on cooling technology. Evaporative or wet cooling requires substantial water withdrawals and raises concerns in drought-prone areas like Maricopa County, Arizona, which has been inundated by data center developments. Air cooling reduces water needs but increases electricity consumption. The Wise County proposal’s closed-loop mine-water cooling approach attempts to change the equation by using cool underground mine water as a heat sink, potentially eliminating dependence on surface water or municipal systems.

Water concerns are particularly acute in some Appalachian locations. Tucker County, West Virginia, suffered through a severe drought in 2024 that forced emergency water pumping from the Blackwater River. 100 Days in Appalachia reported that in neighboring Thomas, the reservoir reached its lowest level in 60 years, rendering water unusable due to high iron concentrations.

In a December 2025 Brookings Institution podcast, Davis Mayor Al Tomson expressed concern about cumulative water impacts. “We’ve suffered a drought for the last two summers,” Tomson said. “We’ve had to go to our secondary water source, which is the Blackwater River. But if the data centers start drawing water out of the aquifer... I’m concerned that it’s gonna affect the source water for the creek that we’re using right now.”

Noise Pollution

The constant hum of cooling systems and backup generators has emerged as one of the most contentious issues for communities living near data centers. According to TechTarget, facilities produce noise levels between 55 and 85 decibels from cooling fans, mechanical chillers, and ventilation systems—sounds that are particularly intrusive in rural areas where residents moved seeking quiet.

In Northern Virginia, Amazon Web Services data centers near the Great Oak subdivision in Manassas have drawn persistent complaints. WUSA9 reported that residents describe the sound as a low roar combined with a high-pitched whir. “These data centers are loud, noisy beasts, and they are being built too close to residential areas,” community activist Roger Yackel told WUSA9. “That’s not something that we should have to live with.”

The Prince William Times reported in December 2022 that noise remediation can cost millions of dollars, and unless regulators apply pressure, companies may be slow to implement solutions. In Tucker County, the prospect of constant industrial noise near the tourist towns of Davis and Thomas—known for stargazing, hiking, and natural beauty—has fueled fierce opposition.

Air Quality and Diesel Risk

Large data centers typically rely on diesel backup generators that produce air pollution during testing and emergencies. The Parsons Advocate of Tucker County reported that the Fundamental Data project there would include 30 million gallons of diesel fuel storage to back up its natural gas power plant.

The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection approved an air quality permit for the Tucker County facility in August 2025 over strenuous community objections. The Intermountain newspaper in Elkins, West Virginia, reported that more than 1,600 written comments were submitted during the public comment period.

“We are extremely disappointed that the West Virginia DEP really isn’t upholding their mission to protect our air, land, and water,” Nikki Forrester of Tucker United told The Intermountain. “They discussed at the public meeting that they’ve never rejected an air quality permit before.”

Community Backlash: Three Overlapping Camps

Across Appalachia, community reactions to data center proposals tend to fall into three overlapping camps. The first is the development coalition: county officials, industrial development authorities, some trades, landowners, and utilities who argue that data centers represent a once-in-a-generation chance to replace the coal-era tax base and keep young people local.

The second is the quality-of-life coalition: nearby residents, tourism businesses, and preservation groups focused on noise, light pollution, traffic, and land conversion. The third is the accountability coalition: people who might tolerate a project if rules are strict, demanding transparency about corporate identity, enforceable limits, and binding community benefits.

In Pittsylvania County, Virginia, grassroots organizing successfully blocked Balico LLC’s proposal to build what would have been Virginia’s largest natural gas power plant at 3,500 megawatts alongside a hyperscale data center campus.

In Tucker County, residents formed Tucker United within weeks of learning about the Fundamental Data proposal. West Virginia Watch reported that the group now counts hundreds of members. “No Data Center in Tucker County” signs have proliferated in windows, storefronts, and on vehicles throughout Davis and Thomas.

One recurring complaint involves the lack of transparency from developers. Fundamental Data’s air permit application was heavily redacted, with the company claiming confidential business information. The firm’s public website consists only of a logo and a copyright notice, as noted by 100 Days in Appalachia.

“The company hasn’t come down and spoken with us at all,” Forrester told Corporate Crime Reporter in August 2025. “From a local leadership standpoint, none of us were aware that this was even a possibility. It feels like it’s a power grab where they want to get rid of any local control, take the money, and leave West Virginians to suffer.”

WVVA reported in April 2025 that more than 1,000 West Virginians signed a petition asking Governor Morrisey to veto HB 2014. He signed it anyway.

Utility Companies in the Mix

This is not just a technology story—it’s a utility planning story. Several major utilities are positioning themselves to serve the anticipated data center boom in Appalachia.

American Electric Power, the parent company of Appalachian Power in West Virginia and Kentucky Power in eastern Kentucky, has emerged as a key player. Data Center Dynamics reported in February 2025 that AEP expects to bring 4.7 gigawatts of new data center capacity online in 2025 alone and has customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of incremental load by 2030.

Louisville Gas and Electric will serve Kentucky’s first hyperscale data center campus. Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility and the company most directly tied to Northern Virginia’s data center concentration, is expanding infrastructure across the Commonwealth. In Southwest Virginia, Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy provide electricity to the region where the Energy DELTA Lab project is proposed.

FirstEnergy has announced $15 billion for power infrastructure investments to support data center growth, according to the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia report. The company serves customers across Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey.

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator covering much of coal-country Appalachia, has become central to debates about supply, demand, and rate impacts. West Virginia Public Broadcasting reported that projected data center load growth far exceeds new supply coming online in the near term.

Will Electric Bills Rise?

The short answer appears to be yes, and in some cases dramatically. Data center demand has already contributed to soaring wholesale electricity prices across the PJM Interconnection, the regional grid that serves West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other mid-Atlantic states. Stories of ratepayer protests about rising electricity prices are appearing all across the mountains.

Mountain State Spotlight reported in October 2025 that the cost to secure an adequate power supply in PJM’s annual capacity auction jumped from $2.2 billion for 2024-2025 to $14.7 billion for 2025-2026, an increase of more than 500%. CNBC reported that an independent monitor found data center demand, both actual and forecast, accounted for $9.3 billion, or 63%, of that total. In the December 2025 auction, prices hit $16.4 billion, with PJM falling short of its reliability target for the first time. Nearly all of the 5,250-megawatt increase in projected demand was attributable to data centers.

Monitoring Analytics, a specialized firm that acts as an independent monitor for the PJM Interconnection, said in its June report: “Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices.”

These costs are spread across the entire grid, affecting ratepayers throughout the region. CNBC reported in November 2025 that residential electricity prices surged 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois, and 12% in Ohio during a recent 12-month period, well above the six percent national average.

A Harvard Law School study released in September 2025 warned that utilities may be subsidizing data center growth by shifting infrastructure costs to residential and other ratepayers. The Union of Concerned Scientists reached a similar conclusion in an October 2025 analysis: “The wealthiest companies are building extraordinarily expensive data centers that you and I are subsidizing.”

Cathy Kunkel, an energy consultant at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told Mountain State Spotlight: “One of the principles of electric rate regulation is that the entity that’s imposing cost on the system bears those costs to the extent possible. The historical way transmission cost allocation has been done is just not keeping up with that principle when it comes to data centers.”

Corporate Players in Appalachia

Two overlapping groups of corporations are driving the data center push into Appalachia. The first consists of hyperscalers—the companies whose cloud and AI services create the underlying demand: Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Even when they aren’t named publicly, they often sit behind developer NDAs or vague references to “Fortune 100” clients, as the Kentucky Lantern has noted in its coverage.

Amazon Web Services has the largest data center footprint nationally, with hundreds of facilities in Northern Virginia alone. Google has committed $25 billion for data centers and infrastructure, including a $3 billion deal with Brookfield Asset Management for hydropower electricity, according to the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia report.

The second group consists of developers, landholders, and power partners—the visible local actors. PowerHouse Data Centers and Poe Companies are developing Kentucky’s first hyperscale campus in Louisville. Compass Datacenters and QTS Data Centers are building the Prince William Digital Gateway in Virginia, billed as the world’s largest future data center complex at 23 million square feet, according to Virginia Business.

In West Virginia, Fundamental Data LLC of Purcellville, Virginia, is pursuing the massive Tucker County project. TransGas Development Systems of New York is proposing two off-grid power plants in Mingo County for what the applications call the “Adams Fork Data Center Energy Campus,” according to Mountain State Spotlight. Texas-based Fidelis New Energy has proposed a data center complex in Mason County.

In early December, ten Mingo County residents filed a federal lawsuit seeking to halt the Adams Fork project, alleging violations of the Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, and National Environmental Policy Act.

Questions Communities Should Ask

What Advocacy Groups Recommend

Several organizations have developed frameworks to help communities evaluate data center proposals and advocate for responsible development. Their recommendations share common themes: transparency, local control, binding commitments, and protection for existing residents and ratepayers.

Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition

The Piedmont Environmental Council and nearly 30 environmental, preservation, and climate advocacy groups formed the Virginia Data Center Reform Coalition in late 2023. Julie Bolthouse, the Council’s director of land use, told Inside Climate News in December 2023 that an “ever-increasing data center footprint” has resulted in “higher utility rates, new transmission lines, declining air quality, reduced water supply,” and a loss in Virginia’s “hard-fought climate goals.”

The coalition has articulated four pillars of reform. The first is enhanced transparency, requiring disclosure and statewide reporting on data center energy use, water consumption, and emissions. The second is state oversight, establishing state-level regulatory review to evaluate regional impacts. The third is ratepayer protection, safeguarding residents and businesses from subsidizing billions of dollars in infrastructure that data centers require. The fourth is incentivizing sustainability by connecting tax exemptions to clean energy and efficiency standards.

“There needs to be more transparency around this industry; we need to know how much energy, how much water, and their emissions,” Bolthouse told Data Center Dynamics in November 2024. “Our localities are ill-equipped to handle the regional implications that are coming from these massive projects.”

PennFuture’s Model Ordinance

PennFuture, a Pennsylvania environmental nonprofit, has created a model zoning ordinance and educational video series to help municipalities prepare for data center development. The organization developed its model after reviewing ordinances passed in Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia.

The model ordinance addresses water consumption, power consumption, noise, and aesthetic concerns. According to PennFuture’s website, “Municipalities must take seriously their responsibility to plan for this new land use and avoid being caught unaware, as many were when the distribution center boom struck Pennsylvania in recent years.”

Donna Kohut of PennFuture told the Republican Herald in August 2025 that Pennsylvania faces serious risks from legislation that would fast-track data center approvals. “By allowing developers to side-step critical and constitutionally required environmental protections, our elected officials would be allowing for unfettered destruction of Pennsylvania’s natural resources and risking the health of our local communities,” Kohut said.

ReImagine Appalachia

ReImagine Appalachia, a coalition focused on sustainable economic development in the Ohio River Valley, published a report in October 2025 titled “Is Responsible Data Center Development Possible?” The report argues that data centers can benefit communities if proper safeguards are implemented.

The organization recommends that data centers be located on shuttered industrial facilities rather than greenfields, ideally co-located with factories or greenhouses that can benefit from waste heat recovery. Components should be procured locally to contribute to the region’s manufacturing sector. Strong labor standards should ensure local workers are hired in development and construction, including prevailing wage requirements, project labor agreements, and registered apprenticeship programs.

“Attracting new industries to our communities should not be a race to the bottom,” ReImagine Appalachia wrote. “The new growth of data centers in the region is a call to assess how our policy models have historically favored economic and project development that benefits extractive, exploitative, absentee corporations at the expense of our communities, workers, and lands.”

NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Principles

In September 2025, the NAACP and environmental justice advocates released guiding principles for data center development following a convening in Memphis, Tennessee, of nearly 70 climate and community advocates. The gathering was prompted in part by concerns about Elon Musk’s xAI data center in South Memphis, which the NAACP has challenged legally over unpermitted gas turbines in a historically Black neighborhood.

The NAACP’s framework demands that companies disclose water and energy consumption, emissions, subsidies, and corporate ownership details as soon as they propose new projects. Energy efficiency standards and environmental commitments must become legally binding through community benefit agreements.

“No community should be forced to sacrifice clean air, clean water, or safe homes so that corporations and billionaires can build energy-hungry facilities,” the NAACP stated in the principles, as reported by The Verge. Abre’ Conner, director of the Center for Environmental and Climate Justice at the NAACP, told The Verge that the principles put tech companies “on alert” that “if they do not meet our demands... we move into other forms of advocacy, including filing litigation.”

An Uncertain Future

The data center rush into Appalachia encapsulates the region’s century-long struggle with extractive industries and outside development. Like coal before it, data centers promise jobs and prosperity while communities worry about bearing the environmental and social costs.

Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at the Piedmont Environmental Council, offered a warning to West Virginia Watch in June 2025: “What you’re going to get if you do it this way is the worst players, the ones that didn’t need to be in Northern Virginia. The players that are wanting that lack of regulations because they didn’t want to abide by rules and didn’t want to or need to protect communities, which is worse for West Virginia and the communities.”

The U.S. Department of Energy projects that data centers could consume between 6.7 and 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023. That growth will require new power generation somewhere, and Appalachia’s abundant natural gas, available land, and water resources make it attractive despite the challenges.

Whether the region can chart a different path than its coal experience remains to be seen. The battles playing out in Tucker County, Wise County, Wythe County, and communities across the region will help determine whether data centers become genuine engines of renewal or simply the latest chapter in Appalachia’s long history of extraction without lasting benefit.

As one Tucker County resident put it at an April town hall covered by 100 Days in Appalachia: “It’s been so long and such a hard fight, and then all of a sudden it feels like this is gonna kick the legs out from the stool from everything that’s already here.”

California Appellate Court Found that Trial Court Erred in Concluding It Lacked Jurisdiction Over Citgo in Municipalities’ Climate Cases

In climate change-based tort lawsuits brought by California municipalities, the California Court of Appeal reversed a trial court order granting Citgo Petroleum Corporation’s (Citgo’s) motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The appellate court found that the trial court erred in concluding that the municipalities’ claims did not arise from or relate to Citgo’s California contacts. The court found that the municipalities demonstrated that Citgo purchased, distributed, and sold fossil fuel products to California consumers via contractual arrangements with other companies, that Citgo promoted the products as Citgo gasoline, and that Citgo “did not include any materials identifying climate-related risks associated with utilizing gasoline.” The appellate court found that “[b]ecause the complaint clearly encompasses claims based upon a duty to warn and asserts that Citgo failed to do so,” the plaintiffs met their burden to demonstrate a connection between Citgo’s California contacts and their claims. The court therefore concluded that specific jurisdiction over Citgo was appropriate. The court also found that Citgo failed to demonstrate that exercise of jurisdiction was unreasonable.

Hawai‘i Trial Court Rejected Fossil Fuel Companies’ Motions to End Honolulu Climate Suit

A Hawai‘i trial court denied motions by fossil fuel companies to dismiss or grant summary judgment to the companies on climate change tort claims asserted by the City and County of Honolulu and Honolulu Board of Water Supply (Honolulu).

The court rejected the companies’ argument that, as a matter of law, the Hawai‘i Supreme Court’s October 2023 opinion allowing Honolulu to proceed with its lawsuit “expressly limited [Honolulu’s] claims to conduct that occurred in, or that targeted, the State of Hawai‘i.” Based on the oral arguments before the Supreme Court and a footnote in the Supreme Court’s opinion, the court concluded that the Supreme Court understood the scope of Honolulu’s claims, did not geographically limit those claims, and left Honolulu to prove causation at trial.

The court also found that the defendants did not satisfy the requirements for summary judgment on their argument that the statute of limitations barred Honolulu’s claims. Citing Hawai‘i Supreme Court precedent that “summary judgment should not be granted when there is still time for the non-movant to develop evidence for use at trial,” the court found that it “cannot conclude continued discovery efforts would be futile.”

Similarly, the court found that it could not conclude that continued discovery efforts by Honolulu would be futile on issues relevant to defendants’ personal jurisdiction arguments. City & County of Honolulu v. Sunoco LP, No. 1CCV-20-0000380 (Haw. Cir. Ct. Jan. 2, 2026)

U.S. DECISIONS AND SETTLEMENTS

Montana Supreme Court Declined to Exercise Original Jurisdiction to Consider Claims that Post-Held v. State Amendments to Environmental Laws Were Unconstitutional

On December 23, 2025, the Montana Supreme Court declined to exercise original jurisdiction to consider the merits of a petition filed 13 days earlier by 13 Montana youth who alleged that 2025 amendments to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) and the Montana Clean Air Act were unconstitutional under the court’s December 2024 ruling in Held v. State. The youth petitioners, who also were plaintiffs in Held v. State, argued in the petition that the 2025 amendments violated their fundamental rights to a clean and healthful environment under the Montana Constitution and Held because they “re-blindfold state agencies during MEPA reviews of fossil fuel projects” and unlawfully restrict the prevention and abatement of greenhouse gas air pollution. The petitioners argued that their petition justified an original proceeding before the Montana Supreme Court because (1) it presented an issue of statewide importance due to “ongoing state-wide harms from fossil fuel air pollution,” together with “the high-volume of MEPA reviews” conducted each year; (2) the enactment and implementation of the amendments was “plainly contrary to binding precedent,” including Held; (3) the constitutionality of the amendments presented purely legal questions; (4) “urgent resolution” was required because “every additional ton of GHG emissions emitted as a result of Respondents’ actions exacerbates Petitioners’ injuries and risks locking in irreversible climate injuries”; and (5) respondents were currently engaged in reviews for large-scale fossil fuel projects and permits and in drafting a “GHG Guidance Document.” The court concluded, however, that the petitioners did not demonstrate why urgency or emergency factors made the normal trial court litigation and appeals process inadequate. The court noted that the petitioners had filed the petition seven months after the amendments took effect. The court acknowledged the petitioners’ argument that development of a factual record was unnecessary due to the factual record already created in Held, but the court found that the petitioners had not addressed why a district court could not address the legal issues “in a timely fashion and permit them to present an appeal in the ordinary course.” Held v. State, No. OP 25-0853 (Mont. Dec. 23, 2025)

En Banc D.C. Circuit to Rehear Challenges to EPA Termination of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Grants

On December 17, 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted petitions for rehearing en banc and vacated its September 2, 2025 decision holding that a federal district court abused its discretion when it granted nonprofit organizations’ motion for a preliminary injunction requiring the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and a bank that served as the U.S.’s financial agent to continue funding grants awarded to the organizations during the Biden administration under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund established by the Inflation Reduction Act. The D.C. Circuit’s December 17 order provided that an April 16, 2025 partial administrative stay was in effect. The court set a schedule for new briefing to be completed on February 17, 2026 and for oral argument to be heard on February 24. Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-5122 (D.C. Cir.

Hawaii Federal Court Declined to Block State’s Climate Impact Fee from Taking Effect; Ninth Circuit Granted Private Plaintiffs’ and U.S.’s Requests for Injunction Pending Appeal

On December 23, 2025, the federal district court for the District of Hawaii denied motions by cruise industry and local business plaintiffs and by the United States for a preliminary injunction blocking a Hawai‘i law imposing a “climate impact fee” on cruise ship operators. The law—Act 96—extends the State’s transient accommodations tax to cruise ships and also imposes registration and notice requirements. It was scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026. On December 4, the court granted the United States’ motion to intervene, finding that the government satisfied the conditions for permissive intervention. In its December 23 decision on preliminary injunction motions filed by the U.S. and by the private plaintiffs and on a motion to dismiss the private plaintiffs’ complaint, the court first concluded that both plaintiff Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA)—which is an organization whose members include cruise line brands representing 95% of global cruise capacity—and local business plaintiffs challenging the law had constitutional standing but that the local businesses asserted the rights of third parties and therefore did not have prudential standing. The court also concluded that the United States had standing to bring suit to protect its interest in federal supremacy over interstate maritime commerce. Second, the court concluded that because state mechanisms existed for challenging Act 96’s state tax and county surcharges, the court lacked jurisdiction over CLIA’s claims regarding these provisions under the Tax Injunction Act, though the court concluded that it could retain jurisdiction over CLIA’s challenges to Act 96’s registration fee and notice requirements. The court concluded, however, that the Tax Injunction Act did not bar the U.S. claims. Third, the court denied the state defendants’ motion to dismiss the challenges to the registration fee and notice requirements but dismissed the claims against the county defendants, finding that CLIA did not establish that they had anything to do with the registration fee or notice requirements. Regarding the preliminary injunction motions, the court said it could not conclude that CLIA or the federal government were likely to succeed on the merits despite “serious questions” as to whether Act 96’s state tax, county surcharges, and registration fee violate the Constitution’s Tonnage Clause or are preempted by the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1884. The court also found that CLIA did not establish a likelihood of success on its First Amendment challenge to Act 96’s notice requirements because the challenge was based on the underlying constitutionality of the tax, surcharges, and fee. Both the U.S. and the private plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit and filed emergency motions for injunctive relief. On December 31, the Ninth Circuit granted the motions and enjoined enforcement of Act 96 pending resolution of the appeals. Cruise Lines International Association, Inc. v. Suganuma, No. 1:25-cv-00367 (D. Haw. Dec. 4 and 23, 2025)

Rhode Island Federal Court Said Issue of Facility Owner’s Obligation to Consider Climate Change Factors Was Question for Trial

The federal district court for the District of Rhode Island ruled that whether the terms of a permit for a bulk petroleum storage and distribution facility in Providence required consideration of climate change factors was a question of fact to be decided at trial. The court therefore denied the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment dismissing three counts in a citizen suit brought by Conservation Law Foundation, Inc. The defendants had argued that the issuance by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management of a new Multi-Sector General Permit for Stormwater Discharge Associated with Industrial Activity in 2024 that explicitly imposed climate change-related obligations demonstrated that duties to consider climate change factors did not previously exist. The court concluded, however, that “whether the revised terms clarified a preexisting obligation or instead introduced an entirely new requirement is not a strictly legal exercise.” Instead, the court found that the answer to the question would depend on “facts surrounding regulatory practice, industry expectations, and what conditions were reasonably understood to fall within expected operational parameters of ‘Good Engineering Practices’ and ‘Best Management Practices’ at the time” (which were operative terms for the stormwater pollution prevention plan required by the facility’s permit). The defendants therefore failed to meet the initial burden of demonstrating no genuine dispute of material fact. Conservation Law Foundation, Inc. v. Shell Oil Products US, No. 1:17-cv-00396 (D.R.I.

The federal district court for the Middle District of Louisiana granted a motion for class certification in an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions on the Farm Line at Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as “Angola.” The court characterized the complaint as alleging that incarcerated persons working on the Farm Line “are subject to a risk of increased physical harm due to their extensive and continued exposure to high temperatures and heat indices.” The complaint also includes allegations regarding the intensification of heat exposure due to climate change. The court certified two classes: (1) a “General Class” of all persons incarcerated at Angola who currently are or may in the future be assigned to the Farm Line and (2) an “ADA Subclass” comprising all persons incarcerated at Angola “who have disabilities that substantially limit one or more of their major life activities and who currently are, or may in the future be, assigned to the Farm Line.” Trial is set to proceed on February 3, 2026.

California High-Speed Rail Authority Voluntarily Dismissed Challenge to Federal Funding Termination, Said It Would Seek Private Funding

On December 23, 2025, the California High-Speed Rail Authority voluntarily dismissed its action challenging the Federal Railroad Administration’s decision to terminate federal grant funding for the California high-speed rail program. In a press release issued the same day, the Authority announced that it had “initiated a process to bring private investors and developers to the Authority by summer 2026.” Two weeks earlier the federal district court for the Eastern District of California denied federal defendants’ motion to dismiss the action. The Authority’s complaint described the high-speed rail program as “a crucial part of California’s long-term strategic planning, not only to address critical transportation needs, but also greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as to spur economic growth in California’s Central Valley and across the State.” California High-Speed Rail Authority v. U.S. Department of Transportation, No. 2:25-cv-02004 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2025)

Maryland Federal Court Denied Offshore Wind Developer’s Request for Preliminary Injunction Blocking Revocation of Federal Approval

The federal district court for the District of Maryland denied US Wind, Inc.’s motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin an alleged federal decision to revoke the Construction and Operations Plan (COP) for US Wind’s wind project off the Atlantic Coast of Maryland. The court found that US Wind failed to satisfy the tests for ripeness and final agency action and therefore did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims.

Montana Federal Court Granted Fish and Wildlife Service Request for Voluntary Remand of Commercial Livestock Grazing Permits

The federal district court for the District of Montana granted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS’s) motion for voluntary remand without vacatur of Commercial Special Use Permits authorizing commercial livestock grazing in the Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Montana. The plaintiffs who challenged the permits opposed remand. Their arguments included that the scope of remand was too narrow because the FWS did not propose to address key issues, including whether the FWS had ignored climate change. WildEarth Guardians v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, No. 9:24-cv-00066 (D. Mont. Dec. 15, 2025)

Massachusetts Federal Court Enjoined FEMA’s Termination of Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program

The federal district court for the District of Massachusetts held that the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program was unlawful. The court called the BRIC program “the largest pre-disaster mitigation program offered through FEMA.” As a threshold matter, the court rejected the federal government’s arguments that the case was not ripe, that the plaintiff states lacked standing, and that sovereign immunity barred the claims. The court also rejected the federal government’s contentions that there had been no final agency action, that states’ claims addressed action committed to agency discretion by law, and that the states sought to compel agency action not required by law. On the merits, the court first found that the “summary termination (without the implementation of any replacement program through which states and local governments can obtain mitigation funding) undoubtedly qualifies as a substantial reduction of FEMA’s mitigation responsibilities” within the scope of the statutory provision prohibiting FEMA from substantially or significantly reducing its authorities, responsibilities, or functions. Second, the court found that the termination violated the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2024 by redirecting pre-disaster funds to post-disaster relief grant programs. Third, the court found that FEMA had not provided the states with the minimum level of funding mandated by statute. The court declined to address the states’ argument regarding the legality of the appointments of two FEMA officials. The court further found that the states met their burden of showing irreparable harm and established that the balance of hardships and public interest tilted in their favor. The court therefore granted the states’ request for a permanent injunction enjoining cancellation of the BRIC program “as it is currently constituted by an act of Congress.” The court wrote: “In sum, this is not a case about judicial encroachment on the discretionary authority of the Executive Branch. This is a case about unlawful Executive encroachment on the prerogative of Congress to appropriate funds for a specific and compelling purpose, and no more than that.” Washington v. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1:25-cv-12006 (D. Mass. Dec. 11, 2025)

Rhode Island Federal Court Transferred States’ Challenge to Revolution Wind Stop-Work Order to D.C. Court

The federal district court for the District of Rhode Island granted a motion by federal defendants to transfer Rhode Island and Connecticut’s lawsuit challenging a federal stop-work order for the Revolution Wind offshore wind project to federal court in the District of Columbia, where a lawsuit brought by the project’s developer was pending in which the court had already issued a preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of the stop-work order. The Rhode Island federal court cited the similarities in the claims and requested relief in the two cases and the potential for inconsistent judgments. In the pending case in the District of Columbia, the project’s developer on January 1, 2026 filed a motion for leave to supplement its complaint to challenge the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s December 22, 2025 order suspending work on the project. The court granted the motion on January 2 and set an expedited schedule for briefing of the developer’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Rhode Island v. U.S. Department of the Interior, No. 1:25-cv-00439 (D.R.I. Dec. 11, 2025), No. 1:25-cv-04328 (D.D.C.); Revolution Wind, LLC v. Burgum, No. 1:25-cv-02999 (D.D.C. Jan. 1, 2026)

Montana Federal Court Vacated Approval for Project in Custer Gallatin National Forest but Upheld Climate Change Analysis

Rejecting in part a magistrate judge’s recommendation, the federal district court for the District of Montana found that the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service failed to comply with NEPA, the National Forest Management Act, and the Endangered Species Act in the review of a forest treatment project in the Custer Gallatin National Forest. The court vacated and remanded the environmental assessment and decision notice issued by the Forest Service. The court rejected, however, the plaintiffs’ argument under NEPA that the Forest Service failed to adequately address the cumulative impacts of climate change. The court noted that the Forest Service concluded—based on a project-level carbon analysis that was “tiered” to a 2022 programmatic analysis of carbon sequestration for the Custer Gallatin National Forest Land Management Plan—that the project would result in a short-term release of carbon but would over the long term increase carbon storage and reduce emissions. The court found that the Forest Service’s consideration of cumulative climate change effects was adequate “[g]iven the nature of this Project and the recency and scope of the tiered analysis.” Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Service, No. 9:23-cv-00110 (D. Mont. Dec. 11, 2025)

California Federal Court Allowed Plaintiff to File Amended Complaint to Clarify Greenwashing Case Against Sugar Producer

The federal district court for the Northern District of California granted the sugar producer Florida Crystals Corporation’s motion to dismiss a greenwashing class action but granted the plaintiff leave to file a second amended complaint to clarify her theory of liability. The court found that the first amended complaint’s allegations of deception were related to the defendants’ representations regarding the environmental benefits of particular products but that in opposing the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff focused on her reliance on representations regarding company-wide practices related to the environment, including climate change. The court therefore dismissed the first amended complaint on the grounds that it did not “adequately articulate” the plaintiff’s theory as to how the defendant’s representations were deceptive. The court did not address the defendant’s other grounds for dismissal and denied the motion to dismiss on those grounds without prejudice to the company’s ability to raise them after the plaintiff filed a new complaint. Merrell v. Florida Crystals Corp., No. 5:25-cv-02264 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 8, 2025)

Massachusetts Federal Court Ordered Disclosure of Federal Advisory Committee Act Records for Climate Working Group

In a lawsuit challenging the legality of the establishment of the “Climate Working Group” that produced a report on which EPA relied for the proposed rescission of the 2009 Clean Air Act endangerment finding for greenhouse gases, the federal district court for the District of Massachusetts ordered federal defendants to produce Federal Advisory Committee Act records by December 22, 2025. The court also ordered the parties to file briefs on the deliberative process privilege by December 15 and to propose a schedule to address remaining issues. The parties’ proposed schedule included briefing in January 2026 on remedies with regard to the Climate Working Group and the U.S. Department of Energy. The parties also requested that the court schedule a hearing on the pending motion to dismiss claims against EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Wright, No. 1:25-cv-12249 (D. Mass. Dec. 8, 2025)

Massachusetts Federal Court Ruled that Federal Pause on Wind Energy Authorizations Was Unlawful

The federal district court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that federal agencies’ orders pausing all wind energy authorizations (the “Wind Order”) were arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The agencies issued the Wind Order to implement a memorandum issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025. As threshold matters, the court found that both the state plaintiffs and plaintiff-intervenor Alliance for Clean Energy New York (ACE NY) had constitutional standing and that their claims were within the zone of interests of the statutory provisions at issue, which set forth timelines and standards for wind energy permitting. On the merits, the court found that the Wind Order was a final agency action subject to judicial review and that it was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act imposing a nondiscretionary duty on agencies to pass upon matters presented to them and to complete any mandated adjudicatory hearings within a reasonable time. The court rejected the agencies’ argument that arbitrary-and-capricious review did not apply because they merely took action as directed by the President. The court vacated the Wind Order in its entirety. New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-11221 (D. Mass. Dec. 8, 2025)

Virginia Federal Court Dismissed Challenge to NEPA Categorical Exclusions Adopted by Forest Service in 2020

The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over a challenge to a 2020 U.S. Forest Service rule that established three categorical exclusions exempting certain commercial logging projects, road construction, and private uses of national forest lands from NEPA review. The court concluded that the plaintiffs’ claims were not ripe for review and that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not tie the categorical exclusions to any site-specific application. The plaintiffs’ allegations included assertions that the exclusions would allow significant climate impacts to occur without analysis. Clinch Coalition v. U.S. Forest Service, No. 2:21-cv-00003 (W.D. Va. Dec. 3, 2025)

New York Court Rejected Industry Challenge to State Hydrofluorocarbon Regulations

A New York trial court denied a petition challenging amendments to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (DEC’s) regulations addressing hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The court described the amended regulations as including prohibitions on new HFC products and systems, prohibitions on bulk substances and containers, and a variance process. First, the court rejected industry petitioners’ claims that portions of regulations were arbitrary and capricious. Regarding provisions addressing bulk substances, the court found that the record demonstrated that the regulations aligned with federal law and implemented the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) scoping plan, and that DEC acknowledged the requirements were technology forcing and provided a variance process to address feasibility concerns. Regarding prohibitions on regulated substances with 20-year global warming potential (GWP20) greater than 10 or greater than 20 (depending on the application), the court found that the regulations were consistent with the scoping plan and that the record showed DEC considered comments, that the regulation did not require specific alternatives, and that a variance provision was included. Regarding the DEC’s decision to include regulations of “other residential HVAC” that the petitioners alleged did not align with federal and other states’ requirements, the court found that the record explained why EPA and other states might not have yet regulated the technologies and that the regulations were intended to address emerging technologies. Second, the court rejected contentions that DEC failed to comply with the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA). The court found that DEC substantially complied with SAPA provisions requiring best estimates of the costs of the regulation, consideration of the regulation’s impact on small business, and identification of differences between federal standards and the adopted regulations. Third, the court ruled that DEC acted within its statutory jurisdiction under the CLCPA and other state environmental statutes. Heating Air-Conditioning Refrigeration Distributors International v. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, No. 903624-25 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Dec. 22, 2025)

Iowa Court Granted Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Developer’s Request to Remand Permit Challenge to Iowa Utilities Commission

In a proceeding challenging the Iowa Utilities Commission’s (IUC’s) approval of a hazardous liquid pipeline permit for Summit Carbon Solutions, LLC’s (Summit’s) pipeline to transport liquefied carbon dioxide through 29 Iowa counties, the Iowa District Court granted Summit’s motion to remand for further proceedings before the IUC. The court found that Summit had “good reason” for failing to present during the IUC proceedings regarding a ban enacted by South Dakota in 2025 (after IUC’s approval of the permit) on use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines enacted by South Dakota. The court also found that the materiality requirement for remand was satisfied due to the route modifications the South Dakota ban would require and their potential influence on IUC’s determination of whether to vest Summit with additional rights of eminent domain.

Massachusetts Land Court Said Abutting Landowner’s Allegations Regarding Flooding Concerns Established Standing for Challenge to Approval for Single-Family Home Conversion

The Massachusetts Land Court denied a motion to dismiss a lawsuit challenging a special permit and variances for conversion of a single-family home in Winthrop to a two-family home. The court found that the abutting property owner’s allegations regarding potential harms from water deflection and flooding were sufficient to demonstrate standing under the Massachusetts Affordable Homes Act, which imposes burdens to affirmatively allege and demonstrate standing on parties challenging certain land use decisions. The plaintiff contended, among other things, that the zoning actions could cause property damage and threaten his personal safety by allowing construction of a two-family home without proper drainage and by directing flooding to the plaintiff’s property “without taking into consideration projections for future sea level rise and useful life of the structure.” Honan v. Baird, No. 23 MISC 000337 (Mass. Land Ct. Dec. 8, 2025)

State Trial Court Held that North Dakota Carbon Storage Law Was Unconstitutional

A North Dakota District Court held that a North Dakota law regarding underground carbon dioxide storage provided for a physical taking of property constituting a taking without providing for just compensation. The law provided that if a carbon storage operator did not obtain consent of all persons who own a storage reservoir’s pore space, the North Dakota Industrial Commission could require that the nonconsenting owners be included in a storage facility, with title to the storage facility and the stored carbon transferring to the State upon completion of a carbon capture project. Although the North Dakota law provided for “compensation” to the nonconsenting owners, the court found that it “clearly does not provide ‘just compensation’ as defined in North Dakota.” Northwest Landowners Association v. State, No. 05-2023-CV-00065 (N.D. Dist. Ct. Dec. 2, 2025)

U.S. NEW CASES AND OTHER FILINGS

Lawsuit Challenged FERC Reauthorization of Rio Grande LNG Export Terminal

Two environmental organizations and the City of Port Isabel filed a lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals challenging Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorizations of the Rio Grande liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal on the Brownsville Ship Channel in Cameron County, Texas, and the associated Rio Bravo pipeline project. The petitioners’ primary challenge was to FERC’s order reaffirming its authorization of the projects under the Natural Gas Act on remand from the D.C. Circuit’s 2024 decision in City of Port Isabel v. FERC, in which the court found that FERC failed to adequately analyze climate change and environmental justice impacts. The petition for review challenging the order on remand did not set forth specific arguments, but before FERC the petitioners had argued, among other things, that FERC should have analyzed a potential carbon capture and sequestration system as a connected action and that the projects were contrary to the public interest because they would not provide public benefits that could outweigh health impacts and other harms.

United States Challenged California Cities’ Natural Gas Bans

The United States filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Northern District of California challenging two California cities’ ordinances establishing building electrification requirements and banning natural gas infrastructure in certain new construction. The complaint alleged that the federal Energy Policy and Conservation Act preempted the ordinances adopted by the City of Morgan Hill and City of Petaluma. The U.S. asked the court to declare that the ordinances are preempted and to permanently enjoin enforcement of the laws. United States v. City of Morgan Hill, No. 5:26-cv-00056 (N.D.

Developers of Virginia and New York Offshore Wind Projects Challenged Federal Stop-Work Order

The public utility developing the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial Project and a subsidiary that leases the offshore commercial lease area for the project filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia challenging the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM’s) December 22, 2025 order directing the utility to immediately stop work on the project. The plaintiffs alleged that the BOEM order—which cited “national security threats” as the rationale for the stop-work order—was inconsistent with BOEM’s regulations, with lease terms, with construction and operations plan approvals, and with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). The plaintiffs also asserted that the order was arbitrary and capricious, contending that the national security rationale was “not plausible.” They also asserted that the order violated OCSLA, that the order deprived the utility of a property interest without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, and that the order violated the Constitution’s Property Clause. The plaintiffs alleged that the order was causing immediate and irreparable harm, including because the wind project was critical to Virginia’s legislative clean energy directive and the utility’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions. Virginia Electric & Power Co. v. U.S. Department of the Interior, No. 2:25-cv-00830 (E.D. Va., filed Dec. 23, 2025)

In a lawsuit filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the developers of Empire Wind Project offshore Brooklyn filed a lawsuit challenging BOEM’s December 22, 2025 suspension of the Empire Wind Project, which is located on the outer continental shelf approximately 14 miles offshore New York. The developers allege the suspension order is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion; that BOEM acted without observing procedure required by law; and that the order contrary to OCSLA. In addition, the developers asserted that the suspension order violated their right under the Fifth Amendment to due process. Empire Leaseholder LLC v. Burgum, No. 1:26-cv-00004 (D.D.C., filed Jan. 2, 2026)

Sunrise Wind LLC, the developer of an offshore wind project approximately 30 miles east of Long Island, also filed a lawsuit challenging BOEM’s suspension order. The complaint alleged that the order posed an immediate threat to energy, environmental, and public health benefits the project would generate, including achievement of the New York Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act’s renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements. Sunrise Wind LLC v. Burgum, No. 1:26-cv-00028 (D.D.C., filed Jan. 6, 2026)

Environmental Groups Challenged TVA Approval of Illinois Coal Mine Expansion

Sierra Club and Prairie Rivers Network filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Illinois challenging the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA’s) approval of the expansion of a coal mine in southern Illinois. The complaint alleged that TVA’s decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it was predicated on an erroneous interpretation of the provisions of a 2002 lease that granted rights to mine TVA coal reserves and also because the decision “contradicts TVA’s own expressed goals related to carbon emissions and statutory obligations related to environmental protection.” The plaintiffs also asserted that TVA violated the National Environmental Policy Act both because the environmental review was grounded in the allegedly erroneous construction of the lease as requiring TVA to grant the mining authorization and because the environmental review did not consider reasonably foreseeable impacts of the mining company’s continued violations of environmental law. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that TVA did not adequately consider the impacts of potential divestment of TVA mineral rights in southern Illinois, including whether sale of the coal reserves to be burned was consistent with TVA’s decarbonization and environmental protection goals. Sierra Club v. Moul, No. 3:25-cv-02202 (S.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2025)

Grant Recipient Challenged Termination of Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant Program

An organization that received an approximately $20 million grant under the Inflation Reduction Act’s Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant program filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Northern District of Georgia challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s purported termination of the entire grant program and refusal to disburse awarded grants. The grant awarded to the plaintiff was for acquisition of land for “a green campus for the community of Norcross”; for offering emergency and clean energy job training; and for services such as air, water, and energy assessment and remediation. The complaint asserted that the federal defendants’ actions were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that the defendants’ actions exceeded their authority, were contrary to law, and failed to observe required procedures in violation of the APA. The plaintiffs also asserted separate claims that the defendants’ actions were ultra vires and violated separation of powers. The plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including an injunction preventing the defendants from terminating the grant program and from impeding or terminating the plaintiff’s access to awarded funds. Lucky Shoals Community Association, Inc. v. EPA, No. 1:25-cv-07221 (N.D. Ga., filed Dec. 17, 2025)

Lawsuits Challenged Trump Administration Suspension of Funding for Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program

Two lawsuits filed in the federal district court for the Western District of Washington challenged U.S. Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration actions freezing funds appropriated for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Program established by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). The IIJA appropriated $2.5 billion to “support changes in the transportation sector that help achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improve the mobility of passenger and commercial vehicles that employ electric, hydrogen fuel cell, propane, and natural gas fueling technologies across the United States.” One lawsuit was filed by California, 14 other states, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and the District of Columbia (the states). The other was filed by two environmental organizations (Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council) and Climate Solutions, which the complaint described as “a Northwest-based clean energy economy nonprofit.” The states’ lawsuit also challenged DOT and FHWA actions suspending the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator Program, which also was funded under the IIJA. The states alleged that the defendants “never publicly explained” their actions suspending the programs, which the complaint said had been held in limbo since early in the Trump administration. The states alleged that the failure to obligate funding under the programs constituted an impoundment that violated the separation of powers by contravening constitutional provisions, including the Spending Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Presentment Clause. The states also asserted claims under the Administrative Procedure Act. The states’ complaint included allegations regarding the importance of the funding for the plaintiffs’ climate goals. The nonprofits’ complaint asserted violations of the APA, violation of separation of powers, violation of the Take Care Clause, and ultra vires action. California v. U.S. Department of Transportation, No. 2:25-cv-02574 (W.D. Wash., filed Dec. 16, 2025); Climate Solutions v. U.S. Department of Transportation, No. 2:25-cv-02578 (W.D. Wash., filed Dec. 16, 2025)

Lawsuit Challenged Reissued Coastal Use Permit for LNG Terminal

Three environmental organizations challenged the reissuance by the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy’s Office of Coastal Management (OCM) of a Coastal Use Permit for construction and operation of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal on the Calcasieu Ship Channel in Cameron Parish. A Louisiana trial court vacated the previously issued Coastal Use Permit in October 2025, finding that OCM violated its regulations, the Louisiana Constitution, and the coastal zone management plan by failing to adequately consider environmental and climate change impacts. In November 2025, OCM published a revised basis of decision and reissued the permit. The organizations alleged that OCM failed to provide notice and opportunity for public comment before issuing the permit. The organizations also alleged that the revised basis of decision did not correct the errors identified by the court, including by failing to consider the project’s cumulative climate change impacts.

HERE ARE RECENT GLOBAL CLIMATE LITIGATION ADDITIONS TO THE DATABASE

HIGHLIGHTED CASE

Europe: European Court of Human Rights reaffirms the limited instances in which violation of rights under Article 2 and 8 can be found

Three Austrian nationals and the environmental organization Global 2000 filed a case in the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in 2023 after having exhausted the available domestic remedies. The applicants alleged that the Federal Minister for Digital and Economic Affairs’ refusal to ban the sale of solid fossil fuels from 2025 and of fossil fuels used in aviation from 2040, or to take other equally effective measures to mitigate the effects of climate change, constitutes a violation of their rights under Article 2 (right to life) and Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life). One of the applicants, a farmer, additionally alleged a breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (protection of property) as her livelihood was in danger due to the droughts caused by climate change.

On December 11, 2025, the ECtHR published its unanimous decision.

With respect to the allegation under Article 2 of European Convention on Human Rights, the Court found that the right is violated only when there exists a serious, real, and sufficiently identifiable threat to an individual’s life. The Court considered it doubtful that Article 2 was engaged on the facts of this case.

With respect to the allegation under Article 8, the court first found that the individual applicants do not have proper standing. Applying the criteria from KlimaSeniorinnen, the Court found that the individual applicants have not provided concrete information outlining how they were personally affected, nor have they submitted evidence substantiating the health conditions, to satisfy the particularly stringent victim-status requirements. For the organizational applicant, the Court reached a mixed conclusion on standing after applying the representative-standing criteria from KlimaSeniorinnen. Although it was found that the organization was validly constituted, entitled to act within Austrian jurisdiction, and mandated to work on environmental protection, the Court questioned whether its statutory purposes included the defense of human rights in the environmental context and whether it represented individuals affected within Austria. The Court left the issue open, however, because the application was held inadmissible on other grounds.

The Court reiterated that Article 8 does not guarantee a right to the specific measure sought by the applicants, namely a prohibition on the sale of fossil fuels. It stressed that, in light of the subsidiarity principle and the broad margin of appreciation afforded to States in determining how to pursue their climate objectives, Article 8 cannot be interpreted as obliging a State to adopt any particular mitigation measure under a sectoral legal framework of an applicant’s choosing (para. 33). The Court also held that the applicants had failed to adequately demonstrate how Austria had neglected to establish an appropriate regulatory regime. Although the government acknowledged that existing policies were insufficient to ensure compliance with its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets, the Court considered this insufficient for the applicants to substantiate their claims. It also noted that the applicants had not pursued available domestic remedies beyond requesting action from the Federal Ministry, nor had they argued that effective remedies were lacking.

Finally, with respect to the additional allegation under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, concerning the right to property, the Court observed that it had not previously applied the article in the climate context and that existing case law did not support its applicability (para. 37). It added that, even assuming the provision could apply to climate-related impacts, the third applicant would not meet the victim-status requirement. Fliegenschnee et al. v. Austria (European Court of Human Rights)

DECIDED CASES

New Zealand: Court upholds local council’s decision to grant a mining company access to a commercial forestry land for assessing viability of coal mine extension

In April 2021, Southland District Council (Council) granted access to Ohai Commercial Forest, a commercial forestry land owned by the Council, to Bathurst Resources Limited (BRL) for the purpose to assess the viability of extending an existing coal mine in Southland. Forest & Bird challenged the Access Decision on eight grounds, arguing, in essence, that the Council erred in assessing the significance of the Access Decision under the Local Government Act 2002 and in deciding without public engagement or consultation.

New Brighton Collieries Ltd (NBC), BRL’s wholly owned subsidiary that would have operated the coal mine, applied to strike out the decision in the High Court, including on the ground that the access permit did not permit any commercial mining of coal. Any future mining required a separate mining permit by the Crown, as well as a publicly notified resource consent process under the Resource Management Act 1991. Associate Judge Johnson of the High Court, on November 4, 2021, declined to rule on the strike-out application and directed that it be heard with the substantive judicial review application.

On March 6, 2023, Justice Osborne of the High Court declined the substantive application, also declining to accept Forest & Bird’s categorisation of the Access Decision as a “climate change” decision. The court also explained that there was a meaningful distinction to be drawn between the Council making a decision under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 as a private landowner, compared to it making a decision as a regulatory body under the Resource Management Act 1991. The Court also found that Forest & Bird’s logic fell short because the Council’s granting access was not identical to approving coal mining expansion.

Forest & Bird appealed, maintaining that the Council’s decision was unreasonable and that, in light of the climate change context, the courts should apply a “heightened scrutiny” standard of review. A bench consisting of Justices Katz, Mallon, and Ellis from the Court of Appeal, on July 16, 2025, however, dismissed the appeal. The decision was largely based on the fact that by the time of the hearing in the High Court, NBC had completed its exploration activities and made no resource consent application. There had also been legislative amendments repealing sections 104E and 70A of the Resource Management Act 1991, which now allows local authorities to consider greenhouse gas emissions in exercising their resource consenting and rule-making functions. The Court of Appeal held that the issue was moot at the time of the first hearing and so, given these material changes, any grant of declaratory relief would be empty. The Court of Appeal also held, as the High Court did, that while granting access may have opened the first “door,” doing so does not mean that the subsequent “doors” will also be open, or even tried. Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of New Zealand Inc v Southland District Council (New Zealand, Court of Appeal)

New Zealand: Immigration and Protection Tribunal grants visa based on the economical and psychological hardship stemming from climate change

From 2023 to 2025, multiple citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying independent island nation in the South Pacific, appealed against their deportation liability when their presence in New Zealand became unlawful. Although the contents of the humanitarian appeal slightly varied, all appellants argued that the challenging circumstances they would face on returning to Tuvalu is inhumane.

Except in a single instance, the Tribunal granted temporary or resident visas, noting the intense effects of climate change in Tuvalu. The Tribunal acknowledged the intensified water insecurity and reduced food availability stemming from climate change, finding that the effects of climate change can adversely affect the enjoyment of basic human rights. The Tribunal, in multiple appeals, also accepted arguments on psychological and/or mental health impacts, based on the concerns about children due to climate disasters.

However, in Carlton v Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, an appeal by a 29- and 25-years-old couple, the Tribunal, while acknowledging climate change “as raising concerns that are humanitarian in nature,” did not find the circumstances to be “well outside the normal run of circumstances.”

New Zealand: Immigration and Protection Tribunal considers climate change in deciding refugee status

Refugee status was granted to a citizen of Somalia after the appellant appealed a refugee and protection officer’s decision to decline to do so. The Tribunal found that the appellant was likely to face a tapestry of harms that cumulatively reached the threshold of serious harm.

Part of the Tribunal’s consideration centered on climate insecurity, with Somalia ranking seventh among the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change. The Tribunal, relying on a report from the International Crisis Group, noted that while droughts and climate change did not create Al-Shabaab or cause Somalia’s instability, they have shaped the environment in which the conflict is taking place and influenced the militant group’s tactics and evolution. The Tribunal found, based on the report, that climate change and conflict are increasingly intertwined, and Al-Shabaab is exploiting climate threats and emergencies.

New Zealand: Court of Appeal acknowledges that climate change may cause arbitrary deprivation of life

A citizen of Kiribati claimed that deportation would expose him to persecution or cruel treatment, partly due to the negative impacts of climate change on his safety and well-being. One issue the courts faced was whether, for the purposes of the Refugee Convention, the Convention against Torture, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a yardstick of time is necessary to assess the real chance of harm from climate change. On appeal, the Court of Appeal accepted that the issue could give rise to a seriously arguable question of law of general or public importance.

Simultaneously, however, the Court of Appeal upheld the Tribunal’s conclusion that even if a specific timeframe or yardstick was implemented to assess the real chance of an arbitrary deprivation of life as a result of climate change, such a deprivation was unlikely to be found. It agreed with the Tribunal’s acceptance that although climate-change hazards could give rise to a Convention or ICCPR ground, on the evidence, this was not established.

New Zealand: Gas company voluntarily withdraws online advertisement after complaints on greenwashing were filed

Gas company Clarus withdrew its online advertisement after two separate complaints were filed to the Advertising Standards Authority for greenwashing.

The advertisement at issue showed a photo of a family in a kitchen making pancakes with the text “Renewable gas now flowing – Enjoy all the same benefits of gas with renewable gas. Learn more.” Both complaints filed against this advertisement argued that the claim of “renewable gas” was misleading and a form of greenwashing, violating the Advertising Standards Code Principle 2, Rule 2(b) (Truthful Presentation) and Rule 2(h) (Environmental Claims).

The first complaint argued that the claim was deceptive because Clarus’s gas was not fully renewable, but rather blended with fossil fuels. It argued that this fact was not clearly disclosed to the public and that the public might assume they were purchasing a completely green product. The complainant also pointed out that current gas appliances are not designed to run on entirely renewable gas. The second complaint went further, challenging the environmental basis of the claim by stating that methane gas, even if considered renewable, is demonstrably worse for the climate than coal when whole-of-life emissions are considered. It noted that the very small amounts of leakage (<0.2%) make it environmentally detrimental.

The Chair of the Complaints Board ultimately ruled the matter as Settled. This decision was based on the fact that Clarus, the Advertiser, was co-operative with the self-regulatory process and removed the advertisement after receiving the complaints. The Chair concluded that no further purpose would be served by placing the matter before the Complaints Board. Clarus [2025] NZASA 23 (New Zealand, Advertising Standards Authority Complaints Board)

Brazil: Court found no fault in climate-related protest based on freedom of expression and the need to discourage environmentally unsustainable practices

JBS S.A. (JBS), a Brazilian multinational meat and meat product producer, filed a suit against Greenpeace Brazil (Greenpeace) and World Animal Protection Brazil (WAP) for trademark infringement and trespassing at its headquarters. This took place after the two organizations each held protests against the company, including a demonstration by Greenpeace at JBS headquarters.

On August 26, 2025, a judgment of Judge Valdir da Silva Queiroz Junior was issued. The judgment partially upheld JBS’s claim and confirmed its preliminary order that the defendants refrain from carrying out further invasions of the plaintiff’s property. The judgment deemed the other allegations unfounded and affirmed the right to freedom of expression. The reasoning for the decision highlighted the following:

(i) There exists a duty to preserve and protect the environment for present and future generations, to which follows a need to discourage unsustainable practices.

(ii) No offense to the plaintiff’s honor or image was established, as the defendants acted within the limits of freedom of expression, basing themselves on facts and public news. Publicizing the plaintiff's activities in the agricultural sector—emphasizing the emission of polluting gases and deforestation resulting from the activities—was also supported by Article 225 of the Constitution, which underscores the commitment made between companies, public authorities, and civil society to adopt measures to reduce pollution and deforestation.

(iii) The protests were carried out individually and peacefully.

(iv) The right to exclusive use of the trademark is not absolute and must be subject to the exceptions provided for in the Industrial Property Law and to the balance with the constitutional values of freedom of expression.

New Zealand: High Court upholds government’s decision to ban issuing permits for mining of petroleum in certain regions

Greymouth Gas Turangi (Greymouth), a company active in the exploration of hydrocarbons and the mining of such resources, sought a judicial review against an Oil and Gas Ban made by the prime minister of energy and resources. The Prime Minister, on April 12, 2018, had announced that there would be a ban on issuing any permits for exploration or mining of petroleum products in all offshore regions of New Zealand (Oil and Gas Ban), with the Crown Minerals Act 1991 to be amended as such. The Prime Minister also announced the terms for the invitation to bid for the 2018 block offer, which excluded potential offshore areas in Taranaki, unlike the prior years’ offers. Greymouth also sought to review a decision by the delegate of the Minister of Energy and Resources, which, before the Oil and Gas Ban was announced, declined an uncontested bid for a petroleum exploration permit (PEP) off the Taranaki coast.

In High Court, the decision was quashed by consent, based on the decision-maker’s breach of procedural fairness and commission of errors of fact and law in evaluating Greymouth’s compliance history.

Turning to the challenge to the Oil and Gas Ban, at issue was whether the Executive took the right steps in announcing the new ban. Greymouth argued that the steps between the announcement of the Ban and when the Ban came into force were inconsistent with the Crown Minerals Act 1991. Greymouth further argued that the rationale for the policy change was to advance climate change concerns, which is extraneous to the Act’s purposes, and that a division of Executive responsibilities explicitly required such concerns to be managed elsewhere.

The Court declined these arguments. The court first found that the Prime Minister’s announcements have not relied on the powers in the Crown Minerals Act. Instead, they foreshadowed administrative action that was to ensue later. On Greyhound’s second argument, the Court noted that while “[i]t is tolerably clear that the ban on offshore prospecting was motivated in large part to address climate change policies, quite discretely from the management of Crown minerals,” that “[t]he status of that policy aspiration was not a matter to which the government could be committed prospectively: subject to not governing by executive fiat, separation of policies on the management of Crown minerals from issues such as climate change policy was a matter that could be revisited and for which the government would answer, if at all, at the ballot box.” The court held that the alleged inconsistency between the actual purpose and the Act’s purpose cannot add anything to the case’s ground of challenge.

Brazil: Federal District Court partially grants requests urging federal agencies to further mitigate greenhouse gas emissions

On July 6, 2023, three NGOs filed a Public Civil Action (ACP) against Federal Union, the State of Rio Grande do Sul, and several federal and state agencies, including: the Federal Environment Agency (IBAMA), National Electric Power Agency (ANEEL), Eletrobras CGT Eletrosul (SE & UTE Cantiota III), Rio Grande do Sul environmental agency (FEPAM), and Companhia Riograndense de Mineração (CRM).

The plaintiffs alleged that (i) the federal and state government, by action or omission, failed to comply with the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the Paris Agreement, and the Rio Grande do Sul’s Policy on Climate Change (PGMC); (ii) the agencies have neglected climate policy when dealing with the licensing and renewal of licenses for these projects in the state; (ii) the Federal Government has encouraged coal-fired thermoelectric projects through energy auctions authorized by ANEEL; and (iv) CRM and CGT Eletrosul have been each operating a coal mine and thermoelectric Plant in disregard of environmental climate laws. Plaintiffs argued that it is up to the Judiciary, based on the principle of the prohibition of regression and duties of protection, to guarantee effective compliance with the rules in question and to prevent the climate scenario from worsening. They also argued that the entire situation of alleged unlawfulness gives rise to a claim for compensation for collective moral damages.

Based on their allegations, plaintiffs made several requests for relief, so that the defendants’ conduct is brought into line with the environmental climate standards. Alongside requests for preliminary injunctions, plaintiffs sought declaration by the governments of their faults, an implementation of a Just Energy Transition plan for the contested plants, compensation for climate damages, and payment of collective moral damages.

The request for injunctive relief was rejected by the judge, who ruled that the analysis of the claims would require a more in-depth hearing. The judge held that the plaintiffs’ claims were too broad and had high economic, political, and social impacts. In addition, however, the judge recognized that the effects of climate change are recognized by the international community, that the process of adaptation by countries is slower than desirable, and climate change could cause irreversible damage to the environment and future generations.

On August 22, 2025, a ruling partially granting the requests was made. Classifying the claim as a structural climate case, the decision carried out a conventionality control based on Advisory Opinion OC 32/2025 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR). It also used pronouncements from the Federal Justice Council (CJF) and Precedent 618 of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) to reverse the burden of proof. The decision highlighted scientific and legal bases for the decision, such as: reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice, studies from the World Meteorological Organization, and reports from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In evaluating these sources, it recognized that the IPCC considers coal to be the fossil fuel with the highest CO2 emissions. It analyzed the consequences of climate change in Rio Grande do Sul based on studies of the impacts of rainfall that hit the state.

Regarding the licensing of the Candiota III Mine and Thermal Power Plant, the court understood that, at the time of the licenses (2011 and 2016), “there was a prevailing understanding that Brazilian emission reduction targets had a voluntary character,” granting discretion to the licensing authority. Thus, it dismissed the initial illegality of the operations.

The Court, however, considered that currently, in a “third phase” of the climate legal regime, “substantial limitations are emerging and consolidating” that impose the assessment of climate impact in the licensing process. This understanding was based on the provisions of the PGMC (State Policy on Climate Change) and Decree 56.347/2022, foreign cases, and advisory opinions from international courts. Therefore, it ordered the immediate suspension of the licenses until these conditions are included, extending this to other similar projects in Rio Grande do Sul. The court also understood that IBAMA and FEPAM should take measures to deepen the climate impact analysis of other coal-fired projects in the state, recognizing that climate assessment during licensing is already mandatory for future coal-fired thermoelectric and coal-fired power plants. Regarding the Energy Transition Plan, the decision stated that “postponing the definition of the mitigation trajectory” for such a polluting sector “is unconstitutional and currently incompatible with advisory opinions,” requiring the State to develop it. Concerning social participation in licensing, it decided that, under Brazilian environmental law, IBAMA must ensure due access to information on thermoelectric licensing procedures and that Rio Grande do Sul should increase the participation of members of civil society and the scientific community in the Rio Grande do Sul Forum on Climate Change (FGMC).

Regarding requests for civil liability for damages, it considered that the occurrence of environmental damage had not been demonstrated. Concerning climate damage, it considered that emissions were formally authorized until the present decision. The court based its decision on the National Council of Justice’s (CNJ) Protocol for Judgment on Environmental Actions, which requires the illegality of GHG emissions for damages be granted by the judiciary. Therefore, it found that neither the claim for civil liability for climate damage nor the claim for collective moral damages was admissible. However, it stated that, based on the sentence, there is no permission for the continued emissions by the enterprises. Furthermore, it considered that the declaration of a “State of Climate Emergency” does not fall within the purview of the Judiciary.

Conclusively, the Court ordered IBAMA and FEPAM to (i) suspend the operating licenses of the Candiota III Plant and the Candiota Mine, respectively, for non-compliance with the guidelines of the PNMC, PGMC, and State Decree 56.347/2022; (ii) include climate conditions in the operating licenses of the plant and the mine, respectively, including scope 3 emissions; and (iii) to include in the Terms of Reference for licensing thermal power plants and coal mines in Rio Grande do Sul the assessment of the climate component, including scope 3 emissions. It also ordered the Union and Rio Grande do Sul to present, by January 31, 2026, a Just Energy Transition Plan for the state's mineral sector; it ordered Rio Grande do Sul to promote the adjustment of the composition of the members of the FGMC, increasing the participation of civil society and the scientific community. Hearings were scheduled to monitor the measures determined in the judgment and set fines in case of non-compliance.

The case is currently on appeal, with the stay of execution of the appeal granted upon the defendants’ request. The Federal Regional Court of the 4th Region suspended all orders for immediate or time-limited compliance with the judgment or the motions for clarification, as well as for compliance through inspection hearings and compliance with court orders and auxiliary judicial expertise.

United Kingdom: Court of Appeal sets precedent on how the Environmental Principles Policy Statement should be applied

Campaigning NGO Rights Community Action applied for judicial review of a Written Ministerial Statement (WMS) released in December 2023. The Statement advised that local planning authorities should not set energy-efficiency standards for new buildings that exceed those contained in current or forthcoming Building Regulations. The claimant argued that local authorities should be able to impose higher energy efficiency standards to reduce GHG emissions from buildings. The government, on the other hand, claimed that differing local standards create complexity and cost, undermine economies of scale, and could adversely affect housing supply.

The claimant challenged the lawfulness of the WMS on three grounds that (i) the Secretary of State failed to fulfill his duty to have due regard to the Environmental Principles Policy Statement (EPPS) under the Environment Act 2021 § 19(1); (ii) the WMS unlawfully purported to restrict the exercise by local authorities of statutory powers under the Planning and Energy Act 2008 § 1 and under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 § 19; and (iii) it misrepresented the legal position of decision-makers, particularly planning inspectors.

On July 2, 2024, the High Court rejected all grounds of challenge on which the claimants appealed.

On appeal, the core issue was whether the Secretary of State had complied with the environmental principles duty in section 19 of the Environment Act 2021 (s.19 EA 2021). The claimant argued that the Secretary of State had failed to have “due regard” to the Environmental Principles Policy Statement (EPPS) when the WMS was adopted in December 2023, and that a later assessment carried out in February 2024 could not retrospectively cure that failure. The claimant also separately argued that the WMS unlawfully restricted local authorities’ statutory powers to set higher local energy-efficiency standards under the Planning and Energy Act 2008.

In July 2025, the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal. On the first claim under s.19 EA 2021, while the Court agreed that there was a failure to have regard to the EPPS at the moment of WMS adoption, the Court held that this defect could subsequently be cured by a legally adequate assessment undertaken in February 2024. The Court emphasized that s.19 imposes a procedural duty, which requires that the policy-making process as a whole demonstrate due regard, not at a single, fixed point in time. This case was the first time that s.19 EA 2021 was considered in court. On the second claim challenging the lawfulness of the WMS itself, the Court held that the WMS does not override the statutory powers of local planning authorities under the Planning and Energy Act 2008. As such, local planning authorities remain entitled to adopt local plan policies that require higher energy efficiency standards, but only where such departures are supported by local circumstances and viability evidence.

Germany: Court of First Instance finds a breach of duty of care by not adapting land planning tools to increase measures to mitigate climate change

The Court of First Instance of Brussels, on October 29, 2025, held that the Brussels-Capital Region had failed its duty of care in the face of climate change by not adapting its land-use planning tools to increase the territory’s capacity to capture carbon or by not adapting the city to combat the risks of flooding and heat islands. The court ordered the Brussels-Capital Region to suspend the urbanization and sealing of undeveloped sites and land exceeding 0.5 hectares within its territory until its official Regional Land Use Plan (Plan Régional d’Affectation du Sol) is adopted, and in any case by December 31, 2026. The court found that the Region was at fault for continuing to authorize real estate projects on undeveloped sites larger than 50 acres based on outdated regulations adopted before climate issues were recognized.

This decision is subject to appeal but is provisionally enforceable during any subsequent legal proceedings. We Are Nature.Brussels and others v. Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium, Brussels Court of First Instance)

United Kingdom: Unincorporated association brings a judicial review against the grant to expand London Luton Airport

Luton and District Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise (“LADACAN”), an unincorporated association constituted to oppose the expansion of Luton Airport, brought a judicial review against the Secretary of State’s decision to grant development consent to the expansion of London Luton Airport. This decision was taken in spite of the recommendation of planning inspectors that permission should not be granted.

The following grounds of challenge were brought and will be considered in the High Court:

(i) There was an error in law in that greenhouse gas emissions from inbound flights were excluded from the environmental impact assessment (EIA);

(ii) There was a lack of consistency in approach between the Luton Airport decision and the process for approving Gatwick Airport’s expansion;

(iii) There was an error of law in that the likely significant impacts of non-carbon dioxide emissions were excluded from the environmental impact assessment;

(iv) There was an error of law in concluding that the government’s duty under the Climate Change Act 2008 to adopt policies and procedures to help reach net zero was a ‘pollution control regime’; and

(v) There was a failure to comply with duties under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which require that developments in an area of outstanding national beauty must seek to further the conservation and natural beauty of the area.

Germany: Constitutional challenge brought against the amended Federal Climate Protection Act

In 2024, two NGOs, several youth complainants, and over 50,000 supporters filed a new constitutional complaint challenging Germany’s amended Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz – KSG). Building on the Federal Constitutional Court’s landmark climate ruling of March 24, 2021 in Neubauer and the European Court of Human Rights’ April 2024 confirmation of robust legislative climate duties in Klimaseniorinnen, they argue that the 2024 KSG violates their fundamental rights.

The complaint targets the Second Act Amending the KSG, in force since July 17, 2024. The amendment replaces binding, sector-specific annual emissions caps and mandatory “immediate action” programs with a cross-sector, multi-year control system based on projections of cumulative emissions for 2021–2030 (and later 2031–2040). Corrective action is triggered only if those aggregate totals are projected to be exceeded. There is no meaningful steering for the period after 2030 and no mechanism at all after 2040.

The complainants allege that the new framework delays mitigation and structurally shifts reduction burdens onto future generations. They further argue that the KSG allows total emissions that exceed Germany’s remaining Paris-compatible CO₂ budget under Article 20a of the Basic Law (GG). The German Advisory Council on the Environment estimates that the 1.75°C-based budget of 3.9 Gt CO₂ would be exhausted by 2033 under current law, and that the 1.5°C budget is already spent. Even these insufficient targets are unlikely to be met, as recent emissions reductions stem mostly from economic slowdown rather than structural climate policy. The Council of Experts on Climate Issues projects continued shortfalls, including in meeting EU Effort Sharing Regulation obligations.

Based on the Federal Constitutional Court’s climate jurisprudence, the complaint alleges that Germany must adopt a Paris-compatible emissions pathway, initiate reductions early enough to avoid a future “emergency brake,” and distribute mitigation burdens fairly across generations. The complainants contend that the 2024 KSG violates the climate protection mandate in Article 20a GG, the intertemporal protection of liberty under Article 2(1) GG in conjunction with Article 20a, and state duties to protect life and health under Article 2(2) GG. They also invoke the European Court of Human Rights’ interpretation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires Paris-aligned targets, credible pathways, and effective enforcement—elements the new KSG allegedly fails to provide.

In August 2025, the Federal Constitutional Court invited the federal government, several ministries, and expert bodies to submit observations. The German Advisory Council on the Environment has already provided its opinion. A decision from the Federal Constitutional Court is expected in 2026. Greenpeace e.V. and Germanwatch e.V. v.

Germany: Constitutional complaint brought against a continued legislative failure to adopt effective climate measures in transport sector

In September 2024, two NGOs, joined by five low-income individuals dependent on private mobility—four in rural areas with poor transit access and one with a disability—filed a constitutional complaint against a continued legislative failure to adopt effective climate measures in Germany’s transport sector. Building on the Federal Constitutional Court’s landmark climate ruling of March 24, 2021 and the European Court of Human Rights’ April 2024 confirmation of robust legislative climate duties, the complainant argues that government inaction violates fundamental rights.

Complainants argue that further delays in legislation will force drastic future restrictions such as driving bans and prohibitive CO₂ prices, disproportionately harming those unable to shift to public transport or electric vehicles. The complaint highlights years of missed transport-sector targets and the minister’s failure to produce lawful “immediate action” programs, such as the 2024 amendment to the Climate Protection Act, which eliminated binding sector targets and sector-specific remedies, easing pressure on transport. The complaint also pointed to the projections by the Environment Agency and the Council of Experts, which show that any apparent progress relies on other sectors compensating for large transport deficits. By 2040, Germany is projected to overshoot its pathway, with millions of combustion cars still on the road and no feasible plan for climate-neutral operation. Germany is also likely to miss EU Effort Sharing targets, while the 2027 ETS 2 may cause steep CO₂ price spikes and major social impacts.

The complainants argue that inaction consumes the remaining Paris-compatible CO₂ budget and pre-determines severe future restrictions on freedom. Scenario analysis shows that delay until 2030 would require unrealistically rapid emissions cuts. They also allege intertemporal and social inequality, as burdens fall hardest on those least able to pay. Complainants claim that only immediate, concrete measures in transport (or, subsidiarily, across sectors) can protect their constitutional and human rights and that improving the legal framework alone is insufficient.

Estonia: NGO challenged amendments to shale oil extraction permits based on failure to assess indirect climate impact and impact to wildlife

MTÜ Loodusvõlu, the legally registered NGO of Fridays for Future Estonia, challenged an amendment to a permit which allowed companies to extract increased amounts of shale oil. The permit, originally issued in 2019, granted Enefit Industry AS and Osaühingu VKG Kaevandused permission to extract shale oil, a coal-like fossil fuel, at the Uus-Kiviõli sites until 2049. In October 2025, the Board amended the permits to increase the quantity of oil shale mined to a total of 15 million tonnes a year, or a 2.5-fold increase.

MTÜ Loodusvõlu claimed that in making the amendment, the Board had failed to assess the indirect climate impact of increased mining, caused by increased downstream greenhouse gas emissions from the processing of oil shale. Additionally, they claimed that the Board also inadequately assessed the impacts of increased mining on nearby wetlands and wildlife, including species and sites protected under the EU Bird Directive and Habitat Directive. The Tallinn Administrative Court accepted the case and designated the Environmental Board as the defendant.

France: Citizens sue the government for failing to address climate risks

In June 2025, 14 French citizens affected by climate-related events, supported by Greenpeace France, Notre Affaire à Tous, and Oxfam France, filed a lawsuit against the French State before the Council of State (Conseil d’État). The plaintiffs challenge the insufficiency of the third National Adaptation Plan to Climate Change (PNACC 3). Earlier, in April 2025, the plaintiffs had submitted a preliminary request (requête préalable) to the government, asking for more ambitious adaptation measures, but was left unanswered.

According to the plaintiffs, the plan lacks binding obligations, dedicated funding, and rigorous monitoring. It does not adequately address climate risks and overlooks social and territorial inequalities, particularly in overseas territories, disadvantaged neighborhoods, and among already vulnerable populations (low income, disability, etc.).

The plaintiffs request that the State revise PNACC 3 so it becomes a binding, well-funded, and closely monitored adaptation strategy. They demand concrete measures in key risk areas, including flood prevention and management, water access and quality, housing and infrastructure safety (including soil instability), heatwave protection, support for vulnerable populations, policies supporting overseas territories and marginalized populations, and agricultural and rural adaptation. They also seek structural reforms to ensure that adaptation is systemic and equitable.

The case draws on the constitutional duty to protect the environment (Charte de l’environnement), as well as international and European obligations, including climate law and human rights instruments. The suit asserts that the State has a general obligation to adapt to climate change and ensure protection for all citizens, including the most vulnerable.

Germany: Environmental NGO challenges the federal government’s climate protection program as failing statutory obligations

Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg, alleging that the government’s climate protection program lacked sufficiently concrete and effective measures to achieve the legally mandated emissions reduction targets. In May 2024, the Higher Administrative Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the program was insufficient to meet the binding climate targets established under the Climate Protection Act. The federal government appealed this decision to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.

On October 22, 2025, the Federal Administrative Court scheduled a hearing for January 29, 2026, to decide the federal government’s appeal in the final instance. DUH maintains that the federal government has still not presented a program capable of achieving the legally mandated climate targets for 2030 and 2040, arguing that the government must specifically identify which measures will reduce CO2 emissions and by what amount. The organization contends that vague declarations of intent and measures with unclear climate benefits are inadequate to fulfill statutory obligations. The federal government is currently negotiating a new climate protection program that must be adopted by March 2026 at the latest, and any judgment from the Federal Administrative Court would directly influence the formulation of this program.

Türkiye: Olive producers challenge the Council of State on the constitutionality and legality of a Mining Law amendment

In August 2025, 77 olive producers from the Milas and Yatağan districts of Muğla Province filed a joint lawsuit at the Turkish Council of State challenging the constitutionality and legality of Law No. 7554, which amended the Mining Law to permit the conversion of designated olive groves into open-pit coal mines for nearby thermal power plants.

Primary Question:

Is Provisional Article 45 of the Mining Law (Law No. 7554), which permits uprooting and relocation of olive groves for mining, unconstitutional under the Turkish Constitution?

Sub-questions:

1. Did the Ministry of Energy unlawfully implement the law through an improperly prepared regulation circumventing environmental protections?

2. Do the mapped and targeted olive groves enjoy constitutional protection as agricultural, environmental, or property assets?

3. Should execution of the contested regulation be suspended to prevent irreversible environmental damage pending judicial review?

The plaintiffs argue that:

• Provisional Article 45 of the Mining Law violates the Constitution, property rights, and environmental protections.

• The law targets specific parcels and operators (Yatağan TEP / YK Enerji), violating the constitutional principle of generality of law.

• The Ministry of Energy’s implementing regulation was unlawful.

The plaintiffs request:

• Referral to the Constitutional Court for constitutional review under Article 152 of the Constitution.

• Suspension of execution of the regulatory act. They request that the enforcement or implementation of the contested regulatory act be suspended until the Constitutional Court issues its decision, to prevent potential ongoing harm.

• Annulment: They request that, following the oral proceedings, the contested regulatory act be annulled.

Standing and Environmental Rights

The plaintiffs argue that as olive producers on the affected lands, they have standing because the administrative act directly threatens their environmental rights. They cite domestic and international sources, including:

• 1972 Stockholm Declaration (right to live in a dignified environment; duty to protect natural resources for present and future generations)

• Turkish Constitution Articles 17, 36, 56

• Environmental Law Article 30 (allowing citizens to challenge administrative acts threatening the environment)

• European Convention on Human Rights, Article 2 (linking the right to life to the right to a healthy environment)

Constitutional and Environmental Violations

The plaintiffs contend that the law authorizing the clearance of olive groves contravenes Article 56, which guarantees the right to a healthy and balanced environment. Olive trees provide economic value and critical ecological functions such as carbon sequestration, soil erosion prevention, and biodiversity habitat. Destroying these groves for coal mining would harm local communities’ rights to clean air, water, and soil and disrupt regional ecological balance.

Under Article 90 of the Constitution, ratified international treaties prevail over conflicting domestic legislation. The plaintiffs invoke:

• 1972 Stockholm Declaration

• 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and Agenda 21

• Convention on Biological Diversity

• 1979 Bern Convention

They also cite relevant jurisprudence:

• Constitutional Court: Recognizing procedural obligations to prevent environmental harm, ensure public participation, and balance competing interests (Cerattepe Decision, 2017/33865).

• European Court of Human Rights: Environmental decision-making must preemptively assess harm, provide access to information, enable participation, and allow judicial recourse (Taşkın and Others v. Turkey, 46117/99).

Although Turkey has not ratified the Aarhus Convention, plaintiffs argue that its principles—public access to environmental information, participation in decision-making, and access to justice—are widely recognized and persuasive in evaluating environmental and life-right claims.

The plaintiffs further assert that removing olive groves in Akbelen and Yatağan would irreversibly destroy traditional livelihoods, violating domestic constitutional guarantees and international environmental obligations.

Additional Constitutional Concerns

The law is also alleged to violate:

• Article 17 (Right to Life)

• Article 23 (Freedom of Settlement)

• Article 35 (Right to Property)

The EV advocacy wants EVs to seem like they are doing well, so they put a lot of emphasis on things they think support that argument. Fair enough. Volvo just did it as well. Let’s look closely at Volvo’s year-end delivery summary to see how the brand’s battery-electric vehicles fared and where they went up and down.

We added the little red arrows to the Volvo delivery chart. Otherwise, it’s a screenshot of what the brand just sent out to the media. Let’s break down the battery-electric vehicle deliveries and see how they went for Volvo this year, and we’ll also compare that to how Volvo reported its EV deliveries in its press release.

Europe - EV Deliveries Fall By 22% In 2025

In Europe, Volvo saw its battery-electric deliveries drop by double digits. In total, Volvo delivered about 30,000 fewer EVs in Europe compared to the prior year. This seems to be odd, given there is so much chatter about EVs succeeding in Europe. Maybe it’s just European brands that are doing well, but wait, isn't Volvo a European brand? Hmm.

China - EV Deliveries Fall By 46% In 2025

Volvo does comparatively little business in the Chinese market. Heck, Volvo shifted fewer than 150 EVs in the entire country in December. It sure seems like Volvo is losing ground in this very large market. BEV deliveries were down a whopping 46%. Well, it's probably Chinese-based companies that make stuff in China, selling all those Chinese-market EVs. Wait a minute. Isn't Volvo a Chinese-owned company making cars in China? Hmm.

Other Markets - EV Deliveries Up By 9% In 2025

“Other” is the world aside from the markets that Volvo calls China, Europe, and the U.S. Places like Turkey, which is normally not included in Europe, despite it having Europe’s most populous city. In “Other,” Volvo grew its EV deliveries a bit. It’s a small segment for Volvo, and they only added less than 3,000 BEVs in 2025 in Other.

U.S. Market - EV Deliveries Way Up By A Whopping 91%

In the U.S., Volvo had a great 2025 for EVs. BEV deliveries leapt by nearly double from 5,608 in 2024 to 10,708 in 2025. That is a huge bump, and BEVs even grew in Q4, following the cessation of EV tax credits in America. Bravo, Volvo.

How Volvo Spun Its 2025 Delivery Report To Pretend EVs Helped

Reading over Volvo’s own summary of its 2025 deliveries made us wonder if we were looking at the same data Volvo was. Here are some quotes offered by Volvo, and what actually happened.

Volvo’s Press Release Statement - “We are pleased to end the year on a positive note with growth across key regions thanks to increased sales of our fully electric and plug-in hybrid offerings,” said Erik Severinson, Chief Commercial Officer

Our Take - Volvo lost ground in every market, but the U.S. in 2025, and its battery-electric vehicle deliveries were down overall. Also, the company’s total vehicle deliveries were down overall. How is that somehow positive? Factually, the statement is untrue, and it’s hard for us to understand the “ending on a positive note” part. Volvo’s deliveries were down by 7% YOY, and its BEV deliveries were down by 13%.

Volvo’s Press Statement - “Sales of electrified models decreased by 48 per cent compared to the same period last year, mostly due to the adverse impact from the removal of subsidies on fully electric and plug-in hybrid cars.”

Our Take - Again, we don't see what Volvo is talking about. Volvo’s BEV deliveries went up 43% during December, after subsidies ended in America, not down. Also, Volvo’s EVs were down in China and down in Europe in 2025, which had nothing to do with American tax subsidies. It’s hard to understand how Volvo sees things.

Another Observation On Our Part - Volvo's Sales Are Mostly Mild Hybrid and ICE

Looking at the words Volvo uses, one might think the company is all about EVs. Mentally, Volvo may be thinking EVs, but its own delivery chart shows that the company still delivers more Mild Hybrid and ICE vehicles than EVs. Less than a quarter of Volvo's global deliveries are battery-electric vehicles.

Tell us your thoughts on Volvo having bucked the trend on BEVs by actually selling more EVs in America after subsidies ended and by seeing its BEV deliveries in China and Europe plunge.

For example, solar+gas means 70 GW of solar plus 47 GW of natural gas firming capacity.","Affordable electricity prices have become a top priority for consumers, policymakers, voters, and elected officials. Electricity prices for the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors averaged 6.7% higher in September 2025, compared to the same month one year ago. Residential prices alone increased by more than 7%, making it especially challenging for low- and middle-income families to make ends meet.

COMMENTARY

There are many reasons for these price increases, which include higher demand for electricity caused by data centers and artificial intelligence, expensive grid upgrades, volatile fuel costs, supply chain problems, and flawed electricity market rules. However, one way to avoid making electricity less affordable is to stop retiring coal power plants and replacing them with new renewable energy resources.

Energy Ventures Analysis (EVA) analyzed the annual cost of replacing coal power plants that are scheduled to retire with six renewable sources of electricity: solar only; solar firmed by battery energy storage systems (BESS) or natural gas; wind only; and wind firmed by BESS or natural gas. BESS and natural gas are firming resources that are necessary to ensure power is available when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining. Even though the cost of BESS has been declining, it is still relatively expensive and is able to produce power for only a few hours at a time. Natural gas can be very expensive when prices spike, and it is sometimes in short supply, especially during extreme weather.

Almost 42 GW of coal-fired generation (46 plants with 79 generating units) have retired or announced plans to retire during 2025 through 2028. (Some utilities have been postponing coal retirements because of electricity demand, and this trend is likely to continue.) EVA estimated the annual cost of continuing to operate these coal plants and compared that to the cost of building and operating the six renewable resources. The exhibits below summarize some of the results of the analysis.

The first chart below shows the annual cost in billions of dollars to continue operating the 79 retiring coal units and the annual cost of building and operating replacement resources. The analysis shows, for example, that replacing retiring coal plants with new solar panels would be 10 times more expensive than continuing to operate the coal plants ($6 billion in annual costs for the coal plants versus $60 billion in annual costs for solar panels to replace the coal plants).

The higher cost for renewables would ultimately result in higher electricity bills. However, the magnitude of the increases would vary by state and region.

The second chart below shows the amount of generating capacity in GW that is required to replace 42 GW of retiring coal capacity. Solar+gas and solar+BESS show the capacity of replacement solar (orange) plus the firming capacity (grey for natural gas and green for BESS). For example, solar+gas means 70 GW of solar plus 47 GW of natural gas firming capacity. Similarly, wind+gas and wind+BESS show the amount of replacement wind capacity (blue) plus firming capacity (grey for natural gas and green for BESS).

These results show the amounts of total replacement capacity, but the amounts alone do not take into account the loss of certain reliability attributes that coal provides and renewables do not.

We support an all-the-above strategy, and this analysis shows one of the reasons why coal has to be an essential part of this strategy. The EVA analysis is not intended to discredit renewables, but rather to show that adding more renewables to the grid is not always the best way to maintain affordable electricity prices.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/splash-rawhide-energy-station.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 23:13:03.589819

And even administration officials privately acknowledge that reducing electricity prices is a difficult and slow process.
One recent order directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to fast-track approvals for co-located generation at data centers.
Taken together, the push reflects Trump’s broader energy agenda: maximize domestic production, cut regulation and emphasize fossil fuels as a backbone of affordability and reliability.","Those steps include small bore items like rolling back appliance efficiency standards — a nod to Trump’s obsession with criticizing things like low-flow toilets — to major efforts aimed at boosting power generation, easing grid constraints and cutting regulatory compliance costs, according to notes on the briefing obtained by POLITICO.

That playbook reflects Trump’s long-standing belief that energy abundance will translate into lower prices as the administration confronts growing unrest about affordability. Indeed, the price of gasoline – currently sitting at $2.80 cents per gallon, according to AAA, is one of several retorts Trump and his administration deploys when faced with questions about Americans’ dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living.

“Every week you fill up your gas tank, you got more money in your pocket to buy your kids presents and pay your bills,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said during a December interview with FOX Business. “This is what happens when the American public elects a president who cares about their pocketbook, cares about American people and not special interests or the climate crazies.”

“Lowering energy prices for American families and businesses is a top priority for President Trump,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. “Americans know that energy is key to everything from powering manufacturing to heating homes to fueling commutes to work. The Trump Administration will continue to aggressively implement President Trump’s energy dominance agenda because cheaper energy can unleash unprecedented growth in every facet of our economy.”

Beyond appliances, steps the administration is taking include invoking emergency authorities to prevent the retirement of power plants deemed critical to grid reliability, and reversing Biden-era policies that administration officials say drove up costs without clear consumer benefits.

The White House has also moved to withdraw from a Biden administration memorandum of understanding related to the Snake River hydroelectric dams, a decision the administration estimates could save between $400 million and $800 million.

But some of those items may only have modest impacts on Americans’ wallets, or take years or longer to realize. And even administration officials privately acknowledge that reducing electricity prices is a difficult and slow process. Power bills – which have risen far faster than overall inflation – are shaped by a complex array of factors, from weather-driven consumption to the mix of fuel costs, aging infrastructure, utility investment cycles that can take years to unwind.

“The structural reasons driving up utility bills are related to the grid and extreme weather, and there’s an opportunity for the federal government, any administration, to really prioritize solutions that tackle those issues, and that would be necessary to bring down costs for consumers, given that those are the biggest drivers,” said Charles Hua, founder of Powerlines, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on lowering utility bills.

“I’m not seeing that. I don’t necessarily know if they’re having some of those discussions sort of behind the scenes, but I have not necessarily seen those actions yet,” he said.

Natural gas prices remain volatile, and the grid is facing new strains from rising demand and the uneven pace of new power plant construction.

While regulatory rollbacks can help lower long-term costs, they rarely produce immediate, visible savings on monthly bills, especially in states where electricity rates are set through lengthy public utility commission processes.

Still, the White House is betting that a visible, aggressive focus on energy will resonate with voters uneasy about costs, and that incremental savings, combined with a broader affordability message, will help Republicans’ chances heading into November.

Other elements of the strategy focus on shoring up the nation’s power supply to meet the demand expected to be generated from the rollout of a host of new AI data centers. The administration has funded restarts of mothballed fossil fuel plants, reduced permitting requirements for natural gas pipelines, and is allowing data centers and other large power consumers to rely more heavily on backup generators.

Officials are also seeking to beef up wildfire mitigation efforts to reduce costly outages, directing the Energy Dominance Finance office (the renamed Loan Programs Office) to prioritize financing for reliable generation and transmission, and pressuring regulators to speed up interconnections to the power grid for large energy users like data centers that are developing their own power sources. One recent order directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to fast-track approvals for co-located generation at data centers.

Yet the EPA insists that refineries buy at least 15 billion gallons of ethanol.","Gasoline prices are down, but the Environmental Protection Agency is about to push them up. President Trump is committed to affordable energy, but he is also under intense pressure from the corn-state ethanol lobby.

Ethanol in the U.S. is a $34 billion industry created by a hidden federal subsidy: the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, a mandate that oil refineries blend a certain total amount of ethanol into the U.S. gasoline supply. The EPA has set the level far higher than the market can absorb. That pushes refineries near bankruptcy and compels them to plead for exemptions, which anger the ethanol lobby.

The EPA proposes to make refiners take the hit for the exempted backlog of recent years in addition to the excessive mandates for 2026-27. That means higher prices, damage to car engines, and fewer good blue-collar jobs.

>>> What’s Really Fueling Californians’ Pain at the Pump

The RFS is a relic of the 1970s oil shocks. President Jimmy Carter warned of “catastrophe” and lavished subsidies on “gasohol.” Oil scarcity proved fleeting, but corn-state interests had discovered an entitlement, and in 2005 Congress discovered a new rationale: climate change. Congress set aggressive RFS targets, rising to 15 billion gallons of ethanol as U.S. gasoline consumption was projected to reach 150 billion gallons. The idea was to mandate as much as car engines could safely absorb: an ethanol content of about 10%. Thus E10 was born.

Contrary to forecasts, gasoline consumption never reached 150 billion gallons. This year’s projection is 139 billion, implying a maximum feasible ethanol volume of 13.9 billion gallons. Yet the EPA insists that refineries buy at least 15 billion gallons of ethanol. It also demands that refineries absorb the cost of excess amounts from prior years.

The EPA’s chief role under the RFS isn’t environmental protection but management of special-interest grievances. The agency’s latest proposal, to reassign retroactively years of exempted obligations, is legally dubious. The EPA openly admits its action will raise fuel costs—the only one of several statutory factors that it analyzed—implicitly conceding that the statutory criteria no longer guide anything.

The ethanol mandate is a deeply flawed policy. It does more harm than good for the environment, with an area the size of Michigan devoted to corn ethanol instead of something beneficial like natural habitat or food production—raising the prices of fuel and food as a result. If Congress could put the national interest above powerful special interests, it would repeal the RFS. That is unlikely to happen anytime soon, but there is an alternative.

Under its post-2022 authority, the EPA can lawfully lower RFS volumes annually based on factors like infrastructure constraints and economic effects. The EPA should use this authority to set a glide path that steadily reduces mandated volumes to no higher than the “blend wall” of E10 at whatever level of gasoline consumption is forecast for the next couple of years.

Given the enormous infrastructure that already sustains ethanol production, it would be competitive at close to E10 even without the RFS subsidy. But producers should be responding to price signals, not to the decrees of an agency bent on enriching them at everyone else’s expense.",https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2026-01/GettyImages-1384111997.jpg?itok=kUDhdip5,N,,2026-01-07 22:58:18.247405

EPA Proposal Would Allow Coal Ash Contamination to Continue Polluting Groundwater

SHARE

By Nancy Stoner, Senior Attorney

On January 6, 2026, I testified in opposition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule that would extend deadlines for certain coal-fired boilers to cease operation and for unlined, leaking coal ash pits to close.

This proposal would allow coal ash contamination to continue flowing into groundwater at eleven coal plants across the country. Every unlined coal ash pond covered by the proposal is already known to be contaminating surrounding groundwater with toxic metals that threaten public health. If finalized, the rule would increase risks to public health and the environment at all five affected Midwest plants, each of which has documented groundwater contamination.

READ MY TESTIMONY

Coal Ash is a Persistent and Dangerous Pollutant

Coal ash is the toxic waste left behind after coal is burned. It contains arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, lithium, radium, mercury, and other heavy metals that pose serious risks to human health and ecosystems. Until recently, it was both legal and common practice to dispose of coal ash in unlined pits, allowing these contaminants to leach directly into groundwater—often near drinking water wells.

The coal ash pits covered by EPA’s proposal are unlined, and utilities’ own monitoring data confirm that they are leaking. Exposure to coal ash contaminants has been linked to increased risks of cancer, heart and thyroid disease, cognitive impairments, respiratory disorders, prenatal mortality, and other serious health effects.

Midwest Communities at Risk

Five of the eleven coal ash facilities that would be allowed to continue operating under the proposed rule are located in the Midwest:

Baldwin Generating Station (Illinois)

Two uneconomic coal-fired boilers at the Baldwin plant were scheduled to shut down last year. The Trump administration intervened to override this market-based decision, forcing the boilers to continue operating and delaying closure of the plant’s coal ash pits. All 32 of Baldwin’s coal ash pits are leaking into groundwater. Detected contaminants include antimony, arsenic, beryllium, boron, cobalt, lithium, manganese, nitrate, sulfate, and total dissolved solids.

Kincaid Generating Station (Illinois)

The Kincaid plant was scheduled to shut down in 2027. Groundwater monitoring shows boron and total dissolved solids leaching from 7 of its 8 coal ash pits.

Miami Fort Power Station (Ohio)

Located along the Ohio River, the Miami Fort plant was also scheduled to shut down in 2027. The plant reports contamination—including arsenic, beryllium, boron, lithium, molybdenum, thallium, and total dissolved solids—at 25 of its 27 groundwater monitoring wells.

Newton Power Station (Illinois)

The Newton plant was slated for shutdown in 2027. All 18 of its groundwater monitoring wells show contamination, including arsenic, lead, radium, lithium, sulfate, and other toxic pollutants.

R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (Indiana)

Coal-fired units at the Schahfer plant were scheduled to shut down in December 2025. On December 23, the Trump administration ordered the units to continue operating despite the plant’s deteriorated condition, environmental impacts, and the owner’s decision to retire the facility. Groundwater monitoring shows contamination at 92 of 107 wells, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, radium, selenium, and numerous other toxic substances. Schahfer is also listed by EPA as a “potential damage case” and has been identified as one of the nation’s top “super polluters.”

This Was Never About Reliability

If, as it claims, EPA’s goal is truly to improve grid reliability, it should be working with the Department of Energy to accelerate the development of clean, reliable, and quick-to-deploy energy sources such as wind and solar. Instead, the Trump administration is blocking clean energy projects while propping up aging, polluting coal plants—demonstrating that this proposal is about subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, not protecting public health or the environment.

EPA’s only job is to protect human health and the environment. This proposed rule does the opposite. For these reasons, ELPC strongly opposes the proposal and urges EPA to withdraw it.",https://elpc.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_67584717-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 22:58:31.543271

At that point, the plant will produce up to 450,000 sinks, toilets, and ceramic pieces for the North American market each year.
Ceramic production requires high temperatures and is traditionally energy-intensive.
In Matane, Duravit uses almost entirely renewable energy: hydroelectric power from Québec replaces fossil fuels, and the electric roller kilns are powered by 99.6% renewable sources.
We want to create long-term jobs that offer prospects and actively contribute to economic development,” says Christian Gilles, Plant Manager at Duravit Canada.","Located on the St. Lawrence River in Matane, Quebec, the first North American manufacturing facility for Germany-based Duravit officially opened in November 2025. At approximately 375,000 square feet, the facility is one of the first plants in the world to fire sanitary ceramics with electric kilns powered almost entirely by renewable hydropower. The company has touted this significant step for lower carbon ceramic production — a breakthrough for a traditionally energy-intensive industry.

With an investment volume of more than $64.9 million (CAD 90 million), the plant employs 102 people with the number expected to reach 240 once planned full capacity is reached in 2027. At that point, the plant will produce up to 450,000 sinks, toilets, and ceramic pieces for the North American market each year. The strategic location on the St. Lawrence River enables short transport routes and resource saving supply to the region. Access to a deep-sea port and the use of clean, cost effective energy were key reasons for choosing the location.

“The opening of this facility marks a defining moment for Duravit that strengthens our regional footprint and sets a new benchmark for lower carbon ceramic production powered by clean energy,” said Bob Downie, President & CEO of Duravit North America at the opening. “It represents a long-term investment in resilient supply chains, high-quality local manufacturing, and a more sustainable future for our industry and the communities we serve.”

The opening event held November 27, 2025 included around 80 guests from various sectors such as government officials and personnel, business leaders and partners, and local media. Duravit was represented by Downie, Christian Gilles (Plant Manager, Canada), Thomas Stammel (COO), and Lüder Fromm (CMO). Special guest Gregor Greinert, Chairman of the Duravit Supervisory Board also joined the event.

Duravit emphasizes that by offering products designed and produced exclusively in North America now, the company is creating a more sustainable and resilient supply chain.

Ceramic production requires high temperatures and is traditionally energy-intensive. In Matane, Duravit uses almost entirely renewable energy: hydroelectric power from Québec replaces fossil fuels, and the electric roller kilns are powered by 99.6% renewable sources. This, combined with shorter transport routes, reduces CO₂ emissions by around 9,000 tons per year. At the heart of the plant are the electric roller kilns from Riedhammer, a subsidiary of the SACMI Group. The kilns, which are around 100 meters long, have a capacity of over 600 ceramic pieces per day, which are fired at a temperature of 1,260 degrees Celsius

(2,300 degrees Fahrenheit). The process heat generated is recycled for drying and casting areas.

Economic Development Canada supported the construction with a repayable contribution of $13.7 million (CAD 19 million), while Investissement Québec provided a loan of $7.9 million (CAD 11 million) through the ESSOR program. The community of the Matane region also contributed to the successful launch with its warm welcome and close cooperationk, notes Duravit.

“The Matane region has shown us great trust and support from the very beginning. For us, this plant is more than just a production site: it is a joint project with the local community. We want to create long-term jobs that offer prospects and actively contribute to economic development,” says Christian Gilles, Plant Manager at Duravit Canada.

With the opening of the new plant in Matane, the company is laying a strategic cornerstone for international expansion and pursuing its goal of becoming CO₂-neutral by 2045.

Lüder Fromm, CMO, says, “With our factory in Matane, Canada, we’re reinforcing our commitment to sustainable design and bringing Duravit’s values — excellence, quality, and responsibility—to North America. This factory shows how we combine innovation with responsibility and create solutions that last. Because true sustainability comes when timeless design is durable.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/duravit_plant_quebec.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 20:58:35.503429

While the Trump energy agenda may seem clear today, Fetter cautioned against assuming things will stay static.","The Department of Energy began 2026 much as it ended 2025, with a flurry of announcements aimed at boosting the administration’s priorities around nuclear power, power demand driven by artificial intelligence, and critical minerals. On Monday, DOE awarded $2.7 billion in contracts for enriched uranium — a historic investment in domestic nuclear fuel capacity — as well as an $11.5 million grant to Texas-based recycling company Amermin to bolster domestic supplies of key industrial and battery metals.

This week’s announcements follow a year of massive upheaval at the agency, which started with a blanket pause on all Biden-era awards, and closed with the Genesis Mission, an initiative focused on using AI for scientific breakthroughs, which the administration likened to the Manhattan Project. In between, DOE began employing the administration’s “energy dominance” framework more selectively, marking not only a pivot from the Biden-era climate focus, but also departure from the first Trump term’s focus on “energy independence” largely through deregulation. Trump 2.0 is using a suite of budgetary, regulatory, and administrative tools to reshape markets rather than simply unwind existing programs.

DOE has been undergoing an overhaul for months via mass firings carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency and billions in IRA-related funding cuts. The overhaul came to a public head in December, when the agency announced a reorganization eliminating the Grid Deployment Office and the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, among others.

It was one of the largest overhauls the agency has experienced in recent history, said Joel Fetter, who served as an advisor to ARPA-E throughout the Obama, first Trump, and then early Biden years. The cuts, though drastic, are in keeping with the current moment in energy, he added.

The core questions around solar panel and wind turbine design, for example, are largely settled, said Fetter, who is now the managing director of energy and industrial technologies at Clark Street Associates, an advisory firm specializing in securing government funding and partnerships for hard tech companies. Meanwhile, critical minerals, advanced nuclear, and energy supply chains all have gaps in existing innovation, making them ripe for DOE support.

Despite the drama of DOGE cuts, funding freezes, and award cancellations that have plagued the agency and imperiled the careers of hundreds of career staffers, Fetter sees the mobilization signals that came in late 2025 as promising. Many in the nuclear and critical minerals sectors are particularly optimistic about the agency’s potential role further upstream in supply chains.

“For example, there’s been no innovation in smelting at all since the end of the 19th century,” Fetter explained. “For DOE to put a focus back on that space, and sort of challenge the research and development and early commercialization, and think more creatively about that, is really important.”

New year, firm power priorities

Foundational to DOE’s priorities is what the president has long referred to as “baseload” power, particularly nuclear and geothermal as well as fossil fuels.

Fetter pointed to both fission and fusion as emerging priorities, driven by both power demand from the AI race but by national security considerations. Throughout last year, DOE was particularly active in nuclear energy, from funding small modular reactors to a $1 billion loan to help Constellation Energy restart a Pennsylvania nuclear plant.

“America does really well when we’ve got a clear opponent,” Fetter said, pointing to fusion in particular. “China is moving out really aggressively in both the number of technologies they’re looking at but also the size of their facilities.” Melding DOE’s energy innovation and national stockpile stewardship roles, he added, could align resources for nuclear “in a way that is catalytic for our ability to maintain an advantage in that area.”

Fission is another key focus, and one where DOE could be instrumental in implementing artificial intelligence: “The Chinese are very good at building things, and we are just getting up off the couch with fission,” Fetter said. “The question we have to face is, how do we achieve innovations in the technology suite that enable things to advance faster?”

And as DOE made clear in its year-end roundup, titled “Promises Made, Promises Kept,” critical minerals also received significant attention. DOE restructured a loan with Lithium Americas to include a 5% equity ownership for the government, and announced funding opportunities including $134 million for domestic rare earth supply chains, $80 million to establish testing grounds for next-gen mining technologies, and $275 million for companies mining minerals from industrial byproducts. The latter is an area where recycling and urban mining companies say the administration could make a massive impact by using policy levers to create demand for domestic products, thereby spurring investment and technology maturation.

DOE’s new normal

The drastic policy swings between administrations may continue for the DOE, Fetter warned — but that doesn’t mean the agency’s role as a lender will diminish.

For companies that have had awards canceled for apparently arbitrary reasons, “the burns are serious,” he explained. They’ve made board-level decisions about things like where to locate factories, and then lost federal support overnight. But at the end of the day, Fetter said, the fact remains that DOE and the broader federal government “have really large checkbooks, and that money can be enabling.”

For nuclear and critical minerals in particular, he added, DOE is bringing in non-traditional players that haven’t previously been a part of the federal funding ecosystem. The involvement of major players is in and of itself is also a vote of confidence to smaller tech innovators in those sectors.

As far as which Biden-era projects will move forward under Trump 2.0, Fetter pointed to manufacturing projects located in politically important districts and backed by commercial fundamentals like offtake agreements. But the pattern isn’t fully coherent, Fetter acknowledged; for instance, the Trump administration pulled its conditional commitment for the Grainbelt Express transmission project, then turned around and finalized a $1.6 billion loan for a different transmission project with AEP. “They haven’t gotten it totally right…those puts and takes between the White House, OMB, and DOE, have resulted in some things that have gone forward that make sense, and some things that people are scratching their heads over why they haven’t moved forward.”

Under the first Trump administration, DOE focused largely on basic research, with commercialization work effectively out of bounds. But Fetter said that approach was unlikely to hold under the far more volatile geopolitical and commodities environment of the second administration, where new constraints are already pushing the government to engage more directly with markets and deployments.

While the Trump energy agenda may seem clear today, Fetter cautioned against assuming things will stay static. Things may get tense between the agency and its OMB and White House counterparts — neither Secretary Wright or his assistant secretaries are in Washington to “keep a seat warm,” Fetter added.

“I think we’re in for some surprises,” he said. ”Some of the doctrines that have been implemented now are going to get questioned, and new problems will come up….

If we have this conversation in a year, I would submit that there would be some different topics and subject matter areas on the agenda.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2026-01-07T133810.881.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 21:13:37.229111

“ I am committed to understanding what this means for the city and then how the council can work on it,” said McCarron.","Amid city budget cuts, New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno has gutted the Mayor’s Office of Resilience and Sustainability (ORS). The office will lose nearly half its staff, including its director.

Chris Lang, the office’s circular economy and policy program director, said he and other colleagues received emails yesterday afternoon stating they would no longer be retained past Monday (Jan. 12).

“Urban agriculture's protected, and the stormwater and green infrastructure team, urban water team is safe. They didn't get terminated,” he said. “So basically the energy, the waste and the transportation folks, as well as the director position [were cut].”

Lang said the office primarily deals with quality of life issues for New Orleans residents, like increasing recycling access, tree canopy, bikeability and solar affordability.

The cuts came as a surprise to both the office’s staff and Moreno’s transition committee on climate and sustainability.

”This is news to us, and news to me,” said Davante Lewis, the committee’s chair. “But I’m hopeful that in the coming days we can be able to hear what the administration's plans are going forward.”

Jackson Voss, another member of the transition committee and the governmental affairs and policy coordinator at the Alliance for Affordable Energy, said the cuts directly contradict the committee’s recommendations to bolster the ORS, which included making the office a permanent city department or elevating its leadership to a cabinet-level position.

“ I think that this is the wrong direction to go, and I suspect there are many people across the city who feel the same way and expected (Moreno) to really be a champion for climate in a very different way than closing ORS,” he said. “I hope that they will reconsider this move.”

According to the 2025 adopted city budget, the office had an operating budget of about $1.4 million dollars. The office also manages hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants.

“We're coming from mostly federal funds, outside of some of our salaries,” Lang said. “But I would say the biggest hit is really because there isn't really an office outside of ours that's leveraging these federal funds and working across departments.”

In a written statement to WWNO, Moreno’s transition team said the change “embeds climate and resilience work across City Hall, not siloed in a single office. This ensures these priorities are integrated into the daily work of core departments where implementation and accountability occur with urgency.”

Moreno’s team also said there will now be eight positions under the ORS and the Chief Administrative Office, “responsible for grants operations, electrification, clean fleet, benchmarking, and outreach,” in addition to a few other positions now scattered across other city departments.

“I respectfully disagree with that idea, that there shouldn't be an office that's focused on ensuring that New Orleans is a place where we're doing the work that's necessary for people to live here, for generations to come,” said Voss. “And I think that that is what we're losing in losing the ORS office.”

Aimee McCarron, who is replacing Moreno as the chair of the City Council’s Climate and Sustainability Committee, said she was also not informed these cuts were coming and is planning on calling for a meeting on the subject as soon as she is sworn into the City Council next week.

“ I am committed to understanding what this means for the city and then how the council can work on it,” said McCarron. “We have the ability to do some things through the climate committee, and if I need to take on some of these things, then it's something that I'm willing to do and willing to partner with the administration on to make sure that we have these initiatives.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f342177/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2F35%2F9286dcff4be08a5fb5215fe1efdd%2F20251011-czb-electionday-792-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 21:58:47.652870

The state’s planning framework divides Texas into 16 regional water planning areas, each required to identify needs and recommend strategies on a five-year cycle.
Those regional plans roll up into the state water plan, which serves as a gatekeeper for eligibility across multiple Texas Water Development Board-administered financing programs.","Last November, Texas voters approved Proposition 4, a constitutional amendment intended to strengthen the state’s ability to finance water infrastructure as population growth, aging systems and long-term supply pressures converge across much of the state.

The initiative, approved by more than 70% of voters according to official results from the Texas Secretary of State, directs the comptroller of public accounts to deposit $1 billion of state sales and use tax revenue into the Texas Water Fund each fiscal year, provided total collections in that tax category exceed $46.5 billion.

The duty to deposit expires after 20 years, setting a two-decade runway for the new revenue stream. The constitutional language requires funds be kept in a separate account and transferred only through legislative appropriation, giving lawmakers ongoing control over when and how the money is deployed.

Beyond the financing infusion, Prop. 4 also hardwires guardrails that shape how quickly the money can translate into projects moving toward procurement.

Language in the amendment authorizes the Legislature to prescribe how portions—even all—of the deposited revenue are allocated among funds and accounts administered by the Texas Water Development Board. Those allocation decisions generally cannot be altered during the first 10 years, except through a temporary suspension during a declared state of disaster.

The amendment also prohibits using deposited revenue to build infrastructure for transporting fresh groundwater, narrowing the range of eligible supply strategies and sharpening long-running regional debates over what constitutes “new supply” in practice.

Supporters argued the amendment was necessary because Texas’ water infrastructure needs have outpaced periodic appropriations and one-time funding infusions. It is an argument reinforced by long-standing state planning documents and federal infrastructure assessments warning that population growth, drought exposure and aging assets are straining both potable supply and the systems required to deliver it.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s most recent Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment estimates that Texas drinking water systems will require roughly $61 billion over the next 20 years for transmission, distribution, treatment and storage improvements.

A broader assessment by Texas 2036, a nonpartisan public policy group, using EPA drinking water and wastewater surveys and the state water plan, projects at least $154 billion in combined water supply, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure needs statewide through midcentury.

That estimate includes more than $3 billion per year through 2041 just to maintain and rehabilitate existing drinking water systems, underscoring that while Prop. 4 expands financing capacity, it addresses only a portion of long-term demand.

Prop. 4 in the Real World

Prop. 4 functions more as a financing pivot than a construction trigger, as Texas’s project selection discipline is more prescriptive than in states relying on ad hoc appropriations or discretionary infrastructure programs.

The state’s planning framework divides Texas into 16 regional water planning areas, each required to identify needs and recommend strategies on a five-year cycle. Those regional plans roll up into the state water plan, which serves as a gatekeeper for eligibility across multiple Texas Water Development Board-administered financing programs.

The following regional snapshots illustrate how that planning discipline translates into differing project profiles and levels of readiness across Texas.

Eligibility for the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT) illustrates that structure. The revolving financing program generally requires that proposed projects include recommended water management strategies from adopted regional plans and be part of the most recent state water plan when applications are submitted.

Even after projects clear the planning threshold, spending remains contingent on legislative appropriation, and lawmakers’ allocation decisions can shape what TWDB can support for years at a time. TWDB then operationalizes those appropriations through program rules, application cycles, prioritization criteria and board actions, much of which unfolds on a public schedule through board agendas, implementation plans and periodic funding updates.

Projects that advance through Texas’ planning gate still face constraints that can affect delivery schedules and risk profiles. Many large water projects trigger layered environmental review and permitting requirements, including state-level environmental assessments embedded in certain TWDB financing programs. Applicants are also commonly required to demonstrate conservation planning and compliance with drought contingency plans as conditions of assistance.

Industry executives working downstream of the planning process say those regulatory layers, combined with long procurement cycles and equipment lead times, are increasingly where projects stall—even after financing pathways are identified.

Financing capacity at the local level can further shape outcomes. TWDB assistance is frequently structured around revenue pledges and market-referenced interest rates, and smaller or nonrated utilities may still face higher borrowing costs, even when participating in programs designed to reduce rates or provide principal forgiveness.

Federal dollars add another layer of complexity. Utilities pursuing Drinking Water or Clean Water State Revolving Fund assistance must align applications with annual intended use plans and federal compliance requirements, including domestic content rules and, for some categories, conditions tied to Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding.

In practice, that sequencing can force local owners to braid state financing with federal capitalization grants and other allocations while navigating differing eligibility standards, reporting obligations and procurement rules.

What Does This Mean for Contractors and Designers?

Against those procedural realities, rural-urban tensions are likely to shape how the expanded financing translates into work: while need is widespread, delivery capacity is not.

Fast-growing metropolitan areas tend to focus on treatment capacity, rehabilitation and system redundancy within existing footprints. Regions facing longer-term supply constraints are more likely to pursue conveyance, pumping and nontraditional sources, which carry higher capital costs and longer delivery timelines. Prop. 4 does not flatten those differences; it amplifies them by favoring regions that have already translated need into defined, finance-ready projects.

Texas 2036, citing Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) data, reports an average of 2,883 boil water notices issued annually from 2019 through 2023. Most are linked to line breaks or service disruptions, with smaller systems experiencing higher rates of water loss, a pattern often associated with limited maintenance and capital capacity.

Additional TCEQ estimates indicate at least 572,000 acre-feet of water—roughly 186 billion gallons—lost statewide each year, highlighting the tension between high-growth urban systems that prioritize redundancy and smaller communities struggling to stabilize basic infrastructure.

Private industrial demand is following a different trajectory. Kevin Gast, CEO of Austin-based VVater, said industrial owners tend to move faster than public utilities because regulatory compliance pressures and production risk leave little tolerance for multiyear delays.

“These industrial players are struggling to meet regulatory compliance, which means they have to spend money to meet those requirements,” Gast said. “They can’t have a problem dragging on for years and years.”

Gast said industrial users are also more likely to redesign projects or pursue reuse-focused approaches to avoid extended permitting and pilot timelines, while some smaller or rural public systems—facing failing infrastructure and limited capital—are more willing to adopt nontraditional solutions than larger cities with deeply embedded assets.

The practical takeaway for the industry is that the projects most likely to advance in the near term are not newly conceived concepts but those that have already moved through feasibility studies, preliminary engineering and regional consensus. Treatment plant expansions, transmission upgrades, reuse systems and phased conveyance projects are among the categories best positioned to compete for assistance.

For firms positioning for work in 2026 and beyond, the clearest signals are likely to emerge through TWDB’s public process. Board agendas, implementation plan updates, annual intended use plans, project rating reports and public comment periods can serve as early indicators of procurement pacing, particularly in years when demand for assistance exceeds available funding.

So whether you're already eyeing that sleek new Tesla or contemplating buying a reliable used Nissan Leaf from last year—it pays dividends both financially and environmentally speaking—to explore what Virginia's EV tax credits can do for you.","In the heart of Virginia, a quiet revolution is taking place on our roads. Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer just a futuristic dream; they’re becoming an everyday reality for many Virginians. With this shift comes a host of incentives designed to make the transition smoother and more affordable, particularly through tax credits that can significantly lighten the financial load.

As part of its commitment to environmentally-friendly policies, Virginia has embraced its status as a ""CARB"" state—an acknowledgment that aligns it with California's stringent air quality standards. This means not only stricter emissions regulations but also attractive rebates and tax credits aimed at encouraging residents to adopt cleaner transportation options.

For those considering purchasing an electric vehicle in 2024 or beyond, understanding the EV tax credit landscape is crucial. The federal government offers substantial incentives: buyers may qualify for up to $7,500 off their taxes when purchasing new electric vehicles or up to $4,000 for used ones. However, these benefits come with specific eligibility requirements.

To qualify for these credits under current guidelines set by the IRS—which are evolving due to recent legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act—you must ensure your income falls below certain thresholds: $300,000 for married couples filing jointly; $225,000 for heads of household; and $150,000 for all other filers. Additionally, your chosen vehicle must meet criteria regarding battery capacity (at least 7 kWh), weight limits (under 14,000 pounds), and final assembly location in North America.

What’s interesting is how flexible these programs have become recently—starting in 2024 you might even be able to transfer your tax credit directly at purchase time instead of waiting until you file your taxes! This could mean instant savings right at the dealership—a game changer if you're looking at making that leap into EV ownership sooner rather than later.

But let’s not forget about timing—the clock is ticking on some aspects of these incentives too. For instance, while currently available benefits will expire after September 30th in subsequent years unless extended by lawmakers, it’s essential to stay informed about any changes that could affect potential savings before committing fully.

WM captures landfill gas from its Simi Valley Landfill — which serves Ventura County and the west San Fernando Valley — and the RNG facility processes it into pipeline-quality RNG, which is then delivered into SoCalGas’s pipeline system. This RNG can be allocated to fuel consumption for heavy duty compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and the RNG can be used to fuel homes and businesses.

“This is a significant milestone in our journey to expand the use of renewable natural gas,” said Jawaad Malik, senior vice president of strategy and sustainability at SoCalGas. “By working with WM to bring this project online, we’re supporting operations that capture methane and convert it into renewable fuel—helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions, advance California’s climate goals, and deliver reliable energy to our customers.”

More than $100 million has been invested by WM to construct the WM Simi Valley RNG Facility, which is expected to generate approximately 2.2 million MMBtu per year of RNG. This anticipated RNG production has the potential to avoid up to 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually – the equivalent of removing an estimated 2,000 trucks from the road or powering approximately 65,000 homes. The 30,000-square-foot plant is one of the largest RNG facilities in the WM portfolio and WM’s first RNG facility in California.

“WM is proud to collaborate with SoCalGas to deliver a renewable fuel source to communities and businesses,” said Tara Hemmer, chief sustainability officer at WM. “This new RNG facility is part of WM’s broader commitment to advancing circularity and providing the innovative solutions our customers need to thrive.”

These efforts align with SoCalGas’s aim to replace 20% of its traditional natural gas delivery to core customers* with natural gas from renewable sources by 2030. In 2024, RNG made up about 5.5% of the gas SoCalGas delivered to its core customers.

RNG sourced from landfills, dairies, and wastewater treatment plants can help lower greenhouse gas emissions and can be used to fuel CNG vehicles, generate electricity, and heat buildings.

The program is part of an initiative begun in 2024 aimed at ending the country’s reliance on foreign sources of enriched uranium, such as Russia, which currently dominates the global market for specialized nuclear fuels.

These efforts are focused on rebuilding U.S. production of Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) to ensure fuel supplies for the nation’s 94 existing commercial reactors, while simultaneously developing High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) –enriched between 5% and 20% – to power future deployments of advanced nuclear reactors.

“President Trump is catalyzing a resurgence in the nation’s nuclear energy sector to strengthen American security and prosperity,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Today’s awards show that this Administration is committed to restoring a secure domestic nuclear fuel supply chain capable of producing the nuclear fuels needed to power the reactors of today and the advanced reactors of tomorrow.”

Awards of $900 million went to U.S.-based firms American Centrifuge Operating and General Matter for the development of advanced high-assay low-enriched uranium processing capabilities.

American Centrifuge Operating, a subsidiary of Maryland-based Centrus Energy Corp., produces centrifuges and related equipment using domestic parts and labor at a plant in Piketon, Ohio. The company’s engineering and manufacturing facility is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

General Matter, a nuclear startup company based in San Francisco, is backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The company was awarded funding to build and operate an enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky, and plans to repurpose the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The company aims to restore U.S. leadership in nuclear enrichment to power future energy demands, including those from AI data centers, according to its website.

The Energy Dept. awarded another $900 million to Orano Federal Services, a global leader in nuclear fuels with headquarters in France, aimed at expanding U.S. production of low-enriched uranium.

“Today’s announcement marks a significant milestone for America’s energy independence & TN is ready-made to lead the next generation of clean, reliable nuclear power,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee posted Monday on X. “I’m grateful for the Department of Energy’s historic $2.7 billion investment to strengthen domestic uranium enrichment, expand innovation & create American jobs.""

The funding for the program was established in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 as part of former President Biden’s ""Investing in America"" agenda.

This is an unforced error for the United States of America.
“The United States would be the first country to walk away from the UNFCCC.
A future administration that understands the stakes can rejoin the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change just as Trump decided to pull the country out of it.
“But make no mistake: while the Trump administration is abdicating the United States of America’s global leadership, the rest of the world is continuing to shift to cleaner power sources and take climate action.","WASHINGTON, DC – The Trump Administration announced today that it would pull the United States out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the formal venue for global climate talks.

While the Administration has already withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, this action further isolates the United States by excluding it from all international climate discussions and sends a signal of deepening disinterest in addressing the global threat. Today’s action stands as the latest move by the White House to side with fossil fuels interests over efforts to address global pollution problems.

Following is reaction from Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“President Trump pulls the United States out of the UNFCCC at the nation’s peril. It is not only self-defeating to let other countries write the global rules of the road for the inevitable transition to clean energy, but also to skip out on trillions of dollars in investment, jobs, lower energy costs, and new markets for American clean technologies. That might suit Big Oil, but it is bad for everyone else. This is an unforced error for the United States of America.

“The United States would be the first country to walk away from the UNFCCC. Every other nation is a member, in part because they recognize that even beyond the moral imperative of addressing climate change, having a seat at the table in those negotiations represents an ability to shape massive economic policy and opportunity. A future administration that understands the stakes can rejoin the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change just as Trump decided to pull the country out of it.

“Fortunately, the U.S. is bigger than Washington. Action from cities, states, the private sector and other nations will become even more important to help prevent the worst that climate change will throw at us and protect the world’s most vulnerable populations.

“But make no mistake: while the Trump administration is abdicating the United States of America’s global leadership, the rest of the world is continuing to shift to cleaner power sources and take climate action. The Trump administration is ceding the trillions of dollars in investment that the clean energy transition brings to nations willing to follow the science and embrace the cleanest, cheapest sources of energy.”

Each unit combines a 400 kWh battery with dual 400 kW DC fast charging ports.
Reef is a real-time charging station management system that gives operators visibility into charging sessions, energy flow and station performance.
According to the company, its system can deliver 400 kW charging from a 30 kW grid connection, and can be deployed in 4-6 weeks.","ElectricFish Energy has unveiled a new EV charging platform aimed at gas stations. The new Turbo Charge platform includes three integrated components:

The ElectricFish 400squared is an EV charger with energy storage. Each unit combines a 400 kWh battery with dual 400 kW DC fast charging ports.

Reef is a real-time charging station management system that gives operators visibility into charging sessions, energy flow and station performance.

Stargazer, the system’s cloud-based engine, is designed to optimize charging schedules, predict demand, and manage grid services to maximize revenue for site hosts.

“We don’t sell EV chargers or batteries—we sell time and uptime,” said ElectricFish CTO Nelio Batista. “We’ve decoupled charging speed from grid limits by actively managing when energy flows in or out, so fast charging strengthens the grid instead of destabilizing it.”

ElectricFish has several installations already underway in the US. A commercial deployment is now live in Detroit’s Eastern Market district, where ElectricFish provides charging for a logistics hub’s fleet of electric trucks, as well as to the public.

ElectricFish’s battery-supported chargers draw power from their own energy storage systems rather than directly from the grid—they can absorb demand spikes, and can even sell power back to the grid during peak periods. According to the company, its system can deliver 400 kW charging from a 30 kW grid connection, and can be deployed in 4-6 weeks.

Under ElectricFish’s revenue-share program, station owners provide space and a modest electrical connection. ElectricFish covers the hardware and installation and then splits the charging revenue with the host.

“Gas stations are built for short dwell times and high turnover. We designed our new Turbo Charge service to behave like a pump, not a parking space,” said Anurag Kamal, ElectricFish CEO and co-founder. “But the real moat is our software. Our Stargazer engine doesn’t just charge cars. It manages energy flow, predicts demand, and helps utilities stabilize the grid. We’re not a hardware company. We’re an energy platform.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ElectricFish-targets-gas-stations-for-its-Turbo-Charge-EV-charging-platform.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:00:51.648090

In 2026, resilience and sustainability will be foundational for business success. Companies that embrace these imperatives will thrive and outpace the competition, while those that don’t risk falling behind. The evidence is in the data: extreme weather events cost businesses in the U.S. more than $100 billion in the first half of 2025. At the same time, nearly 90% of companies now link decarbonization directly to business value, according to Accenture. Sustainability is no longer a cost story, it’s a growth story and the question isn’t if you act, it’s how fast.

Resilience as the North Star

The extreme weather events of 2025 forced a rethink of how we build and operate, especially since buildings consume 30% of all energy and generate 40% of emissions globally. Connected systems can now gather and analyze a million data points per second to deliver real-time insights, cutting response time from hours to minutes. This kind of connected infrastructure allows organizations to react faster, do more with less and outperform even when conditions change – especially important in this era of mega disruption (economic, technological, geopolitical-everything everywhere and all at once!).

Precision industries – healthcare, advanced manufacturing, universities – are proving what is possible. Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital in Ontario connected building technology to reduce energy use by 19%, and now operates 33% more efficiently than the health care industry average. Digital tools saved 4,000 hours in manual troubleshooting and 600 hours annually in preventative maintenance – efficiency that translates into better patient outcomes. A North American university slashed energy use by 50% through improved heating, cooling, and ventilation – saving money while creating a healthier learning environment. These aren’t incremental gains, they’re resilience in action that frees up needed time and capital for what matters most.

Sustainability Becomes the Bedrock for Business Competitiveness

Sustainability drives smart capital allocation and enables growth. The trifecta of efficiency, electrification and decarbonization delivers results that ensure uptime and reliability. Consider the impact: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, between 20 and 50% of industrial energy is wasted. This at a time when electricity costs are up 30% overall and by 60% for industry in many parts of the U.S. Deploying innovative technology like high-efficiency heat pumps and chillers at scale is a key strategy for success. Today’s technologies can cut energy bills in half, allowing businesses to reinvest in growth and innovation. There is huge competitive advantage waiting to be seized by those who redirect capital from waste to winning!

And the results are in the real-world applications. A hospital in Germany tapped heat energy 200 meters below the facility and realized a 30% cut in energy costs while producing enough heat to cover 80% of the hospital’s demand. A data center cooled the racks with chillers that use 40% less power annually and zero on-site water. Leaders are deploying advanced cooling and thermal management to ease grid strain and boost uptime, because in these industries, every second counts. Plus, 40% less energy directed to cooling is 40% more energy directed to computing. Clearly, the winning data center is the efficient, sustainable data center.

General Legislative Overview – Appropriations and Health Care to Start the Year

Congress enters 2026 facing unfinished appropriations work, with funding negotiations complicated by ongoing partisan disagreements.

The lapse of the Covid-era ACA premium tax credits continues to be a major source of political and legislative friction.

Any reconciliation legislation in 2026 is expected to center on health care, with tax provisions likely to be relatively narrow in scope.

While broader tax policy divides remain, there is still a path to a limited bipartisan tax package focused on discrete issues such as digital assets, gambling losses, and certain forms of individual tax relief.

After enactment of the OBBBA and other legislation, traditional tax extenders are far less central, as most significant expirations were made permanent.

Developments at the OECD and the G-7 have dampened prospects for near-term U.S. legislation on Pillar Two, with digital services taxes likely addressed through trade and diplomatic channels.

Treasury remains focused on advancing the Administration’s deregulatory agenda and implementing the OBBBA through a pared-down guidance agenda, with the scope of regulatory action likely influencing whether Congress steps in legislatively.

The legislative tax outlook for 2026 is uncertain and mostly depends on larger political developments, even as Treasury steadily continues issuing guidance to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and advance President Trump’s deregulatory agenda. Members of Congress in both parties are switching into more active campaign mode, with the November 2026 mid-term elections now less than ten months away.

OBBBA advanced numerous tax priorities of President Trump and congressional Republicans, most prominently dealing with the cliff created by the scheduled 2025 expiration of key components of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) by generally making those provisions permanent. From the perspective of most congressional Republicans, there are no tax matters of similar urgency in 2026. It appears Republicans believe that enactment of the OBBBA will help them show they delivered on 2024 election promises to improve the economy and provide Americans with tax relief.

Moderate Republicans would like to extend the Covid-era increased tax credits for certain health insurance premiums, while conservatives are aiming to advance much broader health care reforms. And even without broader big picture political interest, the members of the tax writing committees are always interested in amending the Tax Code, even if the changes are not dramatic.

Congressional Democrats have made the Covid-era health tax credits a priority, and may again use funding the government as a leverage point to force Republicans to extend the credits. As November draws closer, Democrats will campaign on criticizing the OBBBA tax and spending cuts, and instead advocate a more progressive tax system, such as the expanded refundable credits enacted for 2021 and 2022 in the American Rescue Plan Act, and reversing the cuts to green energy tax incentives in the OBBBA.

Despite disagreement on some big picture tax policy issues, there are also some areas of bipartisan agreement. Depending on the larger political dynamic, the leaders of the tax writing committees might negotiate and enact a 2026 bipartisan tax package.

Thus, tax legislation could get enacted this year in a partisan budget reconciliation bill or on a bipartisan basis.

Treasury is focused on OBBBA implementation and other issues in the 2025–2026 Priority Guidance Plan. The Plan is much slimmed down from prior versions, only including projects Treasury and the IRS believe they can actually accomplish during the year.

General Legislative Overview – Appropriations and Health Care to Start the Year

Appropriations

Congress returns this week, as it faces a January 30 deadline at which time the continuing resolution (CR) enacted in November to fund nine of the twelve categories of the federal government will expire. The veterans affairs-military construction, agriculture-FDA, and legislative appropriations categories are funded through this fiscal year, ending on September 30, 2026.

On December 20, the House and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairs, Sen. Collins (R-ME) and Rep. Cole (R-OK), announced they had reached agreement on the topline funding levels for each remaining category. The two did not announce those levels, but said they would not exceed last year’s. However, the deal does not include Democrats, whose votes will be necessary to pass the bill in the Senate, and perhaps the House.

Earlier this week, appropriators agreed on a package funding Interior, Energy and Water, and Commerce-Justice-Science that the House is expected to take up and approve on Thursday, followed by the Senate. This would leave six appropriations categories, including two that are usually the most controversial, Labor-HHS and Defense.

IRS funding, part of the Financial Services category, is one of the major areas of dispute in the appropriations process. The House bill, marked up by the Appropriations Committee in July and reported in September, would provide $9.5 billion, a 23% cut. The proposal released by the Senate Appropriations Committee in November would provide the IRS with $11.8 billion. The House bill would provide the IRS more in technology and operations support, $3.75 billion compared to $3.2 billion. The Senate proposal would provide $3.2 billion for taxpayer services compared to $2.78 billion in the House bill. The most pronounced difference is over enforcement, with the Senate proposal keeping funding flat compared to $3 billion in the House bill, a 45% cut. The differences between the parties are even more pronounced than this comparison because Senate Democrats heavily criticized the Senate Appropriations Committee bill for cutting IRS funding, which helps explain why the Committee has not marked up the proposal.

The House bill funding the State Department and related appropriations, marked up and reported in July, would eliminate American funding of the OECD (constituting about 15% of the OECD main budget). The Senate Appropriations Committee still has not released its version of the bill. In recent years, the Senate has overridden House objections to funding the OECD, but it is not clear whether the Senate will change course under the new Republican majority. It also remains to be seen whether the side-by-side released by the OECD on January 5 will change Congress’s willingness to provide funding.

Health Care

The Covid-era increased tax credits for health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expired at the end of 2025. Partisan disagreement over whether to extend those increased tax credits, and if so whether modifications should be included, resulted in a government shutdown from September 30 through November 12.

Democrats support making permanent the increased credits, or at least extending them for several years. Most Republicans argue that the increased credits should be limited to the Covid-era for which they were enacted. The issue is part of a much deeper dispute about the ACA and health care policy. Some Republicans support a temporary extension of the credits with reforms, such as limiting income eligibility.

House Speaker Johnson (R-LA) has said the House will focus on health care policy during the first portion of 2026, floating the possibility of another budget reconciliation bill as a legislative vehicle. The House and Senate Budget Committee Chairmen, Rep. Arrington (R-TX), who is not running for reelection and very eager to help enact another signature piece of legislation, and Sen. Graham (R-SC), have been enthusiastic about using the budget reconciliation process again to enact major changes to health care policy and other Republican priorities. Other Republicans, including Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (R-MO), have voiced skepticism about this path.

To start 2026, the House will vote this week on a bill that would extend for three years the increased ACA tax credits, after four House Republicans joined all House Democrats to sign a discharge petition on December 17, to bring the bill to the House floor. Although the bill now seems very likely to pass the House, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) has said he will not bring the bill to the Senate floor.

On December 17, the House passed H.R. 6703, the “Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act,” on an almost straight party line basis, containing various health care provisions including pharmacy benefit management services, and association health plans. The bill does not address the ACA credits. It does not appear that the Senate has any plans to take up the bill. Various Senators have been holding discussions about a compromise package that would combine an extension of the credits with income limitations and other reforms.

President Trump has been critical of the ACA credits, along with the ACA more generally, arguing the credits should be changed to provide subsidies directly to individuals instead of to insurance companies. Some White House officials have been advocating a complete health care overhaul through reconciliation. Democrats have said that President Trump will nonetheless eventually yield because of political fallout from the expiration of the credits. The ACA credits are unlikely to be extended unless President Trump decides to back a compromise. Another government shutdown is possible if agreement is not reached.

There was an unusually high level of intra-party political tension to close out 2025 in both parties. On December 30, President Trump issued the first two vetoes of his second term. H.R. 131 would address drinking water pipelines in Colorado, while H.R. 504 would address tribal land control by the Miccosukee Tribe in Florida. The House is set to vote this week on overriding the vetoes.

Tax Policy

Tax Legislation – Reconciliation

A budget reconciliation bill addressing health care issues may also include tax provisions. Considering the breadth of the OBBBA, most Republican tax priorities have already been enacted so the tax provisions of a 2026 reconciliation bill would likely be much more limited in scope.

One possible prominent tax provision would be to legislate on President Trump’s call for sending rebate checks to Americans below certain income levels, relating to increased tariff revenue. The Supreme Court may strike down tariffs imposed by President Trump under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). It is unlikely this would cause Congress to legislatively increase tariffs. But President Trump may instead impose tariffs under other authorities Congress has granted the President, such as those provided in the Tariff Act of 1930, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and the Trade Act of 1974. Whichever way the Supreme Court rules, President Trump and congressional advocates such as Sen. Hawley (R-MO), may use the Supreme Court decision to focus on the rebates.

President Trump has also called for eliminating capital gains on sales of primary residences, and eliminating U.S. taxation of Americans living abroad.

The corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act will prevent some companies from taking the full benefit of OBBBA tax provisions, such as (the partially retroactive) reversal of R&D amortization, and incentives for manufacturing in the U.S., including the revised foreign-derived deduction-eligible income (FDDEI) and expensing for qualified production property (QPP). If Treasury does not use its regulatory authority under CAMT to alleviate these effects, Republicans may attempt to do legislatively.

Tax Legislation – Bipartisan

In addition to the ACA credits, Democrats are prioritizing restoration of the green energy credits cut back by the OBBBA, and refundable tax credits (such as the child tax credit) that were expanded for 2021 and 2022 by the American Rescue Plan Act.

Republicans are very unlikely to reverse OBBBA green energy tax provisions, but there could be overlap between President Trump’s support of tariff rebates and Democratic support for increasing refundable tax credits.

There are a number of tax provisions on which bipartisan agreement could be reached and included in a bipartisan bill. For example, there is bipartisan and bicameral interest, shared by the White House, on digital asset taxation, with a bipartisan House discussion draft recently being released, as explained in more detail below. There is also bipartisan interest in reversing the OBBBA provision limiting gambling losses to 90% of gambling income. Other provisions could also be included, such as tax incentives for energy provisions with bipartisan support. And there is Democratic support for eliminating (or at least limiting) capital gains on the sale of a primary residence. H.R. 1340, introduced by Rep. Panetta (D-CA) (and which has 94 bipartisan cosponsors) would increase the exclusion from $250,000 to $500,000 for single filers (twice that amount for joint filers) and index the exclusion amount to inflation.

Extenders

Earlier this century, there was a large set of perennially expiring tax provisions with very broad impact, such as the R&D credit and the individual AMT, that Congress would extend in lock-step every year or two. The number and prominence of these provisions created considerable political pressure to address them in bills that sometimes also served as vehicles for other tax provisions. Congress has enacted legislation steadily reducing these “extenders” starting with the 2015 PATH Act. The expiring provisions with a 2025 cliff enacted in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and two-year provisions in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act were notable exceptions to this trend.

The OBBBA made permanent the vast majority of tax provisions that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2025. However, the OBBBA did not address the ACA tax credits, or the ARPA refundable credits that Republicans largely argued should remain expired following Covid. Last Congress, Chairmen Smith and Wyden reached a compromise on the ARPA provisions, along with TCJA business tax increases, that was passed by the Republican House by a very wide bipartisan margin. However, the bill was blocked by Senate Republicans (then in the minority) in the hopes (since realized) that Republicans would sweep the 2024 elections and address the provisions through reconciliation.

Other than IRA green energy tax provisions sunset by the OBBBA, provisions expiring in 2025 include the exclusion from gross income of discharge of indebtedness on a principal residence, the seven-year recovery period for motorsports entertainment complexes, and the work opportunity tax credit (WOTC). A per-barrel excise tax on domestic crude oil and imported petroleum products that funds the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that was reinstated in 2006 after previously expiring in 1994 expired at the beginning of 2026. A June 30, 2025 report by the Congressional Research Service found that the Trust Fund had a $9.6 billion balance at the end of FY 2024, which will make it difficult to convince Republicans to support reinstating the tax.

Although the provisions have critics, the motorsports deduction and WOTC are strong candidates for a bipartisan tax bill.

OECD Pillars and DSTs

On January 5, 2026, the OECD released the details of the side-by-side agreement announced by the G-7 on June 28, 2025, along with other rules on Pillar 2 in a document entitled, “Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy – Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two), Side-by-Side Package.” This would appear to make enactment of Section 899, which was taken out of the OBBBA as part of the G-7 announcement of a side-by-side system much less likely. However, it does remain to be seen whether Republicans believe the conditions for the side-by-side treatment, such as a corporate tax rate of at least 20% or a CAMT of at least 15%, infringe U.S. sovereignty and the role of Congress in enacting tax law under the Constitution.

The Trump administration appears to be dealing with DSTs on a separate track from Pillar 2, in the context of trade negotiations over digital technology services more generally. Tensions over these issues ratcheted up in late December with the United States Trade Representative threatening retaliation against EU companies. On December 23, the State Department imposed visa sanctions on five Europeans connected to regulation of digital media, accusing them of “organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose.”

It remains to be seen whether Congress might also enact other legislation addressing interactions between Pillar 2 and the U.S. tax system. There are numerous policy considerations at play, including sovereignty, the competitiveness of American companies, and revenue. Possible issues include foreign tax credit, and modifications to other cross-border rules such as dual consolidated losses. The issues are enormously complicated, and Congress might instead defer to Treasury.

The Tax Regulatory Agenda

Treasury closed 2025 by continuing to grind out guidance on the OBBBA and other issues covered by the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan. Tax guidance did not appear to be slowed down by the government shutdown or the deep cuts to the IRS earlier in 2025.

Although priorities change when administrations shift political control, reversal of Treasury’s positions on many issues, such as so-called partnership “basis shifting” transactions, corporate reorganizations, dual consolidated losses and the corporate alternative minimum tax, has been particularly marked. Critics accuse Treasury of exceeding its authority in order to benefit large corporations and wealthy taxpayers. Defenders counter that it was the Biden Treasury that exceeded its authority in order to increase taxes.

The extent of Treasury action in many of these areas will impact the desire in Congress to legislate, although Republicans might want to codify some guidance in some of these areas to make it harder to reverse. Taxpayer-friendly guidance could reduce the cost (as measured by the Joint Committee on Taxation) of addressing the underlying issues legislatively.",https://www.sullcrom.com/SullivanCromwell/_Assets/images/sc-logo-2D_1200x630.png,N,,2026-01-07 19:01:27.700402

The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport’s CO2 emissions by its RPK.
For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK.","Emissions and efficiency

Data is analysed for 27,451,887 flights (take-offs), operated between 26,156 bi-directional city pairs in 2023. Flights transported a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a total flown distance of 43,314,099,618 km (equivalent to 145 return journeys to the sun), or equalling 6,813,991,167,300 RPK (about 0.7 light years), causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2.

Fig. 1 illustrates the relevance of the 20 highest emitting countries. The United States is responsible for 25% of global emissions (144.6 Mt), with an average weighted efficiency per RPK that is 14.3% higher than the weighted global average. The second largest emitting country, China, follows with 49.7 Mt CO2, and an average weighted efficiency of 88.6 g CO2 per RPK. Together, the 20 countries account for 74.9% (433 Mt CO2) of global emissions from air passenger transport. Emissions on individual city pairs vary between a low of 31.6 g CO2 per RPK (Milan, Italy to Incheon/Seoul, South Korea) and a high of 888.3 g CO2 per RPK (Kavieng to Tokua Lakunai, within Papua New Guinea). The global average is 84.4 g CO2 per RPK.

The global variation in efficiencies can also be illustrated by airports, and for the busiest routes (Fig. 2). Results show that inefficient flights dominate in Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and Central Asia. They are also common in North America (particularly smaller airports, less busy flights), East Asia, and Western South America. In Europe, Norway is particularly inefficient. Efficient flights dominate in Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as on routes with high traveller volumes. Other regions, including Europe, have both more and less efficient routes.

Larger airports have a higher efficiency averaged across arriving and departing flights (Fig. 3a). The standard deviation of flight CO2 intensities increases for larger airports too (Fig. 3b) as they serve more flights. This is statistically supported by rank correlations of (a) −0.57, (b) 0.54, and total CO₂ emissions are largely determined by RPK (Pearson: 0.98). Large variation in CO₂ intensity reflects on regional differences (Fig. 2).

Figure 4 further illustrates differences between the least and most efficient airports and airlines in the world. Average emissions between the least/most efficient airports and airlines (emissions of 0.1 Mt CO2 or more in 2023) can be more than a factor two. For example, airline LATAM (Chile) caused average emissions of 69.1 g CO2 per RPK, while Air Algerie (Algeria) emitted 115.0 g CO2 per RPK; airport Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) caused 67.5 g CO2 per RPK and Atlanta 103.0 g CO2 per RPK. There is also evidence that larger airlines are more efficient (Fig. 5a), and that passenger load factors influence efficiency (Fig. 5b).

Efficiency improvement potentials

These findings point to the importance of aircraft models, layouts, and load factors. These are analyzed to determine the theoretical maximum efficiency in the air transport system. Observed aircraft model efficiency varies considerably (Fig. 6). The most efficient models include Boeing 787–900 (55.4 g CO2 per RPK), 787–800 (59.8 CO2 per RPK), and Boeing 787–1000 (60.1 CO2 per RPK), followed by Airbus A320 neo (61.4 g CO2 per RPK), Airbus A321neo (64.1 CO2 per RPK), and Airbus A350 (76.2 g CO2 per RPK). If all aircraft were replaced with the Boeing 787-9 (long-haul) and the Airbus A321neo (short and medium-haul), this would result in fuel savings of −25% to −28% depending on respective market share (Fig. 7).

In regard to layouts, IATA21 suggests that business and first class seats are up to 5 times more CO₂-intense than economy class seats. Premium class seating is more common in wide-bodied aircraft and on long-haul flights, as well as among specific airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Swiss International Air Lines30. An all-economy class configuration would consequently reduce emissions. Here, results suggest that increasing passenger numbers to the maximum seating configuration for the most efficient aircraft (Airbus 350 and Boeing 787) would further reduce emissions by 21.5% to 56.7%, assuming no changes in the load factor.

In 2023, average passenger load factors were 78.9% for flown kilometers, with a range from 20.1% to 100% between individual flights. Increasing this load factor to 95% would further reduce emissions by 16.1%. Overall, emissions in 2023 could have been 54.5% to 76.0% lower, though a modest fuel penalty would have to be considered (see Methods). This suggests that transporting the same number of passengers over the same distances would be possible with less than half the current fuel consumption, if airlines only operated the most efficient aircraft models, switched to an all-economy layout, and increased the load factor to 95% (Fig. 7).

While this is the hypothetical maximum, analysis for 13,666 city pairs (52.2% of all city pairs) that are served by more than one airline or aircraft configuration suggests that operating these city pairs by the most efficient configuration currently in use would reduce emissions by 10.7%. This represents the already demonstrated efficiency gain in the air transport system, with airlines operating under their economic constraints.

Further analysis confirms that CO2 intensity strongly depends on passenger load factors and flight distance (Fig. 8). A least-squares linear regression with load factor and distance as predictors shows that a full flight (load factor 100%) covering 10,000 km emits, on average, 57 g CO2 per RPK. This almost doubles to 109 g CO2 per RPK for a half full flight (load factor 0.5) or increases to 83 g CO2 per RPK for a reduced flight distance of 1000 km at full capacity. However, there is considerable variation around this average (Fig. 8) likely highlighting the importance of aircraft models. Neglecting possible changes in passenger load, if every flight’s intensity was capped at this average (the medium cap model), increasing efficiency for approximately the lower half of flights would save 8.6% in emissions (or 50 Mt CO₂). A low cap model, allowing average intensities (from the medium cap model) and up to 33% higher, would only affect the most inefficient flights, consequently saving only 1.1% of emissions. A high cap model, however, which requires every flight to be at least 33% more efficient than the average (of the medium cap model), effectively requiring the highest industry standards, would save 34.6% of emissions or 200 Mt CO₂. These scenarios are more realistic compared to those discussed around Fig. 7 as they acknowledge constraints many airlines face when operating.

Efficiency model

The comparison of commercial passenger air transport efficiencies requires a comparable indicator. CO2 intensity, i.e. Emissions per revenue passenger kilometer (g CO2 per RPK) can be calculated for aircraft, airports, and city pairs. This indicator is directly proportional to fuel use per revenue passenger kilometer (kg fuel per RPK). It is influenced by many factors, including the aircraft design (airframe, engine type, winglets), operational aspects (distance, speed, flight route, flight altitude, weather, detours, holding patterns, green flying techniques), as well as on-the-ground conditions (taxiing, ground power supply). Energy use per passenger also depends on aircraft layout (seat numbers), load factors, and co-loaded cargo. Data is limited to aircraft with 30 seats and more, i.e., private aircraft and business jets are not part of the analysis. Data allows us to calculate average load factors for each city pair, from which global load factors and fuel use can be derived.

To factor these aspects into the calculation of emissions per RPK, an efficiency model is used that considers distance, aircraft type, and payload (passenger and cargo weight). 2023 data for the efficiency model is derived from:

1)

T100I (AirlineData): flight-specific load factors for flights to and from the USA and Canada, annual means.

2)

ICAO TFS (Traffic by Flight Stage): similar to T100I with global coverage, though not for all airlines.

3)

IATA WATS (World Air Transport Statistics): annually averaged, airline-specific load factors (i.e., not disaggregated by city pair or aircraft type), further split into international and domestic services, for about 219 airlines.

4)

FlightGlobal: similar to IATA WATS, with airline-level data (annual mean load factors) for 178 airlines.

Data consequently has three levels of granularity for load factors:

Level 1: Airline average over one year (52% of all flights).

Level 2: Airline–city pair average over one year (12.4%).

Level 3: Airline–aircraft–city pair average over one year (15.2%).

T100I and ICAO TFS provide level 3 data. From these, level 2 and level 1 averages can be derived by averaging revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) and available seat kilometers (ASK) across aircraft serving a given city pair (level 2) and additionally across all city pairs (level 1, ICAO TFS only). By contrast, IATA WATS and FlightGlobal only provide level 1 data.

For each individual flight, the highest level of load factor is sought, following a fallback cascade across the data sources. When IATA WATS is established as the best data source, the corresponding value for either domestic or international flights is used. As a last fallback, a global load factor over all airlines is calculated for three distance categories: short-haul (≤1500 km), medium-haul (1501−3500 km) and long haul (>3500 km). This load factor is used when no other load factor (level 1–3) can be found.

The induced error can be calculated for using global means instead of level 3 values. When bootstrapping 100,000 samples, the per-flight absolute error mean is 0.0406, and the median is 0.0145. The bootstrapped 95% CI for the absolute error mean is [0.0389, 0.0423]. This corresponds to a relative error of 5.38% with a 95% CI of [5.15%, 5.62%]. Notably, this error affects 20.4% of the load factor, as a higher-level granularity for load factors is available for 79.6% of flights.

Total fuel use is a function of total load and aircraft-specific performance data. Seat-classes are weighted by multiplying average per-passenger emissions with a seat-class factor based on IATA’s cabin class method21. This method considers the number of seats per class in a given aircraft configuration. The formula for this calculation is provided in (Eq. (1)); the passenger share of fuel use in (Eq. (2)), also involving data from Flight Global, which provides passenger data. Fuel use is transformed into CO₂ in (Eq. (3)).

More specifically, fuel consumption is calculated for each individual flight, accounting for the specific aircraft model, cabin layout, and passenger/cargo load factors. Fuel consumption is derived from a physical aircraft performance model, which calculates fuel consumption for a given aircraft model, considering flight distance and takeoff weight. The total fuel consumption of the flight is then broken down into fuel use per passenger and converted to CO2 emissions per passenger. All subsequent analyses are based on these individual-flight emission characteristics, allowing for more nuanced results than calculations based on airline-average or city pair-average load factors or performance data.

Allocation of total fuel burn of a given flight to individual passengers and subsequent conversion to CO2 emissions follows these steps:

(a) Calculation of fuel use for payload in ton kilometres (tkm)

$${fuel\; per\; tkm}=({total}\, {fuel})/({flight}\, {distance}\times {payload})$$

(1)

(b) Calculation of fuel per passenger (pax)

$${{{\rm{fuel}}}}\, {{{\rm{per}}}}\, {{{\rm{pax}}}} = \; {{{\rm{fuel}}}}\, {{{\rm{per}}}}\, {{{\rm{tkm}}}}\times {{{\rm{distance}}}}\times 100\, {{\rm{kg}}} \\ \times {{{\rm{freight}}}}\, {{{\rm{correction}}}}\, {{{\rm{freight}}}}\, {{{\rm{correction}}}}=\frac{{m}_{{{\rm{pax}}}}+0.5\times {m}_{{{\rm{cargo}}}}}{{m}_{{{\rm{pax}}}}+{m}_{{{\rm{cargo}}}}}$$

(2)

Here, passenger emissions and 50% of the emissions from freight transport are allocated to passengers, assuming a passenger (including baggage) weighs 100 kg39.

(c) Calculation of CO₂ per Passenger (pax)

$${{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2} \; {{{\rm{per}}}}\; {{{\rm{pax}}}}={{{\rm{fuel}}}}\; {{{\rm{per}}}}\; {{{\rm{pax}}}}\times 3.16$$

(3)

The resulting per-passenger emission intensity enables comparisons of flight efficiency. Figure 8 illustrates the inherent dependence of emission intensity on flight distance, with longer flights generally exhibiting lower emission intensities. This is because takeoff and ascent to cruising altitude - the most fuel-intensive phase of a flight - account for a larger proportion of total fuel burn on short-haul routes.

These data are used to assess all flights; where no data for a specific flight is available, global mean values are used for three distance classes (short-/medium-/long-haul). Flight distances are based on great circle distances, which are converted to flown distances by using ICAO’s correction factor: +50 km for flights up to 550 km, + 100 km for flights between 550 and 5500 km, and +125 km for flights >5500 km40. Data is available for 26,155 city pairs and 61,607 ‘flights’, with one flight being defined as a unique combination of departure airport, arrival airport, airline, and aircraft type. Non-operational code-sharing flights have been removed from the dataset; only the airline carrying out the flight is considered. A weakness of the dataset is that it includes mostly scheduled flights.

Validation checks

The dataset comprises 27,451,887 flights in 2023, carrying a total of 3,554,769,475 passengers over a distance of 6,813,991,167,301 RPK, and causing emissions of 577,968,750 t CO2. This is less than the 35.3 million flights, 4.319 billion passengers, 8232 billion RPK, and the 530 Mt CO₂ reported through the CORSIA Central Registry (said to cover 99% of total 2023 emissions on scheduled services reported for 2023 by ICAO41)42,43. Our data consequently covers 83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO data. A potential explanation is that there are data gaps related to the reporting of charter operators.

Consistency analysis of our database shows that the number of seats in aircraft is always higher than the number of passengers. Airline load factor comparison with three airlines, Ryanair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines, for which data is publicly available, also suggests that variation is within 10%. For example, in 2023, Ryanair reported a 93% load factor, whilst the model suggests 93.6%; Lufthansa reported 82%, whilst the dataset is 78.9%; and American Airlines reported 83.5%, whilst the model suggests 81%. It is difficult to validate emission intensities for airlines due to variable operating conditions and inconsistent reporting standards. Annual reports may not include RPK numbers, refer to financial years rather than calendar years, combine data on operational fuel use for cargo and passengers, combine different accounting scopes, deduct sustainable aviation fuel emission “savings”, or calculate CO₂e rather than CO₂. Airlines also have subsidiaries that may have been included/excluded in the accounting. However, the communication teams of all airlines mentioned in this article (LATAM, Ryanair, EasyJet, Qatar Airways, Emirates, China Southern, British Airways, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air Algérie) were provided with the data sources used in our analysis, as well as the airline-specific emission efficiencies (g CO2 per RPK) calculated, and were asked to comment. LATAM responded by saying that it does not wish to comment. EasyJet provided a link to their own calculations, suggesting slightly lower emission efficiencies (66.64 g CO2 per RPK) than calculated using our model (74.2 CO2 per RPK).

Emission attribution

Emissions are assessed at different scales of analysis, for airports, airlines, or countries. For airports, emissions are calculated by aggregating half the emissions from all incoming and outgoing flights. This ensures that half of the emissions for each city pair are attributed to the respective departure and arrival airports. The approach addresses that fuel use can vary between incoming and outgoing flights due to differences in flight paths or weather. Airline emissions consider all emissions from flights operated by an airline, with intensities calculated by dividing the total amount of CO2 by the number of RPK. Country emissions are calculated by aggregating emissions from all airports within national borders.

Efficiency calculations

The efficiency of air transport is calculated for aircraft, airlines, airports, city pairs, and countries, using the same indicator (g CO2 per RPK). Airport emissions are calculated for 3218 airports by summing up the CO2 for all departures and arrivals from/at each airport, and dividing the value by two to assign half the emissions from every flight to this airport. In an identical approach, half of all RPKs for every departure and arrival are calculated. The mean CO2 intensity (g CO2 per RPK) is then derived by dividing an airport’s CO2 emissions by its RPK. Aircraft comparisons are based on city pairs, for which data is available for all aspects of the flight. For these, fuel consumption per RPK can be calculated for each aircraft based on fuel use, emissions, and RPK. On this basis, aircraft can be ranked by observed efficiency.

Optimum efficiencies on city pairs can be calculated for all routes served by more than one flight configuration (13,666 out of 26,156 city pairs, or 52.2%). Avoided CO₂ can be determined by dividing the most efficient average (g CO2 per RPK) by the average efficiency on the city pair, multiplied with CO₂ emissions on this city pair. Values can then be aggregated for all city pairs, and total emission be compared to current emissions in the system. This can be expressed as (Eq. (4)):

Ebest = Best (minimum) efficiency for a given route (e.g., fuel per tkm)

Ei = Efficiency of airline i on the same route

CO2i = Current CO₂ emissions of airline i

CO2best,i = CO₂ emissions at best efficiency for airline i

Then, the formula for CO₂ emissions at the best efficiency is:

$${{{\rm{C}}}}{{{\rm{O}}}}_{2,{{{\rm{best}}}},{{{\rm{i}}}}}=\left(\frac{{E}_{{{\rm{best}}}}}{{E}_{i}}\right)\times {{\rm{C}}}{{{\rm{O}}}}_{2,{{\rm{i}}}}$$

(4)

If there are multiple airlines on a city‑pair, the total emissions improvement can be calculated as (Eq. (5)):

$${{{\rm{Total}}}}\, {{{\rm{CO}}}}_{2}\, {{{\rm{reduction}}}}=1-\frac{\sum {{{\rm{r}}}}{{CO}}_{2,{{{\rm{best}}}},{{{\rm{i}}}}}}{\sum {{{\rm{r}}}}{{CO}}_{2,{{{\rm{i}}}}}}$$

(5)

Assuming that only the most efficient aircraft were operated on all city pairs served by more than one carrier, emissions would be 10.66% lower than current emissions (517 Mt CO₂, rather than 578 Mt CO₂). This is the lower theoretical threshold for emission reductions based on observed operational efficiency.

Theoretical maximum efficiency. There are three ways to increase the efficiency of air transport: using only the most efficient aircraft, switching to one flight class (economy); and increasing load factors. The maximum efficiency for the year 2023 can be calculated in three steps.

Step 1: Global fleet of most efficient aircraft models. The effect of replacing the entire 2023 fleet with the two most efficient models - the Boeing 787-9 (55.4 g CO₂ per RPK) and the Airbus A321neo (61.4 g CO₂ per RPK) would lead to emission reductions in the range of 26.6% (all Airbus) to 33.7% (all Boeing), compared to the current fleet average of 83.6 g CO₂ per RPK, with (Eq. (6)):

Iavg = average CO₂ intensity (gCO₂ per RPK)

Iopt = CO₂ intensity of the Boeing 787‑9 (gCO₂ per RPK)

S = relative savings

$$S=1-\frac{{I}_{{{\rm{opt}}}}}{{I}_{{{\rm{avg}}}}}$$

(6)

Step 2: Economy class only configuration. To determine the difference between an air transport system consisting only very efficient aircraft models, we calculate frequency weighted averages for average seat numbers in economy, business, and first class for the five configurations of the most efficient aircraft models (A350-1000; A350-900; Boeing 787-1000; Boeing 787-800; and Boeing 787-900). As Table 1 illustrates, first class seating is uncommon in these aircraft, partially explaining their efficiency.

The difference in space use between all-economy vs. business and first class aircraft layout can be calculated using current economy to business to first ratios, with each first class seat equalling 5 economy seats, and every business class seat 4 economy class seats21. The percentage increase in seat numbers can be calculated based on data from Official Airline Guide (OAG) and FleetsAnalyzer (FA) for models A350 and B787, which represent the range of most efficient aircraft. In contrast to FA, OAG does not distinguish economy and economy-premium class; this might explain some of the difference in observed maximum seat numbers. OAG data refers to the 2023 flight schedule that lists the actual cabin layout for every flight; FA data considers actual aircraft configurations in fleets of various airlines (2023 data).

Table 1 shows the observed maximum seat number for the different models for both databases, and the average seat numbers for each model. The theoretical maximum number of seats can be calculated based on the following formula (Eq. (7)):

$${S}_{\max }={S}_{{{\rm{eco}}}}+1.5\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{prem.eco}}}}+4\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{bus}}}}+5\cdot {S}_{{{\rm{first}}}}$$

(7)

where S is the number of seats per class, and the factors are the IATA seat class factors, and economy (eco), premium-economy (prem.eco), business (bus) and first (first).

The increase in seat numbers in an all-economy layout is then determined based on an “assumed maximum”, representing either the calculated theoretical maximum seat number or the certified maximum seat number (whichever is lower). Certified maximums refer to type certification that are based on emergency evacuation demands13. This means that the number of seats in the Airbus A350-1000 is capped at 440, and at 420 seats for Boeing 787-1000 and 787-900.

Results suggest that an all-economy layout would allow airlines to carry 26% to 57% more passengers, which is equivalent to the theoretical reduction in fuel use of an all-economy layout.

Step 3: 95% load factor. Limiting capacity growth in global air transport will lead to higher load factors. In particular low-cost carriers have reported load factors of up to 94%44. Here we assume a hypothetical maximum load factor of 95% that would reflect on an air transport system with considerably reduced capacity25. Given the current load factor of 78.9%, aircraft could carry 16.1% more passengers if available capacity was utilized at 95%.

Fuel penalty. Calculations in Step 2 and 3 do not consider that optimization for efficiency will incur a fuel penalty due to the additional weight carried. Analysis for the two aircraft models characterizing the range of layout gains, i.e., A350-1000 and Boeing 787-800 (26.1–56.7% more seats), suggests that this fuel penalty is small. This is illustrated in Fig. 9 for the A350-1000: depending on distance, fuel consumption increases by 5.8% to 13.9%, implying a small fuel-penalty even in comparison of a near-empty (20% load factor) to a close to full (80% load factor) aircraft. We conclude that increasing seat numbers or load factor will marginally increase fuel use. The potential reduction in fuel consumption in an optimized air transport system is thus in the range of −55% to −75%, not considering the fuel penalty.

CO2 intensity cap model

A CO2 intensity cap model illustrates how much emissions from global aviation would fall if flights were required to operate at a mandated maximum CO2 intensity. However, considering such a cap as constant is largely unrealistic as it is strongly dependent on flight distance and load factors. Ignoring changes to load factors or flight distance, we isolate the variation independent of those. Other scenarios investigate increasing load factors (in exchange for fewer aircraft, see above).

The CO2 intensity c is therefore modelled as a function of load factor l and flight distance d, linear in both predictors (Eq. (8)):

$$c\,=\,\frac{a}{l\,+\,{l}_{0}}\,+\,\frac{b}{d\,+\,{d}_{0}}$$

(8)

Inverse proportionality is assumed as increasing load decreases the intensity, so does a longer flight (larger aircraft, less resistance at higher altitude, smaller contribution of fuel-intensive takeoff). This model is fit via least-squares, estimating the constants to (rounded) a = 54 g CO2 per RPK, b = 35,000 g CO2 per pax, d0 = 180 km. The offset in load factor l0 is manually set to 0.01 to prevent intensities going to infinity for very low load factors which is not well constrained with the data given how few flights operate that empty. This model is considered to be the medium cap model representing an average intensity. The low clow and high cap model chigh are defined as clow = 4c/3, chigh = 2c/3, representing 33.3% lower/higher efficiency, respectively. Theoretically, for very long flight distances fuel consumption increases due to the additional weight of large amounts of fuel. This motivates to add a term proportional to distance d, which however, does not yield a positive proportionality constant, contradicting this theory with data. In that sense, higher intensities for very long flight distances are not supported with the data here.

Limitations

Findings are characterized by the following limitations: Our data comprises only a share of global commercial passenger air transport (83% of RPK and 82% of passengers in comparison to ICAO42,43). It is unclear how the difference affects the representativeness of our findings for commercial passenger air transport. We also acknowledge that ICAO’s distance correction is crude, as the ratio of actual flight distance to great-circle distance depends on multiple factors such as weather, airspace restrictions, or airport congestion. Load factors are calculated based on three levels of granularity, and a fallback option that is the global average. Analysis suggests that the error affects in particular small, remote, or politically isolated territories (Nauru, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, Bhutan, or Greenland), countries where reporting is more limited (China, Russian Federation, India), or specific airlines and airline subsidiaries (e.g., Sichuan Airlines, TUI Airways Ltd., Interglobe Aviation Ltd.). Last, our proposed strategies to increase efficiencies in global aviation will in practice be met with various economic and political challenges. Airlines operate within economic constraints and a business environment shaped by subsidies, limited ambition for climate change mitigation, and expectations of continued growth. Efforts to enhance air transport efficiency will have to be addressed within this multifaceted context.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-03069-4/MediaObjects/43247_2025_3069_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-07 22:58:36.668401

The postponement follows a firm refusal by Ford CEO Jim Farley to appear, creating an unexpected stalemate with Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who chairs the Commerce Committee. The hearing, which would have marked the first joint appearance of these leaders before Congress since the 2008 financial crisis, was scheduled for January 14th but is now seeking a new date.

The clash stems from two core objections by Ford. First, the company cited a significant scheduling conflict, as January 14th is the opening media day for the Detroit Auto Show, a cornerstone industry event. Second, and more critically, Ford protested the witness list. While CEOs Jim Farley, Mary Barra of GM, and Antonio Filosa of Stellantis received invitations, Tesla planned to send its vice president of vehicle engineering, Lars Moravy, not CEO Elon Musk. Ford’s legal counsel argued this created an unfair imbalance, stating that if a vice president was suitable for one automaker, others should have the same option. General Motors aligned with this stance, with a spokesperson confirming Barra would attend only “assuming all invited CEOs attend as well.”

Senator Cruz publicly attributed the delay solely to Farley’s reluctance, offering a sharp critique. “Well, for whatever reason, it appears Jim Farley was terrified of testifying before Congress,” Cruz stated. He speculated that Farley’s fear might stem from massive financial losses on the electric F-150 Lightning or past controversies over EV tax credits. Cruz confirmed he deliberately excluded Elon Musk from the invite, telling Politico, “Because if Elon is a witness at a hearing, the Democrats will turn it into a circus,” aiming to keep the focus on affordability. He has not ruled out using a subpoena to compel testimony.

Ford pushed back against the characterization. Spokesperson Dave Tovar reiterated the company’s commitment to constructive dialogue, stating they “look forward to continuing to work with leaders such as Senator Cruz.” The automaker had previously suggested holding the meeting in Detroit to accommodate the auto show schedule. A senate committee spokesperson confirmed that efforts are ongoing, stating that the panel is “coordinating with the leaders of the auto industry to reschedule this hearing.” The intended discussion focuses on how regulations affect consumer costs and the upcoming surface transportation bill, a crucial component of national infrastructure policy.",https://gmauthority.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/US-Capitol.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 11:01:08.910630

PADUCAH, Ky., Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Under a $900 million contract, General Matter will fuel America's advanced reactors with American enriched uranium.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded General Matter a $900 million Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to build and operate High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) enrichment capacity for advanced U.S. commercial and government nuclear fuel needs.

Under the ten-year, milestone-based contract, General Matter will build domestic HALEU enrichment capacity for the advanced reactors that will fuel the next generation of American nuclear power.

This contract marks a critical milestone in reestablishing domestic enrichment capacity. Currently, our nation cannot make its own fuel to power advanced nuclear reactors: only Russia and China make the commercial-scale HALEU that advanced nuclear reactors need, putting America's energy and national security at risk.

Rebuilding U.S. domestic enrichment capacity will reduce reliance on foreign providers, strengthen the nation's nuclear industrial base, and lower energy costs for utilities and consumers.

""This investment in American technology and operations for scalable, clean nuclear power is a defining moment for American energy security and dominance,"" said Scott Nolan, CEO of General Matter. ""We look forward to working with our partners at the Department of Energy to deliver on this urgent national need.""

General Matter will fulfill this contract through its commercial enrichment facility at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. This site once powered America's atomic energy program and is now being reindustrialized under a multi-decade lease agreement with the Department of Energy, announced in August, to restore enrichment operations on U.S. soil.

Equipment for Paducah operations will be manufactured at General Matter's facilities in California and at a larger project outside the state.

""President Trump is catalyzing a resurgence in the nation's nuclear energy sector to strengthen American security and prosperity,"" said Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. ""Today's awards show that this Administration is committed to restoring a secure domestic nuclear fuel supply chain capable of producing the nuclear fuels needed to power the reactors of today and the advanced reactors of tomorrow.""

""General Matter is making the largest investment ever in Western Kentucky with nearly $1.5 billion that will create 140 new jobs for our people, and I am thrilled to see this project move forward with today's news,"" said Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. ""Congratulations to the entire General Matter team, Paducah and our commonwealth as we celebrate this important milestone together."" Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.

""The Paducah community has long held a critical role in advancing U.S. national security and is poised, yet again, to be a national leader in energy production. On behalf of the community, I spoke directly with U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright about the importance of Paducah and future activities at the site. Expanding domestic nuclear energy will support jobs in the area and strengthen our nation's energy independence,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell, who helped secure this federal funding to help expand U.S. production of enriched uranium.

""Paducah has a proud nuclear history, and this project will build upon that legacy,"" shared Senator Rand Paul. ""This facility will bring energy abundance, job creation, and long-term economic growth to the Commonwealth. I commend General Matter for this investment as they work to unleash American energy and look forward to seeing the benefits this contract will bring to Kentucky and the broader region.""

""This announcement is a major win for Kentucky and our nation's energy future,"" said Congressman James Comer. ""Reestablishing nuclear fuel enrichment at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant will bring over $1 billion in private investment, create high-quality jobs, and restore a site vital to America's energy and national security. I'm proud to support this project, which will strengthen our local economy, lower energy costs, and establish Paducah as a leader in the next generation of reliable nuclear power. I will continue fighting in Washington to keep the Paducah area at the forefront of nuclear innovation.""

The Paducah facility will supply a significant portion of the nation's advanced nuclear fuel needs, saving U.S. utilities hundreds of millions of dollars annually and providing a secure, domestic alternative to foreign uranium sources.

""Nothing gets made without fuel,"" Nolan added. ""Our mission is to restore our country's ability to make nuclear fuel, to meet this century's challenges and power our national ambitions.""

The DOE’s roadmap and pending legislation like the Fusion Workforce Act offer a historic chance to start building fusion’s workforce.","Recent breakthroughs at U.S. fusion labs, along with new public-private partnerships, are bringing us closer than ever to realizing fusion energy’s limitless potential. With the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) new Office of Fusion, the Genesis Mission executive order, Fusion Science and Technology Roadmap, and public and private investment, fusion is officially on the national agenda. America is standing on the cusp of a trillion-dollar future.

However, the U.S. has a major gap to fill in fusion research and development (R&D), and workforce development. Public investment lags behind rival nations, slowing progress toward commercialization and leaving a shortage of skilled workers to replace aging talent. As a result, the industry must compete aggressively with other sectors to recruit and reskill science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professionals from adjacent fields.

COMMENTARY

The DOE’s roadmap outlines a Build–Innovate–Grow strategy to close materials gaps, accelerate research using artificial intelligence ( AI), and grow the U.S. fusion ecosystem through manufacturing hubs and workforce development. But as was emphasized at the SCSP AI + Fusion Summit and the Fusion Industry Association’s U.S. Fusion Forum, a shortage of qualified talent could slow progress just as speed is needed most.

Fusion’s Workforce Moment

At the SCSP Summit, Representative Don Beyer (D-Virginia) described fusion as “a technology with the potential to eliminate energy‑driven conflict and reduce global poverty,” contingent on cultivating “a workforce capable of building and operating this revolution.” Government and industry leaders warn that talent must scale substantially to meet DOE’s aims for commercial fusion by the mid‑2030s.

Microsoft has agreed to purchase fusion power, Google is ramping up fusion investment, and dozens of pilot plants are nearing construction. Yet much of the focus remains on science and hardware, not on creating the human infrastructure to sustain it.

Building, operating, and maintaining fusion power plants will require a massive talent expansion. Ignition Research, CleanTech Alliance, and Peak Nano estimate that commercial fusion could create more than one million jobs by 2050, drawing from analog industries like nuclear and renewables. More conservative estimates are in the 400,000-800,000 range, with Realta Fusion placing its estimate at 411,000 jobs.

National lab leaders at the U.S. Fusion Forum highlighted the urgency of workforce expansion, noting that at least 28,000 new skilled workers are needed within the next decade to meet commercialization targets.

As DOE Under Secretary Darío Gil stated, “For the first time, DOE, industry, and our national labs are aligned around a shared purpose, accelerating fusion commercialization through infrastructure, AI, and workforce development.” Washington State University’s nuclear reactor training center and Tri‑Cities apprenticeship program were cited as examples of how universities, labs, and trade schools can collaborate. Speakers agreed this model must scale dramatically.

From the Lab to the Classroom

Commercial fusion will require wide-ranging, multidisciplinary roles bridging the academic and the practical. Companies need electricians, welders, machinists, software engineers, and materials scientists as much as plasma physicists. Realta Fusion predicts that by 2050, we’ll need 198,000 jobs in manufacturing and construction, 193,000 in operations and maintenance, and 20,000 in R&D. Fusion is already creating skilled manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin, which hosts three of the nation’s 25 fusion companies (SHINE, Realta, and Type One Energy).

But the U.S. lacks a coordinated national strategy to produce these skilled workers. Most fusion‑related programs remain concentrated in advanced science rather than technical training, creating a gap between research and operations. Leaders across both October events called for STEM curriculum expansion, apprenticeship funding, and national certification standards to ensure graduates emerge “fusion‑ready.” It also was a topic discussed at POWER’s Experience POWER event last October.

Closing the Skills Gap with STEM

A National Science Foundation report outlines key fusion workforce obstacles: worker shortages, retention issues, and insufficient academic infrastructure for applied STEM education or fusion training. Meanwhile, China is producing nearly 10 times more PhDs in fusion‑related fields than the U.S., and is aggressively building fusion facilities. China threatens to overtake the U.S. as a research superpower across science funding, output, and talent.

This underscores the need for early STEM engagement connecting fundamental science with practical skills. Students should see clear routes “from classroom to control room.”

Our challenge isn’t just to excite the next generation about fusion’s foundational science and power potential, but to embed engineering, programming, and manufacturing into curricula from K-12 on. We must also bring in members of underrepresented communities, as Realta has done with its sponsorship of science camps for middle school girls and nonbinary children.

Partnering to Build the Fusion Pipeline

Creating a fusion-ready workforce demands strong public-private partnerships like the DOE’s Fusion Innovation Research Engine (FIRE) program, which connects public research to industry needs. The STEM Education and Skilled Technical Workforce for Fusion Act introduced in Congress would empower NSF and DOE to fund workforce programs and technical training.

Leading fusion companies, startups, national labs, and government must align with universities, community colleges, and trade schools on workforce needs and launch a multi-tiered education pipeline to get us there.

That means:

Expanding education programs blending STEM and hands‑on experience.

Scaling technical apprenticeships, fellowships, and internships to deliver job‑ready talent.

Creating national “fusion‑ready” credentials and accelerated pathways for STEM workers from adjacent fields, legacy energy sectors, and overseas.

Establishing regional workforce hubs tying education to manufacturing growth.

Beyond education, the industry should place greater focus on retaining existing talent. We need an adaptable workforce for AI, data science, robotics, and materials innovation, which underpin modern energy systems. As the fusion industry matures, robust STEM education and interdisciplinary learning will be non-negotiable.

A Workforce to Power Our Future

Fusion promises to power our energy-hungry future and create meaningful, long‑term careers for American workers. These jobs won’t be isolated in elite research hubs; they’ll come to every rural community and manufacturing town from coast to coast, reinvigorating the middle class while advancing U.S. science and energy leadership.

But without a coordinated national effort to develop fusion talent, we risk losing out. The DOE’s roadmap and pending legislation like the Fusion Workforce Act offer a historic chance to start building fusion’s workforce. If we invest now, fusion won’t just power AI and the grid. It will power careers, communities, and America’s enduring technological leadership.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/preamplifier-at-the-national-ignition-facility-lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:13:48.111604

Even as recent federal actions have attempted to weaken or eliminate clean vehicle standards, states across the country are taking actions to support clean, affordable transportation – actions that cut pollution and save people money. EDF’s new U.S. Electric Vehicle State Policy Landscape Report provides a comprehensive assessment of how all 50 states and the District of Columbia are shaping the next generation of clean, affordable vehicles. The results are unmistakable: every state has taken steps to advance electric vehicles, and many are deploying innovative policies that deliver cleaner air, lower costs and create economic opportunity.

The report evaluates 16 distinct policy types across seven categories – from financial incentives to charging infrastructure to public fleet electrification. This nationwide assessment reveals both remarkable breadth and significant depth: many of the strongest EV policy portfolios span diverse states across the country like Arizona (14), Illinois (13), Alabama (12) and Colorado (13).

States are powering the U.S. electric vehicle transition – even amid federal uncertainty Share on X

States are making EVs more affordable

Direct financial incentives remain one of the most effective ways to put more drivers behind the wheel of a clean light-, medium-, or heavy-duty vehicle, and states are making that possible:

Massachusetts provides $3,500-$6,000 in rebates for battery-electric vehicles and $1,500 for plug-in hybrids, with purchase price caps to ensure affordability.

Colorado offers a rebate of up to $9,000 for buying or leasing a new EV, and up to $6,000 for a used EV to income-qualified residents who retire a higher-emitting vehicle.

California offers point-of-sale vouchers to eligible fleets to lower the cost of qualified electric and hybrid trucks and buses. Available on a first-come, first-served basis, vouchers range from $7,500 to $330,000 by vehicle type and weight.

The Texas Volkswagen Environmental Mitigation Program funds the replacement or repowering of diesel vehicles and equipment with all-electric models. Eligible projects span trucks, buses, port and airport equipment, forklifts and charging infrastructure, with at least 51% of operations required in designated priority areas.

These incentives make clean transportation an even more affordable option for households and companies.

Charging infrastructure is expanding rapidly

States are also dramatically expanding EV charging access – a foundational step for widespread adoption:

Delaware offers rebates of up to $4,000 per port at multi-unit dwellings and $3,000 for workplaces and public sites.

Georgia provides a 10% tax credit (up to $2,500) for publicly accessible charging installations.

New York has committed $885 million to support make-ready programs, offsetting infrastructure costs to make many sites ready for charger installation.

And all states and DC have adopted fast-charging corridor plans through the bipartisan National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, helping ensure EV drivers can travel long distances with confidence.

Public fleets are going electric

Many states are embracing EVs in transit fleets, school buses, and state agency vehicles, helping clean the air where people live, work and learn:

Connecticut stopped procuring diesel-fuel transit buses in 2024 and requires 100% light-duty EV procurement by 2030.

Maine has set a goal that 75% of new school buses be zero-emission by 2035.

Every five years, the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities will review the cost and availability of alternative fuels and, when it makes sense, shifts its fleet to cleaner options while teaming up with public and private partners to make those fuels easier for everyone to access.

These commitments accelerate deployment, lower public-sector fuel and maintenance costs and EV use across communities.

Innovation and collaboration are accelerating progress

Some of the most innovative developments involve emerging technologies and regional coordination:

Indiana and Purdue University are piloting a dynamic wireless charging roadway for heavy-duty trucks – the first of its kind in the U.S.

Dominion Energy created interactive grid-capacity maps in North Carolina and Virginia to help identify optimal locations for fast chargers.

Orlando Utilities Commission provides full-service fleet electrification planning for businesses and public agencies.

Multi-state coalitions across the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest are coordinating regional charging corridors and advancing medium- and heavy-duty electrification.

These forward-looking strategies further expand the benefits of clean, affordable solutions.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//EV-Report-2.avif,N,,2026-01-07 20:59:14.481305

ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Panamanian companies Sinolam LNG Terminal, S.A. and Sinolam Smarter Energy LNG Power Co. (together, ""Sinolam"") today announced the filing of a civil action in the Circuit Court for Arlington County, Virginia, against AES Corporation (NYSE: AES) and partners including, InterEnergy Holdings (UK) Limited, alleging a years-long scheme to unlawfully exclude Sinolam from Panama's rapidly growing liquefied natural gas-to-power market.

According to the complaint, AES and its partners conspired to dismantle Sinolam's LNG power generation and terminal projects in Panama. The lawsuit alleges the defendants used coercive tactics, misuse of confidential information, and improper influence over government regulators to eliminate competition and secure monopoly control over LNG importation, storage, regasification, and LNG-fueled power generation in Panama.

A Competitive LNG Project Allegedly Undermined

Sinolam alleges it lawfully secured regulatory approvals, power purchase agreements, and long-term customer commitments to develop a major LNG-fired power plant and a corresponding LNG terminal in Colón, Panama. These projects were designed to capitalize on Panama's emergence as the LNG hub for Central America following the expansion of the Panama Canal.

The complaint asserts AES, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, viewed Sinolam as a threat to be eliminated from the Panamanian market. Sinolam further alleges that, after Sinolam declined pressure to abandon its terminal project or submit to commercially unreasonable terms that would have made it dependent on AES's LNG infrastructure, AES shifted from negotiation to exclusion.

According to the complaint, senior AES executives directed critical strategy from its global corporate headquarters in Virginia, including efforts to delay Sinolam's permits, undermine its government approvals, and ultimately block the projects.

Alleged Role of InterEnergy and Misuse of Confidential Information

The lawsuit further alleges that InterEnergy entered the scheme after obtaining Sinolam's confidential business information under a non-disclosure agreement. Rather than investing in Sinolam's project, the complaint alleges InterEnergy used the confidential information to partner with AES in forming a new joint venture that displaced Sinolam and its customers from the market.

Through this partnership, AES and InterEnergy allegedly removed one of Sinolam's key customers from the market. The complaint claims this conduct rendered Sinolam's long-term contracts worthless and destroyed billions of dollars in expected economic value.

Alleged Government Manipulation and Market Exclusion

Sinolam alleges that Defendants leveraged political influence to obtain regulatory advantages such as expedited approvals for AES-aligned projects and the revocation of Sinolam's licenses. According to the complaint, these actions ultimately led to the permanent cancellation of Sinolam's power generation license by Panamanian regulators.

Sinolam further alleges the Panamanian government is a significant shareholder in AES's Panama-based subsidiary, AES Panama S.R.L. and that AES used its connections at the highest levels of the Panamanian government to pressure Sinolam over a period of many years and across successive administrations.

As a result, according to the lawsuit, AES now controls both major LNG-fueled power plants in Panama (one in partnership with InterEnergy) and the only operational LNG terminal in the country—effectively eliminating competition in Panama and exerting significant control over energy supply in Central America and the Caribbean, markets worth billions of dollars.

Claims and Relief Sought

The lawsuit asserts ten claims including tortious interference with contract and business expectancy, Virginia statutory civil conspiracy, and Virginia common-law conspiracy. Sinolam seeks compensatory damages in excess of $4 billion, along with other relief permitted by law.

""This case is about protecting competition and the rule of law,"" said Kenneth Zhang, Sinolam's CEO. ""Sinolam invested hundreds of millions of dollars, followed every legal requirement, and played by the rules. What we allege is a coordinated effort by powerful incumbents—backed by their cronies and government partners to shut down a competitor rather than compete on the merits, with the victims including not only Sinolam but the people of Panama and other countries who are now paying higher energy prices, and LNG suppliers in the United States and elsewhere, because AES and its partners, along with the assistance or authorization of the Panamanian government, want to control the market.""

Turning more to innovation is a solution, since so much of the engineering is still done in the state

But more people need to line up with policy goals, notably as elections will be held this year for all top elected officials

Michigan needs to confront risks to its $348 billion piece of the global automotive industry this year and move decisively toward keeping jobs, engineering and production in the state.

That message comes from Glenn Stevens, executive director of statewide industry advocacy group MichAuto that last month released a report he describes as a “call to action.”

This is “a critical time in the industry’s history,” Stevens told Bridge Michigan.

“We are at an inflection point like we’ve never seen before. We’ve got to be making changes and doing things differently to protect our signature industry and our economy as a whole.”

Report: Aging crisis to cause Michigan to lose out on economic boom

The concern is escalating as Michigan readies for its largest automotive celebration: The annual Detroit Auto Show, which returns to Detroit’s Huntington Place from January 17-25.

The auto industry accounts for about 20% of Michigan jobs and has a payroll of $83 billion.

The report warns Michigan must bolster its innovation economy or “be left behind.”

Over 2026, MichAuto will launch a roadmap for policy, economic development and talent attraction for the industry to thrive in Michigan, Stevens said.

That will come after a year when the auto industry reeled from waves of tariff changes, new fuel economy standards and more. Underlying it all were federal changes and market forces that prompted automakers to curtain their electric vehicle strategy.

Among them, Ford Motor Co. in December said it would take a $19 billion hit to shift its EV capacity to gas-powered vehicles, while adding new energy storage systems to its EV battery lineup.

Beyond that, southern US states are building a “battery belt” by actively recruiting automakers and suppliers, including those from Michigan. And the Chinese auto industry is advancing “at an astounding rate as it attempts to dominate the race for electrification,” the report says.

Combined, the report says, changes mean that Michigan cannot rest on its automotive legacy to maintain economic benefits, like employment and powering the state’s GDP.

Due to automation and the digital economy, Michigan needs to elevate innovation as a business goal that will create jobs and economic growth, Stevens said.

“We have to double down on the research and development part of the industry,” Stevens said, noting that Michigan is the top state for privately funded auto R&D research.

Innovation centers — including Michigan Central, funded by Ford and the state — should play a bigger role in the state’s economy as they develop, Stevens said. And they will support other industries, he added, such as the life sciences.

MichAuto also is advocating for Michigan to:

Prioritize workforce development, including Going PRO, a training program for which the Legislature recently reduced funding. Other goals include increasing the number of bachelor’s degrees awarded and creating a pipeline to replace aging workers

Improve the state’s business climate through tax and regulatory changes that make the state more competitive

Set long-term, sustainable economic development incentives. This has been controversial, notably after lawmakers in 2025 defunded the $2 billion Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve (SOAR) Fund

Add support for the industry transition. MichAuto says that helping companies and workers to adapt to new technologies, manufacturing processes, and skills will keep auto jobs in the state

The most recent “State of Automobility” report from MichAuto represents a switch from the group’s typical reports, which are released every 18 months or so, Stevens said, and contain data updates.

The warnings for the state and its auto industry come amid still more reports about Michigan’s prosperity slide, including alerts from the Detroit Regional Chamber that the state needs to sharpen its education system.

Business Leaders for Michigan in November released the 40-page “Michigan in a New Era” roadmap for state success under the next governor, who will be elected in fall 2026.

While the nation has grown, the report notes, Michigan:

Ranks 50th in household income growth over the past 25 years

Shows flat growth in high-wage professional jobs over 20 years, while they’ve grown 35% nationally

Fell from 16th to 44th in fourth grade reading over 30 years

Has one of the highest chronic school absenteeism rates in the nation

The next administration needs to focus on “changing what’s within our control … to change our state’s trajectory,” the Business Leaders for Michigan report said.

Also in November, University of Michigan economists warned that the state is poised to miss out on expected national job growth in 2026 due to its aging workforce and slim population growth.

When it comes to the auto industry, the report said, 2025’s tariffs ended up slightly positive for the sector despite fears that they could prompt job losses.

However, estimates of tariff effects “are highly uncertain both because tariff policy remains fluid and because it is inherently difficult to quantify the effects of such a major policy shift,” the U-M economists note.

So far, the economists expect light vehicle production to increase 2.7% — and prices on new vehicles to increase 6.6%, or about $3,100 per vehicle. According to Anderson Economic Group, a policy analyst company in East Lansing, the average new vehicle price in November was $49,814.

At the same time, the Detroit Three’s share of US light vehicle sales fell from 36.1% in 2023 to 34.2% in 2024. U-M’s economists say the two-decade market share slide of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis is expected to reverse in 2026 “as the new (federal) policy mix takes effect.”

The report's primary objective its to offset the harshest impacts of climate change by getting Delaware to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Carbon emissions from transportation decreased by 3.5% since 2005, but it is not predicted to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.
According to the Climate Action Plan, if the state continues EV incentives and tailpipe emissions standards, the state’s transportation sector can reduce carbon emissions by another 38 percent.
""One thing I will also note is that we can't get we can't EV our way out of transportation emissions,"" she said.","Delaware released its updated Climate Action Plan, a follow-up to the original one delivered in 2021.

It projects the state’s average temperature will increase two to four degrees by 2050, along with increased flooding along the coast and more precipitation in the coming decades.

The report's primary objective its to offset the harshest impacts of climate change by getting Delaware to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Between 2005 to 2021, Delaware's emissions decreased nearly 24 percent.

A net-zero goal means that any greenhouse gasses emitted by 2050 would be compensated for by taking emissions out of the atmosphere, according to DNRECs Division of Climate, Coastal, and Energy Department Administrator Susan Love.

In Delaware, she added, the top three polluting sectors are vehicles, industrial activities, and energy. She noted electricity is the largest contributor to Delaware's drop in carbon emissions since 2005, which the state's report attributes to power plants switching from coal to natural gas, along with new greenhouse gas standards and state initiatives.

On the state's current track, the report says it can decrease emissions 54% by 2050. The reductions come primarily from deployment of clean energy, reduced use of fossil fuels in buildings, and electrification of vehicles.

The report is meant to be adaptable to new technologies or state needs, Love said. Its predictions are not all inclusive, as the 54% emissions reduction projection does not factor in large-scale data center development planned in the state.

""We don't yet under understand the holistic impact of those data centers,"" Love said. The Climate Action Plan's modeling was mostly complete before the data center proposals came to Delaware.

According to Delaware’s report, transportation is the state’s largest emissions sector. Carbon emissions from transportation decreased by 3.5% since 2005, but it is not predicted to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

According to the Climate Action Plan, if the state continues EV incentives and tailpipe emissions standards, the state’s transportation sector can reduce carbon emissions by another 38 percent. Delaware has about 1 million registered vehicles. Between 2020 to 2025, the number of electric vehicles in the state increased approximately 12,000.

Three years ago, Delaware followed other states to adopt the Advanced Clean Car II program, which mandated that 82% of new cars and trucks imported to the state for sale be zero-emission vehicles by 2032. The mandate received pushback during public comment periods. And when when Gov. Matt Meyer assumed office last year, he announced plans to walk the rule back.

Delaware Secretary of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Gregory Patterson said the governor supports increased adoption of electric vehicles to meet Delaware's climate goals.

""I can tell you (Gov. Meyer) wants to do it through incentives and encouragement, and just helping people understand and building out the infrastructure,"" Patterson said.

Love said Delaware has strong incentive programs for electric vehicles and charging stations. But the federal roll backs on tailpipe emissions standards, fuel efficiency requirements, and consumer tax credits for EVs and chargers will make progress harder.

""One thing I will also note is that we can't get we can't EV our way out of transportation emissions,"" she said. ""A lot of work needs to be done to reduce the amount that we drive vehicles, good land use choices, mass transit, and making it easier for people to walk, bike, and roll to their destinations.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9bbabc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2030x1066+0+20/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F64%2Fa510928244ed92de8138c3af37d5%2Fclimate-action-plan-delaware-update.png,N,,2026-01-07 18:00:32.965687

Norwegian company Equinor and the Danish energy company Orsted are the latest to sue, with the limited liability companies for their projects filing civil suits late Tuesday. Connecticut and Rhode Island filed their own request on Monday seeking a preliminary injunction for a third project.

The administration announced Dec. 22 it was suspending leases for at least 90 days on the five offshore wind projects because of national security concerns. Its announcement did not reveal specifics about those concerns.

President Donald Trump has been hostile to renewable energy technologies that produce electricity cleanly, particularly offshore wind, and has instead prioritized oil, coal and natural gas that emit carbon pollution when burned.

Interior Department spokesperson Matt Middleton said Wednesday that Trump has directed the agency to manage public lands and waters for multiple uses, energy development, conservation and national defense. Middleton said the pause on large-scale offshore wind construction is a ""decisive step to protect America's security, prevent conflicts with military readiness and maritime operations and ensure responsible stewardship of our oceans.""

""We will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America's future,"" Middleton said in a statement.

Equinor owns the Empire Wind project and Orsted owns Sunrise Wind, major offshore wind farms in New York. Empire Wind LLC requested expedited consideration by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, saying the project faces ""likely termination"" if construction can't resume by Jan. 16. It said the order is disrupting a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with constrained availability, resulting in delay costs and causing an existential threat to the project financing.

Orsted is also asking a judge to vacate and set aside the order. The company says it has spent billions of dollars on Sunrise Wind, relying on validly issued permits from the federal government. It said in the filing that its team met weekly with the Coast Guard throughout 2025, and this week, with representatives from other agencies frequently attending, and no one raised national security concerns.

The administration's order paused the leases for these two projects, as well as for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.

WATCH: Economic fallout mounts as Trump halts near-finished wind power project

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it ""arbitrary and capricious"" and unconstitutional.

Orsted is building Revolution Wind with its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables. They have filed a complaint over the order on behalf of the venture.

The filing by Connecticut and Rhode Island seeks to allow work on Revolution Wind to continue.

""Every day this project is stalled costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars in inflated energy bills when families are in dire need of relief,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. ""Revolution Wind was vetted and approved, and the Trump administration has yet to disclose a shred of evidence to counter that thorough and careful process.""

Avangrid is a joint owner along with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners of the Vineyard Wind project. They have not indicated publicly whether they plan to join the rest of the developers in challenging the administration.

The Trump administration previously halted work on both Empire Wind and Revolution Wind. In April, it stopped construction on Empire Wind, accusing the Biden administration of rushing the permits, then allowed work to resume a month later. Equinor finalized the federal lease for Empire Wind in March 2017, early in Trump's first term. The final federal approval was in February 2024.

While developers pledged to protect local drinking water by drilling into deep aquifers and using closed-loop cooling, residents lamented the industrialization of pasture land that will soon house 2.7 gigawatts of on-site natural gas power generation.

The unanimous vote greenlights two massive, interconnected projects: Project Jade, an AI data center campus proposed by Crusoe Energy Systems, and the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub, a gas-fired generation facility from Tallgrass.

Raymon Williams, project director for Tallgrass, told the board that the energy infrastructure alone represents a $7 billion investment, with the total capital expenditure for the campus expected to exceed $50 billion. He characterized the development as a “bring your own power” model designed to be “very self-sufficient for our industrial facility” without straining existing municipal utilities.

However, the scale of the project drew sharp criticism from those living on the county’s southern edge. Michelle Jessica, a nearby ranch resident, expressed a sense of loss over the changing landscape.

“I have looked at pasture and cows for my entire life. To see this going in is tough,” Jessica said. “I don’t get to see the view. I get to see lights. I get to see dust. I get to see buildings.”

Resource protection was another focal point of the hearing. Thomas White, who lives near Terry Ranch Road, questioned the developer’s plan to draw industrial water from the deep Lance Formation aquifer.

“We live out there, we see what’s going on out there right now,” White said. “I worry about the groundwater. … They said they’re going to drill deeper. What if they punch a hole and that stuff underneath that water comes out and it contaminates the aquifer that we’re running the water from?”

In response, Matt Field, chief real estate officer for Crusoe, said the data centers would use a closed-loop cooling system to drastically reduce ongoing water consumption. He joined Williams in asserting the project is designed to avoid competing with residential drinking water sources or retail electric rates.

The project received backing from state leadership, with Drew Perkins, chief of staff for Gov. Mark Gordon, framing the development as a national security imperative.

“One of the things that [U.S. Interior] Secretary [Doug] Burgum shared with us was that this administration believes very, very strongly that if we do not win this … race for AI, that we are conceding leadership and even dominance to China,” Perkins said, describing the global pursuit of computing power as the “arms race of our generation.”

In their closing remarks, the commissioners acknowledged the difficulty of balancing private property rights with the concerns of longtime residents. Chair Gunnar Malm drew a parallel between the project and Wyoming’s historical role in defense.

“For Laramie County to play a major role in that like we did with the nuclear deterrence is very, very exciting for me as a community because I’m very, very proud of our military service and what we have accomplished here for generations in Laramie County,” Malm said. “This just continues that in a new forefront in the new age of fighting.”

With the site plans now approved, the project moves toward a construction phase that is expected to employ 5,000 workers at its peak, with the goal of energizing the first buildings by the second quarter of 2027.",https://oilcity.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/69495c9b53e041e7f4d41e53_Abilene-p-2000.webp,N,,2026-01-07 18:13:29.918722

** It seems fairly evident that electric vehicles—despite all of the goodness and benefits that its proponents promote—need incentives and support to gain traction.
When it comes to EVs, evidently the politicians in Norway, party notwithstanding, have been more supportive over a long period of time.","While Newton’s Laws of Motion aren’t completely aligned with this notion, once something gets a push forward, it starts going. If it gets more pushes along the way, not only does it keep going, but it might accelerate.

And it goes merrily along until there is something that impedes that forward motion.

Momentum is reduced, perhaps putting that object in a state where it is limping along, perhaps on its way to a complete stall.

Which brings me to Norway and Minnesota.

In 2025, of all the new vehicles registered in Norway, 95.9 percent were electrified. Most of those 179,549 vehicles—172,232—were full battery electric. There were also 2,751 plug-in hybrids.

ICE vehicles registered? 487.

This didn’t happen just because a whole lot of Norwegians decided they liked Teslas. (Although there were a whole lot of Norwegians who got Teslas in 2025, with the brand accounting for 20 percent of overall EV sales.)

Nor did this happen overnight.

In 1990 the Norwegian government temporarily lifted an import tax for EVs. (Norway doesn’t have a vehicle manufacturing infrastructure, so all vehicles are imported.) That tax relief was made permanent in 1996. What’s more, there was a reduction in annual road taxes paid for drivers of EVs in 1996, followed by a lifting of road tolls in 1997.

In 1999 free municipal parking was instituted for EVs.

Then there were reduced taxes on company cars in 2000 and an exemption from a 25% value-added tax in 2001.

2005 saw EVs getting access to bus lanes and 2009 free rides on car ferries.

Now on the one hand this was being done for what can be considered altruistic reasons, as in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

On the other, there is the fact that about 98% of Norway’s electricity is generated by hydropower, so they’ve got that in abundance.

None of these efforts to encourage the purchase of EVs are free, of course.

It is somewhat ironic that Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global is the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, with considerable monies coming from the country’s North Sea oil and gas reserves, so oil and gas are helping fund the EV transition.

The taxes cut on EVs are partially offset by tax increases on ICE vehicles.

Certainly the country is “losing” money through its efforts. But a country isn’t a business and while debt is not a good thing (though this is not an issue with Norway), governments ideally exist to serve its people, and if serving its people means reducing greenhouse gases through various efforts, then the taxes it isn’t imposing on EVs are worth the loss.

Norway, of course, is not the U.S.

Geographically, it is about the size of Montana.

Demographically, it has about as many people as Minnesota.

According to Drive Electric Minnesota, a public-private partnership established to increase the number of EVs in the Gopher State, as on July 1, 2025 there were 78,679 electrified vehicles on the road in the state: 55,123 EVs and 23,556 plug-in hybrids. That’s 1.03% of all the vehicles on the road in Minnesota.

And then there’s this from a Drive Electric Minnesota presentation made in late October 2025:

“EVs will become more expensive to operate in Minnesota

· State and federal purchase incentives eliminated

· Federal refueling infrastructure tax credit being phased out

· Higher annual EV fee in Minnesota

· Public charging tax beginning in 2027, on top of already sharply rising costs for public fast-charging, which is still an early market”

The state instituted a new EV and PHEV surcharge in 2025 for road maintenance. The state had been charging a flat $75 annually for EVs. It is now doubled.

Drive Electric Minnesota ran the numbers and found that if someone drives a gas-powered Toyota Corolla, there will be an average annual gas tax of $127. If that same someone were to buy a Tesla Model 3, the annual fee during the first year of ownership would be $221.

A Ford F-150 would have an average gas tax of $211. An F-150 Lightning $325.

Not exactly incentivizing the purchase of EVs.

This year Norway is going to roll back some of its EV incentives, like on the VAT incentive. Presumably the government figures the forward momentum in the market is such that people will continue to purchase EVs*. Remember: it has had a policy promoting the vehicles since 1990.

Meanwhile, in Minnesota there isn’t even a slow roll, yet its government is putting obstacles in the way.**

It seems fairly evident that electric vehicles—despite all of the goodness and benefits that its proponents promote—need incentives and support to gain traction. But those facilitators must not be momentary but sustained.

Norway, which has a parliamentary system, has had 11 different government cabinets (e.g., Labour, Center-Right, Red-Green) and six different prime ministers since 1990.

The U.S. has had seven different presidents since 1990 and during this period Republicans had control of both the House and the Senate six times, as have the Democrats.

When it comes to EVs, evidently the politicians in Norway, party notwithstanding, have been more supportive over a long period of time.

It is unlikely that there is going to be a whole lot of momentum gained for EVs in the U.S. unless or until there is sustained support.

///

*While this survey was conducted in the U.S. and before the federal tax credits went away, the J.D. Power U.S. Electric Vehicle Experience Ownership Study, released in February 2025, calculates that 94% of EV owners are “likely to consider purchasing another BEV for their first vehicle, a rate that is also matched by first-time buyers.” So if this translates at all to Norway, even if there is a reduction in the number of EV buyers as a result of the peeling back of some tax incentives, the number of EVs purchased there is likely to remain high going forward.

**I don’t want to pick on Minnesota, but given that Norway’s population is 5.5 million and Minnesota’s is 5.7 million, there is a certain equivalence there.

$3,798 home energy costs + 4,320 gas car fuel costs= $8,118 Solar and EV Power/Fuel Savings Calculated We spent $1,780 to power our house and three electric cars in 2025.
That’s $528 a month that we can now spend on anything other than power/fuel bills.
Since 2018, without rooftop solar, our power bills would have totaled $33,821.
Experts predict utility bills will continue to rise, making a fixed-cost solar system a powerful “hedge” against volatile fuel prices.","Is Renewable Energy Cheaper?

When we decided to install a rooftop solar system in 2018, it was based on the premise that adding rooftop solar would be a cheaper option than our electric system in the long run. That same thinking was part of the calculus to purchase electric vehicles. But is powering your home with renewable energy and driving cars powered by electricity cheaper? In a word, yes! It is saving us over $6,341 a year in fuel costs alone to power our home and cars using renewable energy rather than relying solely on fossil fuels.

Those who know me know I’m a bit of a spreadsheet nerd. So it seemed logical after we installed our solar panels to capture all of those kilowatt-hour data points into neat little columns and rows.

I’ve literally ‘got the receipts’ of our power bills going back to 2020, when the idea came to me to track our solar production, so the data is very complete.

When we sized our solar system, we tracked previous years’ worth of bills too, so we knew that our annual energy usage for our 2,100 square foot home was approximately 18,000 kilowatt hours (kWh). Even though we had just purchased a used EV and knew it would increase our usage, we decided to go forward with a system designed to offset about 18,000 kWh.

The cost to power a home that uses 18,000 kWh annually in Florida fluctuates based on several factors, such as hurricane surcharges or fuel price fluctuations. These fees roll on and off bills at various points in the year, so it’s hard to get a precise annual rate. For this example, I calculated it on actual data, dividing the kWh we used by the total paid to Duke Florida. Thus, it captures not just the price per kWh but all the fees, fines, and taxes per kWh too. In 2025, it worked out to $.211/kWh. The calculations below lay out the costs of powering a home with and without rooftop solar, and calculate fuel costs of driving a gas car versus an electric vehicle.

Estimate Cost To Power An Average Home In Florida

The average 2,100 square foot home in FL uses an estimated 18,000 kWh annually. Duke Power Florida charged us $.211 a kWh, including taxes and fees, in 2025.

Annual home energy costs $3,798. Average monthly costs $316.50

18,000 kWh X $.211 per kWh = $3,798

Estimate Cost To Fuel A Gas Car

A gas car that drives 12,000 miles a year, at an efficiency of 25 miles per gallon, uses approximately 480 gallons of gas (at $3/gallon) per year.

12,000 miles / 25 mpg = 480 gallons

The average annual gas energy costs $1,440. Average monthly costs $120.00

480 gallons X $3 per gallon = $1,440

Estimate Cost To Fuel An Electric Car

An EV that drives 12,000 miles a year, at an efficiency of 3.5 miles per kWh, uses approximately 3,428.6 kWh per year.

12,000 miles / 3.5 miles per kWh = 3,428kWh

Annual EV energy costs $723. Average monthly costs $60.00

3,428 kWh X $.211 per kWh = $723.31

Actual Cost To Power A Home And Three Electric Cars With Solar

We used 8,425 kWh of power in 2025. That includes the solar we generated minus the energy we used powering our home and three EVs.

Our annual home energy costs, including fuel costs for three cars, were $1,780. Average monthly cost $148.00

8,425 kWh X $.211 per kWh = $1,780

Estimate Costs To Fuel A Home Without Solar And With Three Gas Cars

Using the calculations above, the annual home energy costs to power a home without solar are $3,798. Add to that the average annual gas energy costs $1,440 per car (for three cars = 4,320), and you get $8,118. The average monthly cost is $677.

$3,798 home energy costs + 4,320 gas car fuel costs= $8,118

Solar and EV Power/Fuel Savings Calculated

We spent $1,780 to power our house and three electric cars in 2025. We saved $6,341 in 2025 by powering our home and cars with solar energy. That’s $528 a month that we can now spend on anything other than power/fuel bills.

$8,118 (no solar and 3 gas cars) – $1,777 (solar and 3 electric cars) = $6,341 annual savings

Clean, Affordable Energy

Living in the Sunshine State, it only makes sense that we are tapping into an infinite energy source (the sun). Every kilowatt hour we produce is local and the lowest cost option. In fact, 91% of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. Producing most of our energy needs on our roof helps us to buffer against the skyrocketing cost of fossil fuels.

Clean Energy is Cheap Energy

The initial investment was $14,000 for the solar panels because of federal tax credits that were available to install the solar panels. When we installed the solar panels in 2018, we projected we would recoup that initial investment in about eight years. However, the runaway costs of fossil fuels have made power bills so high that we actually broke even in 2023. So from that point on, all of the monthly savings truly are free and clear.

Since 2018, without rooftop solar, our power bills would have totaled $33,821. In that same time, with rooftop solar and driving electric, we’ve spent $10,094, plus the initial investment of $14,000. So in total, $24,094. Energy demand in the U.S. is rising along with utility bills. Experts predict utility bills will continue to rise, making a fixed-cost solar system a powerful “hedge” against volatile fuel prices. The cost of inaction and continued reliance on fossil fuels is far greater than taking control of proven renewable energy.

This dynamic fiscal environment brings both challenges and opportunities for the cardiovascular community, and the ACC is committed to championing its legislative priorities as lawmakers develop and vote on funding bills for 2026.

Chief among ACC's priorities is avoiding another disruption to vital Medicare telehealth services. Previously, Congress expanded access to Medicare telehealth services through legislation that ended the government shutdown in October 2025. But this extension was temporary, and these flexibilities will expire again if Congress does not act before Jan. 30.

The ACC is urging lawmakers to support the Creating Opportunities Now for Necessary and Effective Care Technologies (CONNECT) for Health Act (H.R. 4206/S. 1261), which would make telehealth flexibilities permanent and has received majority cosponsorship in the U.S. Senate after ACC members came to Capitol Hill for ACC Legislative Conference 2025. ACC's first action alert of the year, launched yesterday, focuses on this policy priority. ACC members can send a message to their lawmakers endorsing the CONNECT for Health Act and requesting action.

Other legislative policies that are high up on the College's advocacy agenda include addressing Medicare payment reform, improving maternal health outcomes, and pushing for expanded access to AEDs in public spaces. Additionally, the ACC will closely monitor AI-related policies including its influence on payment models and impact on medical liability as federal agencies continue to express interest in harnessing these technologies.

The College will also continue to highlight the importance of strong, sustained investments in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, illustrating to decisionmakers how robust federal funding fuels clinical innovation, improves patient care and strengthens the nation's cardiovascular workforce.

The Washington State Department of Commerce has submitted revised greenhouse gas emissions data to the Department of Ecology for projects funded by the Climate Commitment Act (CCA) during 2023-25.

Due to a data entry error, Commerce reported that 7.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced as a result of eight rebate projects funded by the CCA that support home electrification and appliance rebates for low-income and vulnerable communities. The corrected data now estimates that 78,000 tons of emissions will be reduced over the lifetime of those projects.

This data is part of an annual report by Ecology detailing how more than $1.5 billion in funds raised through the CCA have been appropriated by lawmakers. Since becoming aware of the error, Ecology has been conducting a full review of all the data submitted. This data encompasses more than 3,600 projects by 37 agencies. Ecology will release a corrected report when that review is complete. That is expected in the coming weeks.

The rebates program is one of many CCA-funded projects administered by Commerce. With this correction, Commerce is now reporting a total reduction in emissions of nearly 308,000 tons across all their CCA-funded programs.

“We made an error in reporting data for this program. The Climate Commitment Act is a vital part of the state’s efforts to control carbon emissions, and we’re committed to ensuring that the information we share is complete and accurate,” said Jennifer Grove, assistant director of Energy for Commerce. “Corrective measures are already in place to strengthen our processes and prevent similar errors in the future.”

“Accurate data is essential to guiding our state’s work to reduce carbon pollution,” said Joel Creswell, manager of Ecology’s Climate Pollution Reduction program. “We’re updating our processes to more thoroughly check data reported by agencies so this doesn’t happen again.”

Moving forward, agencies will report greenhouse gas reductions through a new online tool that will reduce the potential for human error.

More about the report and Climate Commitment Act

The CCA is designed to reduce climate pollution from the state’s biggest sources 95% by 2050. The primary way it does this is by capping greenhouse gas emissions and requiring major sources of that pollution to purchase or obtain allowances equal to their emissions. Over time, the number of allowances is gradually reduced, pushing companies to cut emissions. Lawmakers may also use the revenue generated by allowance sales to further reduce emissions or do other climate-related work.

At the end of each fiscal year, state agencies that receive CCA funding are required to report their expenditures to Ecology, which compiles that information into a report to the Legislature. The latest report details how $1.5 billion of CCA revenue was invested by 37 state agencies during the 2023-25 biennium. In addition to projected greenhouse gas reductions, the report includes whether a project benefited vulnerable populations, whether a project received tribal support, and other benefits achieved.

As Ecology works to update the report’s greenhouse gas data, lawmakers and the public may still use the current version to understand how the CCA is helping communities across the state. Many of the investments made to date lay a foundation for a clean economy, such as building infrastructure for storing and transmitting renewable energy and developing a skilled workforce to support it. Most projects also increase equity and provide other benefits, such as improving air quality or lowering energy costs for those who need it most. CCA funding is also helping communities adapt to a warming climate, such as preventing wildfires and floods and protecting people from extreme heat.",https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AdobeStock_504341882-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 17:00:45.611809

Wired for Profit: Third in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.

BUCKS — South Alabama is where it all washes out.

Here, in the nation’s second-largest delta, the waters of the Deep South wind through the pines and cypresses of the Yellowhammer State, snaking their way into Mobile Bay and on to the Gulf. Among the most biodiverse regions in the country, the Mobile-Tensaw Delta drains 44,000 square miles of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. It’s where the rivers—the Mobile, Tensaw, Blakely, Apalachee, Middle and Spanish Rivers—meet in land dubbed the “American Amazon” by E.O. Wilson, a renowned naturalist born in the state.

The Delta’s history is America’s. At its heart are the island mounds of Bottle Creek, the “principal political and religious center” for the Indigenous Pensacola culture for 300 years before European contact.

About a dozen miles south, beneath the surface of the Mobile River’s muddy waters, lies the wreckage of the Clotilda, widely regarded as the last slave ship to enter the United States. And farther south, still, the Mobile River empties into Mobile Bay, itself a veritable biodiversity hotspot and the cornerstone of a vibrant coastal culture and ecosystem.

But all of that, many residents, experts and environmentalists say, is at risk, because of Alabama Power’s coal ash waste, a toxic leftover from decades of burning coal for electricity.

One 600-acre pit of the toxic coal ash lies along the banks of the Mobile River in the Upper Delta, about 25 miles north of Mobile Bay. There, smokestacks from the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant rise like a sore thumb from a horizon of green, towering over an unlined pond filled with more than 21 million tons of the toxic residue. Holding back the toxic waste from the Mobile River? Earthen dikes.

Alyson Tucker, media relations manager for Alabama Power, one of the nation’s most profitable electric utilities and one of the state’s most powerful companies, said in an email that the company “remains committed to operating in full compliance with environmental regulations. Our plans for closure and groundwater protection fully comply with current state and federal law, are approved by [the Alabama Department of Environmental Management] and are certified by professional engineers.”

“Due to ongoing litigation related to Plant Barry coal ash, we are unable to comment further at this time,” Tucker said.

Leaving coal waste in place under engineered caps, company representatives have long argued, is safe and protective of groundwater—claims that state regulators have accepted but both environmental groups and federal regulators dispute.

Alabama’s American Amazon isn’t the only area placed at risk by Alabama Power’s ghosts of energy past. An Inside Climate News review of the utility’s legally mandated emergency action plans shows that hundreds of square miles of land and waterways would be at risk of inundation in the event of a breach of the barriers holding back toxic waste at its six coal ash pond sites across the state. In total, more than 117 million tons of coal sludge are at issue, stored along Alabama’s waterways.

What to do with all that polluted material has become a controversial question, with federal and state officials at odds over the issue. In 2015, the federal government finalized a rule tightening restriction around how coal waste could be stored. EPA left implementation of the new standards to states, but in May 2024, the agency denied the state of Alabama’s plan to allow Alabama Power and other utilities to continue storing toxic coal ash in unlined pits at sites across the state. Federal officials said the plan would not adequately protect the state’s groundwater from contamination by coal ash residuals following “cap-in-place” closure.

“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure. In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units,” the decision said.

More than a year after the EPA denied Alabama’s coal ash plan, with the Trump administration now running the federal environmental agency, it’s unclear what comes next for the toxic ponds and the government’s now decade-old effort to safely close them.

But one thing is certain, according to Cade Kistler, who leads Mobile Baykeeper, an environmental nonprofit currently in litigation with Alabama Power over the coal ash lagoon at Plant Barry. Until the toxic leftovers of the company’s fossil fuel commitments are moved out of groundwater and away from waterways, the delta and Mobile Bay are an Eden on the edge of disaster.

“The delta is an elegant labyrinth, full of bayous and sloughs and backwaters. If it is flooded with ash, it would be polluting forever,” Kistler said. “There would be no way to effectively clean it up.”

The cost of Kingston

The failure of a dirt dike at a coal ash pond isn’t theoretical. In 2008, a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, breached, spilling more than a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of land and into the Emory River channel. The result was one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The spill cost the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which owned the coal impoundment, over $1 billion to clean up. Ten years after the spill, dozens of the roughly 900 workers employed during the cleanup were already dead. More than 250 were chronically ill. According to the EPA, coal ash contains heavy metal contaminants like mercury, cadmium and arsenic known to cause cancer and other serious effects on the nervous system, heart, kidneys and development.

Both Alabama Power’s own groundwater monitoring reports and measurements taken by researchers from the Mobile River adjacent to Plant Barry confirm heavy metal contamination at the site.

“We identified a significant contribution of toxic metals linked to coal ash near Sister’s Creek, the man-made cooling discharge channel of Plant Barry, particularly during the dry season,” one 2025 study by scientists at the University of Alabama and Texas A&M Universities concluded. The peer-reviewed paper also pointed to the impacts of climate change as another reason to be wary of Alabama Power’s storage of coal ash on waterways.

“There is a plausible concern for acute and chronic toxic metals environmental pollution from the Alabama ash pond, considering rising seawater levels and more frequent severe storm surges in the region since its initial construction,” the study said.

The volume of coal ash material stored at Plant Barry alone is more than four times that of the sludge that spilled in Kingston in 2008, according to company figures. That fact alone should worry anyone concerned about Alabama’s environment, said Diane Thomas, one of three self-proclaimed “coal ash grannies” featured in a new documentary about Plant Barry’s coal lagoons, Sallie’s Ashes.

Thomas spent three decades living on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay.

“I have kayaked and sailed,” she said. “I swam. I crabbed. I fished. My love for the bay and what you can do on the bay runs deep.”

It was an easy “yes,” then, when her decades-long friend Sallie Smith asked Thomas and another friend, Savan Wilson, to help her fight against Alabama Power’s plans to leave coal ash beside the Mobile River. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and felt she needed to spend her remaining time advocating to protect the bay she’d grown to adore. The trio founded the Coal Ash Action Group, a grassroots organization committed to educating Alabamians about an issue unknown to many.

Thomas, a retired clinical psychologist, said it’s easy to fight for something so dear to so many. For decades, the delta and the bay have been an integral part of her family’s lives.

She smiled as she recalled her first jubilee, a naturally occurring event where low oxygen levels in Mobile Bay cause marine life to flee toward shore.

“There is nothing like catching your own crabs,” Thomas said. “Have you ever cleaned 200 crabs? Your thumbs are just raw.”

After her husband was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, no longer able to work, he began to fish almost daily. With aggressive treatment, he survived the disease.

“We ate fresh fish for about eight years—four times a week,” Thomas said.

That type of close connection with the water is something Thomas feels shouldn’t be put at risk unnecessarily by an electric utility.

‘

A knife to your throat’

Alabama Power’s legally-mandated emergency action plan for Plant Barry shows that if earthen dikes separating the coal ash from the Mobile River were to breach, around 25 square miles of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta would be inundated with coal slurry, covering dozens of miles of the Mobile, Middle and Tensaw Rivers, just upstream of Mobile Bay. From there, the toxic sludge would diffuse throughout the region, with the state’s rivers acting as a heart, pumping the liquid farther and farther from Plant Barry.

“But instead of lifeblood, it’s pumping coal waste that would kill the environment,” Thomas said.

David Bronner, the prominent CEO of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, recently called Plant Barry’s coal ash pond “a huge environmental bomb” in a newsletter sent to state retirees.

“We need your cooperation again for South Alabama,” Bronner wrote in an open appeal to Alabama’s congressional delegation. “Not for new jobs, but for solving an old problem that still exists. That problem hangs over all of Alabama, like a knife to your throat: the coal ash dump that sits next to Mobile Bay. No one should forget what the Tennessee coal ash dump did to that state. A breach of the Mobile site would clearly damage Mobile Bay for decades.”

Thomas believes Bronner’s assessment is on target.

A coal ash breach could be even worse, Thomas said.

“If a breach occurred, we would be the most industrially polluted site in the nation, and we know that pollution wouldn’t just go away,” she said.

That’s why she and Wilson have committed themselves to informing others across the state about the dangers of the waste, something they now do in memory of Smith, who died of cancer in October 2023.

“Sallie’s focus was on connecting people in search of our common humanity, and in seeking to deepen our understanding and compassion for one another,” her obituary read. “This ardent effort was an outgrowth and demonstration of her deep faith. She loved her family, Mobile Bay, country music, her many friends, including her hiking group of intrepid college friends, and all God’s people.”

‘Pray we don’t have a hurricane’

While there’s still much to be done to contain the coal ash threat, Thomas said, there have been at least some glimmers of hope. In early 2024, Alabama Power confirmed a plan to contract a company called Eco Materials to remove and recycle some of the coal waste stored at Plant Barry.

Since then, however, there has been little in the way of substantive public updates about the project, which company officials previously said would begin recycling coal ash into construction materials like concrete in January 2026. In response to an inquiry from Inside Climate News, a representative for Alabama Power said the recycling facility is “expected to be in service by early 2026.”

Eco Materials was acquired by materials company CRH in July 2025, according to an announcement. Neither Eco Materials nor CRH responded to a request for a detailed update on the recycling plans.

Still, Thomas said that even the conception of a plan is a step in the right direction.

“We need to recycle as much as possible and just pray we don’t have a hurricane,” she said.

Kistler said he fears just that. An extreme weather event or other emergency could leave a world-renowned environmental gem drowned in polluted sludge.

Alabama Power’s emergency action plans, bare-bones documents required by federal law, provide only limited information about what could occur if a breach happened at its coal ash sites across the state. The documents also provide little real-world information about how the company would approach mitigation, clean up and remediation.

Regarding extreme weather, the 39-page emergency plan for Plant Barry mentions only that if severe weather causes road closures during an emergency dam breach, company response times may be delayed. Despite Plant Barry’s location in south Alabama, the word “hurricane” does not appear in the emergency action plan.

“It’s foolhardy,” Kistler said. “There needs to be more detail.”

Regulators have agreed. In January 2023, the EPA issued Alabama Power a notice of potential violation informing the company that, in the agency’s view, it had violated federal regulations because its groundwater monitoring program and emergency action plan were not adequate.

The agency settled that dispute with Alabama Power in 2024 when the company agreed to “evaluate and expand its groundwater monitoring program at Plant Barry, to review and upgrade its Emergency Action Plan, and to pay a civil penalty of $278,000,” according to the EPA.

More than a year later, a representative of the utility told members of Alabama’s Public Service Commission that an updated emergency action plan is still in the works.

“The emergency action plan will be modified to include additional wording and descriptions to clarify the company’s preparedness for extreme weather conditions,” Dustin Brooks, land compliance manager for Alabama Power, told commissioners on Dec. 9.

“I just hope that outside this public document, they’ve got better plans somewhere,” Kistler said.

A previously available copy of the EPA’s settlement agreement with Alabama Power has been removed from the agency’s website, though the press release announcing the agreement remains. “This Initiative is needed given the breadth and scope of observed noncompliance with the federal coal ash regulations,” the agency said.

An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s coal ash units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s then-vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” coal ash waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.

“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.

In 2019, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.

In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.

Plant Barry is just one of Alabama Power’s six plant sites across the state that store coal ash. In all, the slurry lagoons cover a footprint of around 2,000 acres and pose unique risks to groundwater and waterways around them.

A now capped-in-place coal ash impoundment at Plant Gadsden, for example, is still contaminating groundwater more than seven years after its closure, according to Alabama Power’s groundwater monitoring reports and a lawsuit filed against the utility by Coosa Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit.

“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release after the lawsuit was filed. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”

In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit over groundwater contamination at Plant Gadsden, lawyers for Alabama Power emphasized that state regulators approved the company’s plans for coal ash waste at the site.

When groundwater monitoring identified elevated levels of contaminants, the lawyers wrote, “Alabama Power worked with professional engineers and the public to design and implement a corrective action program to address those exceedances—a program certified as compliant with the federal CCR rule and that will continue as part of ‘post-closure care.’”

While the suit should be dismissed due to an expired statute of limitations, Alabama Power’s attorneys argued, the court should also decline to second guess the decision of state regulators to approve the company’s actions.

“[Coosa Riverkeeper] asks the Court to turn back the clock, to before 2020, to second-guess the groundwater monitoring system and closure decisions—work completed long ago, approved by state regulators, and certified by professional engineers as compliant,” the motion said.

Plants Barry, Gorgas, Greene County and Miller have been designated as having “significant hazard potential” under federal law. Plant Gaston, located near the town of Wilsonville in Shelby County, has been designated as having “high hazard potential.”

Following an emergency dam break at that site, which the company deems “unlikely,” Alabama Power’s initial hazard potential assessment concluded that “water and [coal ash] could potentially impact the residential neighborhood to the west, and the Coosa River to the south…failure or misoperation of the [coal ash] unit could potentially result in a loss of human life.”

Kistler said that it’s notable that Alabama Power is unique among southern utilities in leaving all of its coal waste in unlined pits along waterways. Georgia Power, another subsidiary of Southern Company, has already shifted toward more appropriate disposal of at least some of its coal ash in lined landfills. It’s not a question then, Kistler said, of whether Alabama Power can do the same. It’s only a question of if it will.

“It feels like we’re paying premium prices, and we’re getting bargain-bin environmental protections,” he said, making a reference to Alabama Power’s highest average residential electric bills in the nation. “If Georgia can do it, why not us?”

A coal legacy and a fossil-fueled future

Barry Brock, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, is part of the team of lawyers suing Alabama Power over its coal ash impoundment at Plant Barry. Initially dismissed by a Trump-appointed U.S. district court judge on technical grounds, the case is now pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Brock said he is hopeful the team will secure a victory.

Oral arguments in the case were held in Atlanta in November, and some of Alabama Power’s arguments were unusually revealing, Brock said.

“Alabama Power admits that a lot of the coal ash is going to be left in contact with groundwater under their closure plan,” he said. “That’s particularly galling.”

Coal ash isn’t SELC’s first legal tussle with Alabama Power, however. Lawyers for the environmental nonprofit are also representing customers suing Alabama Power over residential solar fees they argue violate the law and discourage the use of renewable energy. In response, the company has said that it “support[s] customers interested in using onsite generation, such as solar” but that its rate structure for those customers must avoid “unfairly shifting” costs to other ratepayers.

Meanwhile, the company has doubled down on its fossil fuel investments, purchasing a natural gas plant in Autauga County for around $622 million, effectively locking the company into the continued use of fossil fuels for years to come, though the company said in an email that its investments are data-driven, forward-looking and “are not based on a preference for any one fuel source.”

All of these developments are individually concerning, Brock said, and together, they demonstrate a pattern.

“It sends a pretty clear message that Alabama Power is really concerned about their financial well-being and the rate of return they get on fossil fuel infrastructure,” he said. “It says they have a pretty compliant regulatory environment that is not going to scrutinize them when they want to raise rates for customers to do it.”

While the company clearly has the resources to line its coal ash ponds and recycle much of the waste, there’s also little doubt that the state can count on much more sympathetic federal regulators under the Trump EPA than it did under Democratic leadership. At present, the state and federal governments seem closely aligned: Twinkle Cavanaugh recently resigned after 13 years as president of the state’s Public Service Commission, the agency charged with regulating Alabama Power.

As in years’ past, public education received a major infusion of funds from oil and natural gas royalties in FY 2025.
Based on the combined state and local taxes and state royalties attributable to the industry, the oil and natural gas industry pays far more per employee ($54,481) than the average private-sector industry average ($7,225).
“Despite market challenges, the oil and natural gas industry shattered another string of records in fiscal year 2025,” said Staples.
Texas also set records for exports of crude oil and condensate, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and total natural gas.","AUSTIN According to just-released data from the Texas Oil & Gas Association (TXOGA), the Texas oil and natural gas industry paid $27 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties in fiscal year (FY) 2025 — the second-highest total in Texas history. TXOGA President Todd Staples on Wednesday hosted a media briefing to share the Association’s annual Energy & Economic Impact Report and to provide an update on the industry’s record-breaking operational and environmental performance, an outlook on the energy market, and TXOGA’s policy priorities.

“In Texas, lasting progress is built on performance, not opinion. Talk doesn’t grow jobs, keep homes warm or cars running. Action, investment and innovation drive greatness across the Texas economy,” said Staples. “Even during a year dominated by market challenges, Texas oil and natural gas has proven — once again — to be the power behind Texas’ progress.”

“Twenty-seven billion in state and local tax revenue and state royalties from the Texas oil and natural gas industry translates to nearly $74 million every day that pays for Texas’ public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other essential services,” said Staples. “Beyond this essential tax revenue, Texas oil and natural gas delivers energy security at home and global stability for our allies.”

Since 2007, when TXOGA first started compiling this data, the Texas oil and natural gas industry has paid more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in state and local taxes and state royalties, a figure that does not include the hundreds of billions of dollars in payroll for some of the highest paying jobs in the state, taxes paid on office buildings and personal property, and the enormous economic ripple effect that benefits other sectors of the economy.

As in years’ past, public education received a major infusion of funds from oil and natural gas royalties in FY 2025. The Permanent University Fund received $1.72 billion, and the Permanent School Fund received $1.40 billion. Together, the market value of these funds exceeds $100 billion. With a balance of $66.5 billion, the Permanent School Fund alone is larger than Harvard’s endowment and is the largest educational endowment in the nation.

Texas’ Rainy Day Fund, or Economic Stabilization Fund (ESF), has received over $35.9 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes since its inception in 1987. This number amounts to over 85% of the ESF revenue over time. The ESF and the State Highway Fund each received $2.7 billion this cycle.

In FY 2025, Texas school districts received $2.6 billion in property taxes from mineral properties producing oil and natural gas, pipelines, and gas utilities. Counties received an additional $1 billion in these property taxes.

Property tax totals for each county

Property tax totals for each ISD

Among local recipients, Pecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD in West Texas ranked first statewide, receiving $309.3 million in oil and natural gas property taxes, while Reeves County ranked first among counties, receiving $109.4 million paid in oil and natural gas property taxes.

In FY 2025, the industry employed more than 495,500 Texans who earned an average of $133,095 a year — 68 percent more than the average paid by the rest of Texas’ private sector. Conservatively, these jobs generate approximately two more jobs, with nearly 1.4 million total jobs supported across the Texas economy. Some economic analyses suggest that the industry’s employment multiplier could approach three additional jobs per direct job – bringing the total to over 2 million jobs supported by the industry across Texas.

Based on the combined state and local taxes and state royalties attributable to the industry, the oil and natural gas industry pays far more per employee ($54,481) than the average private-sector industry average ($7,225). Staples observed this 7.5-to-1 difference underscores the outsized role the industry plays in financing state and local government services.

“Despite market challenges, the oil and natural gas industry shattered another string of records in fiscal year 2025,” said Staples. “Non-stop industry innovation, investment and operational efficiency raised the bar for performance, once again.”

Texas crude oil production set a new record in July 2025, reaching 5.85 mb/d. Marketed natural gas production reached 35.4 bcf/d in August. Most of these impressive totals are coming out of the Permian Basin, where innovation and efficiency are driving record production in the most important basin in the world.

Texas also set records for exports of crude oil and condensate, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and total natural gas. To transport these volumes, pipeline infrastructure grew to 472,790 miles and LNG export capacity from Texas and Louisiana approached 13.0 bcf/d, with another 19.0 bcf/d of projects already being commissioned or under construction.

Against the backdrop of this strong performance, Staples addressed market commentary related to a potential global energy “glut,” and cautioned against confusing headlines with fundamentals.

“Headlines aside, our data show markets adjusting, not breaking,” Staples said. “Texas energy remains productive, reliable, and globally essential – and fundamentals, not sentiment, continue to drive outcomes for our economy and consumers.”

Staples noted that TXOGA does not see evidence of a disorderly oversupply, but rather markets adjusting as long-lead projects sanctioned years ago come online. He explained that as global energy demand continues to grow, U.S. production gains reflect productivity and efficiency, and Texas remains uniquely resilient due to its infrastructure, export capacity, and innovation. These fundamentals, not short-term sentiment, he said, underpin the strong economic contribution detailed in TXOGA’s 2025 Energy & Economic Impact Report.

“At a time when energy debates are often driven by competing narratives, this report focuses on facts. It underscores a simple truth: Texas runs on oil and natural gas, made possible by hundreds of thousands of skilled men and women who rise before the sun to keep our economy moving and our communities secure,” Staples said. “In the coming year, we look forward to continuing our partnership with state leaders and communities to keep Texas powered, prosperous, and prepared for what comes next.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Todd-Staples-e1634362853665.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:00:18.418006

Both outlets pointed to policy and demand headwinds weighing on Tesla. For example,The Guardian tied the downturn to U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of EV subsidies and emissions regulations that encouraged EV production. And Car and Driver noted that Tesla’s fourth-quarter U.S. performance was affected by the elimination of federal EV incentives, even after lower-priced versions of the Model 3 and Model Y were introduced in the fall.

BYD’s growth, meanwhile, is being driven by scale and product breadth. Car and Driver underlined that BYD’s total 2025 vehicle sales rose 7.7 per cent to 4.6 million, supported by a 28 per cent rise in EV sales, with “just under half” of its global volume electrified. The Guardian added that BYD is including driver-assistance technology called “God’s Eye” even on its cheapest models.

The Kentucky Public Service Commission last week approved Kentucky Power’s plan to maintain its ownership of the Mitchell plant in West Virginia.

In its 68-page order, though, the commission said Kentucky Power had fumbled its options and gave regulators no choice but to approve the proposal “to prevent a worse outcome.”

The commission had rejected a similar plan in 2021. Demand for electricity has risen since then, and so has the cost of coal generation.

Kentucky Power customers are facing a potential 15% rate increase in a separate case the PSC will hear this month.

At two public hearings so far, residents have spoken uniformly in opposition to the increase.

A third public hearing will take place on Thursday in Ashland, followed by an evidentiary hearing in Frankfort on Jan. 13.

The commission urged Kentucky Power to consider converting Mitchell to 100% natural gas. A Sierra Club witness testified that would be cheaper than continuing to burn coal.

Keeping the Mitchell plant online will cost Kentucky Power customers an average of $2 a month. The rate increase, if approved as submitted, would raise average bills by $27.

The Kentucky commission chastised Kentucky Power for its decision to partially retire its Big Sandy plant in Lawrence County in 2015. Instead of installing pollution controls on Big Sandy to keep it operating as a coal plant, the company purchased 50% of Mitchell and converted one unit at Big Sandy to operate with gas.

“While those failures do not justify denying the application in this matter for the reasons discussed above, the commission is concerned that this is part of a broader pattern in which Kentucky Power, whether intentionally or not, has made poor resource decisions,” the commissioners wrote.

The company has said, and the Kentucky PSC agreed at the time, that Mitchell was a cheaper option than upgrading Big Sandy.

Ceasing coal generation at Big Sandy, though, was deeply unpopular in the region and among its elected representatives.

While Mitchell currently operates as a coal plant, it is near Moundsville, West Virginia, about 200 miles away. Mitchell burns little coal from Kentucky, employs few Kentucky workers and pays no Kentucky property taxes.

Kentucky Power has said it will need to replace one of Mitchell’s two concrete cooling towers in the next several years. While the company has applied for a federal grant to help offset the cost, it will need to seek permission from regulators in Kentucky and West Virginia to recover much of the expense from electricity customers.

Kentucky’s commission said Kentucky Power could have opted to retire Mitchell in 2028 and seek replacement power. It reluctantly approved the company’s continued ownership of Mitchell, however, because alternatives, including a new natural gas plant or market purchases, are now more expensive or couldn’t be completed in the next few years.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mitchell-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:13:34.873042

Its Model “e” division reported a $5.1 billion loss in 2024 and a $5.5 billion loss is expected for 2025.

General Motors is looking at a similar loss — $1.6 billion on its late 2025 rollout of some new EV models alone. Porsche just posted its first quarterly loss since becoming a listed company of nearly $5 billion due to its EV program. Rivian and Lucid have burned through $16 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively, since 2022. Lucid continues to lose $400,000 on every car it sells. I suspect total losses will exceed $250 billion when it's all said and done, and my estimate may be light.

The problem with all these losses is that the consumer will end up paying for all of it. How? Have you seen the rising costs of new and used cars in the past several years? Hopefully President Donald Trump’s new regulations will temper these rising costs.

The consumer has already paid plenty — tens of billion in taxpayer-funded climate programs, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies ($7,500 in tax credits per EV), grants and loans doled out by the U.S. government, mostly under the EV mandates required by the Biden administration. And it’s not just the U.S. government; state governments have had their own subsidy program like the leftist state of California in the billions of dollars, never mind the extra billions of dollars charged to consumers in the price of gasoline and other regulatory costs. It is absolutely hideous what government has done.

EVs were to be the panacea to transportation, global warming (a fiction also created by leftist governments) and our allegedly dwindling supply of petroleum. Turns out that the leftist central planners were all wrong. Petroleum-powered vehicles are still 95% of the market, global warming is a complete fiction and our petroleum supplies are growing with many experts claiming we have at least a 500 year supply or more. Do you need more reasons why socialist/communist societies and governments fail?

Tesla makes remarkable cars and the stock is approaching $500. The Model S is beautiful and it drives wonderfully, but it still suffers from limited range and takes too long to refuel, never mind the lack of refueling stations. Tesla may survive as it has developed a great reputation for quality products that do perform as good as the claims. Tesla will supply that 5% niche of EVs to the public that wants them and whose driving characteristics work well with an EV. It will also be successful with its robo-taxis and other unique markets. In fact, sales will grow as other EV makers fall by the wayside.

Why will this happen? Blame all the false promises made mostly by left-leaning scientists and politicians. The first promise was battery energy density will grow at 5% a year. That is like selling the process of turning iron into gold. It will never happen.

As I have written time and time again, batteries are nothing more than a chemical reaction creating a flow of electron between two elements and/or compounds. Scientists have tried them all as the number of elements and compounds therefrom are already known to mankind. There are no more except those elements so unstable and essentially created by humans using linear accelerators; their half-life is a nanosecond and they glow in the dark. Anyone with a decent high school chemistry education knows this. Until the discovery of “Unobtainium,” battery density will remain at about 9-10 pounds a kiloWatt/hour.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/mtdemocrat.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/65/965b1e74-24bc-11ee-8dc5-578391813eb1/64b568603fa22.image.jpg?crop=438%2C438%2C75%2C75&resize=200%2C200&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-07 18:00:37.058304

All in all, China's passenger EV sales, including PHEVs and extended-range hybrids, are expected to have hit about 15.6 million in 2025.
Forget ""EV winter.""
At this point, I'd settle for winter winter.","It's not going to be an easy year for electric vehicle sales around the globe. Between a near-complete reversal of policy in the U.S., a wind-down of some subsidies in China and Europe saying ""never mind"" to its 2035 internal combustion engine ban, things are about to get very rocky. Because of all that, Bloomberg expects 24.3 million passenger EVs to be sold in 2026 — just a 12% increase from 2025. While that doesn't sound terrible on its face, you gotta remember that 2025 saw 23% growth from the year before.

In the U.S., especially, things are bleak. Apparently, we're headed toward what is being described as an ""EV winter"" by one consultant who spoke with Bloomberg. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. We may be in for some sort of revival in 2027 and 2028, according to Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group's global lead for EVs and energy storage. Still, 2026 is more likely than not going to be brutal, and automakers are going to have to bear down to weather the storm.

This really kicked off when the Trump administration decided to kill off the wildly popular $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit at the end of September. Trump then went about neutering fuel economy standards, and now we're here. Year over year, November's EV sales dropped 41%, and it's just an appetizer of things to come. Bloomberg expects the U.S.'s annual passenger EV sales to drop 15% in 2026.

It's not like the United States is alone in this mess, either. Analysts say that even China — the world's top EV market — is going to see a sales slowdown in 2026, and it's partly because of a pullback in government support for the exploding industry. Beijing has apparently cut its EV tax break in half for 2026, according to Bloomberg. At the same time, a cash-for-clunkers program (remember that?) will include new restrictions and limited eligibility for folks who want to swap out their old ride for an EV. Most feel that it's a way to throw water on the price war that has been raging between China's biggest automakers that has led to some posting their weakest annual growth numbers in years.

All in all, China's passenger EV sales, including PHEVs and extended-range hybrids, are expected to have hit about 15.6 million in 2025. That represents a 27% increase over 2024, Bloomberg reports. Nobody expects that to continue in 2026, with growth forecasted at just 13%.

On top of all of this, as we've reported before, the European Union has given up on its 2035 internal combustion engine ban as EV sales continue to slow in the bloc. The European Commission says it plans to maintain a strong market signal in favor of zero-emission vehicles while giving automakers more flexibility, but we know what this is really about. EV sales are slowing on the continent, and automakers are getting spooked.

If you want to learn more about this entire situation and how it's impacting different markets globally, I do suggest you head over to Bloomberg for the full rundown.

As the outlet mentioned, 2027 and 2028 look far more promising than 2026 does for zero-emission vehicles. That's the kind of hope we've got to hold onto, because it's January 7 in New York, and it's 50 degrees outside. Forget ""EV winter.""

Shares in Chevron, the last major U.S. oil company remaining in Venezuela, soared on Monday before retreating on Tuesday.

But the potential Wall Street winners from the United States' dramatic intervention in Venezuela go far beyond oil.
Gold prices rose early this week, while silver prices reached a new record high.","Wall Street traditionally detests ""uncertainty."" But in the first days after the United States removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from power, U.S. investors are shrugging off the geopolitical instability — and mostly focusing on the positive.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record highs on Monday and Tuesday, lifted in part by some Venezuela-related stocks. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high on Tuesday. Meanwhile, investors who own Venezuelan bonds — including some large U.S. financial institutions — also saw those struggling assets surge in value.

""We're in a different ballpark now,"" says Eric Fine, who invests in bonds as emerging-markets portfolio manager at VanEck Funds, and whose investment firm bought Venezuelan sovereign debt a few weeks ago.

U.S. oil companies were the immediate, and stated, beneficiary of the country's attack on Venezuela: President Trump said during a weekend press conference that U.S. oil companies would now be able to invest in Venezuela, to ""fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.""

Big Oil stocks have swung up and down since. Shares in Chevron, the last major U.S. oil company remaining in Venezuela, soared on Monday before retreating on Tuesday. Other oil companies and oil field-services providers — including Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Halliburton — followed the same trajectory.

Another potential Wall Street beneficiary: Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund founded by billionaire and influential Republican donor Paul Singer. A U.S. judge in November approved Elliott's $6 billion bid to take over Citgo Petroleum, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state oil company. Maduro's government had denounced and appealed the sale, which has yet to be approved by the U.S. Treasury Department.

But the potential Wall Street winners from the United States' dramatic intervention in Venezuela go far beyond oil. Here are some other U.S. investor groups that are benefitting:

Venezuela's long-suffering bondholders

For years, Venezuela's debt seemed like a dud investment. In 2017, Venezuela missed payments on bonds issued by the government and its state-owned oil company — leaving foreign investors, including U.S. financial institutions, holding tens of billions of dollars of its debt.

Now many of those investors are hoping that the United States's removal of Maduro — and its intention to take over Venezuelan oil — will boost the country's economy, and ultimately its ability to repay its creditors.

""There are much, much greater upsides in the bond market than what investors went to sleep thinking they were on Friday,"" says VanEck's Fine.

His fund manager bought Venezuelan government bonds ""in the last few weeks,"" betting that the Trump Administration's increasingly aggressive rhetoric around Venezuela would eventually lead to some kind of action. Now Fine is hopeful that the interim presidency of former Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez will eventually lead to elections and a future Venezuelan government that is ""arguably more market-friendly.""

For a long time, ""we really didn't see much [that was] interesting in Venezuela. It is highly indebted, and there was no prospect of regime change,"" Fine says.

But now, from a purely financial point of view, ""I think it's a great opportunity,"" he adds.

U.S. weapons makers are on the up and up

The surprise U.S. seizure of a foreign leader on his home soil did increase geopolitical instability, which sometimes can rattle Wall Street. But this week, it benefitted some equity investors — especially in weapons manufacturers and other defense contractors.

Shares in Lockheed Martin, Boeing, RTX Corp., and General Dynamics are all up this week, with the latter hitting an all-time high.

Precious metals are soaring

At the same time that stocks hit record highs, so did some of the precious metals that investors traditionally use as a hedge against uncertainty and risk. Gold prices rose early this week, while silver prices reached a new record high.

So did the price of copper — which may not be needed for pennies anymore, but which is in high demand for data centers, electric vehicles, and a host of other manufacturing purposes.

Copper is also sometimes seen as an indicator of the nation's shift towards renewable energy — providing a greener contrast to Wall Street's excitement this week over Venezuelan oil.

Equinor owns the Empire Wind project and Orsted owns Sunrise Wind, major offshore wind farms in New York.
The administration's order paused the leases for these two projects, as well as for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.
The Trump administration previously halted work on both Empire Wind and Revolution Wind.
Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project was paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns.","Offshore wind developers and states are suing the Trump administration over its order to suspend work for at least 90 days on five large-scale projects under construction off the East Coast.

The Norwegian company Equinor and the Danish energy company Orsted are the latest to challenge the suspension order, with the limited liability companies for their projects filing civil suits late Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Connecticut and Rhode Island filed their own request at that federal court on Monday seeking a preliminary injunction.

The administration announced Dec. 22 it was suspending leases for five offshore wind projects because of national security concerns. Its announcement did not reveal specifics about those concerns.

President Donald Trump has been hostile to renewable energy technologies that produce electricity cleanly, particularly offshore wind, and has instead prioritized oil, coal and natural gas that emit carbon pollution when burned.

Interior Department spokesperson Matt Middleton said Wednesday that Trump has directed the agency to manage public lands and waters for multiple uses, energy development, conservation and national defense. Middleton said the pause on large-scale offshore wind construction is a “decisive step to protect America’s security, prevent conflicts with military readiness and maritime operations and ensure responsible stewardship of our oceans.”

“We will not sacrifice national security or economic stability for projects that make no sense for America’s future,” Middleton said in a statement.

Equinor owns the Empire Wind project and Orsted owns Sunrise Wind, major offshore wind farms in New York. Empire Wind LLC requested expedited consideration by the court, saying the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by Jan. 16. It said the order is disrupting a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with constrained availability, resulting in delay costs and causing an existential threat to the project financing.

Orsted is also asking a judge to vacate and set aside the order. The company says it has spent billions of dollars on Sunrise Wind, relying on validly issued permits from the federal government. It said in the filing that its team met weekly with the Coast Guard throughout 2025, and this week, with representatives from other agencies frequently attending, and no one raised national security concerns.

The administration's order paused the leases for these two projects, as well as for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.

Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It's asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional.

Orsted is building Revolution Wind with its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables. They have filed a complaint over the order on behalf of the venture.

The filing by Connecticut and Rhode Island seeks to allow work on Revolution Wind to continue.

“Every day this project is stalled costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars in inflated energy bills when families are in dire need of relief,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. “Revolution Wind was vetted and approved, and the Trump administration has yet to disclose a shred of evidence to counter that thorough and careful process.”

Avangrid is a joint owner along with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners of the Vineyard Wind project. They have not indicated publicly whether they plan to join the rest of the developers in challenging the administration.

The Trump administration previously halted work on both Empire Wind and Revolution Wind. In April, it stopped construction on Empire Wind, accusing the Biden administration of rushing the permits, then allowed work to resume a month later. Equinor finalized the federal lease for Empire Wind in March 2017, early in Trump’s first term. The final federal approval was in February 2024.

Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project was paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, a federal judge ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/07/PDTN/88065909007-ap-25356646674574.jpg?crop=5755,3237,x0,y368&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 18:00:45.402645

The program is part of an initiative begun in 2024 aimed at ending the country’s reliance on foreign sources of enriched uranium, such as Russia, which currently dominates the global market for specialized nuclear fuels.

These efforts are focused on rebuilding U.S. production of Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) to ensure fuel supplies for the nation’s 94 existing commercial reactors, while simultaneously developing High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) –enriched between 5% and 20% – to power future deployments of advanced nuclear reactors.

“President Trump is catalyzing a resurgence in the nation’s nuclear energy sector to strengthen American security and prosperity,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Today’s awards show that this Administration is committed to restoring a secure domestic nuclear fuel supply chain capable of producing the nuclear fuels needed to power the reactors of today and the advanced reactors of tomorrow.”

Awards of $900 million went to U.S.-based firms American Centrifuge Operating and General Matter for the development of advanced high-assay low-enriched uranium processing capabilities.

American Centrifuge Operating, a subsidiary of Maryland-based Centrus Energy Corp., produces centrifuges and related equipment using domestic parts and labor at a plant in Piketon, Ohio. The company’s engineering and manufacturing facility is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

General Matter, a nuclear startup company based in San Francisco, is backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The company was awarded funding to build and operate an enrichment facility in Paducah, Kentucky, and plans to repurpose the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The company aims to restore U.S. leadership in nuclear enrichment to power future energy demands, including those from AI data centers, according to its website.

Bill Lee posted Monday on X. “I’m grateful for the Department of Energy’s historic $2.7 billion investment to strengthen domestic uranium enrichment, expand innovation & create American jobs.""

The funding for the program was established in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 as part of former President Biden’s ""Investing in America"" agenda.

In November 2025, Attorney General McCuskey joined EPA Administrator Zeldin for announcement of a proposed groundbreaking rule that would substantially reshape the definition of WOTUS, marking a monumental shift in federal environmental regulation.
Attorney General McCuskey’s letter supports that action and asks the agencies to go even further to restore constitutional order.
We commend the Trump administration for taking bold action to correct this overregulation and we stand ready to help ensure the Clean Water Act fulfills its important, true purpose,” Attorney General McCuskey said.","West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey spearheaded a 20-state coalition of attorneys general to send a formal comment letter to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Lt. General William H. “Butch” Graham, Jr., regarding the updated definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS).

The longstanding WOTUS controversy has placed undue regulatory burdens on West Virginia's farmers, landowners, and businesses, often subjecting routine land use activities to costly federal permitting processes. The West Virginia Attorney General’s Office secured a preliminary injunction against the Biden-era WOTUS rule. Now, the Trump Administration is rolling back that rule. The proposed reform aims to restore clarity and predictability to environmental regulations while maintaining critical protections for the nation’s waterways.

In the letter, Attorney General McCuskey points out that states should control their own waters, like rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands. Historically, states always regulated waters within their borders. The Clean Water Act was supposed to respect this; however, federal agencies have overreached in past administrations by expanding the definition of WOTUS and therefore expanding federal control of waters. The Trump administration proposes to rein in bureaucratic overreach and restore state authority. In November 2025, Attorney General McCuskey joined EPA Administrator Zeldin for announcement of a proposed groundbreaking rule that would substantially reshape the definition of WOTUS, marking a monumental shift in federal environmental regulation. Attorney General McCuskey’s letter supports that action and asks the agencies to go even further to restore constitutional order.

“For too long, federal agencies have overstepped their bounds, regulating everything from puddles in parking lots to seasonal ponds hundreds of miles from navigable waters. This overreach has stripped states of their constitutional authority and cost farmers and businesses millions of dollars. We commend the Trump administration for taking bold action to correct this overregulation and we stand ready to help ensure the Clean Water Act fulfills its important, true purpose,” Attorney General McCuskey said.

Under previous expansive definitions of WOTUS, landowners faced permit costs averaging over $250,000 and permit wait times exceeding two years for projects on their own property. Farmers reported needing federal permits for activities like plowing fields or building bridges over dry washes on their land.

Attorney General McCuskey’s comment letter emphasizes that West Virginia and fellow states stand ready to work with federal agencies to develop a workable definition that protects both environmental integrity and constitutional principles.

Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia joined the West Virginia-led letter.

DEBARY, Fla. – Today, Duke Energy Florida unveiled its DeBary Hydrogen Production Storage System in Volusia County, the first demonstration project in the United States capable of using an end-to-end system to produce, store and combust up to 100% green hydrogen.

How it works

This one-of-its-kind system begins with Duke Energy Florida’s existing DeBary solar site, which provides energy for two electrolyzer units that separate water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

The resulting oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the green hydrogen is delivered to reinforced containers for safe storage.

During times when energy demand is highest, the system delivers the stored green hydrogen to an existing combustion turbine that has been upgraded – using GE Vernova technology – to run on a blend of natural gas and hydrogen or up to 100% hydrogen.

Why it matters

This process makes the natural gas turbines more flexible and diversifies Duke Energy Florida’s generation fleet to support the expansion of renewable energy.

Because the green hydrogen is an on-demand source of energy, the turbines can be turned on and off at any time – it is not dependent on the time of day or the weather.

The site’s reliability allows for more renewable, yet intermittent, energy sources – like solar – that displace the cost of fuel for customers while still meeting rising customer demand.

What they’re saying

“Diverse generation is strong, reliable generation,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “The DeBary hydrogen project underscores Duke Energy Florida’s deep understanding of that notion and our commitment to making strategic infrastructure investments that will allow us to continue providing value for our customers while meeting their rapidly increasing demand for energy.”

“The DeBary system allows for safe, reliable generation and storage of clean energy,” said Reggie Anderson, Duke Energy Florida vice president of regulated and renewable energy. “Duke Energy Florida is proud of this successful innovation and the lasting impact it will have on our industry, our company and, most importantly, our customers.”

“We know Trump wants data centers and Kevin Stitt wants data centers, but these things don’t affect these people,” said Brian Ingram, a Trump voter living in the shadow of the planned project.
Even Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned data center developers that they are losing control of the narrative.
Last month, a group of Senate Democrats launched an investigation into the role data centers play in increasing electricity prices.
It included a bus tour of “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia, the world’s largest collection of data centers.","SAND SPRINGS, Okla. ― One float stood out among the tinsel and holiday cheer at the annual Christmas parade here: an unsightly data center with blinding industrial lights and smoke pouring out of its roof, towering menacingly over a helpless gingerbread house.

This city bordering Tulsa is a battleground, one of many across the country where companies seeking to build massive data centers to win the AI race with China are coming up against the reality of local politics.

Sand Springs leaders were besieged with community anger after annexing an 827-acre agricultural property miles outside of town and launching into secret talks with a tech giant looking to use it for a sprawling data center. Hundreds of aggrieved voters showed up at community meetings. Swarms of protest signs are taking root along the rural roads.

“It feels like these data center companies have just put a big target on our backs,” said Kyle Schmidt, leader of the newly formed Protect Sand Springs Alliance. “We are all asking: Where are the people we elected who promised to protect us from these big corporations trying to steamroll us? The people who are supposed to be standing up and protecting us are standing down and caving.”

From Archbald, Pennsylvania, to Page, Arizona, tech firms are seeking to plunk down data centers in locations that sometimes are not zoned for such heavy industrial uses, within communities that had not planned for them. These supersize data centers can use more energy than entire cities and drain local water supplies.

In Idaho, there are approximately 17 data centers, most of which are located in the Boise area.

Anger over the perceived trampling of communities by Silicon Valley has entered the national political conversation and could affect voters of all political persuasions in this year’s midterm elections.

Many of the residents fighting the project in Sand Springs voted for President Donald Trump three times and also backed Gov. J. Kevin Stitt (R), who implores tech firms to build in his state.

“We know Trump wants data centers and Kevin Stitt wants data centers, but these things don’t affect these people,” said Brian Ingram, a Trump voter living in the shadow of the planned project. “You know, this affects us.”

Ingram was standing before a homemade sign he planted on his front lawn that said, “Jesus Was Born on Ag Land.”

The grassroots blowback comes from deep red states as much as from left-wing groups such as the Democratic Socialists of America, which have helped draw hundreds of residents to hearings in Arizona, Indiana and Maryland.

Even Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned data center developers that they are losing control of the narrative. “In rural America right now, where data centers are being built, everyone’s already angry because their electricity prices have risen a lot,” he told energy executives assembled in Washington for the North American Gas Forum last month. “‘I don’t want them in my state’ is a common viewpoint.”

Some industry groups argue that residents’ concerns are misplaced.

“Fueled by misinformation, driven by radical environmental policies, communities are missing out on the jobs, security and opportunities this technology is delivering,” said an email from Brian O. Walsh, executive director of the AI Infrastructure Coalition. The group says the projects lower electricity prices, a claim that is hotly disputed.

The White House frames the data center boom as beneficial, saying in a statement that it will lead to big investments in infrastructure and boost manufacturing. But the administration is also aware some communities oppose them.

“Communities know what’s best for them, and the Administration is clear that local infrastructure decisions remain with states and localities,” the statement said.

Many local politicians are yielding to community pressure and rejecting data centers. Between April and June, more projects were blocked or delayed than during the previous two years combined, according to Data Center Watch, a tracking project by the nonpartisan research firm 10a Labs. Some $98 billion in planned development was derailed in a single quarter.

Last month, a group of Senate Democrats launched an investigation into the role data centers play in increasing electricity prices.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) last month called for a moratorium on data center construction, warning that the tech firms are draining scarce energy and water reserves and pushing the cost onto everyday Americans in pursuit of AI technologies that threaten to displace millions from the workforce.

White House AI czar David Sacks replied on X: “He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power.”

But advocates say residents’ concerns are legitimate.

“This data center expansion affects so many issues,” said Mitch Jones, managing director of policy and litigation at Food and Water Watch. The group last month organized a letter signed by several national advocacy groups demanding a moratorium.

“It takes up farmland in rural communities. It takes up dwindling water sources in communities that need cleaner drinking water. And it is driving up electricity prices for everyone,” he said. “It is drawing together people from disparate backgrounds who might not agree on other political issues. They are saying this is taking place without any forethought to communities and we must stop it.”

The NAACP this month convened a two-day “Stop Dirty Data” conference in Washington that focused on the impacts of the AI build-out on minority and low-income communities. It included a bus tour of “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia, the world’s largest collection of data centers.

Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is championing an AI “bill of rights” to enshrine local governments’ power to stop data center construction and prohibit utilities from pushing AI infrastructure costs onto residents. The break between Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) and Trump was driven in part by her vocal criticism of his AI build-out push.

The industry has struggled to quell the concerns. In Chandler, Arizona, former senator Kyrsten Sinema (I), co-founder of the AI Infrastructure Coalition, implored city officials to get on board with a large proposed project or risk the federal government pushing it through without city input.

The city council rejected the project unanimously.

The vote followed the Tucson City Council’s unanimous rejection of a plan that would have required annexing land in the Sonoran Desert that until June had been zoned “rural homestead.” Some voters were outraged that local officials had signed a five-year nondisclosure agreement with Amazon, which did not come to light for two years. Frustration with the power company that would have provided the power has fueled a movement to drive it out in favor of a community-led nonprofit.

Amazon did not respond to questions about the controversy, saying only, “We do not have any commitments or agreements in place to develop this project.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

“People are understandably asking how they will benefit,” said Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer at OpenAI, which has won initial local approval for some of the country’s largest data center projects. He said companies need to listen to communities and make sure they are sharing in the economic gains. “You need to be on the ground, having these conversations. It is a journey.”

In some places, large tech companies have signed contracts committing to pay for new power grid infrastructure required to bring a data center online, even when the companies are not the only ones that would benefit from it.

It’s a journey that some local officials are willing to go on because the projects generate construction jobs and boost revenue for schools.

“We’re trying to work through this,” said Mike Carter, the city manager in Sand Springs. “This would probably be one of our major employers. It would almost certainly become the dominant part of our tax base. … When you can surpass Walmart, which is right now the biggest taxpayer in our community, there is a big incentive to look at this.”

He has tried to assure residents that they will have all their questions answered – including the name of the tech firm – before the city hearing this month, where officials will consider rezoning the sprawling property from agricultural to industrial. He said the city has signed other nondisclosure agreements during negotiations with large corporations, such as Olive Garden.

The project developer, White Rose Partners, said none of the costs involved with providing electricity to the Sand Springs data center would fall on residential ratepayers. The firm says the data center would generate millions of dollars in revenue for local schools and services.

It is cold comfort to many residents of the rural community, where the data center would industrialize a landscape now defined by the ranches that drew them there.

“I don’t care how much chocolate icing you put on a dog turd, it don’t make it chocolate cake,” said Rick Plummer, who raises elite team-roping horses next to the proposed data center. “They are trying to fluff this data center thing up and say, ‘Man, eat this birthday cake.’ But it isn’t birthday cake.”

On the other side of Tulsa, a steady stream of pickups pulled off the busy local road to sign petitions fighting a different data center proposed for the rural community of Coweta. One sign takes aim at the nondisclosure agreements, stating “NDAs BETRAY.” The petitions demand the firing of a city official who signed one.

“We want to see this damn data center go away and go someplace else,” said Allen Prather, who was leading the petition drive dressed as Santa. “This town deserves a better centerpiece than a data center. They keep coming to smaller and smaller towns. Leave mine alone.”

Sherri Crumpacker, a retired law enforcement officer who pulled over to sign, concurred. “I moved here from California to get away from BS like this,” she said.",https://idahobusinessreview.com/files/2026/01/data-centers-corrected_73GBXQ5PNB6UIXI52N3OINCRX4-875x5481-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:00:23.652280

The stock price of this electric vehicle (EV) charging station operator dropped by roughly 70% in 2025 and is down by 99% over the past five years.

Investors poured their capital into this name during the pandemic when the EV boom was at its peak. However, the bubble burst a while ago, and the stock continues to lose value.

You don't have to be a savvy investor to outperform ChargePoint. Buying just about any other stock out there would likely get the job done. However, investors who put their money into ChargePoint tend to be speculative growth seekers, and Cipher Mining (CIFR 5.16%) certainly fits that description, making it a viable alternative.

Cipher Mining's infrastructure is the next big thing

Cipher Mining got its start as a Bitcoin miner but has recently pivoted to using its cryptocurrency mining infrastructure to become a landlord for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center tenants. It now focuses on turning its large development pipeline into profitable, long-term leases while managing debt and expansion efforts. Cipher Mining provides the energy and infrastructure necessary for intense AI workloads.

While EV infrastructure faces considerable challenges due to declining electric vehicle sales and the expiration of EV tax credits, Cipher Mining's AI infrastructure is a hot commodity that is bound to become more attractive in the years ahead.

The company has already signed multiple long-term deals with tech giants, including a 15-year deal with Amazon Web Services that comes to $5.5 billion. Cipher Mining has soaring annual recurring revenue that it is leveraging to expand its pipeline. The AI infrastructure leader has 3.4 gigawatts in its pipeline, and the Amazon Web Services deal takes up only 300 megawatts.

The strong demand for Cipher Mining's AI infrastructure is in sharp contrast with ChargePoint's leveled off EV infrastructure demand.

Long-term profits are on the horizon

Neither company has reported a full year of profits for investors, but Cipher Mining is much closer to that goal. The AI infrastructure firm may become profitable in 2026 as new deals boost revenue and eventually translate into higher margins.

Cipher Mining lacks profits because it still makes most of its revenue from crypto mining. The narrative shifted significantly this year with multiple long-term deals, and it should translate into profitable quarters in 2026. The company is also powering more AI data centers as it brings more of its 3.4 gigawatt pipeline online.

A pollution tariff is a lasting solution that brings benefits to our state and our nation for years to come.","By Florida state Rep. Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point

As the U.S. Supreme Court weighs the future of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, it’s worth exploring alternative policies that can still achieve the America First trade agenda with lasting benefits for our nation’s economy and our global environment. A tariff on foreign pollution is a simple, effective and durable solution.

Here in Florida, we invest significant resources — time, energy and money — to restore and protect our environment and strengthen resilience against weather and climate conditions. This year alone, we allocated more than $1.5 billion in environmental protection and restoration projects. Through programs like Florida Forever and the Rural and Family Lands Protection Program, we’re acquiring critical conservation lands and protecting essential wildlife habitats in perpetuity. We’ve adopted a comprehensive strategy to reduce risks of flooding, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural hazards.

All of this was achieved with strong conservative leadership in Florida — Republicans who value our natural resources and know what an important role they play in our economy.

But there is only so much we can do on the state level when many of the threats to our air, water and precious ecosystems in Florida are fueled by foreign countries. We need a federal trade policy to hold foreign polluters accountable.

Countries like China let their industries pollute freely, dumping chemicals into rivers, pumping toxins into the air and throwing plastics into the ocean. These aren’t isolated incidents. They are the foundation of their economic strategy.

President Trump put it plainly: These countries have become “filthy pollution havens.” They ignore the latest technologies and innovations that we use in America to mitigate our impact on the environment, choosing instead to cut corners and poison the planet. Not only do they intentionally harm our environment, but their cheap and dirty practices undercut U.S. manufacturers, harm American businesses and stifle our nation’s prosperity.

That’s why we need to take strong action to rein in China’s pollution and level the playing field for American businesses to compete.

A pollution-based tariff forces foreign producers to pay a price for using lax environmental standards as an inherent subsidy. It goes after how goods are made, not just where they are made. That means it’s harder to evade, harder for China to game and harder for multinational corporations to exploit with clever paper shuffling.

A pollution tariff protects American businesses that already follow the rules. It rewards more efficient domestic manufacturing and helps the United States reshore jobs and supply chains. It strengthens our industrial base with the clean, innovative production methods we excel at here in the United States.

Importantly, the president already has full legal authority to impose tariffs when other nations’ behavior places an unreasonable burden on our economy, including through environmental negligence. The evidence is overwhelming and very difficult for high-polluting foreign governments to credibly challenge.

In addition to executive action, the Foreign Pollution Fee Act offers a strong legislative path to lock this policy in place. The legislation was filed this year by Republican U.S. Sens. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. It would levy fees on the world’s biggest polluters like China and Russia. Not only would this tariff hold foreign countries accountable, it would also boost U.S. manufacturing and incentivize cleaner production abroad.

Congress should advance this initiative to make President Trump’s America First trade revolution permanent. A pollution tariff is a lasting solution that brings benefits to our state and our nation for years to come.

Senate Bill 152, introduced January 5 and referred to the Senate Utilities Committee, proposes a series of changes affecting utility governance, mergers and acquisitions, and cost transparency.

The bill remains in early committee review, but its scope signals a broader legislative interest in how utilities structure transactions, allocate costs, and pass expenses on to ratepayers.

Expanded Approval Requirements for Utility Transactions

At the center of the proposal is a tightening of approval authority for the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Under the bill, utilities would be required to obtain commission approval before selling stock, entering certain contracts, reorganizing corporate structures, or acquiring control of another utility or utility holding company.

The legislation also establishes a right of first refusal if a utility seeks approval to sell or transfer its franchise, works, or system. In such cases, priority would be granted to a municipality where the utility’s assets are located or to a public charitable trust. The provision would apply before a transaction could proceed to other buyers.

Limits on Cost Recovery Through Retail Rates

The bill places new limits on what utilities may recover through retail electric or natural gas rates. It would prohibit the recovery of direct or indirect costs associated with lobbying, legislative activity, political advocacy, litigation tied to legislation or regulatory actions, investor relations, charitable giving, and certain non-regulated programs.

These restrictions extend to affiliated entities, requiring utilities to account for costs billed or allocated from parent companies or subsidiaries. The intent is to prevent customers from subsidizing activities deemed outside the scope of regulated utility service.

New Reporting and Public Disclosure Requirements

Beginning in 2026, energy utilities would be required to file annual reports detailing costs tied to the restricted activities. Required disclosures include employee roles and compensation, affiliate relationships, vendor payments, and internal cost allocations.

The commission would be required to make these reports publicly available on its website, subject to confidentiality protections required under state or federal law. The reporting provisions would significantly expand the level of detail available to regulators, policymakers, and the public.

Early-Stage Legislation With Broader Implications

While Senate Bill 152 is still in the early stages of review, it reflects a broader trend toward increased scrutiny of utility corporate behavior as states grapple with infrastructure investment, affordability concerns, and regulatory accountability.

For Indiana utilities, the proposal signals potential changes to transaction approvals and cost-recovery practices. For industry observers, it adds to a growing body of state-level efforts aimed at tightening oversight of utility governance and financial transparency.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260105-130713-d1c-Monthly%20Utility%20Bills.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 16:13:34.855250

Senate Bill 152, introduced January 5 and referred to the Senate Utilities Committee, proposes a series of changes affecting utility governance, mergers and acquisitions, and cost transparency.

The bill remains in early committee review, but its scope signals a broader legislative interest in how utilities structure transactions, allocate costs, and pass expenses on to ratepayers.

Expanded Approval Requirements for Utility Transactions

At the center of the proposal is a tightening of approval authority for the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Under the bill, utilities would be required to obtain commission approval before selling stock, entering certain contracts, reorganizing corporate structures, or acquiring control of another utility or utility holding company.

The legislation also establishes a right of first refusal if a utility seeks approval to sell or transfer its franchise, works, or system. In such cases, priority would be granted to a municipality where the utility’s assets are located or to a public charitable trust. The provision would apply before a transaction could proceed to other buyers.

Limits on Cost Recovery Through Retail Rates

The bill places new limits on what utilities may recover through retail electric or natural gas rates. It would prohibit the recovery of direct or indirect costs associated with lobbying, legislative activity, political advocacy, litigation tied to legislation or regulatory actions, investor relations, charitable giving, and certain non-regulated programs.

These restrictions extend to affiliated entities, requiring utilities to account for costs billed or allocated from parent companies or subsidiaries. The intent is to prevent customers from subsidizing activities deemed outside the scope of regulated utility service.

New Reporting and Public Disclosure Requirements

Beginning in 2026, energy utilities would be required to file annual reports detailing costs tied to the restricted activities. Required disclosures include employee roles and compensation, affiliate relationships, vendor payments, and internal cost allocations.

The commission would be required to make these reports publicly available on its website, subject to confidentiality protections required under state or federal law. The reporting provisions would significantly expand the level of detail available to regulators, policymakers, and the public.

Early-Stage Legislation With Broader Implications

While Senate Bill 152 is still in the early stages of review, it reflects a broader trend toward increased scrutiny of utility corporate behavior as states grapple with infrastructure investment, affordability concerns, and regulatory accountability.

The facility combines approximately 42 MW of solar capacity with a four-hour battery storage system with a capacity of 35 MW and a storage capacity of 140 MWh.

Arrowleaf is operated under a long-term tolling agreement with the municipal utility San Diego Community Power. According to the company, the project is expected to provide clean energy to nearly one million end customers.

With the commissioning, Ormat’s operational portfolio grows to around 1.7 GW. The project is also part of a hybrid tax-equity structure: in December 2025, Ormat entered into a corresponding partnership with Morgan Stanley Renewables and monetized the project’s tax incentives, resulting in approximately 38 million US dollars flowing directly to the company.

Arrowleaf underscores the importance of the storage segment for Ormat’s strategic direction. In addition to geothermal energy, the company is systematically expanding its involvement in battery storage and solar energy and aligning its growth strategy with the coming years.

CEO Doron Blachar described Arrowleaf as an important milestone. “With this project’s tax benefits having been monetized in December 2025, we successfully collected over $160 million of tax credits in 2025, exceeding our full-year target. This accomplishment further strengthens our balance sheet and cash flow trajectory while supporting continued growth across all of our segments,” said the CEO.

Ormat stock, listed in the renewable-focused RENIXX World index, rose 47.2 percent in 2025 to €94.80. The current price is €98.98.

The U.S. power sector is undergoing a quiet revolution — one that promises to reshape not only generation and transmission, but the very role of retail energy providers, or REPs, and their relationships with end customers.

The last decade was characterized by incremental shifts in competition and procurement strategies. The current decade, by contrast, is being shaped by a fundamental reordering: a cleaner, more distributed generation stack; rising demand driven by electrification and digital infrastructure; and customers who increasingly expect their energy provider to align with their values.

As these trends converge, REPs face a dual challenge. First, they must design and manage a “next-generation supply portfolio” capable of balancing intermittency, price volatility and regulatory shifts. Second, they must ensure that the portfolio they construct resonates with, and is trusted by, their customer base. Making this “next-gen mix” not purely technical, but rather, a strategic integration of supply optimization and customer alignment.

Structural shifts in the US power market

One of the most consequential stories of the last year is clean energy’s rise, and the benchmark it represents for retail providers.

In its US Electricity 2025 Special Report, energy think tank Ember confirmed the country’s electricity sector is at an inflection point as wind and solar have overtaken coal in the national generation mix, with fossil fuels now accounting for less than half of the country’s power mix for the first time on record, signaling a systemic shift is underway.

The Business Council for Sustainable Energy 2025 Key Trends Report echoes Ember’s finding, noting that renewables — particularly wind, solar and storage — have comprised a record share of new build capacity additions over the last year.

This, as overall electricity demand has ballooned to one of the sharpest surges this century. The growing demand driven by data centers, electrification (EVs, heat pumps), new industrial loads and increased digital consumption, marking a dramatic departure from the flat demand that defined much of the 2010s.

The confluence of these trends carries significant implications for retail energy providers in deregulated markets, fundamentally shifting the supply side and reshaping the way electric energy retailers think about procurement and risk.

A framework published in the energy and engineering scientific research journal, Energies, describes this “next-generation retail electricity market” as one that will be increasingly shaped by decentralization, digitization and decarbonization. The paper’s authors make the case that distributed energy resources, advanced metering and smart grid technologies will soon blur the boundary between wholesale and retail, requiring REPs to evolve from a commodity model into a services and market orchestration one.

Supply portfolios in transition

By aligning their supply portfolios with the clean energy transition and customer preferences, retail energy providers can position themselves as leaders in the next-generation energy mix, driving customer satisfaction and long-term growth. These structural changes, however, place new demands on supply portfolio management.

Ember’s US Electricity 2025 Special Report highlights how solar and storage now dominate new additions, but their variability means portfolios built solely on renewable contracts risk exposure to imbalance charges and real-time market volatility. Market intelligence and analytics solutions provider for the power industry, Ascend Analytics, reinforces this view, adding that rising demand and congestion in key markets (e.g., ERCOT, PJM) amplify this risk.

The implication is that REPs must adopt a more diversified approach with a resilient portfolio that integrates the following:

Diversification of energy sources, including traditional generation and renewables.

Renewable power purchasing agreements and green products to meet consumer demand for clean energy and sustainability.

Dispatchable resources to hedge and protect against volatility.

Storage and demand response capacity to monetize flexibility.

This mirrors Enode’s prediction that flexibility will become a core value stream for electric energy retailers. Where historically flexibility was a system operator concern, today it’s evolved into a business model opportunity for REPs who can aggregate and monetize DERs, design dynamic pricing and deploy storage assets.

Essentially, by aligning their supply portfolios with the clean energy transition and customer preferences, retail energy providers can position themselves as leaders in the next-generation energy mix, driving customer satisfaction and long-term growth.

Customer expectations, trust and generational dynamics

But all the supply-side sophistication in the world counts for little if a retailer can’t win and retain customers. And consumer behavior in energy markets is evolving, with an increasing demand for transparency from providers about the source of their power, the carbon footprint of their usage, and the options available to them for aligning their consumption with their values

So while supply portfolios are becoming more complex, the rising demand for personalization, trust, flexibility and digital-first experiences are what will win share in the retail market as customer-centricity is set to define the next stage of retail competition.

Beyond that, generational value differences are emerging: whether it’s Boomers prioritizing reliability and simplicity, or Gen-Z demanding climate-aligned energy, providers must calibrate offerings to diverse segments.

For REPs, this means that designing the right supply mix is inseparable from how that mix is communicated. The same diversified portfolio that manages risk on the supply side must also be translated into products and messages that resonate with diverse customer groups.

Taken together, these sources point to a clear conclusion: the next-generation retail energy mix is as much about alignment as it is about diversification. On the supply side, portfolios must balance renewables, storage, demand response and risk management tools to ensure reliability and cost stability. On the customer side, REPs must engage segments with transparency, personalization and value-based offerings.

Read More in Generation

The Energies scientific journal article, The Next-Generation Retail Electricity Market in the Context of Distributed Energy Resources: Vision and Integrating Framework, is a reminder that the electric retail energy market of the future is not just a conduit between wholesale and end-use, but rather a dynamic platform that integrates grid-edge resources, mediates between central markets and local needs and provides differentiated value to customers. In this sense, the supply portfolio and the customer audience are two sides of the same strategic coin.

Implications for retail energy providers

The path forward for REPs in deregulated markets is not optional, it’s a strategic necessity. The combined lessons of the above cited research and analyses suggest it’s imperative for REPs to adopt the following now:

Build flexibility into supply portfolio (physical and contractual). Demand response, storage and DER aggregation should be treated as core supply resources, not ancillary services.

Segment offerings by customer values. Develop differentiated products for diverse customer groups that map to generational and demographic preferences.

Treat supply and customer engagement as integrated strategy, not separate silos. Prioritize transparency and communicate the composition and rationale of the supply mix to build trust and loyalty.

Engage in regulatory and market design conversations. The shape of compensation and market access for DERs will determine the competitive landscape.

Invest in digital infrastructure. Smart platforms and analytics are critical for optimizing both supply-side decisions and customer engagement.

The energy transition is no longer a distant prospect, it’s here. Renewable penetration, demand growth, DER integration and evolving customer expectations are converging to redefine deregulated retail energy markets. The “Next-Generation Mix” is not a simple procurement formula, but a framework for uniting supply strategy with audience expectations.

For REPs, the opportunity — and the challenge — is to move beyond managing kilowatt-hours and toward orchestrating portfolios that reflect both the realities of modern supply and the values of modern customers. Those who succeed will not only weather the volatility of today’s markets but will also position themselves as trusted partners in the energy systems of tomorrow.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/8TRmknKdAB2Nc6X6zRnaSbzY8R1lTOdOfCitXwu12W8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzIxOTM1NzYyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-07 12:14:35.169160

HARRISBURG — Democrats and Republicans who lead the Pennsylvania legislature have singled out increasing energy production as a goal for the year, as electricity prices rise and demand increases.

Consumers could feel an even greater squeeze in the years ahead, as utility companies predict that efforts to build data centers across the state to meet the artificial intelligence demand will worsen the crunch.

But environmental and labor advocates are skeptical that lawmakers can overcome partisanship in the state Capitol and take meaningful action.

That skepticism persists despite a major policy hurdle — which led to legal fights costing taxpayers more than $4.2 million — now being out of the way.

As a part of a $50.1 billion budget deal that resolved a four-month impasse, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and members of his party who control the state House agreed to pull out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The controversial interstate program would have capped the total amount of carbon emissions that some companies in Pennsylvania could emit and forced them to pay for each ton emitted.

Leaving RGGI was a major Republican goal. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that his chamber was unlikely to move energy legislation until the state courts resolved a lawsuit regarding Pennsylvania’s entrance into the program.

With the program out of the way, Shapiro said he expects action.

“For years, the Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production. Today, that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “It is time now to look forward.”

Energy auctions in Pennsylvania offer a window into the challenge facing utility companies and consumers. The auctions are held by the operator of the state’s vast energy grid and are used to procure enough electricity for the future, and in recent years, prices have skyrocketed. In 2024, prices increased by more than 800% from the year prior. And at the December auction, energy prices hit a record high and would likely have increased further without a cap agreed to as part of legal action brought by Shapiro.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission also told consumers this past summer that the state saw “soaring power usage during multiple heat waves since mid-June and scorching conditions that pushed electricity demand on the regional power grid to its highest level in 14 years.” Supply and demand are the biggest factors in prices, an expert told Spotlight PA at the time.

Rob Routh, a lawyer and advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he’s watching the state Senate in particular to see if lawmakers are willing to move legislation that would increase renewable energy production or if the caucus will only support the natural gas industry.

“Are they just going to be ideologically fixed on one type of resource to generate electricity — gas?” Routh told Spotlight PA. “Are they willing to consider an all-of-the-above energy approach, or is it an explicit rejection of renewables?”

More energy on the table

Lawmakers’ proposals to increase energy production take many approaches — from speeding up permitting to adjusting tax credits. They’ve also focused on various industries, from solar to nuclear power.

Shapiro told reporters that he wants to see state Senate Republicans pass his energy package, a slate of bills also known as the “Lightning Plan.”

It includes legislation that would amend some tax credits to benefit clean energy production, create a new board to streamline permitting for energy projects, and require electric companies to buy more renewable energy.

Another key part of Shapiro’s plan is to create a Pennsylvania-specific carbon cap-and-trade program, similar to RGGI. A majority of the payments from power producers to emit carbon dioxide — 70% — “would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bill,” according to the Shapiro administration.

Pittman has shot down that idea outright, saying that his caucus is not interested in supporting “any type of artificial cap-and-trade” program.

He has been more open to the other parts of the plan. He told Spotlight PA that revisiting the renewable energy standards “has merit,” and that the caucus is “willing to have a conversation over” the tax credit rewrites. These tax credits currently can be claimed by companies for a variety of purchases, including natural gas to manufacture petrochemicals, milk for dairy processing, and hydrogen fuel. Shapiro’s rewrite would include a new tax credit for clean energy producers.

“We would certainly be willing to have a conversation about any initiatives that help speed up projects in development so shovels get in the ground as soon as possible,” Pittman said.

Pittman said his caucus’ energy priorities include efforts “to enhance the use of our resources,” naming carbon capture as an example — a process through which carbon emissions are contained before they reach the atmosphere and are injected into deep underground wells. The waste can also be used to drill for more oil.

He also talked about speeding up efforts “to lower the taxes on job creators,” and issuing permits more quickly. However, he did not name specific legislation that he would support in the new year.

“I really think the best approach is to be as nimble and inviting as possible, to not try to have government programs and government initiatives artificially attempt to drive the marketplace,” Pittman told Spotlight PA days after the final budget deal.

Renewable energy, not climate protection

State House Democrats have proposed a range of legislation to lower barriers to increasing renewable or low-carbon energy sources, such as requiring that new warehouses be built to be compatible with solar panels and reducing permitting fees for small nuclear power plants.

Both the state House and Senate have passed bills that touch on solar energy with bipartisan support in recent years, although they had different goals.

Last session, the state House passed a proposal that would allow third parties to operate community solar energy facilities, which consumers could opt into. The idea is that “solar energy reduces the load on the grid while lowering electric bills,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The bill was reintroduced last year, but hasn’t been considered by either chamber.

Last summer, the state Senate passed a measure that would tighten oversight of Pennsylvania’s growing solar energy industry to help ensure that solar panels are properly decommissioned and all waste is properly disposed of. The requirements would not apply to homes and businesses that use solar panels to “generate electricity for their own use,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The full state House has not taken it up.

Katie Blume, legislative director for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, doubts that Democrats and Republicans will push energy bills to the finish line.

She pointed to other unresolved disagreements, including the regulation of slot-like skill games, that both parties have agreed are priorities but have been unable to advance.

“Why should I have faith in the Senate to do anything on energy, let alone affordability, when they can’t even figure out skill games in their own caucus?” Blume told Spotlight PA.

Rob Bair, chair of the Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council, which represents many unionized workers who build power plants, echoed Blume’s concern. Bair said lawmakers will have to compromise and bolster both natural gas and solar, industries that are often pitted against each other.

“Everyone understands we need to do it,” Bair said of increasing power generation in the state. “But we are watching everything closely to see if the chambers can actually come together.”

Environmental protection bills have even worse odds of passing the General Assembly, said state Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware) at a December advisory committee meeting on climate change issue.

Vitali said that the “political reality” in the Capitol is that legislators have to focus on proposals that are “in conformance [with] labor and labor jobs.”

“Climate isn’t among the top five issues of legislators,” Vitali said. “There’s a need for leadership. … They have to do more than introducing bills and paying [climate change] lip service.”

Data centers on deck

Lawmakers have also singled out data centers as a major reason to increase energy production in the state.

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build out data centers in Pennsylvania. These facilities require huge amounts of both energy and clean water — the latter is used to cool the campuses. One projection estimates that global energy demand will increase by up to 165% by the end of the decade because of AI.

At the same time, Pennsylvania’s grid operator — PJM Interconnection — is seeing record-high prices at energy auctions. Those higher prices trickle down to consumers, according to utilities.

The most recent energy auction hit the price cap negotiated by Shapiro and the grid operator, and still failed to procure the amount of energy PJM had targeted.

Pittman has also identified data centers as a key cause for increasing energy production in the state. Though he has not identified specific regulatory procedures that he supports for the burgeoning industry, he said consumer prices and energy production go hand in hand.

“The best way to protect consumers with the advent of data centers is to make sure supply meets demand,” Pittman said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “We want to see responsible growth of data centers. We want to see [the] responsible growth of power supply.”

Any energy-related legislation will likely be referred to the state Senate’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, and its chair, Gene Yaw (R., Lycoming), said he doesn’t think more renewable energy is the answer.

“Renewable energies and data centers, they don’t go together at all,” Yaw told Spotlight PA. “Data centers require continuous, non-intermittent power. And renewable power — it’s intermittent and of limited duration at best.“

Routh, the advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said gas plants have their own limitations and argued that Yaw’s comments ignore the effectiveness of battery storage technology for renewable energy.

Still, he called the data center issue “top of mind for legislators and their constituents,” and said there’s potential for state House Democrats and Senate Republicans to collaborate on regulating their energy usage.

He pointed to a bipartisan agreement in the state budget deal related to the PUC, which oversees utilities across Pennsylvania. The legislation, which is now law, allows the agency to review and validate utility companies’ predictions to PJM of the amount of electricity needed — those estimates help set costs for consumers.

​​Routh said that one bill he’s keeping an eye on would direct the commission to draft regulations to oversee data centers and prevent spikes in electricity costs.

“It’s a new issue. It’s the key driver for why people’s electric bills are going to be going up in Pennsylvania,” Routh said. “There is the potential for bills around data centers to break through traditional partisan ideological lines.”",https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01mn-gcy1-ywjz-yr0y-1280x853.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 13:00:35.127440

In order to meet that demand, we need fast, dependable options. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are the fastest path to new capacity, thanks to their agile deployment and ability to support flexible interconnections.

These advantages, among others, have positioned storage as the most immediate solution to meeting growing global energy demand while also addressing the reliability requirements of large loads. That said, battery storage is only as good as its uptime, and ensuring that BESS is available when it matters most comes down to its software controls.

COMMENTARY

Battery software is also becoming increasingly important as the power landscape becomes more dynamic. Early BESS applications were primarily focused on single-value use cases, such as peak shaving and energy arbitrage. Now, evolving grid conditions and new large loads, such as for artificial intelligence and data centers, are giving rise to more complex and flexible battery storage operations, where advanced software must orchestrate various grid services and behind-the-meter load management needs. Hybrid sites, like solar-plus-storage, are also on the rise, and can benefit from advanced software to control and co-optimize multiple assets, reducing complexity and costs.

All of that is to say: battery storage isn’t the solution on its own. Power producers and large-load customers need storage paired with a modern energy management system (EMS) to deliver reliable capacity, serve dynamic AI-driven loads, and protect project economics.

Back to the Basics: Why the Right EMS Software Matters

The EMS is the control layer that optimizes battery storage and other energy assets, ensuring the grid or customer gets the right services at the right times and that operators capture the most revenue opportunity. An EMS acts as the brain behind the battery, overseeing and communicating with all subsystems to dictate how and when to store or dispatch energy, respond in real-time to market demands, and share predictive analytics to maximize asset life. The EMS is a small portion of a project budget, yet choosing the right software plays an outsized role in a project’s return on investment (ROI).

To see why, let’s look at a hot summer day: two identical battery sites face the same grid conditions, but one runs on a bare-bones EMS and the other on a high-performance platform.

Mid-afternoon, the transmission operator calls to say your site is delivering 90 MW instead of its contracted 100 MW. With a basic EMS, the operator is stuck sifting through raw data, trying to isolate the issue while the clock is ticking on the highest-value hours of the year. After finally diagnosing the issue, a technician is dispatched to the site, and the project continues to incur lost revenue and potential penalties until the problem is resolved.

With a high-performance EMS, the same fault looks very different. The software continuously benchmarks expected versus actual performance, detects the deviation immediately, and quickly isolates a root cause. In many cases, it resolves the issue remotely or guides a fix before output drops far enough to trigger an operator call. Additionally, with fleet-level dashboards, real-time alerts, and site-specific controls, operators can keep availability high across dozens of projects to maximize revenue during the times it matters most.

Battery Availability is the Real Asset

That contrast between a reactive scramble and proactive control highlights how project value depends on battery availability, and the EMS is what ensures it. The best way for battery storage operators to protect their revenue is by minimizing unplanned downtime and ensuring that planned downtime, such as maintenance, doesn’t coincide with high-earning events. An advanced EMS supports this strategy in a few key ways.

First, preventative maintenance. Delays in maintenance can cause accelerated battery degradation, so an EMS that proactively identifies maintenance needs and optimizes maintenance schedules will keep batteries running at a high level for longer.

Second, rapid issue detection, so problems don’t escalate. An advanced EMS supports faster fault recovery and helps identify and resolve issues quickly, allowing a site to get back online and generate revenue. An EMS coupled with remote monitoring also provides operators with real-time updates on site performance, so that high-earning events are never missed.

And finally, proactive battery health insights. Advanced EMS functionality can also unlock more precise state-of-health diagnostics based on actual site conditions, rather than generic projections, so asset managers can more accurately plan for augmentation timelines and implement strategies that extend battery life.

The EMS Protects and Grows Storage ROI

ROI from battery storage is won by avoiding downtime and capturing market opportunities. Your revenue model assumes the system will deliver contracted output when called, pass performance tests, and respond within required timelines. A bare-bones EMS puts that at risk: faults take longer to diagnose, dispatch targets can be missed, and operators are forced into manual workarounds, like in the summer day scenario. The result is money left on the table because of under-delivery or penalties, plus the longer-term cost of losing trust with grid operators and offtakers. A high-performance EMS protects ROI by ensuring the asset reliably delivers on its commitments.

On the other hand, capturing upside hinges on being available during the few extreme peak events, such as summer heatwaves and winter cold snaps, that put the most stress on the grid, require the most agility, and drive a large share of annual earnings. If a battery is down in those windows, there’s a significant hit to yearly revenue. Advanced EMS controls keep systems healthy, schedule maintenance away from peak risk, and catch issues early so the project earns when it matters most.

In the long term, ROI also depends on staying adaptive over an asset’s lifespan, as market and grid priorities evolve, regulations change, and value streams shift. The EMS is how storage keeps up without expensive retrofits or constant retuning. ERCOT is a good example: grid service economics have moved quickly, rewarding operators who can update participation strategies in response. Or in Europe, where new markets are emerging while others become saturated, leading project owners to diversify their revenue streams. The right EMS doesn’t just improve performance today; it future-proofs profitability and supports scale over time.

Software Will Define the Next Phase of American Energy

As electricity demand rises, the grid needs highly available and reliable BESS that can come online quickly to meet demand challenges. Software optimizes batteries to meet these grid needs.

Operators that implement an advanced EMS, whether in new projects or retroactively in existing projects, and who work with hardware-agnostic EMS providers will see benefits: availability when it matters most, reduced downtime, preventative maintenance and predictive insights, and flexibility to meet evolving power needs. All of that translates to more revenue for owners, better support for large-load customers, and improved service to the grid as demand rises.

Historically, much of the power sector has been defined by physical infrastructure and steel in the ground, but now, the future of the power sector will be defined by advanced software to solve our biggest energy challenges.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/remote-operating-center-roc-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:01:42.339419

From Wintry to Warm in One Month

Balanced between a chilly start and a warmer finish, our December temperatures were near-normal overall in North Carolina. The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) reports a preliminary statewide average temperature of 41.8°F and our 64th-coolest December out of the past 131 years.

Monthly average temperatures were generally closer to normal in the west and cooler in the east. Hickory matched its normal temperature in tying for its 35th-warmest December in the past 75 years, and Charlotte likewise was near-normal with a tie for its 51st-warmest December since 1878.

Other major Piedmont sites were 2 degrees cooler than normal. That included Greensboro, which tied for its 61st-coolest December; Raleigh in its 53rd-coolest December; and Fayetteville in a tie for its 37th-coolest December on record.

Among coastal stations, Wilmington tied for its 38th-coolest December, Hatteras had its 31st-coolest December, and Elizabeth City tied for its 17th-coolest December dating back to 1934. This was also its coldest December since 2010.

Early on, a series of cold fronts and Arctic air masses kept cold air in place, including 12 consecutive nights with below-freezing temperatures in Raleigh – the longest such streak there in December since 2005.

Our coldest day on December 15 saw low temperatures dip into the single digits at higher elevations, the 10s elsewhere, and even down to 23°F at Hatteras – the coldest morning there and in many areas since December 24, 2022.

Following that frigid Monday, temperatures quickly rebounded with 60s across eastern North Carolina by December 17 and even in the Mountains on December 18.

The next week was even warmer as high pressure to our south pushed temperatures into the 70s. Charlotte shattered its record highs on both Christmas Eve, reaching 77°F, and Christmas Day, at 79°F — the warmest December day there since 2007. Greensboro also set a new record on December 25, with a high of 75°F.

Fifteen years after the last White Christmas for much of North Carolina, this holiday was decidedly less wintry as part of a late-month temperature turnaround. Those extremes are evident in the final stats: even Wilmington had the same number of nights below freezing (13) as it did days hitting 60°F or warmer. From cold to warm, there was little in-between in December.

Another Dry Month in Most Areas

Our dry fall weather continued into the start of winter, with below-normal precipitation across the Mountains and Piedmont. NCEI notes a preliminary statewide average precipitation of 2.44 inches, which ranks as the 25th-driest December in North Carolina since 1895.

As in November, much of the state saw less than 2 inches of precipitation in December, with totals generally increasing from west to east. The driest sites included Marshall, which had only 0.83 inches in its 6th-driest December on record, and Asheville with just 1.18 inches in its 14th-driest December.

Charlotte totaled 1.82 inches in its 20th-driest December, Greensboro had 1.80 inches to tie for its 21st-driest December, and Raleigh finished the month with exactly 2.00 inches and its 27th-driest December on record.

Coastal sites fared better thanks to multiple significant rain events. An offshore low pressure system on December 2 brought an inch or two of rain across the Coastal Plain, including up to 2.37 inches at our ECONet station in Whiteville – the first day with more than an inch of rain there since October 12.

A similar system on December 5 and 6 dropped more than an inch of rain along our southern coastline, and a passing cold front on December 18 and 19 brought more widespread totals of about an inch statewide.

Some coastal areas even picked up a bit of snow on December 14 as cold air moving over the warm water of the Albemarle Sound generated a narrow band of quick-hitting but accumulating “sound-effect” snow between Plymouth and Lake Mattamuskeet.

That precipitation in all forms added up to 5.44 inches in Hatteras for its 37th-wettest December on record, while Ocracoke had 4.99 inches in its 12th-wettest December out of 40 years with observations. New Bern was a quarter-inch above normal with 3.88 inches and its 29th-wettest December since 1948.

The heavier rainfall totals along the coastline helped soil moisture levels bounce back to above normal and drought conditions to ease in parts of southeastern North Carolina. However, drier weather farther west led to the expansion of Moderate Drought into the Mountains as groundwater levels declined throughout the month of December.

While drought has shifted from east to west, the bottom line is that drought remains widespread, affecting almost 60% of the state at the end of 2025.

Record Roundup from 2025

Christmas wasn’t the only record-breaking day this year. From temperatures to extreme precipitation impacts, 2025 featured a number of local records all across the state.

Warm extremes far outnumbered cold ones, including five daily record high temperatures broken or tied in Raleigh. Those ranged from an unseasonable 80-degree day on February 4 to a sizzling 100°F on back-to-back days in late June.

July was notable for its warm nights, and based on the average minimum temperature, it was the warmest month on record in North Carolina. Raleigh tied its all-time record warm low temperature of 80°F on July 18 – one of 22 daily record warm nights in the capital city in 2025.

We followed July with a much cooler August, and Greensboro tied its record cool high temperatures on three days in a row that month. It reached only 69°F on August 5 and 6, and 75°F on August 7.

The summer also featured a soaking from Tropical Storm Chantal that broke several records across the central Piedmont. Burlington (5.75 inches), Chapel Hill (7.65 inches), and Yanceyville (8.68 inches) each set new single-day rainfall records, and gauges on the Haw and Eno rivers reached new record crests.

We even saw several precipitation records of a frozen variety last year. The mid-January snow event finally ended snow-free streaks that had lasted more than 1,000 days across the Piedmont, including record-long streaks of 1,084 days in Marion and Shelby, and 1,076 days in Charlotte.

On February 19 and 20, Elizabeth City picked up 8 inches of snow, which was its third-greatest February snow on record and the most in that month since 1980. An unusually snowy year in northeastern North Carolina resumed in November, with the earliest measurable snow on record in Edenton on November 11.

Despite those precipitation events, drought was a major storyline throughout the year, and the source of several other records. In March streamflows on the North Fork Swannanoa River in Buncombe County and Indian Creek in Lincoln County reached new monthly record low levels. And in both November and December, the Smith River at Eden bottomed out at new monthly record low streamflows.

If all goes as planned, the 400-megawatt plant would become the world’s first fusion plant providing steady power to the grid—enough to power about 300,000 homes.
Whereas traditional nuclear fission energy creates power by splitting atoms, fusion uses heat to create energy by melding them together.
The deal is for a so-called merger of equals with Trump Media, which will become a Truth Social media, cryptocurrency, and fusion power conglomerate.
The running joke is that fusion power is mythical and it’s always 30 years away.","Backed by Nvidia, Google, Mitsubishi, Bill Gates, and more, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) leads the nascent fusion sector in funding, contracts, and has the advantage of being founded earlier than most in 2018 through a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“Fusion is no longer a science project; it’s actually the next big thing in tech,” Mumgaard said.

CFS is currently building its SPARC demonstration project outside of Boston, and just installed the first of 18 high-temperature, D-shaped superconducting magnets that power the machinery. The magnets that CFS manufactures are theoretically strong enough to lift an aircraft carrier out of the water, Mumgaard said. SPARC will nearly be completed by the end of 2026 and will produce its first plasma energy in 2027.

“The main argument against fusion is making it work, and that’s why we’re building SPARC and showing that it can work,” Mumgaard told Fortune in an interview prior to the keynote. “That will be a big moment for fusion overall, not just for us.”

If SPARC succeeds, CFS’ first commercial fusion plant, ARC, is slated to be built and to come online in the early 2030s just outside of Richmond, Virginia. If all goes as planned, the 400-megawatt plant would become the world’s first fusion plant providing steady power to the grid—enough to power about 300,000 homes.

Whereas traditional nuclear fission energy creates power by splitting atoms, fusion uses heat to create energy by melding them together. In the simplest form, it fuses hydrogen found in water into an extremely hot, electrically charged state known as plasma to create helium—the same process that powers the sun. When executed properly, the process triggers endless reactions to make energy for electricity. But stars rely on overwhelming gravitational pressure to force their fusion. Here on Earth, creating and containing the pressure needed to force the reaction in a consistent, controlled way remains an engineering challenge.

CFS is now working with Nvidia Omniverse AI tech and Siemens industrial software to create a digital twin of the SPARC project to experiment, process data, and answer questions without having to open up the physical machinery. CFS also works with Google DeepMind AI systems. CFS likens DeepMind to a co-pilot and the Nvidia digital twin to the virtual airplane.

“The way to think about it is that the physical world and the digital world are increasingly merging, and we’re increasingly able to get the best out of both sides,” Mumgaard said, arguing that he’s optimistic the digital twin tech will accelerate the development of ARC.

Trumped up competition

There is of course competition, including even from the Trump family.

In December, the Trump Media & Technology Group and fusion developer TAE Technologies announced an unexpected $6 billion merger to become the first fusion player to go public—soon owned in part by the Trump family—on a belief that an influx of capital will speed up the launch of fusion power on the grid.

The deal is for a so-called merger of equals with Trump Media, which will become a Truth Social media, cryptocurrency, and fusion power conglomerate.

“Having a public fusion company was something I think the industry always expected to happen. I don’t think anyone had it on their bingo card for it to happen quite this way. But it’s good to have one, and I wish them success,” Mumgaard told Fortune. “With the Trump connection, fusion has been bipartisan, and we’d like to make sure it stays bipartisan.”

CFS also is racing against others competitors such as Helion—backed by OpenAI’s Sam Altman and SoftBank—which aims to build a fusion plant east of Seattle to power Microsoft data centers.

CFS is the leader in the most common form of fusion tech—the oddly named “tokamak.” The tokamak—shortened from toroidal chamber magnetic—relies on its powerful magnets. The design essentially involves a massive, doughnut-shaped machine that traps the plasma in a high-temperature, superconducting magnetic field.

The running joke is that fusion power is mythical and it’s always 30 years away. Not so any longer, Mumgaard said, even if it will still take a couple of decades before fusion is a key player in the global power grid.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251229-SPARC-digital-twin-3-e1767742454456.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-07 11:59:41.334569

INDIANAPOLIS - The Indiana Chamber of Commerce today announced its top legislative priorities for the 2026 legislative session. Among the list are addressing barriers to work-based learning opportunities, tort reform to help maintain a business-friendly climate and creating additional childcare options.

All of the organization’s goals align with its current visioning plan for the state, Indiana Prosperity 2035 (IP35). A survey of Indiana Chamber member companies at the end of 2025 solidified that the IP35 pillar of Economic Growth, Innovation and Entrepreneurship ranked as the most critical area for the organization’s increased involvement, with the Education and Workforce pillars rounding out the top trio.

“This session, we are focusing on the policies we believe will have the biggest impact on employers, particularly small employers, and can get accomplished in the short timeframe we have,” says Indiana Chamber President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “What they all have in common is preserving or improving Indiana’s economic competitiveness in various areas and overall business climate. We look forward to working with lawmakers, Governor Braun and other stakeholders to advance bills that make that happen.”

The full list of the Indiana Chamber’s 2026 legislative priorities:

Ensure tax conformity or decoupling with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OB3) to maintain Indiana’s competitive tax status

“Indiana has worked over many years to maintain a tax code that is broad-based, stable and relatively easy for individuals and employers to navigate. We have and will continue to urge state leaders to take action around OB3 to ensure clarity for taxpayers and ongoing stability in Indiana’s tax system.”

Enact tort reform to protect those unjustly targeted and improve the state’s business climate

“Smart tort reform is not about limiting legitimate claims; it’s about ensuring a level playing field, reducing uncertainty and protecting employers who operate responsibly – all in the interest of economic growth. Indiana has long benefited from a reputation as a balanced, business-friendly state that values fairness while discouraging abusive litigation practices. Maintaining that reputation matters, particularly as competition among states for high-growth companies and innovation-driven investment intensifies.”

The Indiana Chamber is part of the Indiana Alliance for Legal Reform, a new nonprofit entity seeking state-level civil and tort law reforms, announced in late December and comprised of statewide groups and Indiana-based businesses.

Establish a sustainable, scalable approach to addressing liability barriers for employers hiring students under 18 years old for work-based learning experiences

“If Indiana wants to be a leader in work-based learning and grow its own talent pipeline, we must address barriers to participation on both sides. For employers, too often the obstacle is around liability insurance; we need to determine a long-term solution that is accessible to multiple industries and sizes of corporate partners.”

Establish framework to enable scholarship granting organizations (SGOs) to serve children aged five and under in childcare settings

“One of the things we hear repeatedly from our member companies is the need to do more around childcare to help families and employers. By allowing designated scholarship granting organizations to offer scholarships to qualified childcare providers for preschool students, it should reduce some of the strain on the federal Child Care and Development Fund and enable more Hoosiers to return to the workforce and increase their household income. Plus, employers benefit from a deeper talent pool to fill their job openings.”

Provide the option for township government elimination to maximize resources and efficiency

“We have been chipping away at common sense local government reform for years. This is the next step in that modernization by allowing township governments that are within another unit of local government to essentially eliminate themselves to better serve their residents. There is support from some of these impacted municipalities to do just that; they recognize the redundancy and want to consider this option.”

Build on economic development collaboration across the state to continue momentum for initiatives in all regions

Enhance workplace safety by allowing employers to act quickly when credible threats of violence emerge

Here's a blueprint. - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/data-centers/pjm-needs-flexible-data-centers,"To approve flexible interconnections, utilities, grid operators, and data center developers must have data on power flows from generators across high-voltage transmission grid networks to giant power users.
Ultimately, the new data underscores in the most definitive terms yet that flexible interconnection is viable in PJM, Atkinson said.
PJM’s missing link for flexible data centers PJM isn’t the only grid operator or utility facing data center–driven cost pressures.
That lack of consensus has prevented PJM from developing a key policy that could allow flexible interconnection to happen, Atkinson said.
In December, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered PJM to create structures that would allow data centers and other big customers to connect to its grid in more flexible ways.","Federal regulators are demanding that PJM Interconnection, the country’s biggest power market, find a faster way to connect data centers to the grid without spiking energy costs or threatening reliability.

Those regulators and other energy experts increasingly believe that a practice known as flexible interconnection is key to juggling those imperatives — and a recent study offers compelling supporting evidence.

Flexible interconnection is simple in principle: Power-hungry customers like data centers supply their own power during the handful of hours per year when overstressed grids can’t handle their needs, allowing them to get online much faster and also save money for customers at large.

But to date, only a handful of utilities and grid operators have developed the technical and regulatory structures to make flexible interconnection a reality.

Astrid Atkinson, CEO of Camus Energy, and Carlo Brancucci, CEO of Encoord, whose companies aim to enable flexible interconnection, say that PJM could deploy the practice on a large scale. That argument is backed by a unique analysis of real-world conditions — modeled across every hour of the year on the same transmission grids that PJM manages — conducted by Camus, Encoord, and Princeton University’s ZERO Lab.

Their December report looks at six sites in mid-Atlantic states served by PJM. It concludes that a 500-megawatt data center using flexible interconnection and providing its own power during times of peak demand could connect three to five years faster than one that has to wait for grid upgrades and new power plants to be built in order to support its full power needs. By paying for the resources to cover any peak demand deficits, these flexible data centers would avoid passing those grid and generation costs on to customers already struggling with rising energy bills tied to data center growth, the report contends.

What’s more, the methods used in the report can be used by grid operators and utilities in PJM and across the country to enable other real-world flexible interconnection studies using standard interconnection tools and datasets, Brancucci said. ​“Everything else flows from that — what type of interconnection you need, what type of flexibility you need, what kind of contracts and agreements you need.”

“Our companies both offer commercial products that can do this,” said Atkinson, who co-founded Camus in 2019 after leading the team that maintains reliable computing for Google, the report’s sponsor and the preeminent tech giant working on real-world flexible interconnection projects today. In fact, she said, ​“we’re doing commercial modeling of similar sites right now.”

Filing in the data gaps

Data center flexibility is a hot topic. Recent reports from Duke University, think tank RMI, and analytics firms GridLab and Telos Energy all explore its viability and benefits.

But the report from Camus, Encoord, and ZERO Lab differs in a few ways that make it a far more practical blueprint for flexible interconnection, Atkinson said.

The first thing that distinguishes their report is that it uses in-depth, real-world data.

To approve flexible interconnections, utilities, grid operators, and data center developers must have data on power flows from generators across high-voltage transmission grid networks to giant power users. ​“You do need privileged data access to do this,” Atkinson said — and other research teams haven’t had that access.

But Camus, which provides grid orchestration software for utilities across the United States, including Pennsylvania’s PPL Electric Utilities and Duquesne Light Co., has that data for the six sites it modeled, Atkinson said. She wouldn’t reveal which utilities provided the data or the location of the sites, which in the report were given animal names such as Koala, Pony, Shark, and Whale. But she did confirm that they represent realistic targets for flexible interconnection.

The second thing that sets the report apart, according to Brancucci, is that it integrates the real-world operating conditions and constraints of the transmission networks serving data center sites. To do that, they used Encoord’s software platform, which simulates how real-world transmission networks operate during all 8,760 hours of the year.

“A 500-megawatt demand will have major impacts on any utility,” said Brancucci, who co-founded Encoord in 2019 after working as a senior research engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado and as a researcher at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. ​“That will change the way power flows. And when power flow changes, you need to consider different security constraints.”

Such analyses consider not just business-as-usual conditions but also emergencies when power plants or transmission lines fail and grid operators must act quickly to prevent widespread outages. ​“This is the type of transmission analysis any ISO or utility is going to do when considering new load,” he said, and it’s a must-have for approving a new 500-megawatt customer.

Encoord works with transmission system operators and utilities struggling to ensure reliable service under a variety of conditions, including during winter storms when fossil gas systems fail. ​“If 10 utilities and 10 hyperscalers came to us and said, ​‘We want to interconnect across 10 sites,’ we could redo this easily,” Brancucci said.

The results for the six sites in the December report show that transmission constraints would force four of them to curtail significant portions of their 500-megawatt peak power demand or build enough on-site generation and battery storage to cover these gaps — but only for less than 35 hours per year. The other two sites did not have transmission constraints.

The third thing that distinguishes their report is that they were able to tap into a model developed by researchers at ZERO Lab and MIT to assess how adding data centers to the grid would affect the amount of generation capacity that PJM needs to cost-effectively meet peak electricity demand.

That model enabled them to analyze how individual data centers could secure a mix of faster-to-build power sources, including solar power, wind power, and hybrid renewable-battery systems, as well as secure commitments from other customers willing to lower their power use to cover data centers’ needs through demand response or virtual power plants.

Ultimately, the new data underscores in the most definitive terms yet that flexible interconnection is viable in PJM, Atkinson said. And if PJM were to allow it, data center developers would likely be more than willing to take on the responsibility of securing their own resources to relieve those rare constraints, she added. Doing so could allow them to get online in two or three years, rather than needing to wait five to seven years for new transmission or generation.

“Data centers are willing to pay more if they can connect, in many cases, because the opportunity costs” of being forced to wait for years ​“far outweigh the costs of capacity,” she said. ​“They just need to know how much they need to build.”

And once they’re armed with that knowledge, data centers can take on the cost of securing their own resources, which would almost completely eliminate the need to build more grid infrastructure and power plants, reducing costs for all PJM customers, according to the report.

PJM’s missing link for flexible data centers

PJM isn’t the only grid operator or utility facing data center–driven cost pressures. But its challenges are more acute than most. PJM has a massive interconnection backlog that has created multiyear delays for new generation seeking to connect to its grid. And its capacity market structure is forcing up utility rates today to cover the future costs of serving forecasted data center demand.

PJM hasn’t been able to gain consensus from stakeholders — including utilities, power plant owners, big corporate energy users, and data center developers — on how to fix these problems, even as the more than 67 million customers that get power from PJM’s system face spiking utility bills to cover those costs.

That lack of consensus has prevented PJM from developing a key policy that could allow flexible interconnection to happen, Atkinson said. In order for the method laid out in the December report to work, PJM and member utilities would need to allow data centers to interconnect via something called ​“conditional firm” grid service.

In simple terms, this means blending traditional, ​“firm” service for the portion of power needs that can be supplied without grid upgrades and ​“conditional” service, which requires data centers to cut their power use or supply their own electricity needs during critical hours.

PJM doesn’t provide this kind of option for customers — though it may have it soon enough. In December, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered PJM to create structures that would allow data centers and other big customers to connect to its grid in more flexible ways. That order set out a variety of methods for PJM to pursue, including a structure called ​“interim non-firm transmission service,” which closely approximates the conditional firm service that Camus and Encoord envision.

“At its core, the FERC order moves PJM away from ​‘full freight’ assumptions and toward studying and serving large loads based on their actual time-varying grid use,” Brancucci said. ​“That’s exactly the premise behind the conditional firm service model we analyzed in a few locations in PJM.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Data-center-cluster-in-Virginia_GettyImages-2161850834.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=3c2c6e587b089285e8603bb9422fb637,N,,2026-01-07 14:13:57.909538

With BlueChipAI, we can discuss how UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School is integrating AI into teaching, improving efficiency for staff and faculty and setting clear norms for ethical, secure use of AI in coursework, research and day-to-day academic work. These efforts are transforming how UNC Kenan-Flagler is preparing students for the workplace of the future. UNC Kenan-Flagler is modeling how academia and industry can work together to shape informed, forward-thinking decisions about generative AI use.

AI, productivity and the future of work

As someone who studies open innovation, crowds and the future of work, I’m unpacking where AI is genuinely improving productivity, where organizations are still struggling to translate experimentation into impact and what a more execution-focused next phase of AI could mean for firms, workers and markets.

— Arvind Malhotra, professor at UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School

AI

It’s somewhat foolish to make predictions about AI, a technology that is as opaque as it is transformative. But if I had to bet, I’d say that 2026 will be the year the bubble bursts. I hope I’m wrong, but I fear I’m not.

— Scott Geier, teaching assistant professor at UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media

AI law and regulation

The clock on AI regulation is significantly and unconstitutionally slowing. Efforts in the European Union are facing friction in the rollout of the AI Act, and there is also significant resistance from the White House, where President Donald Trump has announced by executive order his intent to stop U.S. states from enacting and enforcing their own regulation. It’s also far from clear that regulating AI harms will address the growing power and influence of AI companies over the state and citizens. Whether we’re looking at automating more labor, collecting and analyzing more biometric data or training AI systems on others’ intellectual property, regulation is just one answer to the growing imbalances in power that AI generates and the growing chasm between the U.S. and its allies in terms of policy and regulation. 2026 will likely be a turning point in the discussion about the role law can and will play; there is no question that many of us are deeply concerned whether regulation alone can and will preserve democratic norms.

How online search engine AI overviews influence searches about politics

As people’s search patterns change, a key fact remains the same — our starting points, like our keywords or our prompts, drive the information that is returned to us. Since our language is heavily influenced by our ideological dialects, how we see the world shapes what is ultimately returned to us, reinforcing, rather than broadening, what we already think we know politically.

— Francesca Tripodi, associate professor at the UNC School of Information and Library Science

AI as an infrastructure and community catalyst

In 2026, AI will be less of a “tool” and more of the underlying infrastructure for testing, refining and scaling ideas. Universities that lead will use AI to accelerate research translation, support founders and teach students to use these systems responsibly, with clear guardrails around ethics, bias and data protection. At UNC-Chapel Hill, Innovate Carolina is coordinating a nearly 1,000-member AI Community where students, researchers, staff, entrepreneurs and employers learn and build together, creating a collaborative model that is becoming a blueprint for how regions grow their AI talent.

— Patrick Kastian, assistant director of the Data Intelligence Hub at Innovate Carolina

Opioid overdoses

Opioid overdoses will continue to be something we grapple with in 2026, including why rates have been declining. The drug supply is poised to make marked shifts in 2026, and our lab has tested 20,000 drug samples to understand the complexity. Collectively, we’ll need to continue to provide resources that address people’s full health needs, including harm reduction options, treatment, food, shelter and more.

— Nabarun Dasgupta, senior scientist at the UNC Injury Prevention Research Center and innovation fellow at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health

Naloxone access

Access to naloxone has helped so many communities reduce opioid overdose death rates. However, access to this lifesaving drug is still suboptimal in many communities, including rural communities. There are opportunities to integrate technology, advocacy and public awareness campaigns with tools like naloxonenearme.org and naloxonesaves-nc.org to ensure people living in all North Carolina communities have access to naloxone and are aware of the resources available to them.

— Delesha Carpenter, professor at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy and the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health

Population trends and the aging economy

The demographic reshuffling is underway. We see record-low birth rates, an aging population and potential changes to immigration patterns following political influence. This change in demographics will have lots of implications for 2026 and beyond, especially in terms of labor markets, financial and caregiving support for older adults, rural population shifts and young adults’ futures.

— Karen Guzzo, professor at the UNC College of Arts and Sciences’ sociology department and director of the Carolina Population Center

Autism

We are living at the intersection of unprecedented autism visibility and also unprecedented misinformation. For decades, autism has been unfairly pulled into vaccine debates and politicized activism, despite overwhelming scientific consensus — leaving lasting impacts on public trust, stigma and the lived experiences of autistic people and their families. Today, social media accelerates both awareness and distortion, amplifying fear-based narratives alongside genuine advocacy. At the same time, autistic people are increasingly shaping public life as students, workers, creators and leaders.

— Brian Boyd, professor at the UNC School of Education and director of the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute

Youth mental health and well-being

In 2026, youth mental health will command national attention as we’re seeing how profoundly technology use, including social media and AI, is shaping emotional development, brain development, sleep patterns and overall well-being. Parents, educators and clinicians are increasingly confronting a reality in which digital environments often outpace the safeguards meant to protect young people. As the pressure grows for stronger guardrails — both from tech companies and policymakers — youth well-being will remain one of the most closely watched public health issues of the year.

— Mitch Prinstein, professor at the UNC College of Arts and Sciences’ psychology and neuroscience department and director of the Winston Center on Technology and Brain Development

Food access and SNAP benefits

Economic volatility may push more households to depend on public benefits like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka SNAP), yet policies may create new barriers for families to access or maintain these benefits. Additionally, some populations may experience more distrust of governmental entities, creating new barriers to accessing benefits even when they’re eligible. 2026 is a year to watch for how public benefits are utilized and the trickle-down impacts of their use or not.

— Molly De Marco, research associate professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health

Food and nutrition policy

Policies that shape our food environment — from agricultural subsidies to labeling standards and school meal regulations — are coming under sharper scrutiny. After a year of heightened bipartisan attention to the links between diet and chronic disease, 2026 will be a critical test of whether federal momentum translates into meaningful policy shifts. The decisions made this year could fundamentally reshape how healthier foods become accessible, affordable and normalized in households across the country.

— Lindsey Smith Taillie, professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health

Climate resiliency

With extreme weather events accelerating in both frequency and intensity, every sector — from municipal planners and homeowners to insurers and capital markets — is confronting a new baseline of risk. The growing exposure to financial losses is catalyzing rapid innovation in climate analytics and resilience financing, positioning risk management as one of the most important fields for safeguarding economic stability in the years ahead.

— Greg Characklis, professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and director of the Institute for Risk Management and Insurance Innovation

Flooding outside FEMA flood zones

Flooding is no longer a risk confined to traditional Federal Emergency Management Agency flood zones. As climate patterns shift, we’re seeing major flooding occur in places previously considered safe. In the years ahead, more people will be affected as extreme weather intensifies, making it essential that communities plan proactively and adapt to these emerging realities.

— Antonia Sebastian, assistant professor at the UNC College of Arts and Sciences’ Earth, marine and environmental sciences department and adjunct assistant professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and UNC Environment, Ecology and Energy Program

Air quality

Air quality will be a central media storyline in 2026 as climate-driven wildfires, industrial expansions, rapidly growing energy needs and urban congestion merge into a single, measurable threat to daily life, prompting urgent questions about environmental responsibility.

— Sarav Arunachalam, deputy director and research professor at the UNC Institute for the Environment and adjunct professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health

Climate and major sporting events

There are major sporting events coming to the world stage in 2026, including the Winter Olympic in Italy and the FIFA Men’s World Cup across North America. From artificial snow to extreme heat, these two events bring up climate change concerns for athletes, fans, staff and the media. Yet sport can also serve as a platform for awareness of climate hazards, vulnerabilities and solutions. These mega events are also ecological indicators for collegiate and youth sport in our own communities.

— Jessica Murfree, assistant professor and Hyde Family Foundation Fellow at the UNC College of Arts and Sciences’ exercise and sport science department

Sustainable energy and critical minerals

In my work on sustainable energy systems, I focus on how we can design a cleaner electric grid using materials, extending equipment lifetimes and reducing waste across the energy supply chain. This is key as universities, utilities and policymakers grapple with how to manage end-of-life for solar panels, batteries and other technologies. My research group is also examining the role of critical minerals, like lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements, in enabling long-term duration of battery storage and grid decarbonization. Identifying more sustainable extraction resources like these or considering alternative design solutions are becoming central to transitioning toward a cleaner grid system.

Economic growth

I’m paying attention to what a slower-but-fragile 2% to 3% global growth world could mean for 2026, especially how high public and corporate debt, shifting risk appetite and uneven inflation and interest-rate paths may rewire capital allocation, hiring plans and day-to-day risk management.

Job searching in a challenging market

The job market is more competitive and more dynamic, with AI reshaping opportunities for new graduates. Employers are looking for talent who can pair technological fluency with creativity, communication and sound judgment. At UNC-Chapel Hill, we help students develop these skills while gaining practical, real-world experience through internships, research and early career exploration. This combination of preparation and support ensures Tar Heels are well-equipped to thrive in our rapidly changing economy.

— James Barricelli, assistant vice chancellor for career development and executive director of the UNC Career Center

Online graduate education and nontraditional learners

As dean of the Graduate School, I have a front-row view of how the profile of graduate students is changing, with more working adults and other nontraditional learners looking for high-quality online pathways. That makes 2026 an inflection point because universities will be judged less on simply offering online degrees and more on whether they build the academic, advising and career support that helps these students succeed at scale. At Carolina, we are strengthening those comprehensive student supports. Regarding where online graduate education is headed next, program design, faculty engagement and career alignment will likely define quality in the years ahead.

— Beth Mayer-Davis, dean of The Graduate School and professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health

Experiential learning

As learners navigate an increasingly complex world, experiential education is not simply an enhancement to learning. It is an essential pathway through which people of all ages discover curiosity, build competence and grow in confidence. We spend less than 5% of our lives in classrooms, and most of what we come to understand about the world is shaped through free-choice, informal and hands-on experiences. These moments of exploration spark wonder, strengthen scientific reasoning and help individuals see themselves as capable contributors to a better society. This spirit of discovery and possibility will be vital in 2026 and in the years ahead.

— Todd Boyette, director of the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center

Universities as economic engines and startup factories

Public universities are no longer just educating students; they are quietly becoming some of the most powerful economic development engines in their states. Through startup pipelines, industry partnerships and innovation hubs, institutions like UNC-Chapel Hill can show measurable impact in jobs, tax base, and investment — turning research and student ideas into real companies that stay and grow in the region.

— Sheryl Waddell, director of economic development and innovation hubs at Innovate Carolina

Affordable housing

Affordable housing will be a major focus in 2026 as rising living costs, urban population growth, constrained supply, burdensome regulation and the impact of economic inequality intensify the housing crisis. The importance of affordable housing will push policymakers, developers and communities to prioritize innovative approaches, recognizing housing affordability as a core contributor to economic vitality in the U.S.

— Roberto Quercia, professor at the UNC College of Arts and Sciences’ city and regional planning department

Civil discourse in polarized times

In a moment when polarization feels sharper than ever, strengthening our communities starts with learning how to engage one another respectfully. Civil discourse isn’t about agreeing on every issue; it’s about creating space to listen, challenge constructively and work toward shared solutions. If we want healthier, more resilient communities, this skill is no longer optional.

— John Rose, professor of the practice at the UNC School of Civic Life and Leadership

Rural health care access

Rural health care access will emerge as a defining issue in 2026. This year, we’ve seen policy changes that reduced Medicaid and Medicare funding to hospitals, as well as a potential increase in premiums for marketplace plans. These policies place strain on the financial health of these facilities; as a result, we will likely see shifts in healthcare facilities, whether that’s reducing services, changing to different types of healthcare facilities or potentially closing. Hospitals embedded within larger health systems may be better positioned to withstand these shifts, but independent hospitals may face larger challenges.

— Mark Holmes, professor at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health and director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research

Constitutional law

We can expect that in 2026 the Constitution and the American people will continue to be challenged by the Trump administration’s disdain for the law. Time and again, we saw in 2025 how the president and his allies in government have tried to damage the rule of law, higher education, national security, the economy and public health. Protecting the institutions of government and the civil rights of Americans and respect for the rule of law will continue to be major concerns for the nation. The robustness of the rule of law will depend on how strongly the American people are willing to fight for it.

— Michael Gerhardt, professor at the UNC School of Law

Immigration enforcement

Immigration enforcement — raids, police stops and surveillance through traffic cameras and other means — will very likely continue to dominate the news. Key questions include the constitutional limits on the government’s power, the role of police in immigration enforcement and the impact of immigration stops on citizens and noncitizens alike.

— Eisha Jain, professor at the UNC School of Law

Hemp regulation and legislation

2026 will likely be a pivotal year for the hemp industry. Federal legislation redefining hemp takes effect in November that will criminalize many — perhaps most — popular hemp products. The hemp industry is sure to lobby Congress for a less restrictive definition over the next year to preserve the multibillion-dollar market. Without new legislation, however, a wide array of hemp business will be forced to either close or operate under threat of a federal criminal and civil penalties. Many states, including North Carolina, currently have a far more permissive definition of hemp than the new federal standards, and the conflict between state and federal law states will be closely watched by industry stakeholders, policymakers and consumers alike. North Carolina has also previously considered state-level regulation of hemp products without reaching a legislative consensus, and the General Assembly may return to that issue in 2026.

This doesn’t include many other advanced energy projects whose costs increased due to cancellation or delay by Trump’s earlier decisions.
Trump’s cancellation of offshore wind projects comes after he and congressional allies have already repealed incentives for clean energy, raising consumer prices, killing hundreds of thousands of jobs, and withdrawing power needed to meet rapidly growing electricity demand.
“The illegal attacks on fully permitted renewable energy projects must be reversed if there is any chance that permitting talks resume,” said Sens.
Trump’s latest actions, unless reversed, will further raise electricity costs on hard-pressed families and businesses.","President Trump is waging a political culture war against U.S. clean energy that is jacking up monthly electricity bills on already struggling American families — in many cases costing more than $200 more a year.

By cancelling or preventing wind and solar projects, defunding energy innovation, killing efficiency standards, imposing tariffs and overriding state consumer protections, Trump is exacerbating America’s affordability crisis. These actions have generated opposition from consumers and many businesses just when America needs all the electricity it can get to meet massive new power demand from AI data centers.

Voters angry about Trump’s “pain at the plug” policies are already punishing Republicans. Energy affordability was a major motivating issue in Republican defeats in 2025 state elections. It is certain to be crucial in the upcoming midterms, with Republicans facing an increasingly likely loss of their House majority, and perhaps even of the Senate.

Yet the Trump administration continues to make things worse. Near the end of the year, the administration shocked consumers and the electric utility industry by ordering an unprecedented halt to five major U.S. offshore wind projects already deep into construction — projects that have met every stage of approval and are carrying tens of billions of dollars in private investment.

This includes the nearly completed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project. The region’s electric utility, Dominion Energy, has already spent $8.8 billion — more than two-thirds of the project’s total budget — while charging ratepayers for construction. In all, the five halted wind projects involve more than $25 billion in already spent private-sector investment, more than 10,000 jobs and would power more than 2.5 million homes and businesses. This doesn’t include many other advanced energy projects whose costs increased due to cancellation or delay by Trump’s earlier decisions.

Dominion Energy called Trump’s late December shutdown order just “the latest in a series of irrational agency actions attacking offshore wind and then doubling down when those actions are found unlawful.” Earlier in December, a federal judge struck down a prior Trump executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law. Now, new, expensive lawsuits are challenging Trump’s latest action.

Even Trump allies are outraged by his preemptory actions. Neil Chatterjee, a Republican-appointed chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during Trump’s first term, called the latest decision “incredibly reckless,” setting “a terrible precedent at a time when we need every available electron.” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) broke with Trump last fall to back the Virginia wind project, noting that “ratepayers have already paid for it.” And all five wind projects affect states with majority Democratic representation, continuing unprecedented extreme partisanship in the administration’s budget policies.

Trump’s cancellation of offshore wind projects comes after he and congressional allies have already repealed incentives for clean energy, raising consumer prices, killing hundreds of thousands of jobs, and withdrawing power needed to meet rapidly growing electricity demand. The Trump administration also has deeply cut or eliminated research funding for new advanced energy technologies and blocked energy efficiency provisions for appliances and other users of electricity that save consumers money and reduce power demand right away.

Responding to Trump’s wind cancellations, key Democratic senators on relevant committees have walked away from negotiations over permitting reform crucial to permanently lowering consumer prices and diversifying America’s energy system. “The illegal attacks on fully permitted renewable energy projects must be reversed if there is any chance that permitting talks resume,” said Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) in a joint statement.

While perhaps understandable in the heat of the moment, suspending permitting reform negotiations for any length of time is self-defeating in meeting the key goals of increasing the availability of cheap clean energy to meet America’s electricity demands and to lower prices for consumers and businesses.

Both parties agree the current morass of permitting requirements is delaying or preventing new energy from reaching consumers and businesses, adding tens of billions of dollars in long-term consumer costs. In addition, both agree more energy is needed to help America compete in the race for artificial intelligence, including from new natural gas pipelines and powerlines for renewable resources. For all these reasons, the House passed a major permitting reform bill in December which, while containing some provisions likely to be revised in the Senate, garnered 11 Democratic votes in support.

It is possible the courts strike down Trump’s unilateral halt of already permitted wind projects, especially given the administration’s flimsy pretext of security concerns, widely questioned by top national security experts. But in the meantime, precious time is being lost.

As for Senate Republicans, right now they are losing the political battle over electricity prices, particularly against the backdrop of higher inflation and consumer and business costs from Trump’s tariff regime, which have also led to unexpectedly sharp increases in U.S. business bankruptcies.

But Senate Democrats also have strong incentives to pass permitting reform. Opposing negotiations allows critics to blame Democrats for higher natural gas prices, which have been rising in part due to a lack of domestic pipeline infrastructure. And even if Democrats win back Congress in November, they are unlikely to produce a bill Trump will sign.

Trump’s latest actions, unless reversed, will further raise electricity costs on hard-pressed families and businesses. But permitting reform remains America’s biggest opportunity to expedite building U.S. new energy quickly and cheaply, helping our nation to reduce costs even as power demand grows.

POWER: What are the primary factors you consider when assessing a potential deal for energy infrastructure?
What have been the most important lessons you’ve learned from that experience, particularly as it relates to structuring energy deals?
Energy assets live through cycles, so your capital structure has to survive those cycles.","The race to lead when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more about securing the power necessary for data centers and other AI infrastructure. As POWER’s recent Data Center POWER eXchange event in Denver, Colorado, showed, demand for energy from the AI sector is impacting several fuel types, both thermal and renewable. Natural gas has emerged as a leading option to provide baseload power, as a buildout of gas-fired power plants already is underway.

Andrejka Bernatova is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dynamix Corporation III, and managing partner of Dynamix Capital Partners, a group that is working to partner with proven, market-leading companies in energy, power, and digital assets. She works within the energy industry as both an operator and investor. Bernatova has helped raise more than $35 billion across energy and infrastructure. Bernatova led a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) full-cycle with ESGEN, which merged with Florida’s largest solar installer to form Zeo Energy Corp. in 2024. In 2025, another SPAC she leads announced a business combination with The Ether Machine, an institutional-grade Ethereum investment vehicle. Bernatova also recently completed the initial public offering for Dynamix Corporation III, pursuing opportunities in energy, power, and the digital assets value chain.

Bernatova is an accomplished athlete who has completed the Marathon des Sables, a ~200-mile ultra-marathon race across the Sahara Desert. She also biked more than 600 miles across Tibet and Nepal to the Mount Everest Base Camp. She has volunteered in orphanages and construction projects in Kenya, Chile, Nepal, and Egypt. Bernatova has lived, worked, and studied across five continents, and speaks five languages.

Bernatova recently provided POWER with insight into her company’s business. and also discussed Dynamix’s belief that the energy and infrastructure industry is in the early phases of a decades-long transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future.

POWER: What are the targets for Dynamix when it comes to North American energy and infrastructure?

Bernatova: Our focus is very pragmatic. For Dynamix Capital Partners, the priority is assets that sit at the intersection of power, energy security, and scale, particularly generation and infrastructure that can support the next wave of demand driven by AI, data centers, and grid resiliency. We’re targeting cash-flowing, industrial-scale platforms that can be part of the solution over the next five to 10 years.

We’re currently in the process of completing the deSPAC for our most recent business combination with The Ether Machine, announced this past summer. We view digital assets through the same lens as energy and infrastructure, and Ethereum is an energy-efficient major blockchain. This aligns directly with our focus on scalable infrastructure that improves efficiency rather than exacerbating strain, making the transaction a natural extension of our core focus. (Editor’s note: De-SPAC refers to a business deal where a private company goes public by merging with a SPAC.)

POWER: You’ve talked about “Disruptive Decarbonization.” What does that mean?

Bernatova: Disruptive decarbonization is about reducing emissions in a way that actually works within real-world constraints. The fastest way to decarbonize at scale today is not by waiting for perfect technologies, but by replacing dirtier fuels with cleaner ones that already exist and can be deployed immediately, particularly natural gas. If you can cut emissions by 50-60% today rather than promise 100% reduction in 10 years, that’s true impact. Disruption comes from pragmatism, not from chasing headlines.

POWER: How has your previous experience as an operator and company builder at PennTex Midstream, Enchanted Rock, and Goodnight Midstream helped with the energy deals you work on today?

Bernatova: Being an operator changes how you see risk. At PennTex, Enchanted Rock, and Goodnight, I was responsible for execution, contracts, capital allocation and capital raising, and operating through cycles, which forces discipline. It teaches you where models break, where assumptions fail, and where value is actually created. Today, when we look at deals, we focus heavily on operational reality: Can this be built? Does this business have a sustainable commercial and customer backbone? Can it be financed? Can it survive volatility? Does it generate cash flow? That mindset is invaluable.

POWER: What are the primary factors you consider when assessing a potential deal for energy infrastructure?

Bernatova: First, cash flow visibility and contract structure, because, without that, nothing else matters. Second, scalability, or whether the asset grows alongside demand without relying on speculative technology shifts. Third, resiliency and relevance to the grid, because assets that improve reliability will always matter. And finally, capital structure. Too many deals fail because they’re built on overly engineered or toxic financing. We’re extremely disciplined about balance sheets and alignment from day one.

POWER: What should startup energy companies be looking at as they devise strategies for their business in today’s highly competitive market?

Bernatova: They need to focus on commercialization and profitability much earlier. Energy is not software; it is large-scale infrastructure and asset deployment. You cannot rely on perpetual funding rounds or subsidies. Startups must be brutally honest about whether their technology can scale economically and generate EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). If your business only works under perfect regulatory conditions or continuous government support, it’s not a business. The companies that survive will be the ones that understand cost, execution, and customer demand from the outset.

POWER: You’ve held investment roles at some of the world’s largest banks, including Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, and you’ve also worked at The Blackstone Group. What have been the most important lessons you’ve learned from that experience, particularly as it relates to structuring energy deals?

Bernatova: Structure matters as much as the asset itself. I’ve learned that bad capital can destroy a good business. The best deals are simple, aligned, and built for durability, rather than optimized for short-term financial engineering. Energy assets live through cycles, so your capital structure has to survive those cycles. Alignment between sponsors, management, and investors is critical. If incentives are misaligned at the start, the deal is already broken.

POWER: How has your experience as an ultra-marathoner impacted your career? Does the discipline required to excel in that sport translate to your work in business?

Bernatova: Ultra-marathons teach you how to operate under sustained pressure, manage energy, make decisions when conditions are far from ideal, and be able to live through periods of long-term pain. Business, especially in this industry, is not a sprint. It’s about endurance, discipline, and staying rational when others panic. You learn to respect process, prepare for adversity, and keep moving forward even when progress is incremental. That mindset translates directly to how I approach investing and building companies.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/data-center-stockcake-1024x583.png,N,,2026-01-07 14:14:03.370719

The Washington Post

SAND SPRINGS, Okla. – One float stood out among the tinsel and holiday cheer at the annual Christmas parade here: an unsightly data center with blinding industrial lights and smoke pouring out of its roof, towering menacingly over a helpless gingerbread house.

This city bordering Tulsa is a battleground, one of many across the country where companies seeking to build massive data centers to win the AI race with China are coming up against the reality of local politics.

Sand Springs leaders were besieged with community anger after annexing an 827-acre agricultural property miles outside of town and launching into secret talks with a tech giant looking to use it for a sprawling data center. Hundreds of aggrieved voters showed up at community meetings. Swarms of protest signs are taking root along the rural roads.

“It feels like these data center companies have just put a big target on our backs,” said Kyle Schmidt, leader of the newly formed Protect Sand Springs Alliance. “We are all asking: Where are the people we elected who promised to protect us from these big corporations trying to steamroll us? The people who are supposed to be standing up and protecting us are standing down and caving.”

From Archbald, Pennsylvania, to Page, Arizona, tech firms are seeking to plunk down data centers in locations that sometimes are not zoned for such heavy industrial uses, within communities that had not planned for them. These supersize data centers can use more energy than entire cities and drain local water supplies.

Anger over the perceived trampling of communities by Silicon Valley has entered the national political conversation and could affect voters of all political persuasions in this year’s midterm elections.

Many of the residents fighting the project in Sand Springs voted for President Donald Trump three times and also backed Gov. J. Kevin Stitt (R), who implores tech firms to build in his state.

“We know Trump wants data centers and Kevin Stitt wants data centers, but these things don’t affect these people,” said Brian Ingram, a Trump voter living in the shadow of the planned project. “You know, this affects us.”

Ingram was standing before a homemade sign he planted on his front lawn that said, “Jesus Was Born on Ag Land.”

The grassroots blowback comes from deep red states as much as from left-wing groups such as the Democratic Socialists of America, which have helped draw hundreds of residents to hearings in Arizona, Indiana and Maryland.

Even Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned data center developers that they are losing control of the narrative. “In rural America right now, where data centers are being built, everyone’s already angry because their electricity prices have risen a lot,” he told energy executives assembled in Washington for the North American Gas Forum last month. “‘I don’t want them in my state’ is a common viewpoint.”

Some industry groups argue that residents’ concerns are misplaced.

“Fueled by misinformation, driven by radical environmental policies, communities are missing out on the jobs, security and opportunities this technology is delivering,” said an email from Brian O. Walsh, executive director of the AI Infrastructure Coalition. The group says the projects lower electricity prices, a claim that is hotly disputed.

The White House frames the data center boom as beneficial, saying in a statement that it will lead to big investments in infrastructure and boost manufacturing. But the administration is also aware some communities oppose them.

“Communities know what’s best for them, and the Administration is clear that local infrastructure decisions remain with states and localities,” the statement said.

Many local politicians are yielding to community pressure and rejecting data centers. Between April and June, more projects were blocked or delayed than during the previous two years combined, according to Data Center Watch, a tracking project by the nonpartisan research firm 10a Labs. Some $98 billion in planned development was derailed in a single quarter.

Last month, a group of Senate Democrats launched an investigation into the role data centers play in increasing electricity prices.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) last month called for a moratorium on data center construction, warning that the tech firms are draining scarce energy and water reserves and pushing the cost onto everyday Americans in pursuit of AI technologies that threaten to displace millions from the workforce.

White House AI czar David Sacks replied on X: “He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power.”

But advocates say residents’ concerns are legitimate.

“This data center expansion affects so many issues,” said Mitch Jones, managing director of policy and litigation at Food and Water Watch. The group last month organized a letter signed by several national advocacy groups demanding a moratorium.

“It takes up farmland in rural communities. It takes up dwindling water sources in communities that need cleaner drinking water. And it is driving up electricity prices for everyone,” he said. “It is drawing together people from disparate backgrounds who might not agree on other political issues. They are saying this is taking place without any forethought to communities and we must stop it.”

The NAACP this month convened a two-day “Stop Dirty Data” conference in Washington that focused on the impacts of the AI build-out on minority and low-income communities. It included a bus tour of “Data Center Alley” in Northern Virginia, the world’s largest collection of data centers.

Even Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is championing an AI “bill of rights” to enshrine local governments’ power to stop data center construction and prohibit utilities from pushing AI infrastructure costs onto residents. The break between Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) and Trump was driven in part by her vocal criticism of his AI build-out push.

The industry has struggled to quell the concerns. In Chandler, Arizona, former senator Kyrsten Sinema (I), co-founder of the AI Infrastructure Coalition, implored city officials to get on board with a large proposed project or risk the federal government pushing it through without city input.

The city council rejected the project unanimously.

The vote followed the Tucson City Council’s unanimous rejection of a plan that would have required annexing land in the Sonoran Desert that until June had been zoned “rural homestead.” Some voters were outraged that local officials had signed a five-year nondisclosure agreement with Amazon, which did not come to light for two years. Frustration with the power company that would have provided the power has fueled a movement to drive it out in favor of a community-led nonprofit.

Amazon did not respond to questions about the controversy, saying only, “We do not have any commitments or agreements in place to develop this project.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.

“People are understandably asking how they will benefit,” said Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer at OpenAI, which has won initial local approval for some of the country’s largest data center projects. He said companies need to listen to communities and make sure they are sharing in the economic gains. “You need to be on the ground, having these conversations. It is a journey.”

In some places, large tech companies have signed contracts committing to pay for new power grid infrastructure required to bring a data center online, even when the companies are not the only ones that would benefit from it.

It’s a journey that some local officials are willing to go on because the projects generate construction jobs and boost revenue for schools.

“We’re trying to work through this,” said Mike Carter, the city manager in Sand Springs. “This would probably be one of our major employers. It would almost certainly become the dominant part of our tax base. … When you can surpass Walmart, which is right now the biggest taxpayer in our community, there is a big incentive to look at this.”

He has tried to assure residents that they will have all their questions answered – including the name of the tech firm – before the city hearing this month, where officials will consider rezoning the sprawling property from agricultural to industrial. He said the city has signed other nondisclosure agreements during negotiations with large corporations, such as Olive Garden.

The project developer, White Rose Partners, said none of the costs involved with providing electricity to the Sand Springs data center would fall on residential ratepayers. The firm says the data center would generate millions of dollars in revenue for local schools and services.

It is cold comfort to many residents of the rural community, where the data center would industrialize a landscape now defined by the ranches that drew them there.

“I don’t care how much chocolate icing you put on a dog turd, it don’t make it chocolate cake,” said Rick Plummer, who raises elite team-roping horses next to the proposed data center. “They are trying to fluff this data center thing up and say, ‘Man, eat this birthday cake.’ But it isn’t birthday cake.”

On the other side of Tulsa, a steady stream of pickups pulled off the busy local road to sign petitions fighting a different data center proposed for the rural community of Coweta. One sign takes aim at the nondisclosure agreements, stating “NDAs BETRAY.” The petitions demand the firing of a city official who signed one.

“We want to see this damn data center go away and go someplace else,” said Allen Prather, who was leading the petition drive dressed as Santa. “This town deserves a better centerpiece than a data center. They keep coming to smaller and smaller towns. Leave mine alone.”

Sherri Crumpacker, a retired law enforcement officer who pulled over to sign, concurred. “I moved here from California to get away from BS like this,” she said.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2026/01/data-centers-corrected_73GBXQ5PNB6UIXI52N3OINCRX4-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:00:30.854956

The possibilities feel endless, and I’m passionate about helping businesses understand what’s coming and how to get ready for it.

There is no doubt that industry wants to adopt this technology—and needs to. Manufacturing faces a triple challenge: 1. the loss of generational knowledge as older workers leave the factory floor, 2. the rapid pace of change in emerging technologies, and 3. the growing complexity of managing global, rather than local, supply chains.

Lowering the barriers to Industrial AI entry in manufacturing

Thankfully, the barrier to integrating industrial AI into manufacturing is the lowest it’s ever been and the wait for ROI is significantly shorter.

As Hitachi’s Chief Technology Officer, you might think, “of course he would say that!” But I’m part of a business that’s also engaged in manufacturing. Hitachi knows the challenges manufacturing businesses face because we face them ourselves.

We also know that AI doesn’t just promise to help with these challenges. It already can. Nevertheless, when it comes to AI, we still have to get it right. We’ve heard the cautionary tales: the airline AI chatbot that gave away so many discounts it led to financial loss, or the business that over-inventoried car purchases during COVID because the AI model was trained on historical patterns and didn’t have proper governance.

Even more seriously, if AI fails in a factory environment and has an impact on safety—even one time in 100,000—it could cost a life. And that is a cost too high to pay.

Understandably, many companies take a risk-based view of industrial AI because failure is not an option in manufacturing use cases.

The early adopter advantage

At Hitachi, we’re both a business that makes things as well as an early adopter of technology. We’ve experienced firsthand the challenge of integrating AI into manufacturing. We know in the past it’s taken a significant investment to build a model, collect the data, clean it, make it ready, and then train the AI to a point where it is delivering consistently.

So, we’re creating AI-powered solutionsopens in a new tab that reduce the time and investment manufacturing businesses need to realize the benefits of AI, drawing on our real-world manufacturing experience and decades of technological expertise.

And we’ve found that in a lot of use cases you can actually build on top of existing models, to create “plug and play” versions that can then be fine-tuned for each unique application. So instead of doing the work training a model on a data set, you can use the common footprint and then add in the specific knowledge of your business.

AI as an asset for accelerating change

We call this “assetizing” AI, creating pre-built accelerators for common manufacturing challenges such as predictive maintenance, autonomous quality inspection, and digital twins. Hitachi has already eliminated about 30% of the development effort1, dramatically reducing the friction many businesses face when adopting AI. As a result, it is now simpler than ever to bring AI into manufacturing and to realize greater value than ever before.

The shift toward physical AI is a major turning point. It will empower both people and businesses and fundamentally change what we know about how factories operate. No factory I know of today is designed for hundreds of drones to fly around making inspections, and there will have to be changes to physical security models. In the next 10-15 years, the factories of the near-future will look radically different as manufacturers rethink their layouts, infrastructure and processes.

With this shift comes benefits for workers too. Remote working will become more viable, improving both safety and job satisfaction. Automated, AI-integrated machinery—drones, robots, and production line arms—will have the perceptive intelligence to handle complex tasks, while human operators will be able to monitor operations and troubleshoot remotely. Reducing the need for constant physical presence will also extend careers by lowering the physical toll of manufacturing, helping retain the vital knowledge of longstanding, skilled workers.

The possibilities are enormous, and Hitachi has a unique advantage. For the businesses we work with, we can say with confidence that when we build an AI use case, we have already considered the core challenges it must overcome to function in a real manufacturing environment, because we’ve been there.

This is a path we’re making ourselves. We want to walk the road toward the factories of the future alongside our partners, helping transform operations for the better, to stand shoulder to shoulder with manufacturers and ask, “What’s next?” together.

Consumer electronics is about scale; and at scale, even the most marginal improvements matter.
From its earliest stages, the consumer electronics ecosystem evolved along very different lines.
They are repeatedly assembling the same electro-industrial stack — batteries, power electronics, motors, compute, and sensors — into new permutations.
A company that excels in one corner of consumer electronics is capable of excelling in practically every other.","Steve Jobs famously sold the iPhone as three inventions in one. In truth, it represented something much more foundational: the first mass-market machine that bundled compute, power, sensing, connectivity, and software into a single, tightly-engineered package.

Once that blueprint existed, everything else started to look the same. Your laptop, smart TV, thermostat, doorbell camera, refrigerator, industrial robot, drone: all of them follow the same basic recipe. Even an electric vehicle, once you peel back the sheet metal, relies on the same ingredients — batteries, sensors, motors, compute, and software, just in a different skin. We no longer live among truly distinct technological paradigms, but within a world of variations on one single idea: the smartphone, endlessly turned inside and out and scaled across every domain. Everything is a smartphone. Everything is computer.

There is an irresistible evolutionary logic to why so much of the modern technological world converged on this form. Consumer electronics are unique because they sit on a deeply modular foundation: systems can be broken down and recomposed into entirely new products with surprising ease. The same polymers, diodes, and battery cells that power an industrial robot are just as at home in a laptop. Capability concentrates at the product level, but scale accumulates far below it.e

That is why the “modular middle” of the electro-industrial supply chain ultimately determines both commercial and geopolitical success. This layer is what allows electronics to be built, customized, and improved faster than any other class of physical goods, while drawing on vast consumer-scale commodity markets to create new systems by recombination. It’s how a company like Xiaomi could move seamlessly from smartphones into electric vehicles. Control over this integration step shapes cost curves, sets performance ceilings, and determines who can reliably build complex products at scale.

Mastery of the modular middle can confer a decisive advantage in electro-industrial production — and with it, disproportionate influence over the pace of technological progress this century. China understands this. The United States largely does not. If we want to compete, we must fill in this “missing middle.”

Rise of the electro-industrials

Think, for a moment, about what your smartphone is made of. A smooth slab of glass and metal crammed with nanometric transistors, atomic sensors, lenses that bend light like a studio camera, a power source that can be recharged thousands of times without ever catching fire; all of this perfectly interlocking and operating at their thermal and mechanical limits, and all snugly integrated with software that makes this supercomputer not only remarkably powerful but also easy and even fun to use. And this remarkable device ships in the billions at consumer prices, with near-zero rates of failure, on rigorous annual redesign cycles, with perpetual process improvement every year. Nothing before in human history has demanded that level of integration at scale, and meeting those requirements required the creation of a vast global supply chain capable of mass-producing ultra-complex systems at unprecedented speed.

What makes this remarkable process practical at all, let alone feasible at such a regular tempo? Scale.

Consumer electronics is about scale; and at scale, even the most marginal improvements matter. When you ship hundreds of millions of units, small gains in cost, efficiency, size, or reliability compound directly into better products and fund the next iteration. And in a market that large and competitive, companies don’t just assemble systems. They rethink the modules inside them.

By modules, I mean the integrated subsystems that form the middle layer bridging low-cost components and high-value finished products. At the lowest level, ultra-commoditized materials like wafers, foils, and polymers are produced at massive scale and combined into standardized primitives: diodes, electrodes, windings, lenses, passives. The modular middle packages these primitives into functional building blocks, abstracting away unneeded complexity and allowing OEMs, original equipment manufacturers, to effectively tap into mature, high-volume supply chains that sit upstream.

Consider some examples. Higher-voltage SiC MOSFET switches are cheap, but turning them into a thermally stable inverter that can manage the load profile of a car is challenging. Drone motors use standard magnets and windings, but producing a sealed, vibration-tolerant motor that can keep a quadcopter stable in flight is its own craft. The inputs to batteries are commoditized chemicals; the difficulty lies in converting them into high-yield cells that can be integrated into compact, reliable packs. Each of these subsystems takes abundant, low-cost components and transforms them into something packaged, validated, and fine-tuned for a specific end-product competing in brutally competitive commercial markets.

Compare the consumer electronics stack with the traditional auto industry. Early automakers were vertically integrated — Henry Ford’s Rouge River plant being the classic example, with raw materials entering the factory at one end and finished cars exiting through the other. But as automobiles grew more sophisticated, car companies evolved into high-level integrators of bespoke subsystems designed and manufactured by phalanxes of tier-one suppliers. Firms like ZF, Bosch, and Aisin (Toyota) came to own much of the car’s architecture, which is why different automakers would often share the same underlying systems. Mazda and Lotus, for example, use Toyota drivetrains.

This was the automotive industry’s attempt to chase scale: sharing core subsystems across brands to amortize cost and complexity. But even at its best, this model never approached the volume dynamics of electronics. Automotive subsystems were still designed almost exclusively for vehicles and tightly tailored to specific platforms or regulatory regimes. The result was scale within a narrow domain, not participation in a broad, cross-sector ecosystem. More of the vehicle would be ceded to suppliers over time; incentives favored risk offloading, regulatory lock-in, and supplier-led customization. Carmakers retained assembly and branding, but stitched together supplier-defined systems. The result was an industry that neither controlled its core technologies nor captured the cost-performance curves and spillovers emerging elsewhere.

From its earliest stages, the consumer electronics ecosystem evolved along very different lines. Unlike legacy internal-combustion vehicles, electric vehicles draw heavily on components and device primitives shared across many other industries. Consumer electronics was built on broadly reusable components produced at massive scale, even as modules were custom-designed to meet demanding end-product requirements.

At first, off-the-shelf modules often couldn’t meet consumer requirements. When Apple pushed Sony on cameras, for example, existing sensors fell short. But beneath the module layer, the same device primitives were already being produced at an increasingly massive global scale. Electronics OEMs kept control of module design and built systems on top of those shared inputs with the help of modular middle suppliers. And because those inputs were used across phones, laptops, and industrial equipment, improvements spread quickly, pulling down costs and pushing up performance in a way the automotive industry never could.

Much of today’s most important technology rests, almost inadvertently, on the foundations built by that modular ecosystem. Lithium-ion batteries perfected for phones made electric vehicles viable. MEMS accelerometers built for screen rotation now stabilize drones and robots. Smartphone cameras became the eyes of autonomous systems. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips evolved into the backbone of connectivity. Mobile-class processors now fly in spacecraft because they outperform bespoke aerospace hardware. And of course, GPUs built for video games became the engines of modern AI systems.

Consumer electronics underpin all of the most important technologies of our time. And everything, absolutely everything, is based on the indispensable paradigm of the smartphone. An electric vehicle is a smartphone with wheels. A drone is a smartphone with propellers. A robot is a smartphone that moves. The differences matter, of course, but the family resemblance is impossible to ignore.

This explains why so many electronics companies — especially in China — now appear to be building many different types of products at once. From the outside, this looks like reckless sprawl. From the inside, it is straightforward reuse. The products change; the components do not. A company that builds smartphones at global scale already understands batteries, sensors, compute, thermal management, wireless stacks, and high-volume manufacturing. To build electric vehicles, it doesn’t need much more than that.

In December, the technology YouTuber Marques Brownlee showcased a new Chinese EV. It was a $40,000 electric sedan with the performance and polish of a Porsche. What was remarkable wasn’t that a Chinese firm had produced an impressive EV; it was that the firm in question was the smartphone company Xiaomi. Such industry “crossovers” are common in China. BYD, the global leader in batteries, builds cars, buses, ships, and trains. DJI makes drones, but also cameras, radios, and robotics hardware. These firms are not “diversifying” in the traditional sense. Rather, they are doubling down. They are repeatedly assembling the same electro-industrial stack — batteries, power electronics, motors, compute, and sensors — into new permutations.

The same pattern is visible across Asia. A company that excels in one corner of consumer electronics is capable of excelling in practically every other. Sony builds game consoles, sensors, cameras, smartphones, and robotics. Panasonic makes cameras, batteries, avionics, EV components, and appliances. Samsung produces smartphones, memory, displays, appliances, and industrial equipment. LG develops displays, batteries, HVAC systems, appliances, and robotics. These firms keep recombining the same underlying competencies into different physical forms. Their advantage is not breadth for its own sake, but mastery of a single electro-industrial production model that can be applied almost without end.

The defense electro-industrial base

Which brings us back to America.

It’s a myth that the United States “lost manufacturing,” as if we’d misplaced our industrial sector or gambled it away. We made the conscious decision to stop being a country that manufactures things. We told ourselves that the real value was in design and IP, while the physical act of manufacturing was a low-value task that other people could handle. Modules and their components were the ingredients, and we were the head chefs directing legions of line cooks. Why should American companies care where batteries, motors, displays, or power electronics come from, as long as they design the final system?

But that logic ignored a harsh reality: if a country supplies every critical module in a supply chain, it’s not hard for that country to assemble the final product itself. And nowhere was that dynamic more pronounced than in consumer electronics.

In modern consumer markets, tiny errors are catastrophic. Every small improvement that can be eked out of a production process matters immensely, and every percentage point of yield, cost, and reliability becomes a matter of basic survival. Hitting those targets requires genuine technical breakthroughs across materials science, thermals, EMI behavior, and manufacturability. In the language of mathematics, the optimization problem is non-convex: there are countless local minima and false starts that can only be conquered by constantly building, learning, iterating, and building again. That constant pressure fuses manufacturing and research into a single engine, creating an industrial competence that compounds over time.

Apple understood this early. They poured billions into China, training factories, funding tooling, building new process capabilities, and effectively creating a distributed applied-research ecosystem inside each of their suppliers. What began as an effort to squeeze cost and defects out of the iPhone turned into one of the most demanding production engineering challenges of all time. And it was solved beautifully — but on someone else’s soil.

Tesla took that same industrial engine and pushed it into a new domain. When Tesla committed to Shanghai in 2018, Li Qiang — then the city’s top official and now China’s second-in-command — personally cleared obstacles, aligned national and local incentives, and helped stand up a world-class factory in under a year that now produces half of Tesla’s vehicles. The exchange reshaped both sides: Tesla gained velocity, cost discipline, and enormous market access; China absorbed Tesla’s production philosophy and leveled up its suppliers. Companies like CATL, LK Group, and a broader constellation of local firms honed their capabilities by meeting Tesla’s brutal standards for quality, speed, and scale. An ecosystem that had once been a “fast follower” soon became a global frontrunner — not just in EVs, but across each node of the entire electro-industrial stack.

The strategic consequences are enormous. Where innovation once flowed from defense and automotive firms into consumer markets, today it moves in the opposite direction. The future fight isn’t just about stamping steel; it’s about drones, spectrum warfare, power management, resilient communications, and hardened compute — systems built from the very modules and processes perfected in Shenzhen’s factories, not Detroit’s.

The late aerospace republic

America is often called an “aerospace republic” because it remains a domain of clear dominance. The industry is shielded by ITAR, and unlike EVs or drones, aerospace still relies on high-power turbomachinery that cannot easily be replaced by electrical systems tied into the global electronics supply chain. We remain the world’s best in thermodynamics; in fact, more countries can build nuclear reactors than can build top-tier gas turbines.

But this moat is shrinking. Aerospace and defense platforms are rapidly becoming electric and software-defined. Avionics, power distribution, motor controllers, and autonomy now matter as much as the airframe or combustor.

Everything that can be electrified will be electrified, because electric systems are the native substrate for code. Power electronics become the transmission, motors become the engine, and software becomes the differentiator. Across land, sea, and air, mobility is shifting to battery-electric and hybrid architectures. Rockets are the lone exception — chemical propulsion still dominates on thrust-to-weight ratio — but even these systems are increasingly going electric. Starship carries hundreds of kilowatts of power electronics and the same Tesla batteries you’d find in a Model 3 or Powerwall. The rocket equation stays chemical; everything around it becomes electrical.

Our aerospace moat that defines much of our defense prowess is far less secure than it first appears. It’s true that America still excels at turbomachinery; but we’ve offshored nearly everything else.

The major exception is Elon Musk. Tesla and SpaceX have built tens of millions of units in the United States, and a Model 3 has more in common with a Starlink satellite than with a legacy car: tightly-integrated electronics, high-density power systems, aggressive thermal management, OTA updates, and factories built for continuous iteration. It’s the same consumer electronics playbook being executed across Asia as we speak.

The lesson of Musk’s success, however, is not blind vertical integration. SpaceX only in-houses what the market cannot deliver. They build engines, tanks, and custom avionics because no supplier can meet their schedules. But they also work with STMicro for power ICs, Samsung for modems, and Xilinx for FPGAs. Even Starship depends on those batteries built through Tesla’s long-standing partnership with Panasonic.

The differentiator is that SpaceX fully owns the subsystem design and can credibly threaten to in-house any part that doesn’t meet its standards; and they proved this threat to be credible early on, when they in-housed production of their engines and structures. Electronics has kept up longer thanks to its scale and capability, but even that edge is narrowing as iteration gets faster, specs get tighter, and volume grows — which is why SpaceX now runs the largest PCB factory in the country, and is investing aggressively in advanced chip packaging.

Musk’s real insight is that cars and spacecraft should be built the way smartphones are — engineer the production system first, shape every subsystem for manufacturability and integration, and rely on existing high-volume supply chains and relentless process improvement for as long as physics allows. Musk’s companies appear unrelated: but together they form a cohesive electro-industrial conglomerate built on a common production model that others must follow to survive.

The arc toward boring excellence

When a technology becomes a consumer electronic, it follows the same arc: it starts life as a fragile miracle; then an interesting and novel product; then a boring commodity. Cars drive themselves, drones become expendable, robots leave labs, and cameras collapse into chips. Scale unlocks democratization: high-volume manufacturing lowers price, simplifies use, and spreads advanced capabilities to everyone on Earth. You, your friends, a shopkeeper in Lagos, and the President of the United States all carry the same smartphone.

This is an unprecedented global success, but left unattended it also creates a national security vulnerability. Defense-critical capabilities now emerge from the same process improvements that drive consumer electronics. The country that masters those processes gains the skills needed to shape the strategic industries of the future.

Today, the United States lacks serious modular middle firms that bind together the electronics ecosystem. Exceptional figures like Elon Musk have succeeded despite this by aggressively plugging into global supply chains and then pulling critical modules in-house over time. But that is not a reproducible strategy for the world ahead. We cannot make national success contingent on finding a hundred more Elons able to vertically integrate down to a screw. If we want the default choice to be American — fast, competitive, and reliable — we need to rebuild the missing layer. Reclaiming our electro-industrial future starts with building an American modular middle.

Critically, the goal is not deep vertical integration in the style of BYD or SpaceX. Even the best companies don’t — and shouldn’t — have to build everything themselves. Winners own system architecture and design key modules with scaled suppliers, concentrating differentiation where it actually matters: integration, software, and the customer. When a supplier can take a spec — a power system, motor driver, flight controller, thermal assembly, — and ramp it quickly using familiar parts and processes, development becomes fast, cheap, and repeatable. The aim is to anchor your product’s supply chain in as many massive markets as possible. This is the electro-industrial model worth building: architects define the system, upstream firms provide low-cost components at scale, and integration turns them into globally competitive products. Not all together inside a single firm, but across an ecosystem — here, in the United States. That’s how you get low-cost EVs, mass-produced satellites, and consumer-grade robotics in America.

And the solution must begin at the earliest stages of company formation. American startups lead in product vision, but often struggle to find suppliers willing to prototype alongside them, iterate quickly, and then scale with demand. Without a functional middle layer, these companies are pushed into premature vertical integration, sacrificing their core advantages of speed and focus simply to get products shipped.

This same gap has also pushed much of the mature American electronics sector toward foreign ODMs — original design manufacturers like Foxconn and Quanta that both design and build the product while their American partners focus on brand and distribution. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Amazon, and most appliance makers now rely heavily on this model. Between ODMs and vertical integration sits the hybrid JDM model — joint design manufacturing — where OEMs and suppliers co-design modules from the start, as with Apple and Sony on optics or Tesla and Panasonic on cells. Today, both the ODM and JDM models depend on a deep and capable ecosystem that the United States simply doesn’t have.

When companies are forced into vertical integration or risky foreign supplier bets, it’s a sign of market failure. A healthy industrial base depends on diverse suppliers who can adapt to customer requirements quickly and scale capacity on demand. Companies like Diode hint at what’s possible for PCBs, but America needs a far larger bench of key suppliers across every part of the electro-industrial stack — sensors, motors, batteries, compute, power electronics, and beyond.

There is tremendous reason for optimism. America leads in product and module design, and the upstream materials and device primitives we need are, for the most part, increasingly available. We also have the world’s deepest and most demanding consumer markets, and the brands best positioned to serve them. On paper, this should put the United States in a strong position. But in practice, closing the production gap will require a significant and durable shift to support an electronics ecosystem that now spans consumer products, industrial systems, and defense applications.

We may never match Shenzhen’s sheer density of low-cost suppliers. But software can help us stitch together a distributed manufacturing network of highly automated factories — not just to reshore high-volume production, but to continuously drive down the marginal cost of new product iteration. Without this, domestic manufacturing becomes increasingly static, bespoke, and expensive, while foreign competitors’ advantages compound through faster iteration. At the same time, we must be careful about lax subsidies that merely entrench incumbents or suppress competition; industrial policy that rewards presence rather than world-class performance will create lethargic firms vulnerable to the hyper-competitive dynamics of Asian markets. Finally, we should be intentional about inviting firms to build their production ecosystems here to learn from. American firms repatriating capabilities offshored decades ago are not the same as foreign firms just extending theirs.

America started this race with the smartphone in all of our pockets. We built the blueprint for the consumer electronics revolution; others scaled it. The billionth unit is always better and cheaper than the first. The next decade will determine whether our ecosystem remains merely architects or becomes builders. That depends on whether we can manifest the industrial layer we left behind. We will do this not through nostalgia for the factories of the past, but through mastery of the production model of the future. America invented the smartphone.

The board is chaired by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen Harris.
“The process reflects a serious effort to balance the State’s clean energy goals with the continued need for reliable and affordable electric service.
The process to update the State Energy Plan was announced in August 2024.
The State Energy Planning Board received and considered nearly 15,000 written comments and more than 1,000 people attended public hearings, with nearly 450 providing oral comments – which were also considered.","The New York State Energy Planning Board in December voted unanimously to approve a State Energy Plan.

The Plan includes recommendations, which are based on findings from more than a year-long assessment of current systems and future energy needs through 2040, that will guide the dtate’s energy-related decision making.

The board is chaired by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen Harris.

“NYPA is at the helm of major initiatives to add more renewable energy, develop advanced nuclear generation and expand transmission pathways to fortify New York’s electric grid,” said Justin E. Driscoll, president and CEO, New York Power Authority. “The state energy plan aligns with the Power Authority’s efforts to lead in clean energy innovation so that all New Yorkers have affordable energy and a healthier environment.”

“The Long Island Power Authority appreciates the extensive and thoughtful work undertaken by NYSERDA in developing the New York State Energy Plan,” said Carrie Meek Gallagher, Chief Executive Officer of LIPA.

“The process reflects a serious effort to balance the State’s clean energy goals with the continued need for reliable and affordable electric service. As Long Island’s public power utility, LIPA remains committed to advancing clean energy in a manner that protects system reliability and customer affordability. LIPA will continue to work closely with NYSERDA, state agencies, and regional partners to ensure Long Island’s electric system remains safe, reliable, and resilient while supporting New York’s clean energy transition,” she said.

The plan’s approval advances multiple objectives of the State including ensuring affordable, abundant, reliable, and clean energy while supporting economic development, equity, and a healthy environment, NYSERDA said.

“The plan embraces the State's continued commitment to renewables while also noting that a variety of energy sources, like advanced nuclear and natural gas, will be needed to help New York meet its overall energy needs over the next 15 years,” NYSERDA said.

The plan “was developed at a time when the energy sector faces significant uncertainty stemming from economic pressures and a shift in federal priorities and policies away from renewable energy projects,” it noted.

The analyses conducted for the plan have been updated to reflect the latest available data and federal actions since modelling was completed for the Draft Plan released in July 2025.

Updates also included further focus on energy affordability considerations and strategies to manage system costs, including through demand-side flexibility and added discussion of new, large loads and ways to manage associated grid and cost impacts.

NYSERDA said the analyses inform five primary planning goals and associated actions to continue to meet New York's energy needs which include:

• delivering abundant, reliable, resilient and clean energy through a diverse mix of resources and supply infrastructure, while supporting energy efficiency and load flexibility;

• providing affordable energy to households and equitable benefits – with a focus on reducing the upfront costs of efficiency and clean energy choices to help cut spending and lessen the burden for lower-income households;

• supporting economic growth and competitiveness by investing in workforce development, meeting the needs of large energy users, and attracting new industry, including clean energy leaders;

• strengthening partnerships across New York’s innovation ecosystem to foster economic development, create jobs, and provide greater leverage for State investments; and

• continuing progress toward decarbonization and a clean energy economy.

The process to update the State Energy Plan was announced in August 2024. The State Energy Planning Board, comprised of the heads of ten State agencies and authorities, appointees from the Governor, Senate, and Assembly, and the president of the New York Independent System Operator, commenced its work to assess and compile data to inform the Draft State Energy Plan, which was released in July 2025 for public review and comment.

The release of the 2025 Plan follows a robust public comment period which included 10 public hearings, seven in-person and three virtual, and written comment.

The State Energy Planning Board received and considered nearly 15,000 written comments and more than 1,000 people attended public hearings, with nearly 450 providing oral comments – which were also considered.

The Board received input from a wide variety of stakeholders, including individual New Yorkers, environmental organizations, utilities and energy companies, labor unions, and trade and business organizations, “underscoring the importance of the Plan’s focus on energy affordability and maintaining an abundant and diverse mix of energy sources and supply infrastructure,” NYSERDA said.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-07 11:59:51.338397

Clarity is bipartisan legislation that establishes a regulatory framework for digital assets, clarifying jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The bill passed the House of Representatives in July.

One reason for the heightened attention is that it allows Congress to revisit the issue of interest on deposits in stablecoins. Recall that Congress passed, and the president signed into law, the GENIUS Act, which provided a regulatory environment for payment stablecoins. Stablecoins would have to be backed dollar-for-dollar by holdings of Treasuries, so safety of the payment mechanism was assured. It also prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly paying to holders interest, yield, or rewards to keep stablecoin issuers focused on payment mechanisms rather than savings/investment products. That was the straightforward intent of Congress.

There are, however, economically equivalent transactions that the law doesn’t explicitly ban. Crypto exchanges, affiliates, or partners can offer yield-like incentives tied to stablecoin holdings. This means issuers can effectively circumvent the ban by having an exchange or third party give rewards that look like interest payments.

How should one think about this?

The incentive to use interest to attract dollars into stablecoin is clear; Congress should have recognized that it was possible to replicate the incentives without using interest per se. If the real legislative intent was not simply to ban interest, but to ban all interest-equivalent incentives, then the Clarity Act is an opportunity to get this right in the context of the larger regulatory regime governing crypto.

Or perhaps it was not. In that case, dollars will be attracted away from banks, money market accounts, and other deposits and into stablecoins. This would mean fewer deposits in banks, and the loss – perhaps substantial loss – of the loans the deposits financed. From a purely competitive point of view, it is a negative for the banking sector. Also, while the stablecoins are safe, the individuals face risks that the exchanges themselves could fail. These are negatives for banks and individuals.

On the other hand, the dollars would flow into Treasuries, and some other saver would not have to buy those Treasuries. Instead, their dollars would be available to fund the loans the banks would otherwise make. If the same investment financing happens using a lower-cost transaction mechanism, that is a good thing for the economy as a whole. Overall, the regulatory framework should support competition, innovation, and efficiency.

Viewed from this perspective, the problem with a GENIUS Act-like approach is that it is focused only on stablecoins, providing no way to balance competition between stablecoins and other payment mechanisms. A better approach would have a comprehensive approach to regulation, i.e., a Clarity Act, and seek to put all traditional and digital payments and assets on a level playing field and let the chips fall where they may.

Residents of Bienville Parish and an environmental advocacy group have filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn an oil and gas wastewater injection permit issued by the state, marking what is described as the first appeal of a Class 2 injection permit in Louisiana.

The suit was filed January 5 in the 19th Judicial District Court by citizens from Jamestown and the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, or LEAN, challenging a permit granted to Brickyard Trucking LLC by the Louisiana Department of Conservation. The plaintiffs argue the agency failed to adequately consider cumulative environmental impacts, particularly risks to drinking water aquifers.

Brickyard Trucking received the permit on November 6 authorizing three injection wells that would pass through the Carrizo-Wilcox and Upland Terrace aquifers, part of the Sparta Aquifer system. According to the filing, the facility would accept wastewater delivered by as many as 192 tanker trucks per day, with the waste injected underground under high pressure.

The wastewater, commonly referred to as produced water or saltwater, contains toxic and radioactive materials but is exempt from regulation under federal hazardous waste law, the suit states. The injection site is located in a recharge zone for the Sparta aquifer system and near a major fault line, which plaintiffs say heightens concerns about groundwater contamination and seismic activity.

“The Dept. of Conservation is a public agency, and it needs to start taking the public seriously,” said Lois Smith of Jamestown, one of the named plaintiffs.

LEAN and four individual residents — Ralph Woodall, Tanya Griffith, Lois Smith and Audrey Evans — allege both substantive and procedural errors by the Department of Conservation. The suit cites more than 800 citizen petitions submitted during the permit review process. It also notes that during the review period, the agency was managing a high volume of carbon capture and sequestration permit applications, which led Gov. Jeff Landry to issue a moratorium prioritizing certain Class 6 projects.

Opponents of the project have raised concerns about the growing number of wastewater injection facilities in the region, increased truck traffic and the potential for contamination of drinking water sources. They also point to what they describe as a rise in earthquakes in the area that scientists have linked to human-caused drilling activity.

Citizens in Bienville Parish have continued a yard sign campaign urging the protection of Louisiana’s aquifers and advocating for alternatives to underground injection of produced water. The campaign promotes redirecting federal 45Q tax credit funding toward above-ground treatment options, which industry groups have identified as a growing priority following wastewater disposal issues in other states.

Wired for Profit: Third in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.

BUCKS — South Alabama is where it all washes out.

Here, in the nation’s second-largest delta, the waters of the Deep South wind through the pines and cypresses of the Yellowhammer State, snaking their way into Mobile Bay and on to the Gulf. Among the most biodiverse regions in the country, the Mobile-Tensaw Delta drains 44,000 square miles of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. It’s where the rivers—the Mobile, Tensaw, Blakely, Apalachee, Middle and Spanish Rivers—meet in land dubbed the “American Amazon” by E.O. Wilson, a renowned naturalist born in the state.

The Delta’s history is America’s. At its heart are the island mounds of Bottle Creek, the “principal political and religious center” for the Indigenous Pensacola culture for 300 years before European contact.

About a dozen miles south, beneath the surface of the Mobile River’s muddy waters, lies the wreckage of the Clotilda, widely regarded as the last slave ship to enter the United States. And farther south, still, the Mobile River empties into Mobile Bay, itself a veritable biodiversity hotspot and the cornerstone of a vibrant coastal culture and ecosystem.

But all of that, many residents, experts and environmentalists say, is at risk, because of Alabama Power’s coal ash waste, a toxic leftover from decades of burning coal for electricity.

One 600-acre pit of the toxic coal ash lies along the banks of the Mobile River in the Upper Delta, about 25 miles north of Mobile Bay. There, smokestacks from the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant rise like a sore thumb from a horizon of green, towering over an unlined pond filled with more than 21 million tons of the toxic residue. Holding back the toxic waste from the Mobile River? Earthen dikes.

Alyson Tucker, media relations manager for Alabama Power, one of the nation’s most profitable electric utilities and one of the state’s most powerful companies, said in an email that the company “remains committed to operating in full compliance with environmental regulations. Our plans for closure and groundwater protection fully comply with current state and federal law, are approved by [the Alabama Department of Environmental Management] and are certified by professional engineers.”

“Due to ongoing litigation related to Plant Barry coal ash, we are unable to comment further at this time,” Tucker said.

Leaving coal waste in place under engineered caps, company representatives have long argued, is safe and protective of groundwater—claims that state regulators have accepted but both environmental groups and federal regulators dispute.

Alabama’s American Amazon isn’t the only area placed at risk by Alabama Power’s ghosts of energy past. An Inside Climate News review of the utility’s legally mandated emergency action plans shows that hundreds of square miles of land and waterways would be at risk of inundation in the event of a breach of the barriers holding back toxic waste at its six coal ash pond sites across the state. In total, more than 117 million tons of coal sludge are at issue, stored along Alabama’s waterways.

What to do with all that polluted material has become a controversial question, with federal and state officials at odds over the issue. In 2015, the federal government finalized a rule tightening restriction around how coal waste could be stored. EPA left implementation of the new standards to states, but in May 2024, the agency denied the state of Alabama’s plan to allow Alabama Power and other utilities to continue storing toxic coal ash in unlined pits at sites across the state. Federal officials said the plan would not adequately protect the state’s groundwater from contamination by coal ash residuals following “cap-in-place” closure.

“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure. In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units,” the decision said.

More than a year after the EPA denied Alabama’s coal ash plan, with the Trump administration now running the federal environmental agency, it’s unclear what comes next for the toxic ponds and the government’s now decade-old effort to safely close them.

But one thing is certain, according to Cade Kistler, who leads Mobile Baykeeper, an environmental nonprofit currently in litigation with Alabama Power over the coal ash lagoon at Plant Barry. Until the toxic leftovers of the company’s fossil fuel commitments are moved out of groundwater and away from waterways, the delta and Mobile Bay are an Eden on the edge of disaster.

“The delta is an elegant labyrinth, full of bayous and sloughs and backwaters. If it is flooded with ash, it would be polluting forever,” Kistler said. “There would be no way to effectively clean it up.”

The cost of Kingston

The failure of a dirt dike at a coal ash pond isn’t theoretical. In 2008, a coal ash impoundment in Kingston, Tennessee, breached, spilling more than a billion gallons of toxic sludge across 300 acres of land and into the Emory River channel. The result was one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history. The spill cost the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which owned the coal impoundment, over $1 billion to clean up. Ten years after the spill, dozens of the roughly 900 workers employed during the cleanup were already dead. More than 250 were chronically ill. According to the EPA, coal ash contains heavy metal contaminants like mercury, cadmium and arsenic known to cause cancer and other serious effects on the nervous system, heart, kidneys and development.

Both Alabama Power’s own groundwater monitoring reports and measurements taken by researchers from the Mobile River adjacent to Plant Barry confirm heavy metal contamination at the site.

“We identified a significant contribution of toxic metals linked to coal ash near Sister’s Creek, the man-made cooling discharge channel of Plant Barry, particularly during the dry season,” one 2025 study by scientists at the University of Alabama and Texas A&M Universities concluded. The peer-reviewed paper also pointed to the impacts of climate change as another reason to be wary of Alabama Power’s storage of coal ash on waterways.

“There is a plausible concern for acute and chronic toxic metals environmental pollution from the Alabama ash pond, considering rising seawater levels and more frequent severe storm surges in the region since its initial construction,” the study said.

The volume of coal ash material stored at Plant Barry alone is more than four times that of the sludge that spilled in Kingston in 2008, according to company figures. That fact alone should worry anyone concerned about Alabama’s environment, said Diane Thomas, one of three self-proclaimed “coal ash grannies” featured in a new documentary about Plant Barry’s coal lagoons, Sallie’s Ashes.

Thomas spent three decades living on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay.

“I have kayaked and sailed,” she said. “I swam. I crabbed. I fished. My love for the bay and what you can do on the bay runs deep.”

It was an easy “yes,” then, when her decades-long friend Sallie Smith asked Thomas and another friend, Savan Wilson, to help her fight against Alabama Power’s plans to leave coal ash beside the Mobile River. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and felt she needed to spend her remaining time advocating to protect the bay she’d grown to adore. The trio founded the Coal Ash Action Group, a grassroots organization committed to educating Alabamians about an issue unknown to many.

Thomas, a retired clinical psychologist, said it’s easy to fight for something so dear to so many. For decades, the delta and the bay have been an integral part of her family’s lives.

She smiled as she recalled her first jubilee, a naturally occurring event where low oxygen levels in Mobile Bay cause marine life to flee toward shore.

“There is nothing like catching your own crabs,” Thomas said. “Have you ever cleaned 200 crabs? Your thumbs are just raw.”

After her husband was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, no longer able to work, he began to fish almost daily. With aggressive treatment, he survived the disease.

“We ate fresh fish for about eight years—four times a week,” Thomas said.

That type of close connection with the water is something Thomas feels shouldn’t be put at risk unnecessarily by an electric utility.

‘

A knife to your throat’

Alabama Power’s legally-mandated emergency action plan for Plant Barry shows that if earthen dikes separating the coal ash from the Mobile River were to breach, around 25 square miles of the Mobile-Tensaw Delta would be inundated with coal slurry, covering dozens of miles of the Mobile, Middle and Tensaw Rivers, just upstream of Mobile Bay. From there, the toxic sludge would diffuse throughout the region, with the state’s rivers acting as a heart, pumping the liquid farther and farther from Plant Barry.

“But instead of lifeblood, it’s pumping coal waste that would kill the environment,” Thomas said.

David Bronner, the prominent CEO of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, recently called Plant Barry’s coal ash pond “a huge environmental bomb” in a newsletter sent to state retirees.

“We need your cooperation again for South Alabama,” Bronner wrote in an open appeal to Alabama’s congressional delegation. “Not for new jobs, but for solving an old problem that still exists. That problem hangs over all of Alabama, like a knife to your throat: the coal ash dump that sits next to Mobile Bay. No one should forget what the Tennessee coal ash dump did to that state. A breach of the Mobile site would clearly damage Mobile Bay for decades.”

Thomas believes Bronner’s assessment is on target.

A coal ash breach could be even worse, Thomas said.

“If a breach occurred, we would be the most industrially polluted site in the nation, and we know that pollution wouldn’t just go away,” she said.

That’s why she and Wilson have committed themselves to informing others across the state about the dangers of the waste, something they now do in memory of Smith, who died of cancer in October 2023.

“Sallie’s focus was on connecting people in search of our common humanity, and in seeking to deepen our understanding and compassion for one another,” her obituary read. “This ardent effort was an outgrowth and demonstration of her deep faith. She loved her family, Mobile Bay, country music, her many friends, including her hiking group of intrepid college friends, and all God’s people.”

‘Pray we don’t have a hurricane’

While there’s still much to be done to contain the coal ash threat, Thomas said, there have been at least some glimmers of hope. In early 2024, Alabama Power confirmed a plan to contract a company called Eco Materials to remove and recycle some of the coal waste stored at Plant Barry.

Since then, however, there has been little in the way of substantive public updates about the project, which company officials previously said would begin recycling coal ash into construction materials like concrete in January 2026. In response to an inquiry from Inside Climate News, a representative for Alabama Power said the recycling facility is “expected to be in service by early 2026.”

Eco Materials was acquired by materials company CRH in July 2025, according to an announcement. Neither Eco Materials nor CRH responded to a request for a detailed update on the recycling plans.

Still, Thomas said that even the conception of a plan is a step in the right direction.

“We need to recycle as much as possible and just pray we don’t have a hurricane,” she said.

Kistler said he fears just that. An extreme weather event or other emergency could leave a world-renowned environmental gem drowned in polluted sludge.

Alabama Power’s emergency action plans, bare-bones documents required by federal law, provide only limited information about what could occur if a breach happened at its coal ash sites across the state. The documents also provide little real-world information about how the company would approach mitigation, clean up and remediation.

Regarding extreme weather, the 39-page emergency plan for Plant Barry mentions only that if severe weather causes road closures during an emergency dam breach, company response times may be delayed. Despite Plant Barry’s location in south Alabama, the word “hurricane” does not appear in the emergency action plan.

“It’s foolhardy,” Kistler said. “There needs to be more detail.”

Regulators have agreed. In January 2023, the EPA issued Alabama Power a notice of potential violation informing the company that, in the agency’s view, it had violated federal regulations because its groundwater monitoring program and emergency action plan were not adequate.

The agency settled that dispute with Alabama Power in 2024 when the company agreed to “evaluate and expand its groundwater monitoring program at Plant Barry, to review and upgrade its Emergency Action Plan, and to pay a civil penalty of $278,000,” according to the EPA.

More than a year later, a representative of the utility told members of Alabama’s Public Service Commission that an updated emergency action plan is still in the works.

“The emergency action plan will be modified to include additional wording and descriptions to clarify the company’s preparedness for extreme weather conditions,” Dustin Brooks, land compliance manager for Alabama Power, told commissioners on Dec. 9.

“I just hope that outside this public document, they’ve got better plans somewhere,” Kistler said.

A previously available copy of the EPA’s settlement agreement with Alabama Power has been removed from the agency’s website, though the press release announcing the agreement remains. “This Initiative is needed given the breadth and scope of observed noncompliance with the federal coal ash regulations,” the agency said.

An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s coal ash units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s then-vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” coal ash waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.

“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.

In 2019, the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.

In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.

Plant Barry is just one of Alabama Power’s six plant sites across the state that store coal ash. In all, the slurry lagoons cover a footprint of around 2,000 acres and pose unique risks to groundwater and waterways around them.

A now capped-in-place coal ash impoundment at Plant Gadsden, for example, is still contaminating groundwater more than seven years after its closure, according to Alabama Power’s groundwater monitoring reports and a lawsuit filed against the utility by Coosa Riverkeeper, an environmental nonprofit.

“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release after the lawsuit was filed. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”

In a motion to dismiss the lawsuit over groundwater contamination at Plant Gadsden, lawyers for Alabama Power emphasized that state regulators approved the company’s plans for coal ash waste at the site.

When groundwater monitoring identified elevated levels of contaminants, the lawyers wrote, “Alabama Power worked with professional engineers and the public to design and implement a corrective action program to address those exceedances—a program certified as compliant with the federal CCR rule and that will continue as part of ‘post-closure care.’”

While the suit should be dismissed due to an expired statute of limitations, Alabama Power’s attorneys argued, the court should also decline to second guess the decision of state regulators to approve the company’s actions.

“[Coosa Riverkeeper] asks the Court to turn back the clock, to before 2020, to second-guess the groundwater monitoring system and closure decisions—work completed long ago, approved by state regulators, and certified by professional engineers as compliant,” the motion said.

Plants Barry, Gorgas, Greene County and Miller have been designated as having “significant hazard potential” under federal law. Plant Gaston, located near the town of Wilsonville in Shelby County, has been designated as having “high hazard potential.”

Following an emergency dam break at that site, which the company deems “unlikely,” Alabama Power’s initial hazard potential assessment concluded that “water and [coal ash] could potentially impact the residential neighborhood to the west, and the Coosa River to the south…failure or misoperation of the [coal ash] unit could potentially result in a loss of human life.”

Kistler said that it’s notable that Alabama Power is unique among southern utilities in leaving all of its coal waste in unlined pits along waterways. Georgia Power, another subsidiary of Southern Company, has already shifted toward more appropriate disposal of at least some of its coal ash in lined landfills. It’s not a question then, Kistler said, of whether Alabama Power can do the same. It’s only a question of if it will.

“It feels like we’re paying premium prices, and we’re getting bargain-bin environmental protections,” he said, making a reference to Alabama Power’s highest average residential electric bills in the nation. “If Georgia can do it, why not us?”

A coal legacy and a fossil-fueled future

Barry Brock, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, is part of the team of lawyers suing Alabama Power over its coal ash impoundment at Plant Barry. Initially dismissed by a Trump-appointed U.S. district court judge on technical grounds, the case is now pending before the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Brock said he is hopeful the team will secure a victory.

Oral arguments in the case were held in Atlanta in November, and some of Alabama Power’s arguments were unusually revealing, Brock said.

“Alabama Power admits that a lot of the coal ash is going to be left in contact with groundwater under their closure plan,” he said. “That’s particularly galling.”

Coal ash isn’t SELC’s first legal tussle with Alabama Power, however. Lawyers for the environmental nonprofit are also representing customers suing Alabama Power over residential solar fees they argue violate the law and discourage the use of renewable energy. In response, the company has said that it “support[s] customers interested in using onsite generation, such as solar” but that its rate structure for those customers must avoid “unfairly shifting” costs to other ratepayers.

Meanwhile, the company has doubled down on its fossil fuel investments, purchasing a natural gas plant in Autauga County for around $622 million, effectively locking the company into the continued use of fossil fuels for years to come, though the company said in an email that its investments are data-driven, forward-looking and “are not based on a preference for any one fuel source.”

All of these developments are individually concerning, Brock said, and together, they demonstrate a pattern.

“It sends a pretty clear message that Alabama Power is really concerned about their financial well-being and the rate of return they get on fossil fuel infrastructure,” he said. “It says they have a pretty compliant regulatory environment that is not going to scrutinize them when they want to raise rates for customers to do it.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47657/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/berry-plant-for-jan-7-2025-story-1024x6251767787590.jpg?h=3b04d700&itok=o8WH8VsH,N,,2026-01-07 09:14:26.464952

They have been renewed one year at a time ever since, but without the comprehensive overhaul that used to accompany farm bills.

The July 2025 enactment of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the Trump administration’s budget priorities in the tax and spending bill, revised funding levels for many programs that were historically handled in the farm bill.
Doing so would be an effective declaration that a permanent five-year farm bill is on indefinite hold.","With Congress back in session, legislators will take up a set of issues they haven’t comprehensively addressed since 2018 – the year the last farm bill passed.

Farm bills are massive pieces of legislation that address a diverse constellation of topics, including agricultural commodities, conservation, trade, nutrition, rural development, energy, forestry and more. Because of their complexity, farm bills are difficult to negotiate in any political environment. And as the topics have expanded since the first iteration in 1933, Congress has generally agreed to take the whole thing up once every five years or so.

However, the most recent farm bill’s provisions expired in 2023. They have been renewed one year at a time ever since, but without the comprehensive overhaul that used to accompany farm bills.

As former federal employees handling agriculture policy who now study that topic, it’s unclear to us whether a comprehensive, five-year farm bill can be passed in 2026, or ever again.

The July 2025 enactment of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the Trump administration’s budget priorities in the tax and spending bill, revised funding levels for many programs that were historically handled in the farm bill. For instance, that law included a 20% cut in funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which helps low-income families buy food. And it doubled support for the largest farm subsidy programs.

Those changes and current divisions in Congress mean the nation’s food and agriculture policy may remain stuck in limbo for yet another year.

Cuts to SNAP used for farm subsidies

For decades, political conventional wisdom has held that sweeping federal farm bills are able to pass only because farmers seeking subsidies and anti-hunger advocates wanting increased SNAP dollars recognize the mutual advantage in working together. That’s how to build a broad, bipartisan consensus strong enough to garner the 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to avoid a filibuster and actually pass a bill.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending law did not create a compromise between those competing interests. It slashed SNAP spending by US$186 billion over the next decade. At the same time, it boosted price support for farmers who grow key crops like corn, soybeans and wheat by $60 billion, in addition to a $10 billion economic relief package passed at the end of 2024 to address high costs of seeds, fertilizer and other farming supplies.

Supporters of anti-hunger programs are furious that these funds for farmers are being paid for by cutting SNAP benefits to families.

In addition, about one-third of the SNAP cuts came by shifting the program’s cost to state budgets. States have always carried some of the costs to administer SNAP, but they have never before been required to fund billions of dollars in benefits. Many states will be unable to cover these increased costs and will be forced to either reduce benefits or opt out of SNAP altogether, dramatically cutting the help available to hungry Americans.

Groups that support SNAP are unlikely to help pass any bill relating to food or farm policy that does not substantially reverse the cuts to SNAP.

And farmers who receive money under the two largest farm subsidy programs are not even required to grow the specific crops those programs are meant to support. Rather, they must simply own farmland that was designated in 1996 as having grown that crop in the early 1980s.

Farmers have repeatedly said they would prefer federal farm policies that support markets and create conditions for stable, fair commodity prices. And evidence shows that spending more money on farm subsidies does little to actually improve underlying economic conditions affecting the costs of farming or the prices of what is grown.

And yet, in early December 2025, the Department of Agriculture released an additional $12 billion to help offset losses farmers experienced when Trump’s tariffs reduced agricultural exports. In mid-December, the National Farmers Union said that money still wasn’t enough to cover losses from consistently low commodity prices and high seed and fertilizer costs.

A regular five-year farm bill may be out of reach

The success of any bill depends on political will in Congress and outside pressure coming together to deliver the required number of votes.

Some leaders in Congress remain optimistic about the prospects of a farm bill passing in 2026, but major legislation is rare with midterm elections looming, so meaningful progress appears unlikely. It seems to us more likely that the ongoing stalemate will continue indefinitely.

In September 2025, Politico reported that instead of a complete five-year farm bill, the House and Senate committees on agriculture might take up a series of smaller bills to extend existing programs whose authorizations are expiring. Doing so would be an effective declaration that a permanent five-year farm bill is on indefinite hold.

Prospects for sustainable farm policy

By using financial incentives cleverly, Congress has shifted farming practices over time in ways that lawmakers determined were in the public’s interest.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, allocated $20 billion over four years to encourage farmers to reduce or offset carbon emissions, which the Agriculture Department calls “climate-smart agriculture.” Those funds, along with a separate Department of Agriculture initiative with similar aims, were well received by American farmers. Farmers applied for far more money than was actually available.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act tax and spending law cut those funds and repurposed them for traditional Agriculture Department programs for farmers who want to implement conservation practices on their land.

But unexpectedly, the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, agenda contains some ideas that climate-smart advocates have previously advanced. These include scathing indictments of the effects of conventional agriculture on Americans’ health, including concerns over pesticide use and the so-far-undefined category of “ultra-processed foods.”

The MAHA agenda could be an opportunity for organic farmers to secure a boost in federal funding. In December, the Agriculture Department committed $700 million toward “regenerative” practices, but that’s a trifling amount compared with the billions commodity farmers received in 2025.

And the administration’s allies who support conventional agriculture have already expressed concerns that MAHA efforts might reduce the nation’s agricultural productivity. The administration may end up caught between the MAHA movement and Big Ag.

Overall, in this new political environment, we believe advocates for changes in agriculture and food aid will likely need to rethink how to advance their agendas without the promise of a farm bill coming anytime soon.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/711033/original/file-20260106-63-dhw91p.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C464%2C5568%2C2784&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-07 10:13:59.823814

“States have powerful tools to advance zero-emission vehicles, making their leadership more critical than ever,” said Ryland Shengzhi Li, Lead Counsel, Clean Transportation. “State policies deliver cleaner air, lower fuel and maintenance costs for drivers, and provide major economic opportunities in EV manufacturing and infrastructure.”

The report features detailed state profiles, a 16-policy matrix, and analysis designed to inform policymakers, utilities, industry leaders, and other stakeholders as they shape next-generation EV strategies. EDF developed the report through extensive cross-state reviews of state and local government policies, regulatory agency actions, and utility programs. Key findings include:

Every state has adopted at least four EV-supportive policies, reflecting broad, bipartisan commitment to expanding clean transportation across a range of policy tools.

California leads with all 16 policies in place, while states across the geographic spectrum – including Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, and Alabama – have built diversified EV policy portfolios.

Charging infrastructure investment is nearly universal: Almost every state offers incentives or rebates for EV charging equipment through state or utility programs, and all states participate in the bipartisan National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build a national fast-charging network.

Forty states offer incentives for medium- and heavy-duty EVs, signaling broad support for cleaner trucks and buses.

Some states are taking action to help bring as many renewable kilowatts to the grid as possible before the major start-construction deadline comes along on July 4, 2026.

In Oregon and Colorado, governors themselves have tried to streamline permitting and cut other red tape to get projects online faster.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek put forth an executive order in October 2025 called “Accelerating Wind and Solar Energy Development in Advance of Elimination of Federal Clean Energy Tax Credits.” The order instructs state agencies to take all steps necessary to accelerate and prioritize siting and permitting reviews for projects seeking to meet the July 4 ITC deadline.

“With the elimination of promised incentives by the Trump administration, states must step up as the last line of defense against climate catastrophe. We have to get renewable energy infrastructure built, and quickly,” Kotek said in a press statement. “We cannot afford to lose this critical window; every wind and solar project we help complete now directly fights the irreversible climate damage we’re racing to prevent.”

Similarly, in Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis released an executive action over the summer titled “State Commitment Prioritizing Deployment of Affordable Clean Energy,” also directing state agencies to do whatever they can to speed deployment before the deadline. Polis announced a state commitment to adopt flexible interconnection — allowing more projects to interconnect to the grid using operational software that tailors renewable energy output to match the grid’s needs.

Beat-the-deadline efforts are also happening in state legislatures and utility commissions across the country. In New Jersey and Illinois, new actions have opened more capacity in state incentive programs to help developers stack incentives and lower costs for ratepayers ahead of federal deadlines.

The Illinois Commerce Commission doubled the size of its Adjustable Block Program — opening incentives to 1,000 MW of community, commercial and small-scale solar projects. The expanded capacity prioritizes projects that can start construction before July 4.

“By acting now, Illinois is ensuring that residents and businesses benefit from the lowest-cost solar projects while federal incentives remain available — cementing the state’s position as a national model for smart, affordable clean energy growth,” said Stephanie Burgos-Veras, senior manager of equity programs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill into law that unlocked an additional 3,000 MW of community solar in October 2025. The state focused on community projects specifically to give more residents the chance to lower their bills with clean energy.

“By accelerating the process for bringing new sources of energy online and rapidly building new energy storage facilities, we will meet growing demand while also making life more affordable for our state’s families,” said Murphy in a statement.

And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill to exempt solar developers from paying taxes on IRA benefits — keeping project costs down, helping to appeal to investors and spurring development before the deadline.

“SB 302 will keep energy project costs down by allowing California energy developers to realize the full value of federal tax incentives,” said Stephanie Doyle, California state director for SEIA.

Newsom also signed a bill creating a West-wide regional electricity market that will allow California to develop and sell renewable energy to other states across the Interior West, and vice versa. These efforts create new opportunities for developers working to get as many megawatts in the ground as possible with the remaining tax incentives.

“Rapidly expanding demand for new energy resources from data computing needs, aging transmission infrastructure and extreme weather conditions are raising the cost of electricity across the West. The stakes are high, and with passage of AB 825, we have an opportunity to collaborate and create a western regional market for cost-effective supply of newer clean energy resources,” said Vijay Satyal, deputy director of markets and transmission at Western Resource Advocates.

As the wood is heated, the volatile matter off-gases and burns as an open flame, similar to a candle.","Companies are increasingly seeking renewable sources of carbon for energy use and sequestration, and one option consistently rises to the top for accessibility: biomass. With a wide range of feedstocks—including woody and agricultural residues, aquatic biomass and food waste—biomass serves as a versatile source of carbon, with potential use applications as diverse as the materials themselves. Fertilizer producers, cement manufacturers, farmers and steelmakers are among those benefiting from lower carbon-intensity scores tied to fossil-emission reductions and carbon sequestration.

However, as biomass applications expand and specifications become increasingly important, so, too, do standards. The biomass industry’s product diversity is a strength, but it can cause confusion for future investors or offtakers as they seek to understand carbon-based products and applications. Industry experts Myles Gray, U.S. Biochar Initiative, and Chris Wiberg, Timber Products Inspection/Biomass Energy Lab, work to provide clarity regarding the differences among three seemingly equivalent terms—biochar, biocoal and biocarbon—as well as the overarching term pyrogenic biocarbon.

In his role at USBI, Gray promotes the manufacture and utilization of biochar. His background in environmental science led him to an interest in the biochar industry. Through his experiences working for a biochar startup, he found that the biochar industry needs clearer definitions and standards to help maximize growth and explain the product’s value proposition to investors. “It was always such an uphill battle to even get someone to understand what biochar was,” he says. “And if you got past that threshold, trying to get them convinced that you could make the same product over and over again at large scale to hit certain metrics.”

USBI is funded by the U.S. Forest Service, which views biochar as a strategy to reduce fire risk by providing another market for low-value wood. One of Gray’s first projects with USBI was a survey of the global and U.S. biochar industries, he explains, and he was surprised to learn that the industry identified standards as one of the key obstacles to biochar’s development. “From then forward, we really started pushing on standards, and those who really understand product to market, I think, are very enthusiastic about the effort,” Gray says. Standards are critical because they enable communication between seller and buyer. Currently, that communication “has been a mess,” he adds, as both parties are looking for different data.

The terms biochar, biocarbon and biocoal are used by various sectors but lack standardized terminology. Serving as chair of the U.S. Technical Advisory Group for the International Organization for Standardization Technical Committee 238, Wiberg works to bring clarity through standardization. He also utilizes his extensive experience from working with Timber Products Inspection/Biomass Energy Lab, which involves inspecting and testing for compliance for solid biofuel- and biocarbon-based products. In a 2024 update, ISO TC 238 changed its title and scope to include “pyrogenic biocarbon,” which includes biochar, biocarbon and biocoal. In essence, this means the standards for this sector are now managed through ISO TC 238. Actual definitions for these terms are still being developed, Wiberg explains, but he believes these efforts will help differentiate how the terms biochar, biocoal and biocarbon should be used to describe various pyrogenic biocarbon products.

Technical Details

Understanding what pyrogenic biocarbon is and the differences between these products starts with understanding the basics of combustion and the components of biomass. Clean woody biomass, for example, consists of roughly 84% volatile matter (material that is liberated as gas when heated) and roughly 15% fixed carbon (the solid carbon material that remains after all volatile matter is released), with the remainder being the ash fraction. Charcoal is an example of a material whereby biomass has been heated to remove the majority of the volatile matter, with the fixed carbon and ash remaining. The process by which the volatile matter is removed, the type of biomass material used and the amount of ash can vary significantly. Therefore, the final product may better serve a specific end use (e.g., agriculture, concrete additive, steelmaking, etc.), creating a variety of product categories that may be referred to as biochar, biocoal, biocarbon, etc. In the past, waste biomass materials were typically utilized via combustion, creating renewable heat and energy. However, interest in sequestering carbon and avoiding emissions has led to interest in processing biomass through pyrolysis or gasification to yield high fixed-carbon-content materials that can be used to replace carbonaceous fossil fuels or to directly sequester carbon.

Wiberg illustrates the process of combustion and the presence of volatile matter and fixed carbon using the example of a common campfire. When wood combusts in a campfire, the initial tall flames come from the volatile matter. As the wood is heated, the volatile matter off-gases and burns as an open flame, similar to a candle. As the volatile matter is depleted, the tall flames go away, but what is left is a very hot bed of coals. This is the high-energy-density fixed-carbon fraction. Smoke is essentially volatile matter that does not ignite and burn. “Any smoke is like the lost energy,” he explains.

Woody biomass is transformed into charcoal through pyrolysis, which heats wood to the point that nearly all volatile matter is liberated, leaving behind fixed carbon. Charcoal is differentiated from other products because its primary feedstock is low-end biomass with high ash content; this works well for generating heat and grilling but is not well-suited for industrial applications where the material must be as clean as possible.

The production process may not differ greatly from product to product, but there are differences. For example, wood shavings or sawdust could be used to make any of these three products, while biomass like sewage sludge or food waste is better used in biochar (e.g., agricultural applications) but would not work as a feedstock for biocarbon (e.g., steel manufacturing). “Not all feedstocks result in the ability to sell into all three markets,” Wiberg says. “It’s more like you can make pyrogenic biocarbon products out of a lot of different feedstock materials, but the end use may be more selective as to which ones are better or more appropriate for a specific end use.”

Gray also emphasizes that the processes used to make biochar, biocarbon and biocoal are almost identical, but the quality of the feedstock often determines the ultimate end use.

Biochar

Made via pyrolysis, biochar’s main purpose is to sequester carbon for preferably hundreds of years. This could mean use as a soil amendment for marginal, low-quality soils or as a component in concrete. When added to soil, biochar improves water and nutrient retention, helping improve fertility. “If you mix it with a fertilizer, some of the fertilizer will be absorbed into the biochar, and it will allow for a more gradual dissipation of that fertilizer into the farm application,” Wiberg says.

Biochar must remain in the environment for as long as possible; therefore, the biomass’ permanence constitutes the important metric rather than fixed-carbon content. Wiberg explains that data points such as random reflectance and hydrogen-to-organic-carbon ratio help predict how long the carbon will remain sequestered in the environment.

Though it has been said there are 80 uses for biochar, according to Gray, only about 10 are economically viable, and his team actively promotes five of those. Alongside use as a soil amendment and fertilizer ingredient, biochar finds use in the horticultural substrate market, replacing expensive imported products such as peat, perlite or vermiculite.

The concrete sector sees biochar as a potential additive to help reduce the product’s carbon intensity and increase its strength. “Small amounts of biochar can be added in, and that’s not much. It might be like 3 to 5 percent, but 3 to 5 percent of all the concrete we use would be an astronomical amount of biochar deployed. There’s just so much concrete in the world,” Gray adds.

The two other applications his team explores are soil remediation and wastewater treatment, since biochar’s properties help remove pollutants and improve plant health in stormwater systems. A particle of biochar is 90% porous, with wood biochar in particular looking like a “crazy honeycomb,” Gray explains. When the cell wall structure of the wood is retained, it offers a lot of porosity and surface area inside biochar particles, allowing pollutants to be absorbed by the biochar. “I think of it as sort of like the poor man’s activated carbon as a product that can be deployed more broadly, in more systems where you might not want to put a bunch of very expensive activated carbon. You can use biochar instead,” he says.

Currently, the largest market for biochar comes from farmers growing high-value crops on small acreage, such as vineyards and orchards. The agricultural sector will most likely continue to be biochar’s largest market, according to Gray.

Biocarbon

This substance offers itself as a lower-carbon-intensity option for industrial processes such as steel manufacturing. Coke or metallurgical coal helps reduce iron oxide into steel. Producers engineer biocarbon to be as similar to metallurgical coal or coke as possible, which means the product must be highly refined. Biocarbon needs a concentrated degree of carbon, so the feedstock is typically made of clean, high-quality wood, minimizing the amount of ash created. “They want to be very calculated as to how much volatiles they cook off so that it’s a very highly concentrated fixed carbon in the final product,” Wiberg says. “It’s kind of like charcoal, only it’s been engineered more precisely.”

The carbon is still used up in this application, but it enables manufacturers to avoid coal usage. Gray explains that the carbon in biocarbon becomes consumed by the reduction process, while biochar stays in the ground for up to 1,000 years.

Biocoal

The term “biocoal” is used to describe a renewable alternative to coal. While it is made from a thermally treated material, biocoal does not require the same type of charring as other products. “[A] lot of the volatile matter is dissipated when you’re making the higher-quality biocarbon reductant material for steel or even biochar—since you’re trying to get it to be as permanent in the environment as possible—but biocoal is not as heavily thermally treated. You might try to retain a larger percentage of those volatiles,” Wiberg says.

Typically, biocoal is produced using steam explosion or torrefaction processes that increase the energy density of the material. Biocoal finds use in power plants, cement production facilities, heating plants and anywhere coal serves as a source of heat or power.

These product uses might vary widely, but ultimately, each of them brings value by utilizing waste and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil carbon, Wiberg explains. “There are different benefits, but all of them have some very nice carbon mitigation … properties and purposes, and hence the reason everybody’s trying to use them in any way they can to switch over from fossil carbon to renewable carbon,” he says.

Championing Standardization

Right now, the primary consequence of the lack of standards is confusion for buyers and sellers, but the challenges will grow with the industry. Although these products may be similar, defining each term is crucial, as the products serve different uses and may have different manufacturing methods.

Wiberg lists some of the key elements the ISO seeks to standardize to help the industry speak the same language: “It’s sampling, sample prep, vocabulary, but then all of the individual test methods that go into testing these materials. You’ve got moisture, ash, volatile matter, physical properties, calorific value, metals, chlorine, etc. All the different techniques that are used to run the analysis of these materials are defined under ISO TC 238.”

According to Wiberg, standards are already “late to the game.” As the industry grows and large-scale projects multiply, the necessity for clear standards becomes more urgent. Even as projects are underway, uncertainty remains regarding how these materials can be shipped, which measurements are required in testing and more. For example, the International Maritime Organization prohibits shipment of these materials unless special provisions are incorporated into the shipping process because they are believed to have the potential to be self-heating, posing a fire risk onboard ships. Research must be conducted to answer these questions and prevent any hindrances to the growth of these products.

The interest in biocarbon expressed by the steel industry and the scale of research being executed into biochar applications cannot be ignored. “Even though most projects are still in the early stages of development, you can sense that they’re coming,” Wiberg says. “And as a result, we know that we’re on the cusp of a big boom.”

A circular economy could create a second supply source for critical minerals used to make these technologies, strengthening the global energy transition.

At the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting 2026, participants will discuss how to both protect the environment and drive economic growth.

The world’s energy systems are entering a period of profound transformation. As climate impacts intensify, the November 2025 COP30 meeting in Belém, Brazil reinforced a global consensus that the clean energy transition must accelerate dramatically over the next decade.

Some countries agreed to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), commit to clearer timelines for phasing down fossil fuels and scale financing for clean energy and climate adaptation. But, at the same time, COP30 highlighted a critical vulnerability: The world cannot meet its expanded renewable and electrification targets without a vastly more resilient and sustainable supply of critical minerals.

Batteries, electric vehicles, solar and grid technologies will be major contributors to future demand growth for lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, according to the International Energy Agency’s Global Critical Minerals Outlook. But supply remains heavily concentrated in a handful of countries and companies.

As a result, energy security and supply chain resilience will become central pillars of post-COP30 industrial strategy.

Boosting clean energy supply chains?

As the clean energy transition accelerates, pressures including price volatility, restrictive trade measures, tightening environmental standards and delays in new mining projects will make it increasingly difficult to meet critical mineral demand through primary mining alone. So, as more countries rely on their own clean energy resources, the stability of critical mineral supply chains will become a strategic national and industrial priority, not just a corporate concern.

Recovering and recycling metals from resources traditionally treated as waste, such as end-of-life solar panels, batteries and industrial by-products, could create a more stable supply of lower-risk material flows. This would strengthen supply chain resilience while directly contributing to COP30-aligned goals for emissions reduction, biodiversity protection and resource efficiency.

A circular economy approach would go beyond traditional recycling to create a second major supply source for the clean energy era. By dispersing geographic concentration of mineral resources, circular supply would help to create a more secure foundation for the global energy transition.

How a circular economy creates a competitive advantage

The circular economy can strengthen environmental resilience and create a competitive advantage, both industrially and geopolitically, in several ways:

1. Lower emissions and compliance with global carbon standards

Recycling-based metal recovery can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional mining. Recycled critical minerals such as nickel, cobalt and lithium incur, on average, around 80% less greenhouse gas emissions than primary materials produced from mining, according to the International Energy Agency. As countries and regions continue to tighten emissions regulations, low-carbon supply chains will drive global competitiveness.

2. Reduced exposure to geopolitical and market risks

By sourcing materials from secondary resources rather than relying solely on geographically concentrated primary mines, industries can reduce exposure to policy disruptions, export controls and geopolitical tensions.

3. Alignment with global market trends

Sustainability criteria increasingly shape investment, procurement and regulation. Using high-quality recycled metals across value chains for batteries, EVs, semiconductors and solar panels will allow suppliers to reach a wider market looking for more climate-friendly materials.

How to scale a circular economy

A circular economy can simultaneously advance industrial competitiveness, energy security and emissions reduction. But scaling it will require more than corporate action. Governments and industries must collaborate on governance systems that enable circularity at scale.

National systems for end-of-life product collection and movement will create efficient pathways for gathering, transporting and processing used batteries, solar modules, electronics and industrial residues, for example. Investment in recycling and refining infrastructure will also help to transform secondary resources into reliable, high-purity inputs for advanced manufacturing.

Clear and trusted regulatory frameworks can establish standards for recycled material quality, cross-border movement of secondary resources, carbon accounting and producer responsibility systems. This is vital to building market confidence and accelerating private-sector investment.

It’s also important that technology and innovation are treated as enablers. High-efficiency, low-emission processes and advanced technologies are crucial for treating complex waste streams. Governments, companies and international institutions must collaborate to accelerate innovation and adoption in this area.

If policy, technology and market incentives can align in this way, the circular economy can underpin industrial strategy, rather than being a peripheral environmental initiative.

The future of clean energy competitiveness

The success of the global clean energy transition will depend in part on how quickly new technologies are deployed. But it will also depend on how intelligently and reliably the critical minerals that enable those technologies can be circulated.

Batteries have become a strategic priority globally as countries race to secure energy storage for renewable power, electric vehicles and grid stability. The United States, China and the European Union have all rolled out industrial policies and incentives in recent years to localize battery supply chains amid growing geopolitical competition and concerns over dependence on imports.

Pakistan, which faces persistent power shortages and a heavy energy import bill, is increasingly looking to energy storage as it expands solar power, electric mobility and backup systems for telecom infrastructure.

“The energy storage policy must be integrated with Pakistan’s national energy security framework,” the government said in a statement, quoting Haroon Akhtar Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production, who chaired a meeting on the matter in Islamabad.

The statement said the Battery Manufacturing Policy 2026–31 includes phased localization targets, tariff reforms and performance-based incentives designed to encourage domestic manufacturing and private sector investment. A dedicated working group for the policy was constituted in December 2025 on the prime minister’s instructions, the statement said.

The meeting approved lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery technology for initial localization, citing its safety profile, cost effectiveness and suitability for grid storage and electric vehicles. LFP batteries are widely used globally as governments and companies seek alternatives to more expensive lithium-nickel chemistries.

The policy also emphasizes quality, safety and sustainability, assigning a key role to the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority in testing, certification and compliance with international standards. The statement said a framework for battery recycling is also being developed to limit environmental risks.

Pakistan has identified domestic reserves of phosphate, iron and manganese that could support battery manufacturing and reduce reliance on imported raw materials, the statement added.

While not all may be equally affected by its consequences, it is still vital to mitigate climate change, especially for the sake of island nations. One in particular became the first nation 100% powered by solar energy, but now, climate change threatens its survival in this very century. Discover why island nations are the most vulnerable to the concept of climate change, despite their embracing renewable energy sources.

The consequences of climate change on island living

Harmful greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels cause the devastating effects of climate change. While these effects can be seen globally, such as rising urban temperatures and extreme changes in weather patterns, those who live, work, or occasionally travel to certain islands may find that these nations have drawn the short straw.

According to a 2022 report by the United Nations in the Caribbean, the primary climate change effects faced by island nations include:

Warmer ocean temperatures

Glaciers melt, which increases sea levels

Higher occurrences of flooding, permanent land loss, and coastal erosion

Result in coral bleaching, which destroys vital reefs and mangrove forests

Aggravated storms

Tropical cyclones and storm surges intensify

Impacts culture and local communities, economies, and infrastructure, often resulting in permanent displacement

Limited space

Nowhere to retreat, as many are located in low-elevation coastal zones

Economic

The tourism industry is significantly impacted

Food and water scarcity

Saltwater intrusion impacts drinking water supplies and land

Changing rainfall patterns further aggravate the problem

One island nation turned to renewable energy sources to address climate change, becoming the first nation 100% powered by solar energy.

The first nation 100% powered by solar energy

America may have had the first artificial photovoltaic island, but Tokelau, located in the South Pacific, became the first worldwide to achieve self-sufficiency with solar energy. The small island nation completed this achievement as early as 2012, years ahead of the UN’s final climate deal. This means that the 1,411 residents of the Atafu, Fakaofo, and Nukunonu atolls depend on solar power systems.

According to Joseph Mayhew, the New Zealand Aid Programme’s development manager:

“At the end of October 2012, New Zealand company PowerSmart had completed work on all three atolls. The people of Tokelau now enjoy solar energy for almost 100% of their electricity needs.”

Across the three atolls, the entire solar project consists of:

4,032 solar panels

392 inverters

1,344 batteries

This island nation’s survival is continuously threatened by climate change

Tokelau may be home to some of the biggest solar energy systems globally, but it doesn’t mean that the nation’s troubles are over. According to Mayhew, they specifically chose PowerSmart for the project because:

“They had experience in designing solar power systems for harsh and remote environments and have taken care to design a robust system suitable for the Pacific, which could withstand high temperatures, salt-laden air, and the risk of cyclones and flooding.”

Yet, the island’s very existence is being threatened. Tokelau’s three atolls are low-lying and at the forefront of the climate crisis, as their maximum elevation is only two to five meters above sea level. According to The Conversation, experts believe that solutions are needed to halt the island’s submergence, something that is becoming increasingly impossible by the day.

As the rest of the world is racing against time to meet the global mission of achieving net zero by 2050, Tokelau is already boasting a significantly low carbon footprint. Yet, the nation still faces the consequences of climate change, which highlights the importance of this global zero-carbon goal, as the existence of various island nations, such as Tokelau, depends on it.

That’s the consensus among experts who follow the EV industry. A number new electric models may stir excitement, but production and sales could be sluggish. Meanwhile, in the background, government policies and manufacturing plans may change in subtle ways.

“It’s not dead, but it’s in suspended animation for a year or maybe two,” said Alan Baum, an independent Detroit auto analyst.

The EV has undergone a giant vibe shift in the past year.

A wave of new vehicle announcements and plans for new factories, fueled by supportive government policies, came to a crashing halt with President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January. Since then, the president and his Republican allies in Congress have neutered nearly every federal incentive and regulation that favored electrics.

That seismic shift makes 2026 the dawn of a new, Darwinian era.

“It doesn’t mean EVs are going to vanish by any means, but it means they are going to live or die based on market demand,” said Karl Brauer, an auto analyst for the online auto-sales site iSeeCars.com.

And that demand isn’t looking great.

Sales of new EVs reached an all-time high of 11.7 percent in September, according to Cox Automotive. Car buyers rushed to take advantage of the last month of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. By November, sales had plunged to 5.4 percent, the lowest in more than three years.

Car-buyer sentiment doesn’t suggest that sales will climb again soon.

According to a recent study by CDK, a digital platform for auto dealers, nearly a third of gas car buyers of two years ago — 31 percent — wanted an EV for their next car. Now, only 11 percent of traditional travelers want to go electric.

“Gas shoppers — and to a lesser extent hybrid shoppers — are far less likely to buy an EV in the future than they were just a year ago,” the study said.

Baum is projecting that America’s EV sales in 2026 will tread water or fall slightly short of the 1.1 million sold last year.

Reasons for optimism

Leading EV advocates looked past the bleak sales projections and are steadfast that the American market for EVs will survive and prosper once again.

The late-2025 sales numbers “are still numbers that a year or two ago we would have been delighted to see,” said Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that seeks to bolster EV markets and policies.

One thing that gives them hope is that EV buyers are persistent. The market-intelligence service J.D. Power said in a report last year that 94 percent of U.S. EV buyers intended to buy an EV again.

Furthermore, a wave of relatively affordable used EVs are poised to hit auto lots, as prior years’ EV leases come to an end. “That will help in normalizing EVs,” Prochazka said.

Joel Levin, the executive director of Plug In America, a nonprofit that aims to get more drivers into EVs, takes encouragement from the fact that many of 2025’s top-selling electrics — including those from Tesla, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Volkswagen — are still on sale.

“None of them are going away,” he said.

However, state and local governments, already strapped from a general pullback in aid from Uncle Sam, don’t seem to be in position to fill the yawning gap of federal support that aided EV sales until last year.

EV advocates interviewed for this story couldn’t name a pending policy at the state or local level that will move the needle on EV adoption.

“The states are trying to step up where they can, but it’s hard,” Levin said.

Exciting EVs, but not many of them

A number of new EVs are likely to generate buzz if they are released as promised in 2026.

Analysts and observers pointed to the Rivian R2, a smaller and less expensive version of the electric automaker’s signature SUV, and the Slate, a bare-bones but affordable electric truck.

Auto reviewers have raved about the new BMW iX3, with a lighter battery and faster charging. And Japanese automakers are finally stepping up their U.S. electric game. Honda is supposed to start releasing its “O Series” EVs from a new factory in Ohio, and both Subaru and Toyota have two models set for release this year.

But none is expected to be released in high volumes, according to Baum, the Detroit auto analyst.

That includes the plans for General Motors’ electric Bolt, which received a surge of interest from buyers just as it was pulled from production in 2023.

The refreshed version is due this year but is scheduled to be produced in just a single shift from a factory in Kansas. Like other automakers, GM isn’t signaling plans to make all that many EVs this year.

And for the nation’s leading electric automaker, Tesla, it may be a stagnant year for EV sales.

CEO Elon Musk has said that the Cybercab, an electric robotaxi with no steering wheel, may be released this year. But given regulatory headwinds, it is unlikely to be produced in big volumes.

Tesla’s other vehicles are old by industry standards and may face continued declining sales this year, Baum said.

The partial-EV promise

Two types of EV in 2026 appear ascendant yet scarce: the plug-in hybrid and the extended-range electric hybrid.

The two types rely in part on both a gas engine and a battery, but they do so in different ways. A plug-in hybrid, or PHEV, is primarily an internal-combustion engine vehicle that first runs on a battery until its electrons are expended. An extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV, is primarily an electric vehicle with a backup gasoline generator. That generator kicks in to charge the battery when it’s low.

EREVs are big news when comes to big trucks. Automakers have learned that truck drivers are skeptical of all-electric trucks because their range degrades quickly when towing heavy trailers.

Last month, Ford axed the F-150 Lightning, its signature all-electric truck, citing low demand. Ford said it would pivot to making the vehicle an EREV but offered no release date.

Ford followed in the footsteps of Ram and the new Volkswagen nameplate Scout, both of which have scaled back original plans to make all-electric trucks and now plan to start with EREVs.

Meanwhile, more PHEVs are due to hit the market, including low-carbon versions of the Jeep Grand Wagoneer and the Nissan Rogue.

EV advocates are cheering the evolution. “If it plugs in, it’s the right thing for us to support,” said Prochazka of the Electrification Coalition.

However, as with pure EVs, don’t expect to see many more of them in dealer showrooms. Baum estimates that 360,000 PHEVs will be sold this year, up only modestly from the 316,000 sold last year.

“It’s not that the automakers don’t want to offer plug-ins, but they made their plans only recently, and they have to get their supply chains in order,” Baum said.

Meanwhile, EV experts said, the other key levers that could open the door to more EV sales — more charging stations, and less expensive batteries — are coming.

But changes are likely to be incremental and escape the attention of the car-buying public.

“Since day one, EPA has been clear that providing clean air, water, and land for all Americans is a top priority.” The EPA’s reconsideration focuses on the Clean Air Act, the country’s most powerful air quality law, which regulates hazardous air pollutants for different types of industrial operations.
The Clean Air Act doesn’t say whether the EPA is required to conduct additional residual risk reviews after the first one.
The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide.
In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide.","Ethylene oxide was once considered an unremarkable pollutant. The colorless gas seeped from relatively few industrial facilities and commanded little public attention.

All that changed in 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency completed a study that found the chemical is 30 times more carcinogenic than previously thought.

The agency then spent years updating regulations that protect millions of people who are most exposed to the compound. In 2024, the EPA approved stricter rules that require commercial sterilizers for medical equipment and large chemical plants to slash emissions of ethylene oxide, which causes lymphoma and breast cancer.

It was doing what the EPA has done countless times: revising rules based on new scientific knowledge.

Now, its ability to do that for many air pollutants is under threat.

In government records that have flown under the radar, President Donald Trump’s EPA said it is reconsidering whether the agency had the legal authority to update those rules.

Chemical companies and their trade organizations have argued that the EPA cannot reevaluate hazardous air pollution rules to account for newly discovered harms if it has revised them once already.

It doesn’t matter if decades have passed or new information has emerged.

If the EPA agrees, environmentalists fear that the decision could have wide implications, significantly curbing the EPA’s ability to limit nearly 200 pollutants from thousands of industrial plants. The next time new science reveals that a chemical is much more toxic, or that the amount of pollution released from a factory had been underestimated and would cause legally unacceptable health risks, the agency would not be able to react.

“It’s a poor reflection on this administration’s claim that they are actually interested in clean air,” said Ana Baptista, a professor of environmental policy and sustainability management at The New School. “By saying we’re no longer going to consider science, it’s abdicating your mission.”

The EPA didn’t address ProPublica’s questions about the ethylene oxide reevaluation or its broader implications. Instead, the agency pointed to a March press release about how it was reconsidering multiple air pollution rules issued by President Joe Biden’s administration, including the ones for chemical plants and commercial sterilizers. “EPA is committed to using the gold standard of science during these reviews,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Since day one, EPA has been clear that providing clean air, water, and land for all Americans is a top priority.”

The EPA’s reconsideration focuses on the Clean Air Act, the country’s most powerful air quality law, which regulates hazardous air pollutants for different types of industrial operations. There’s a specific rule for oil refineries, for instance, and another for steel mills. Within eight years after each rule is published, the EPA is required to conduct an assessment, called a residual risk review, to decide if an update is necessary.

These assessments use detailed data on the quantity of emissions coming from each facility, the toxicity of each chemical and other information on how the chemicals are released and dispersed in the air. The combined data reveals how the emissions put local residents at risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, reproductive harm and other health problems.

If the EPA determines the overall risks exceed what’s allowed under the law, the agency must tighten the rules.

The Clean Air Act doesn’t say whether the EPA is required to conduct additional residual risk reviews after the first one. Nor does it specifically prohibit the agency from doing so.

As far back as 2006, the EPA under President George W. Bush asserted that the agency had the right to revisit and revise the rules based on risk.

The issue became newly relevant in 2021, when the EPA’s Office of Inspector General cited the new conclusions about the toxicity of ethylene oxide. The office estimated that nearly half a million Americans were exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from industrial emissions by chemical plants, commercial sterilizers and other facilities pumping out ethylene oxide.

In its report, the inspector general’s office advised the agency to “exercise its discretionary authority to conduct new residual risk reviews” as needed when “new data or information indicates an air pollutant is more toxic than previously determined.” (The inspector general was a Trump appointee.)

The EPA had already conducted the first, mandatory risk reviews for large chemical plants and commercial sterilizers in the early 2000s. In response to the inspector general report, the agency launched additional reviews using the updated science on ethylene oxide. Ultimately, the EPA determined the health risks were unacceptable and revised the rules to lower them. The agency asserted that the Clean Air Act “does not limit our discretion or authority to conduct another risk review should we consider that such review is warranted.”

According to the EPA’s estimates, the new regulations for chemical plants under the 2024 revised rule would cut the number of nearby residents who are exposed to unacceptable cancer risks from 90,000 to 3,000.

But the chemical industry opposed the stricter rules. Industry representatives disagreed with the EPA’s new assessment of ethylene oxide, contending that it overestimated the risk the chemical posed, and argued the agency didn’t have the authority to conduct those risk reviews. In a 2023 letter, the American Chemistry Council said “the Agency has erred in conducting a new risk review,” as “the plain text” of the Clean Air Act “indicates that EPA actually lacks this authority.”

Similarly, the Louisiana Chemical Association submitted public comments on the chemical plant rule stating the “EPA has no statutory authority to conduct a second risk review” and that doing so was “arbitrary and capricious.”

David Cresson, president and CEO of the association, told ProPublica that the trade group supports “protecting the public’s health through regulatory frameworks that are lawful, while remaining based in sound science.”

Brendan Bradley, a spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, said the organization had no further comment on the issue.

After Trump was inaugurated, one of his appointees to the EPA let the industry know the agency was conducting a “reconsideration” of the two rules focused on ethylene oxide emissions. Last spring, Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator Abigale Tardif, a former oil and gas lobbyist, hinted at how the EPA might challenge those rules.

In letters addressed to trade groups representing commercial sterilizers and chemical plants, Tardif said the agency was reconsidering multiple issues related to the rules, including the “EPA’s authority and decision to undertake a second residual risk review” under the Clean Air Act, as well as “the analysis and determinations made in that review, and the resulting risk standards.”

Tardif didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The agency also filed a regulatory notice about its plans to revise the 2024 chemical plant rule. Citing the part of the Clean Air Act that deals with the updated rule assessments, the notice said the EPA had “identified items for reconsideration around its CAA section 112(f)(2) residual risk review authority.”

While the stricter ethylene oxide rules are technically still in effect, the Trump administration has exempted dozens of large chemical plants and sterilizer facilities from following them as the agency works through a formal process that is widely expected to result in watered-down standards.

If the Trump EPA does decide it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, the agency might still have the authority to strengthen hazardous air pollution rules by using a separate part of the Clean Air Act, said Abel Russ, a senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. That section of the act allows the EPA to update a rule if agency scientists conclude that better pollution-control technology is affordable and available. But limiting the agency’s ability to conduct residual risk reviews would be a serious blow to the act, Russ said, “kneecapping” the agency’s authority over these toxic pollutants.

Environmental groups will almost certainly sue if the EPA concludes it does not have the legal authority to revise hazardous air pollution rules more than once based on risk. Russ called industry’s comments absurd and said they don’t account for the reality that our knowledge of industrial pollution is changing all the time.

As ProPublica reported in October, the agency recently received clear evidence that many industrial facilities are leaking far more pollution than the companies that own them previously reported. In 2023, researchers who conducted their own air monitoring in the industrial corridor of Louisiana known as Cancer Alley found much higher concentrations of ethylene oxide than expected. For more than half the areas they sampled, the local cancer risk from ethylene oxide would be unacceptable if residents were exposed to these concentrations over a lifetime.

If the EPA decides it lacks the legal authority to conduct multiple risk reviews, it would find itself in the position of not being able to take action even if the agency confirmed similar results.

“The whole premise of risk assessment is that it’s based on the best available science,” said Kimberly Terrell, a research scientist at the Environmental Integrity Project. As our knowledge grows, researchers tend to find that chemicals are linked to additional health effects, she added, so blocking these updates “pretty much ensures” the EPA is underestimating the risks.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EPA-Risks-OG.jpg?resize=2000,1050",N,,2026-01-07 07:59:39.504982

The platform combines a 400 kWh battery-powered charger with AI-driven energy management software, enabling 400 kW charging from grid connections as small as 30 kW.

Highlights

Rapid deployment model: ElectricFish units install in 4-6 weeks versus 12-18 months for conventional DC fast chargers, eliminating costly utility upgrades

Revenue-share business model: Gas station operators provide space and modest electrical connections while ElectricFish covers hardware costs and splits charging revenue

Hyundai validation: Multi-month testing at Hyundai’s California Proving Ground delivered 1,119 kWh across 37 sessions with 313 kW peak output in triple-digit temperatures

Detroit deployment live: First commercial installation operational in Detroit’s Eastern Market district through Toyota Mobility Foundation’s Sustainable Cities Challenge

Platform Architecture

The ElectricFish ecosystem comprises three integrated components backed by five issued U.S. patents.

ElectricFish 400squared

The hardware foundation features a 400 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery paired with dual 400 kW charging ports. The liquid-cooled system draws from its internal battery reservoir rather than the grid, requiring only one-tenth to one-third of typical DC fast charger power connections.

This architecture addresses what MotorTrend identified as a core industry paradox: abundant electricity but scarce fast charging infrastructure. Conventional installations can exceed $150,000 per port in utility upgrade costs alone.

Reef Charging Station Management System

The Reef CSMS provides operators real-time visibility into charging sessions, energy flow metrics, and station performance data.

Stargazer AI Engine

Five patented intelligent agents power the Stargazer optimization platform:

Grid Agent: Determines optimal timing for selling energy back to utilities

EV Agent: Forecasts vehicle arrivals to ensure battery readiness

Health Agent: Monitors battery and system longevity

Cost Agent: Tracks time-of-use pricing, weather patterns, and outage data

Coordinator Agent: Synthesizes inputs and issues real-time system commands

Each deployment learns from a master model before adapting to local site conditions.

Business Model and Target Market

ElectricFish targets America’s 150,000-plus gas stations with a revenue-share program designed to eliminate capital barriers. Station owners provide physical space and a modest electrical connection while ElectricFish handles hardware, installation, and maintenance costs.

“Gas stations are built for short dwell times and high turnover. We designed our new Turbo Charge service to behave like a pump, not a parking space,” said Anurag Kamal, ElectricFish CEO and co-founder.

The Turbo Charge service targets 8-10 minute sessions delivering up to 180 miles of range, differentiating from longer-duration parking lot charging models.

Hyundai Testing Results

Hyundai Motor Company conducted extended validation testing at its California Proving Ground facility throughout 2025. The 350squared charger, predecessor to the 400squared launching at CES, operated through continuous triple-digit temperatures during MotorTrend’s 2026 SUV of the Year evaluations.

“ElectricFish allowed us to fast charge without costly electrical infrastructure upgrades, and installation is quick and simple,” said Dean Vivo Amore, Senior Engineer at Hyundai. “We see this as a way to unlock fast charging at sites that the grid alone can’t support today.”

Tafflyn Toy, Project Lead at Hyundai CRADLE, noted the system “passed with margin” under extreme heat testing, with built-in safety redundancies supporting customer-facing deployment.

Detroit Commercial Deployment

ElectricFish’s first commercial installation is now operational in Detroit’s Eastern Market district, selected through the Toyota Mobility Foundation’s Sustainable Cities Challenge from nearly 100 submissions. The deployment electrifies fleet operations in the historic food and warehouse logistics hub while providing public fast charging access.

The company is in discussions with Michigan contract manufacturers, potentially establishing the state as a second operational hub alongside its San Carlos, California headquarters.

Policy and Market Context

Recent policy developments align with ElectricFish’s expansion strategy. California Governor Gavin Newsom announced $1.1 billion for zero-emission transit and infrastructure in December 2025. Michigan’s Charge Up Michigan program targets two million EVs and 100,000 chargers by 2030.

FERC Order 2222, mandating grid storage programs nationwide, further supports the company’s distributed energy model.

Grid Integration Strategy

ElectricFish positions its network as grid-positive infrastructure rather than additional load. Each unit functions as a distributed energy resource capable of absorbing demand spikes and selling power back during peak periods.

“We don’t sell EV chargers or batteries; we sell time and uptime. We’ve decoupled charging speed from grid limits by actively managing when energy flows in or out, so fast charging strengthens the grid instead of destabilizing it,” said Nelio Batista, ElectricFish CTO and co-founder.

The company’s long-term vision targets community-scale 400 kWh batteries at neighborhood level, creating virtual power plant capability across thousands of networked units.

CES 2026 Presence

Morristown meeting outlines proposed vertical expansion at landfill

A standing-room-only crowd filled Morristown Town Hall on Tuesday for an informational meeting on a proposed modification to the Crossroads Eco-Center landfill, a regional waste facility located along U.S. 52 east of town.

The proposal would allow the landfill to expand vertically by up to 170 feet within its existing permitted footprint, extending its operating life by roughly a decade. No vote was taken at the meeting, which was required by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) as part of the permit modification process.

Dave Klene, environmental engineer at the facility, said the landfill is not seeking additional acreage. “We’re not going out laterally,” he said. “We’re just going out vertically.”

According to Klene, the landfill currently accepts between 4,000 and 4,500 tons of waste per day and has approximately 12 years of remaining capacity under its existing permit. The proposed modification would create space for an additional 12.6 million tons of disposal capacity, extending the landfill’s life by a decade.

Between 2021 and 2023, waste arrived from 45 Indiana counties, as well as from out of state. Marion County accounted for the largest share of in-state tonnage during that period, followed by Shelby County. Based on historical and projected trends, the permit application anticipates future waste receipts averaging about 6,500 tons per day over the next 20 years, according to IDEM’s fact sheet.

While company representatives emphasized that the proposal would reduce pressure to site new landfills elsewhere, many residents raised concerns about increased truck traffic and environmental risks. Several speakers questioned how a taller landfill could affect stormwater runoff and long-term environmental safety. Others focused on the origin of waste coming into the facility and whether out-of-state waste should continue to be accepted.

The public comment period for the proposed modification remains open through Jan. 22, 2026. Written comments may be submitted to IDEM permit manager Hannah Ford (hford@idem.in.gov), who will oversee the review process. When IDEM reaches a final determination, a Notice of Decision will be mailed to nearby landowners and others who submitted comments or requested notification.

This Day in Shelby County History

Local headlines reported on or around this date in Shelby County history. Selections are curated by The Addison Times from Shelby County Public Library Genealogy Department materials.

2006: Cagney’s owner Jerry Brown announced an end to the restaurant’s smoking section. He said the main reason for the policy change was the dwindling number of customers willing to dine in the area. Brown said customers renting out the banquet room could decide whether or not to allow smoking. Shelbyville Councilman Jeff Sponsel had recently opened a public debate when he suggested in a council meeting that the city consider an anti-smoking ordinance.

1996: “Clobbered again!” The Shelbyville News’ headline read. A new snowfall had drifted on top of existing snow. Ryobi Die Casting closed for the first time in 10 years, asking its third shift to not come in. Knauf stayed open, but was short-staffed. Knauf rented rooms at the Holiday Inn for workers who could not go home. In addition to keeping employees at the Holiday Inn, Knauf wiped out the shelves of Mr. T’s convenience store for them.

1986: Shelbyville police officer Jim Dile received a commendation from the Board of Works for his work in solving the Dec. 11 assault on George Arthur, owner of Maplewood Service Station on South Harrison Street.

Despite their potential, many industrial clusters face challenges, including unclear growth strategies, fragmented governance structures and limited focus on shared business cases and digitalization efforts.

The Transitioning Industrial Clusters (TIC) initiative unites the world’s largest community of industrial clusters around a vision for economic growth, job protection and carbon dioxide emission reduction.

Four years on, Malaysia’s government agreed to adopt the TIC framework as a national agenda.

A global industrial transformation is underway. Rising energy demand, shifting geopolitics and new technologies are reshaping industrial ecosystems. Energy security and industrial competitiveness now go hand in hand, yet investment in clean energy remains far below what is needed. Establishing competitive industrial clusters is essential to bridge this gap.

Launched at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) by the World Economic Forum, in collaboration with Accenture and EPRI, the Transitioning Industrial Clusters initiative has grown to 40 industrial clusters across 20 countries, to become the largest community of its kind globally.

Well-organized industrial clusters – geographic areas where co-located companies and public institutions collaborate – present an immediate opportunity for transformative action. By sharing infrastructure, resources and risks, industrial clusters can achieve greater efficiency and collective impact.

But despite their potential, many clusters face challenges, including unclear growth strategies, fragmented governance structures and limited focus on shared business cases.

To accelerate industrial transformation through a holistic approach, the initiative has developed the TIC framework, built on four foundational components.

Balanced emphasis on driving economic, social and environmental value.

Inclusive consideration of all technologies and processes that support carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions reduction.

Cross-sectoral collaboration within and across industry, public sector, financiers, labour and community stakeholders.

Coordinated, agile strategies between partnership, policy, financing and technology enablement and deployment.

Why did Malaysia adopt the TIC framework?

In June 2025, Malaysia adopted the TIC framework as a national agenda to drive green economic growth, open up highly skilled job opportunities and reduce carbon emissions.

Prime Minister Anwar bin Ibrahim said: ""The Malaysian Government agreed to adopt TIC as national agenda as it is a strategic move that unites companies and public institutions to drive green economic growth, open up highly skilled job opportunities and reduce carbon emissions.""

This milestone, achieved in collaboration with the Malaysia Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (MYCentre4IR), reflects over a year and a half of sustained engagement in the country, including virtual and in-person events across key industrial hubs such as Johor and Sarawak to build a shared vision.

It affirms the Forum’s ability to foster national and regional public-private collaboration and shape cutting-edge thinking on industrial cluster development.

With this national endorsement, MYCentre4IR has been mandated by the prime minister to coordinate federal and state agencies and develop a unified proposal to accelerate Malaysia’s industrial cluster transitions.

Key priorities will include:

Developing state-level industrial cluster strategies that align federal ambitions with each state’s economic strengths, ensuring more coherent planning, investment readiness and long-term competitiveness.

Formalizing the governance structure and transition roadmap for the Bintulu cluster in Sarawak, enabling clear roles, decision-making pathways and an investable project pipeline to support its 2026 launch cycle.

Scaling the TIC framework adopted in Bintulu across additional strategic clusters, each selected for its national economic importance and potential for low-carbon industrial growth.

Malaysia’s key industrial hubs

Malaysia’s key industrial hubs each play a distinct role in advancing the nation’s sustainable, technology-driven growth agenda.

Sarawak: Green petrochemical hub

Anchored in the state of Sarawak, the Bintulu cluster leverages abundant renewable resources and a mature petrochemical ecosystem to position Malaysia as a leader in green molecules production. The cluster focuses on:

Integrating green molecules and green electrons into existing petrochemical value chains, enabling low-carbon feedstocks and cleaner production pathways.

Advancing industrial symbiosis between petrochemical, hydrogen and downstream manufacturing activities.

Finalising a state–federal governance model to support coordinated planning and enable an aligned 2026 project launch cycle.

Johor: Sustainable data centre and artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem

Johor is rapidly becoming one of Southeast Asia’s core digital and hyperscale clusters. The TIC strategy focuses on:

Integrating low-carbon and renewable energy into data centre expansion.

Deploying digital twins to optimize cooling, reliability and resource use.

Strengthening Johor’s role as a regional sustainable AI hub.

Enabling downstream growth in cloud services, AI and digital content services and high-value analytical AI data processing.

Selangor: Manufacturing cluster

Selangor’s broad manufacturing base offers significant potential for long-term ecosystem strengthening. Early TIC work focuses on:

Exploring opportunities to uplift overall industrial capabilities through smart manufacturing programmes.

Identifying areas where shared support or coordination may enhance competitiveness.

Encouraging progressive improvements across the wider manufacturing landscape by identifying toolkit deployments (e.g. Lumina).

Penang: Semiconductor, electrical and electronics (E&E) industries

Penang’s semiconductor and E&E ecosystem continues to evolve as part of a growing regional corridor. TIC discussions centre on strengthening overall ecosystem readiness and exploring pathways for sustained, high-value industrial growth.

Support ongoing ecosystem development and resilience.

Enhance coordination across upstream and downstream activities.

Explore shared pathways for sustaining high-value industrial growth over time.

This strategy will enhance Malaysia’s industrial competitiveness, deepen participation in regional value chains, and position the country as a leading hub for sustainable and technology-driven industrial development in Southeast Asia.

What is the impact of the TIC initiative?

The TIC initiative convenes the world’s leading public and private industrial stakeholders at various stages of ambition and development to align on the components required to competitively apply for funding, secure regulatory support and launch full-scale development activities to transition industrial clusters successfully.

The initiative delivers tangible outcomes across three levels of impact – policy, cluster and project – demonstrating how collaborative action can translate strategic dialogue into national adoption, industrial transformation and on-the-ground implementation.

Each level reinforces the others, creating a scalable model that can be replicated across countries, regions and industry clusters to strengthen competitiveness.

Therefore, TIC enables Malaysia to respond effectively to shifting global market forces. By strategically adopting high-impact technologies, industrial clusters can transform into engines of green growth and drivers of global competitiveness.

HARRISBURG — Democrats and Republicans who lead the Pennsylvania legislature have singled out increasing energy production as a goal for the year, as electricity prices rise and demand increases.

Consumers could feel an even greater squeeze in the years ahead, as utility companies predict that efforts to build data centers across the state to meet the artificial intelligence demand will worsen the crunch.

But environmental and labor advocates are skeptical that lawmakers can overcome partisanship in the state Capitol and take meaningful action.

That skepticism persists despite a major policy hurdle — which led to legal fights costing taxpayers more than $4.2 million — now being out of the way.

As a part of a $50.1 billion budget deal that resolved a four-month impasse, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and members of his party who control the state House agreed to pull out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The controversial interstate program would have capped the total amount of carbon emissions that some companies in Pennsylvania could emit and forced them to pay for each ton emitted.

Leaving RGGI was a major Republican goal. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman, R- Indiana, previously told Spotlight PA that his chamber was unlikely to move energy legislation until the state courts resolved a lawsuit regarding Pennsylvania’s entrance into the program.

With the program out of the way, Shapiro said he expects action.

“For years, the Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production. Today, that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “It is time now to look forward.”

Energy auctions in Pennsylvania offer a window into the challenge facing utility companies and consumers. The auctions are held by the operator of the state’s vast energy grid and are used to procure enough electricity for the future, and in recent years, prices have skyrocketed. In 2024, prices increased by more than 800% from the year prior. And at the December auction, energy prices hit a record high and would likely have increased further without a cap agreed to as part of legal action brought by Shapiro.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission also told consumers this past summer that the state saw “soaring power usage during multiple heat waves since mid-June and scorching conditions that pushed electricity demand on the regional power grid to its highest level in 14 years.” Supply and demand are the biggest factors in prices, an expert told Spotlight PA at the time.

Rob Routh, a lawyer and advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he’s watching the state Senate in particular to see if lawmakers are willing to move legislation that would increase renewable energy production or if the caucus will only support the natural gas industry.

“Are they just going to be ideologically fixed on one type of resource to generate electricity — gas?” Routh told Spotlight PA. “Are they willing to consider an all-of-the-above energy approach, or is it an explicit rejection of renewables?”

More energy on the table

Lawmakers’ proposals to increase energy production take many approaches — from speeding up permitting to adjusting tax credits. They’ve also focused on various industries, from solar to nuclear power.

Shapiro told reporters that he wants to see state Senate Republicans pass his energy package, a slate of bills also known as the “Lightning Plan.”

It includes legislation that would amend some tax credits to benefit clean energy production, create a new board to streamline permitting for energy projects, and require electric companies to buy more renewable energy.

Another key part of Shapiro’s plan is to create a Pennsylvania-specific carbon cap-and-trade program, similar to RGGI. A majority of the payments from power producers to emit carbon dioxide — 70% — “would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bill,” according to the Shapiro administration.

Pittman has shot down that idea outright, saying that his caucus is not interested in supporting “any type of artificial cap-and-trade” program.

He has been more open to the other parts of the plan. He told Spotlight PA that revisiting the renewable energy standards “has merit,” and that the caucus is “willing to have a conversation over” the tax credit rewrites. These tax credits currently can be claimed by companies for a variety of purchases, including natural gas to manufacture petrochemicals, milk for dairy processing, and hydrogen fuel. Shapiro’s rewrite would include a new tax credit for clean energy producers.

“We would certainly be willing to have a conversation about any initiatives that help speed up projects in development so shovels get in the ground as soon as possible,” Pittman said.

Pittman said his caucus’ energy priorities include efforts “to enhance the use of our resources,” naming carbon capture as an example — a process through which carbon emissions are contained before they reach the atmosphere and are injected into deep underground wells. The waste can also be used to drill for more oil.

He also talked about speeding up efforts “to lower the taxes on job creators,” and issuing permits more quickly. However, he did not name specific legislation that he would support in the new year.

“I really think the best approach is to be as nimble and inviting as possible, to not try to have government programs and government initiatives artificially attempt to drive the marketplace,” Pittman told Spotlight PA days after the final budget deal.

Renewable energy, not climate protection

State House Democrats have proposed a range of legislation to lower barriers to increasing renewable or low-carbon energy sources, such as requiring that new warehouses be built to be compatible with solar panels and reducing permitting fees for small nuclear power plants.

Both the state House and Senate have passed bills that touch on solar energy with bipartisan support in recent years, although they had different goals.

Last session, the state House passed a proposal that would allow third parties to operate community solar energy facilities, which consumers could opt into. The idea is that “solar energy reduces the load on the grid while lowering electric bills,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The bill was reintroduced last year, but hasn’t been considered by either chamber.

Last summer, the state Senate passed a measure that would tighten oversight of Pennsylvania’s growing solar energy industry to help ensure that solar panels are properly decommissioned and all waste is properly disposed of. The requirements would not apply to homes and businesses that use solar panels to “generate electricity for their own use,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The full state House has not taken it up.

Katie Blume, legislative director for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, doubts that Democrats and Republicans will push energy bills to the finish line.

She pointed to other unresolved disagreements, including the regulation of slot-like skill games, that both parties have agreed are priorities but have been unable to advance.

“Why should I have faith in the Senate to do anything on energy, let alone affordability, when they can’t even figure out skill games in their own caucus?” Blume told Spotlight PA.

Rob Bair, chair of the Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council, which represents many unionized workers who build power plants, echoed Blume’s concern. Bair said lawmakers will have to compromise and bolster both natural gas and solar, industries that are often pitted against each other.

“Everyone understands we need to do it,” Bair said of increasing power generation in the state. “But we are watching everything closely to see if the chambers can actually come together.”

Environmental protection bills have even worse odds of passing the General Assembly, said state Rep. Greg Vitali, D-Delaware, at a December advisory committee meeting on climate change issue.

Vitali said that the “political reality” in the Capitol is that legislators have to focus on proposals that are “in conformance [with] labor and labor jobs.”

“Climate isn’t among the top five issues of legislators,” Vitali said. “There’s a need for leadership. … They have to do more than introducing bills and paying [climate change] lip service.”

Data centers on deck

Lawmakers have also singled out data centers as a major reason to increase energy production in the state.

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build out data centers in Pennsylvania. These facilities require huge amounts of both energy and clean water — the latter is used to cool the campuses. One projection estimates that global energy demand will increase by up to 165% by the end of the decade because of AI.

At the same time, Pennsylvania’s grid operator — PJM Interconnection — is seeing record-high prices at energy auctions. Those higher prices trickle down to consumers, according to utilities.

The most recent energy auction hit the price cap negotiated by Shapiro and the grid operator, and still failed to procure the amount of energy PJM had targeted.

Pittman has also identified data centers as a key cause for increasing energy production in the state. Though he has not identified specific regulatory procedures that he supports for the burgeoning industry, he said consumer prices and energy production go hand in hand.

“The best way to protect consumers with the advent of data centers is to make sure supply meets demand,” Pittman said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “We want to see responsible growth of data centers. We want to see [the] responsible growth of power supply.”

Any energy-related legislation will likely be referred to the state Senate’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, and its chair, Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, said he doesn’t think more renewable energy is the answer.

“Renewable energies and data centers, they don’t go together at all,” Yaw told Spotlight PA. “Data centers require continuous, non-intermittent power. And renewable power — it’s intermittent and of limited duration at best.“

Routh, the advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said gas plants have their own limitations and argued that Yaw’s comments ignore the effectiveness of battery storage technology for renewable energy.

Still, he called the data center issue “top of mind for legislators and their constituents,” and said there’s potential for state House Democrats and Senate Republicans to collaborate on regulating their energy usage.

He pointed to a bipartisan agreement in the state budget deal related to the PUC, which oversees utilities across Pennsylvania. The legislation, which is now law, allows the agency to review and validate utility companies’ predictions to PJM of the amount of electricity needed — those estimates help set costs for consumers.

​​Routh said that one bill he’s keeping an eye on would direct the commission to draft regulations to oversee data centers and prevent spikes in electricity costs.

“It’s a new issue. It’s the key driver for why people’s electric bills are going to be going up in Pennsylvania,” Routh said. “There is the potential for bills around data centers to break through traditional partisan ideological lines.”

Lithium-ion batteries currently dominate the market due to their high energy density, longer lifespan, and adaptability across vehicle categories, including passenger cars, buses, and heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Continuous improvements in lithium-ion chemistry have enhanced driving range, charging speed, and safety, making EVs more appealing to a broader consumer base.

At the same time, next-generation battery technologies such as solid-state batteries are gaining momentum. These advanced chemistries promise higher energy efficiency, faster charging times, improved thermal stability, and lower long-term costs. Their commercialization could significantly reshape the competitive landscape of the transportation battery market over the forecast period.

Consumer behavior is also evolving. Growing awareness of carbon footprints, rising fuel costs, and long-term savings associated with EV ownership are encouraging consumers to shift away from internal combustion engine vehicles. Automakers, responding to this demand, are accelerating electrification strategies and committing billions of dollars to battery research, development, and production.

Role of Government Policies and Infrastructure Development

Government support has emerged as a decisive factor in the growth of the U.S. transportation battery market. Federal and state governments are implementing aggressive policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting clean energy adoption. Tax credits for EV purchases, subsidies for battery manufacturing, and grants for research and development are significantly lowering entry barriers for consumers and manufacturers alike.

Public investment in charging infrastructure is also expanding rapidly. The development of nationwide fast-charging networks is improving accessibility and reducing range anxiety, one of the major obstacles to EV adoption. States such as California, Texas, and New York are leading this infrastructure push, while federal initiatives aim to ensure more uniform coverage across urban and rural regions.

In addition, recent supply chain disruptions have highlighted the importance of domestic battery production. To reduce dependence on imported materials and strengthen energy security, the United States is investing heavily in local gigafactories, mineral processing facilities, and recycling plants. These initiatives are fostering collaboration among automakers, technology companies, and government agencies, positioning the U.S. as a competitive force in the global transportation battery market.

Key Factors Driving the United States Transportation Battery Market Growth

Rising Adoption of Electric Vehicles

The increasing adoption of electric vehicles remains the most significant driver of the transportation battery market in the United States. Consumers are increasingly drawn to EVs due to lower operating costs, improved vehicle performance, and growing environmental awareness. Commercial fleet operators are also transitioning to electric vehicles to reduce fuel expenses and comply with sustainability targets.

Automakers are responding by expanding EV portfolios across passenger and commercial vehicle segments. As EV penetration increases, demand for high-capacity, durable, and fast-charging batteries continues to surge, reinforcing the market’s growth momentum.

Strong Policy Support and Incentives

Supportive government policies at both federal and state levels have accelerated the transition toward electric mobility. Incentives such as tax rebates, purchase subsidies, and zero-emission vehicle mandates are encouraging consumers and businesses to invest in EVs and supporting battery demand.

In parallel, government initiatives aimed at strengthening domestic battery manufacturing are enhancing supply chain resilience and reducing import dependency. These measures are creating a favorable ecosystem for long-term growth and innovation in the transportation battery sector.

Technological Advancements in Battery Systems

Technological innovation is a central pillar of market expansion. Continuous improvements in lithium-ion battery performance—such as higher energy density, longer lifespans, and faster charging—have significantly enhanced the appeal of electric transportation.

Moreover, advancements in solid-state batteries and alternative chemistries are opening new opportunities across heavy-duty transportation, aviation, and maritime sectors. These innovations are expected to play a crucial role in achieving cost-effective and sustainable mobility solutions across the United States.

Challenges in the United States Transportation Battery Market

High Raw Material and Manufacturing Costs

Despite strong demand, high production costs remain a major challenge. Transportation batteries rely on critical raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt, which are subject to price volatility and supply constraints. These factors increase manufacturing costs and limit affordability for some consumer segments.

Additionally, establishing battery manufacturing facilities requires substantial capital investment, creating barriers for new entrants. While recycling initiatives and alternative chemistries may help mitigate costs in the long run, addressing affordability remains essential for sustained market growth.

Infrastructure and Supply Chain Constraints

Charging infrastructure gaps, particularly in rural areas, continue to hinder widespread EV adoption. Limited access to fast-charging stations reduces consumer confidence and slows the transition to electric mobility.

Each degree from those temperatures can add $10 to a homeowner’s monthly electric bill.","If you live in an urban area in South Carolina, you likely pay your electricity bill each month directly to a major energy company like Duke Energy, Dominion Energy or the state-owned Santee Cooper. However, in many rural areas, electric cooperatives provide power to homes and businesses.

Leaders from cooperatives around the Lowcountry recently gathered for a media day to explain how the providers work. A common saying was that “if you’ve seen one co-op, you’ve seen one co-op.”

And while each may have unique features, the executives explained how electric co-ops generally operate, common misconceptions customers have, and ways to save on your electricity bill.

What is a co-op?

Electric cooperatives are electric utility providers that are collectively owned by their customers. Libby Roerig, the communications director for Berkeley Electric Cooperative, said these providers date back to the Great Depression when President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act in 1936 as part of the New Deal.

Roerig said the major energy companies at the time had no financial interest in extending power to people in rural areas. The REA helped to bridge the gap by providing low-interest federal loans to farmer-led cooperatives to electrify rural communities. As such, many of the co-ops in South Carolina today continue to serve primarily rural areas.

According to the organization’s website, The Electric Cooperatives of South Carolina, or ECSC, was formed in the 1940s as co-ops around the state emerged to share resources and advocate for co-ops at the Statehouse. The national counterpart to ECSC, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, similarly provides training and resources for providers across the country and lobbies on their behalf in Washington, D.C.

Cooperatives in South Carolina do not produce energy for their members but instead collectively buy electricity from companies that do, such as Dominion, Duke and Santee Cooper. Co-ops are also governed by their customers, who elect their board members.

How do co-ops prepare for storms?

Storm preparations for co-ops vary slightly from major energy companies. While providers like Dominion and Santee Cooper have more resources to pre-stage ahead of storms, co-ops tend to rely more on resource pooling because maintaining a large stock of equipment and emergency personnel would raise prices for their members.

Ryan Cooper, CFO of Santee Electric Cooperative, said co-ops often have fixed prices for mutual aid agreements where other providers send in resources after major storms. ECSC also negotiates with its statewide counterparts in Georgia, Tennessee and Florida to make sure extra resources are available when needed. Sometimes, the help comes from farther away.

Avery Wilks, vice president of communications for ECSC, said this mutual aid model played out on a large scale after Hurricane Helene hit the Upstate in 2024.

“After Helene, we had 3,500 line workers out in the field across the state, which is the largest workforce we've ever amassed for power restoration,” Wilks said. “And because so many of our sister states were also hit by Helene, we were pulling from 24 states as far away as California, North Dakota and Maine.”

David Felkel, CEO of Edisto Electric Cooperative, said the process to restore power starts with making sure generation and transmission are online. For those steps, he said, there is a reliance on Santee Cooper and other companies as the cooperatives do distribution, not energy transmission or generation.

After that, linemen focus on making sure substations are operating before moving to distribution lines, which Felkel said can run for up to 32 miles from the substation to the last house on the line in rural areas. Focus is set on restoring power to as many people as possible as quickly as possible, he said, acknowledging customers can feel frustrated waiting for power to come back on.

What factors into an electricity bill from a co-op?

The majority of a co-op customer’s energy bill goes toward buying electricity. Micah Ponce with Berkeley Electric Cooperative said about 70-75 percent of the bill covers the cost of energy. The other 25-30 percent, he said, is to cover “fixed costs.” These expenses include things like salaries for staff, bucket trucks and other vehicles.

Ponce said costs have risen in recent years, with wholesale energy prices going up 12-30 percent and the price of line trucks jumping 60 percent. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, average residential electricity costs across the country are now 13-18 percent higher compared to 2022 prices.

Ponce said that about half of residential electricity usage comes from heating and air conditioning, while about 22 percent comes from water heaters and lighting accounts for 5 percent. A practical way people — both co-op members and others — can reduce energy bills is to set their thermostats to 78 degrees in the summer and 68 in the winter, he said. Each degree from those temperatures can add $10 to a homeowner’s monthly electric bill.

He also noted that his and other co-ops have “load control programs” that help customers spend less on electricity, which include things like credits for installing smart thermostats and a rebate for getting an energy-efficient water heater. There’s also the Beat the Peak program, which Ponce said alerts customers to peak energy usage hours — usually when people get ready in the morning and after they get home in the evenings — so that they can make the conscious effort to use less electricity at those times.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/bf/7bf08e65-1be9-4d79-8fe4-0a9380f765b4/6914edaee4913.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C235&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-07 05:58:14.304826

The law follows the ""Virginia model,"" but introduces several nuances that will matter for organizations doing business in, or targeting residents of, Indiana.

What Entities Are Covered?

The statute does not capture every business that touches Indiana residents. It applies to entities that conduct business in Indiana or offer products or services to Indiana residents and, in a calendar year, either: (1) control or process personal data of at least 100,000 Indiana consumers, or (2) control or process personal data of at least 25,000 Indiana consumers and derive more than 50% of gross revenue from the sale of personal data.

There are broad exemptions. State and local government entities, including certain affiliated service companies, are carved out. In addition:

financial institutions and data subject to the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act,

HIPAA‑regulated covered entities and business associates,

nonprofits,

institutions of higher education, and

public utilities

are also exempt. For many organizations in these sectors, existing federal or sector‑specific regimes will continue to drive most privacy compliance obligations.

What Counts as ""Personal"" and ""Sensitive"" Data?

The law adopts a familiar definition of personal data. ""Personal data"" is information that is linked or reasonably linkable to an identified or identifiable individual, excluding de‑identified data, aggregate data, and publicly available information. Publicly available information includes data made available through government records or information a business reasonably believes has been lawfully made public through widely distributed media or by the consumer, subject to certain limitations.

The statute creates a distinct category of sensitive data, which typically warrants stronger controls. Sensitive data includes personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, a mental or physical health diagnosis by a health care provider, sexual orientation, and citizenship or immigration status. It also covers genetic or biometric data used to uniquely identify an individual, personal data collected from a known child, and precise geolocation data that locates an individual within a 1,750‑foot radius. Controllers must obtain consent before processing sensitive data and must handle children's data in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

What Rights do Indiana Consumers Receive?

Indiana residents acting in a personal, family, or household capacity gain a suite of rights that will be familiar to organizations operating in other comprehensive privacy jurisdictions. Consumers have the right to confirm whether a controller is processing their personal data and to access that data, subject to defined limitations. They also may correct inaccuracies in personal data they previously provided, taking into account the nature of the data and the purposes of processing.

Consumers have a right to delete personal data provided by or obtained about them, including data the controller sourced from third parties. For this ""third‑party"" data, a controller may comply by retaining only a record of the deletion request and the minimum information required to ensure the data remains deleted, and by committing not to use that retained information for any other purpose. Consumers may further obtain either a copy of, or a representative summary of, the personal data they previously provided to the controller in a portable and, where technically practicable, readily usable format that allows them to transmit the data to another controller when processing is automated.

Importantly, Indiana consumers may opt out of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data, and profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects, such as decisions regarding credit, housing, employment, or access to essential services. Controllers must implement processes to authenticate requests, respond within 45 days (with a single 45‑day extension where reasonably necessary), and provide at least one response per consumer per twelve‑month period at no charge. If a controller denies a request, the consumer is entitled to an internal appeal, and any denial of that appeal must include a method to contact the Indiana Attorney General to submit a complaint.

What Does the Law Expect from Controllers and Processors?

The statute is as much about governance as it is about individual rights. Controllers must limit collection to personal data that is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for the purposes disclosed to consumers. If a controller wishes to process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary for nor compatible with those disclosed purposes, it must obtain the consumer's consent.

Controllers are required to maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data. They may not process personal data in violation of state or federal anti‑discrimination laws and may not discriminate against consumers for exercising their rights, including by denying goods or services or providing a different level or quality solely because a consumer has exercised a statutory right. At the same time, the law permits bona fide loyalty, rewards, and similar programs and allows differentiated pricing or features when a consumer elects to receive targeted advertising or to permit the sale of personal data, provided these programs are transparent.

Transparency is a central requirement. Controllers must provide a ""reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful"" privacy notice that identifies the categories of personal data processed, the purposes for processing, the means by which consumers can exercise their rights and appeal a decision, the categories of personal data shared with third parties, and the categories of those third parties. Where a controller sells personal data or uses it for targeted advertising, it must clearly and conspicuously disclose that activity and explain how consumers can opt out.

Processors, for their part, must adhere to the controller's instructions and assist the controller in meeting its obligations, including responding to consumer requests, maintaining security, and supporting breach notification obligations under Indiana's existing breach statute. Contracts between controllers and processors must set out processing instructions, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data, the duration of processing, and each party's rights and obligations. These agreements must require confidentiality, address return or deletion of personal data at the end of services, provide information needed to demonstrate compliance, and allow for reasonable assessments or independent audits, with equivalent requirements flowing down to subcontractors.

What about DPIAs, De‑identified Data, and Enforcement?

Indiana aligns with other states in requiring formal documentation of certain higher‑risk processing through data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). The requirement applies to processing activities created or generated after December 31, 2025 and does not retroactively cover earlier processing. Controllers must conduct and document DPIAs for targeted advertising, sales of personal data, specified profiling that presents reasonably foreseeable risks (including unfair or deceptive treatment, unlawful disparate impact, or material injury), processing of sensitive data, and other processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to consumers.

DPIAs must weigh the benefits of processing to the controller, consumers, and the public against the risks to consumer rights, taking into account mitigation measures such as technical and organizational safeguards, the use of de‑identified data, consumer expectations, the context of processing, and the nature of the controller‑consumer relationship. A single DPIA may cover a set of similar processing operations, and an assessment prepared under another law may be used if its scope and effect are reasonably comparable. The Indiana Attorney General may request DPIAs relevant to an investigation by civil investigative demand, but these documents are confidential and exempt from public disclosure, which encourages candid analysis.

The statute also clarifies the treatment of de‑identified and pseudonymous data. Controllers must take reasonable measures to ensure de‑identified data cannot be associated with an individual, publicly commit not to attempt re‑identification, and contractually require recipients to follow the same constraints. At the same time, controllers and processors are not required to maintain data in an identifiable form solely to respond to consumer requests, and some rights and obligations are narrowed for pseudonymous data when robust technical and organizational controls are in place.

Enforcement authority resides exclusively with the Indiana Attorney General. Before initiating an enforcement action, the Attorney General must provide at least 30 days' notice of the alleged violation; if the organization cures the violation and provides a written statement that the violation has been cured and will not recur, the Attorney General may not proceed on that violation, and Indiana's cure period does not sunset. For uncured or repeated violations, the Attorney General may seek injunctive relief and civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation, as well as recovery of reasonable investigative and litigation costs, including attorneys' fees. There is no private right of action, and the statute preempts local ordinances regulating the same subject matter, providing a single statewide framework.

For organizations already engaged in multi‑state privacy compliance, Indiana's law is another signal that comprehensive privacy obligations are becoming a standard feature of doing business in the United States. Reviewing data inventories for Indiana‑resident coverage, updating public notices and internal procedures, aligning vendor contracts with the controller‑processor requirements, and operationalizing DPIAs for targeted advertising, sales, profiling, and sensitive data will position businesses to be ready on January 1, 2026.

As emissions begin to plateau and fall, but climate pledges remain modest, how will the next plan approach different energy technologies?","This year should see more promising clean energy solutions reach maturity and set the stage for wider adoption.

Technological progress is rarely linear. From the automobile to the television to solar power, a process of “gradually, then suddenly” can be observed. This process traditionally follows five distinct phases (outlined in Exhibit 1). The good news when it comes to our clean energy future is that many promising solutions are reaching stages of maturity that bring them closer to widespread adoption across a wide array of sectors and geographies.

Exhibit 1. Ten trends for 2026 along the 5 phases of technology adoption.

1. Decision makers consider “soft energy paths” to meet growing electricity demand

October is the 50th anniversary of “The Road Not Taken”, a landmark article by RMI cofounder Amory Lovins. The article encapsulates “soft energy paths,” a strategy which combines quick renewable energy deployment with “a prompt and serious commitment to efficient use of energy.” Fifty years later, this idea is as relevant as ever — as a new era of load growth requires fast, flexible solutions to meet increased demand. This time, it’s especially important in the Global South, where rapid demand growth and scarce capital combine to make these strategies more compelling than ever before.

Energy efficiency is a critical first fuel. Compared to supply-side projects, demand-side measures can increase grid capacity at roughly half the cost and 5 to 10 times the speed. For the grid itself, alternative transmission technologies can increase buildout several times faster and cheaper than traditional transmission. Innovative supply solutions, from virtual power plants to “power couples” for co-location, are also in the early adoption phase (phase 3).

2. Clean energy supports affordability with the right policies and investments

Meanwhile, wind and solar energy have entered phase 4 (system integration) and are set to continue growing. Countries such as Denmark have generated 70 percent of their electricity from solar and wind, while rising renewables are taking a larger share of generation in much of the Global South.

Combined with rapid electrification, this puts massive requirements on infrastructure and “supporting innovations” such as flexibility. The main challenges now lie in orchestrating the renewable technologies into a new energy system that can support electrification efficiently.

Now, as electricity demand rises, rising costs are a major concern — including in the United States, where affordability played a key role in recent elections and could do so again in November’s midterms. Thankfully, we can slash energy costs and waste by upgrading home technologies, implementing the right market mechanisms and policies to fix who pays, and accelerating investment in the “soft energy path” solutions above.

Global trends are already showing what’s possible for clean energy affordability. Average battery grid storage costs are more than 2 times lower than 2 years ago and more than 3 times lower than 3 years ago. In tandem, more than 90 percent of new renewable energy projects are cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives, and new renewables generation is now eclipsing total electricity demand growth. Leading experts expect this trend to continue as renewables and storage rise up the S-curve of phase 4, accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels.

3. Electric vehicle adoption enters a new phase with further action on key enablers

In the passenger transport sector, EVs have emerged as the ‘winning technology’ and are moving from niche markets (phase 3) to the mass market (phase 4). As such, adoption varies widely, but more than 1 in 4 new cars globally now have a plug, helping importing countries collectively save more than a million barrels of oil per day.

Reaching scale will also come with infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks that must be resolved. For example, this new phase requires further work on the enabling environment, from manufacturing investment to preparations for the grid. Affordable purchase prices and charging options are also crucial. New research, policies, and tools can help accelerate charging stations to match EV growth while managing new electricity demand and improving battery circularity.

In addition, battery electric trucks are moving from pilots (phase 2) to niche markets (phase 3) with several models commercially available and others nearing commercialization. We expect continued rapid improvement of battery electric trucks in terms of cost and performance, alongside a need for scaling niche markets (through trucking corridors, for example).

4. Aviation contrails see further awareness and action with new collaborations

New partnerships and explainers have highlighted the potential impact of aviation contrails — and the opportunity to quickly cut 80 percent of their warming by just tweaking 2 percent of flights. Success would make contrail avoidance the sector’s greatest near-term solution for warming through 2050.

Early solutions are ready for pilots as they move from phase 1 to 2. Recently tested corporate accounting methods could make a major difference, if strong stakeholder collaboration continues. Further action could come from the EU Emissions Trading System. A key step now will be to build the transparent data practices that can underpin future progress.

5. Industrial cleantech is boosted by new policies and protocols

Industrial heat pump adoption is nearing mass market (from phase 3 to phase 4), as progress in the buildings sector helps heat pumps improve performance while cutting costs. This progress creates inroads into higher-temperature industry, enabling further opportunities for electrification in industry.

However, many industrial solutions are still in phase 2 or early phase 3 — such as green hydrogen, where top-down market mechanisms can incentivize early adoption. In 2026, several related policy efforts can spark change across the world.

First, industrial efficiency could be improved significantly. High-efficiency motors are mature (phase 5), but only account for one-quarter of industrial motors; technological improvements could save more electricity globally than the entirety of demand from data centers. Other measures include facility design, flexibility, and smart manufacturing.

Broader actions include the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which is moving from reporting to action across several industrial sectors alongside new reporting requirements from the EU Methane Regulation. India’s carbon market is also preparing for compliance trading in the second half of 2026. And voluntary carbon markets will continue to build on the recently launched Carbon Data Open Protocol (CDOP).

6. Super pollutant solutions find increased visibility and new market mechanisms

Similar progress is helping to raise awareness across methane and other non-CO2 super pollutants. New funder collaboratives, action roadmaps, and powerful data from Climate TRACE are starting to bring unprecedented visibility to ground-level ozone, the air pollutant that also causes as much current warming as the global road transport sector.

Though early-stage field-building remains, many solutions intersect with energy transition efforts that are well into phases 3 and 4 of deployment. Enabling conditions are catching up, from recent landfill methane policies to corporate credit purchases that reach more sectors. If this progress continues, it can leverage a crucial opportunity to cut warming fast.

7. Cooling solutions reach new readiness, from innovation to deployment

From appliances to design innovations, cooling solutions are gaining ground. India is a crucial player, as a leader in recent efficiency progress as well as cooling demand growth.

Take super-efficient air conditioners, which have progressed from a phase 1 solution search (via the Global Cooling Prize) to a phase 2 proof of concept. Nine months of field testing in India’s Palava City showed that the winning technologies can cut appliances’ costs, energy use, and strain on peak electricity demand by half or more. This coming year can accelerate adoption by scaling proof points, building capacity among manufacturers, and taking other market activation steps across awareness, finance, and demand aggregation.

Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) is nearing a similar stage, with a recent call to demonstrate performance in real-world pilots. The coming months could show which approaches can lead.

8. New standards catalyze embodied carbon solutions

Another opportunity for buildings is to improve embodied carbon, which accounts for more than one-tenth of global emissions today. In countries like India, where as much as 90 percent of 2050 floor space has yet to be built, there are immense benefits to building right the first time.

With many approaches in phase 2 and 3, policy standards can help incentivize early adoption. The RESNET Standards in the US are one such example, with publication and training expected in early 2026.

9. China’s upcoming Five-Year Plan has ripple effects across the world

China is the pivot nation in the global energy transition, and its recent cleantech exports are reshaping the international landscape. Thus, this spring’s release of the 15th Five-Year Plan will be closely watched. As emissions begin to plateau and fall, but climate pledges remain modest, how will the next plan approach different energy technologies?

With its clean energy buildout firmly in phase 4 (or 5) across key technologies, China is transitioning fast and looking to new markets for its solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles. But results will depend on how other countries navigate trade tensions alongside the demand for clean energy’s affordability.

10. Global climate efforts host key convenings after a year of unfinished business

At the global level, 2025 left unfinished business across a range of policy efforts, from the International Maritime Organization to the COP30 climate conference outcomes. Even with the delays, there is a clear theme of implementation as policy efforts attempt to match the progression of technologies to the deployment phase.

The coming year will have several key milestones, including sessions of the new Global Implementation Accelerator as well as April’s First International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels. Key roadmaps on fossil fuels and forests are set for release by COP31, when last year’s Brazilian hosts pass the baton to Turkey and Australia.

It can be easy to get lost in the noise of the news cycle. But by returning to these energy transition phases, we can keep a systems view of the incredible opportunities for progress.

In North Carolina, debates over how to regulate emerging water contaminants are moving from the lab to the policy arena — and this week, those debates could translate into binding policy. The North Carolina Environmental Management Commission, which sets statewide water quality standards, is scheduled to meet Jan. 7-8 and is expected to finalize rules that limit the discharge of PFAS and other pollutants into state waterways.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances make up a class of 15,000 synthetic compounds often called “forever chemicals” because of their persistence in the environment and resistance to breaking down. Used for decades in products like nonstick cookware, food packaging and stain-resistant fabrics, PFAS have been linked to immune suppression, developmental harm and certain cancers.

An emerging contaminant, microplastics, plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters — about the size of a pencil eraser — and even smaller nanoplastics are now considered ubiquitous in the environment. In the past few years, scientists have increasingly been able to detect these particles in water, food and human tissue, including organs such as the liver, kidneys and brain, raising new questions about how plastics move through the body.

Previously, PFAS and microplastics were studied as separate contaminants. But newer research suggests that real-world exposure rarely occurs that way. Studies increasingly show the two pollutants co-exist in water, food and the environment, where microplastics may carry or interact with other chemicals, and both can persist in living tissue. This realization has prompted calls for a more integrated approach to assessing environmental and human health risks.

As North Carolina and the nation brace for an active year of policy debates and new research on PFAS and microplastics, Frank Leibfarth, a UNC Chapel Hill chemistry professor and the university’s first recipient of the Blavatnik National Award for Young Scientists, is working at the intersection of both challenges. Leibfarth’s research focuses on designing advanced polymer materials and chemical processes to capture and destroy PFAS in drinking water, while also developing safer, more sustainable plastics aimed at reducing long-term environmental contamination.

In 2024, Leibfarth and Orlando Coronell, a UNC Chapel Hill environmental sciences and engineering professor, helped launch pilot testing of new materials designed to remove PFAS from public drinking water and wastewater systems as part of the North Carolina PFAS University Research Alliance. The work was funded by the North Carolina Collaboratory, a General Assembly initiative that coordinates research across the UNC System to support state and local government decision-making.

In late 2025, NC Health News spoke with Leibfarth about what the latest science reveals about PFAS and microplastics — and what questions researchers are still trying to answer.

North Carolina Health News: Can you share an update on the PFAS pilot testing?

Frank Leibfarth: We completed three pilot tests. One involved surface water from the Cape Fear River, which we conducted at [Cape Fear Public Utility Authority] Sweeney Water Treatment Plant. Another focused on groundwater drawn from the Pee Dee Aquifer and was carried out at [CFPUA’s] Richardson Drinking Water Treatment Plant in Wilmington. The third took place at a wastewater facility — the Burlington Wastewater Treatment Plant. We also conducted pilot testing with Orange Water and Sewer Authority in Chapel Hill.

Leibfarth told NCHN that in addition to field pilots, his team is working with several utilities on bench-scale tests to evaluate how the materials perform under different treatment conditions.

NCHN: Beyond studying the liquids produced by landfills (called leachate), what other goals do you have for 2026?

Leibfarth: With the information that we’ve learned from the pilots and the feedback we’ve gotten from the utilities, we want to start at least two more pilots in order to solve specific problems that they’ve asked us to solve. Those are things like increasing the capacity of our resins for long chain PFAS, and implementing an on-site regeneration procedure that could be used by utilities in the future.

NCHN: Many water utilities already rely on granular activated carbon systems to remove PFAS. What are the challenges in adding new treatment technologies without rebuilding entire systems?

Leibfarth: In 2026, we want to pilot ion exchange resins that are denser and could be used in combination with carbon. Most surface water plants, like Sweeney, will likely use carbon because it makes economic sense. For utilities to adopt another technology, it has to fit into that existing infrastructure. No municipal treatment plant wants to tell customers they need a whole new building to make it work.

NCHN: One challenge utilities face is what happens to PFAS after filters are cleaned. How does that process work for granular activated carbon?

Leibfarth: For granular activated carbon filters, they send them to what are called reactivate facilities. That’s a thermal treatment process that reactivates a granular activated carbon so it can be used again.The information for how effectively [the process] destroys PFAS is still not known because the data isn’t released. That reactivation isn’t 100 percent, so, typically, they have to add some new granular activated carbon in order to bring the performance up to what it was.

NCHN: Let’s shift to plastic waste. In a recent Duke University study put a price tag on the societal costs of plastic pollution as much as $1 trillion yearly. What do you think about single-use plastics in that context?

Leibfarth: There’s a study comparing coffee cups [that states that] over its lifetime, a porcelain mug can generate more greenhouse gas emissions than hundreds of disposable polystyrene cups, largely because porcelain is energy-intensive to manufacture and wash. I’m fully on board with reducing how much plastic we make — and there are huge opportunities to recycle and reuse it better — but plastics also do a tremendous amount to save energy.

NCHN: But much of that polystyrene still ends up discarded in the environment. How do you reconcile that?

Leibfarth: We design materials for the most extreme use case. Think about a food truck — packaging is designed for someone who might drive 30 miles and want the food still hot. But most people walk up and eat right there. Do we really need all that excess material? A lot of this comes down to how we think about using things, not just the material itself.

Large, complex problems like plastic pollution and climate change can be difficult for people to grasp at an individual level, Leibfarth noted. Studies that quantify environmental impacts, he said, help show how everyday choices — multiplied across millions of people — can add up to significant harm, even as he cautioned against simplistic narratives that frame all plastics as inherently bad.",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_0375-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-07 05:58:01.588874

""Solar power is the cheapest form of energy in history,"" economist Gernot Wagner from Columbia Business School told DW.
""Basically, you invest to put up the clean energy system and that will save you the money that you're currently spending on buying fossil fuels,"" Bond said.","In the rolling hills of southeast Queensland, Australia, farmer and businessman Brent Finlay stands beneath turbines so tall they rival skyscrapers.

""There's a lift inside that takes about 12 minutes to go from the bottom to the top,"" he said, pointing skyward. Forty-five of the giant turbines that now dot his property are part of the massive MacIntyre Wind Farm which will soon generate enough electricity to power 700,000 homes.

It's a world away from the climate disaster Finlay endured five years ago when a devastating year-long drought turned his fertile land to powder, birds fell dead from the trees and thousands of native kangaroos perished from extreme temperature fluctuations.

""Our ecosystem didn't just decline, it collapsed,"" he recalled.

Despite experiencing firsthand the devastation climate change causes, Finlay's choice to host the wind turbines is not an environmental statement. ""It's additional revenue... an investment for future generations on this farm,"" he told DW, pointing out that intensifying weather extremes are making farming more precarious.

Since then, he's been using regenerative farming practices to restore the wool and beef farm that's been in his family for more than 100 years. But he's also one of a growing number of farmers now allowing renewable energy projects on their land. They can earn revenue through renting land to renewable energy developers, while generating power for nearby communities.

A fast transition could save trillions

Farmers with land to rent out aren't the only ones expected to reap financial benefits from a clean energy system.

As the price of renewables technology continues to plummet, experts predict savings across the board — from lower household power prices to fewer costly climate disasters.

In fact, the quicker a transition happens, the cheaper it will be. Even without taking into account the savings to be made from avoiding costly climate disasters, aUniversity of Oxford study found a shift to renewables by 2050 could save the global economy at least $12 trillion (€10.2 trillion) in energy system costs. As compared to sticking with fossil fuels.

And those savings would be made while producing more energy overall and expanding electricity access worldwide.

The reason a rapid transition would provide more savings is because the more renewable energy technology is being made, the cheaper it's getting.

Economists describe this phenomenon as a ""learning curve"" called Wright's Law, which shows the costs of certain technologies fall as cumulative production increases. The same pattern drove down the price of aircraft, cars, computers, and DNA sequencing over the past century.

Prices for solar, wind, battery storage continue to fall

In the last ten years, the cost of solar panels has dropped by around 90%, largely thanks to an explosion in Chinese manufacturing capacity.

""Solar power is the cheapest form of energy in history,"" economist Gernot Wagner from Columbia Business School told DW. ""This stuff is so cheap that Germans are installing it as garden fencing. It keeps the dog in and the car charged.""

Wind power has also dropped in price by about 70% since 2014. And battery storage — vital for storing wind and solar power — is also fast improving, with prices declining by 85% compared to the 2010s.

""When you have small modular technologies, it's much easier to reduce costs because essentially you have innovation taking place over tens of thousands or even millions of different agents,"" Kingsmill Bond, energy strategist at the UK-based energy thinktank Ember, told DW.

Technologies vs. commodities

Compare that to the fossil fuel system, which relies on finite materials that need to be located, extracted from the ground, transported across the world, and can only be burned once.

Coal, oil and gas prices fluctuate based on geopolitics, supply shocks, and market speculation, but they do not get cheaper over time. And this price fluctuation has serious economic consequences, climate economist Wagner explained.

""That's where Putin blows a fuse, invades Ukraine... and we have the summer of 2022 when electricity prices in Europe were 10 times as high as they should have been,"" he said.

Solar and wind technology require upfront manufacturing and construction costs, but low operating costs. Once a solar or wind farm is built, the ""fuel"" — sun and wind — is free and immune to global market shocks.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), in 2024, generating electricity from solar was almost half as expensive as the lowest-cost fossil alternative, and wind power was even less. As renewable capacity expands, that price difference is expected to continue growing.

Nuclear power stands out as an exception, however. Unlike solar and wind, it's not getting cheaper. A nuclear-led transition would cost around $25 trillion more by 2050 than today's energy system.

Why fossil fuels cost more than they seem

Sticking with fossil fuels might feel cheaper because the infrastructure is already built. But — even without taking into account the enormous cost of its harmful impact on the climate — running this system comes with massive ongoing operating costs.

The constant mining, transport, and machinery used to extract and refine the fuels are hugely expensive. Another hidden cost comes in the form of what economists call ""rent"" — the extra profit that fossil fuel-producing countries can charge for coal, oil and gas simply because they control scarce resources that are in high demand.

Saudi Arabia, for example, can extract oil for roughly $5-10 a barrel, then sell it for between $50-100. According to World Bank data, these global fossil fuel ""rents"" amount to as much as $2.5 trillion a year.

""We're pouring thousands of billions of dollars into the pockets of the petrostates and making them very wealthy,"" said energy strategist Bond. ""It's that money that's up for grabs that we don't have to spend anymore.""

Spending differently, not more

Contrary to popular belief, transitioning to clean energy sources like solar and wind does not require spending more overall, Bond explained. Most of the investment required can simply be reallocated from what would otherwise be spent on maintaining and expanding fossil fuel infrastructure.

""Basically, you invest to put up the clean energy system and that will save you the money that you're currently spending on buying fossil fuels,"" Bond said.

Money that would otherwise go toward building new pipelines, upgrading old refineries or paying for fuel imports can instead be invested in wind and solar farms, storage and grid upgrades — assets that deliver energy at far lower long-term operating costs.

""You just stick up a solar panel, and it lasts for 30 years and generates your electricity every single day... it's obviously going to be cheaper to run a renewable system,"" Bond told DW.

Republicans in Congress have cancelled tax credits that would have helped households save big on clean energy upgrades. The Trump administration is dismantling federal building-decarbonization policies and trying to block states and cities from setting rules that restrict fossil fuel use in homes and businesses. Even some Democrats who once championed such mandates U-turned last year: Los Angeles’ mayor repealed an ordinance that most new construction go all-electric, and New York’s governor delayed a similar statewide law previously slated to go into effect last week.

These are very real headwinds, but they’re not the whole story. Several key barometers suggest that building decarbonization is poised to pick up speed as consumers grow more worried about energy affordability, installers get familiar with electric tech, and policymakers and building owners alike recognize the health, comfort, and financial benefits of ditching fossil fuels.

Let’s dive into seven indicators — and a few bonus figures — that show why the momentum behind climate-friendly buildings may be unstoppable.

11.7%: Growth in fossil gas prices from September 2024 to September 2025

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index for piped gas ballooned more than twice as fast as that for electricity, and nearly four times as fast as overall inflation for all tracked items. That makes utility gas one of the leading causes of inflation, which could give customers pause on whether to depend on the fuel in the future.

The price surge is partly thanks to the fact that the U.S. has been increasing its exports of liquefied natural gas, squeezing the domestic fuel supply and driving up costs at home, said Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the nonprofit Building Decarbonization Coalition.

Gas customers are also shouldering growing infrastructure costs. Utilities have massively ramped up gas-system spending since the 2010s — a result of increased safety investments in response to some high-profile explosions that decade, as well as a sense of urgency stoked by state climate laws, Bartholomy said.

“Many [utilities] view this as a race against time,” he noted in a December interview. ​“We now have 15 states since 2020 that have started future-of-gas proceedings, where they’re actually [taking] a regulatory approach to how they’re going to wind down the gas system in their state.”

$2 billion to $7 billion: The amount of money U.S. utility customers could save each year if policymakers reformed gas line subsidies

In utility territories across 46 states and Washington, D.C., existing gas customers cover the cost of hooking up new customers to the system. The fees add up to $2 billion to $7 billion each year, according to an August 2025 analysis by the Building Decarbonization Coalition.

Policymakers and utilities in six states have reformed these ​“line extension allowances” to stop incentivizing growth of the gas system as well as to lower customer bills. Of the six, California, Colorado, and New York have eliminated the subsidies statewide. Another six states and D.C. are considering ending them.

Putting an end to gas-hookup subsidies is a fast-acting affordability measure, Bartholomy said. ​“States [that] stop subsidies in 2026 … are going to save people money in 2027.”

52%: The percentage of single-family homes that were built with electric heating in 2024

The majority of homes — both single- and multifamily abodes — are now built with electric heating, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s a big change over the last decade for single-family homes especially; in 2015, 60% were equipped with gas or propane heating, and just 39% were heated electrically.

Among multifamily buildings, electrically heated units accounted for 63% of new construction in 2015. In 2024, the share rose to 76%.

The agency doesn’t break down how many newly built homes have super-efficient heat pumps. But the next stat shows that the appliances are increasingly popular.

4.1 million: Number of air-source heat pumps shipped in the U.S. in 2024

Heat pumps beat out gas furnaces (3.1 million shipped in 2024) by their biggest margin ever, 32%, that year, according to data from the industry trade group Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute. The numbers for 2025 through October, the latest available, show heat pumps in the lead yet again.

These appliances, which provide both heating and cooling, are also steadily gobbling up the market share of conventional air conditioners. In 2015, ACs outsold heat pumps by two-to-one. By 2024, the gap had shrunk to 35%, with ACs still pulling ahead.

Bartholomy of the Building Decarbonization Coalition predicts that margin could shrink to just 20% in 2026.

About 1 in 4: States that have passed legislation related to thermal energy networks

Lawmakers in 13 states have approved bills that encourage gas utilities to reinvent themselves as utilities that provide carbon-free thermal energy instead of fossil gas. Some of these laws require gas companies to pilot thermal energy networks, which can decarbonize entire neighborhoods at once by replacing gas pipeline systems. Others unlock financing or establish regulatory frameworks that allow utilities to recover costs for these projects from customers.

Thermal energy networks that make use of geothermal heat, found tens to hundreds of feet deep, are also the rare climate solution that the federal government is incentivizing. Geothermal networks are eligible for a tax credit of 30% to 50% until 2033. The appliances that harvest underground heat and store it for later — geothermal heat pumps and thermal batteries — qualify for the tax credit, too, as long as eligible commercial customers lease instead of purchase these products.

“In many states, we’re seeing this lease [structure] as a real tipping point, where geothermal becomes less expensive than the status quo for the builders,” Dan Yates, CEO of geothermal heat-pump startup Dandelion Energy, told Canary Media last year.

58%: The share of contractors who reported installing more heat pumps than they did three years ago

That’s according to a survey released in January 2025 by the ACHR News. The same survey revealed that 71% of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning installers expect heat pumps to make up a larger fraction of projects in the next three years. Just 61% thought so the year before.

Contractors may be responding to warming consumer sentiment. About nine out of 10 heat-pump owners would recommend the tech to others, and a growing number of homeowners (32% in 2024 versus 23% in 2023) report having a good understanding of what these systems are, per a survey published in February 2025 by manufacturer Mitsubishi Electric Trane.

Innovation in some contractor businesses could also help the tech gain traction. One vertically integrated startup, Jetson, says it’s cutting the cost of heat-pump installations in half.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Contractor-installs-heat-pump-at-home-in-Redwood-City-CA.JPG?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=90eb8f21f9898967a818a5a48bb89c7e,N,,2026-01-07 06:59:31.481297

The idea is that “solar energy reduces the load on the grid while lowering electric bills,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor.
Though he has not identified specific regulatory procedures that he supports for the burgeoning industry, he said consumer prices and energy production go hand in hand.
“Renewable energies and data centers, they don't go together at all,” Yaw told Spotlight PA. “Data centers require continuous, non-intermittent power.
“There is the potential for bills around data centers to break through traditional partisan ideological lines.”","HARRISBURG — Democrats and Republicans who lead the Pennsylvania legislature have singled out increasing energy production as a goal for the year, as electricity prices rise and demand increases.

Consumers could feel an even greater squeeze in the years ahead, as utility companies predict that efforts to build data centers across the state to meet the artificial intelligence demand will worsen the crunch.

But environmental and labor advocates are skeptical that lawmakers can overcome partisanship in the state Capitol and take meaningful action.

That skepticism persists despite a major policy hurdle — which led to legal fights costing taxpayers more than $4.2 million — now being out of the way.

As a part of a $50.1 billion budget deal that resolved a four-month impasse, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and members of his party who control the state House agreed to pull out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. The controversial interstate program would have capped the total amount of carbon emissions that some companies in Pennsylvania could emit and forced them to pay for each ton emitted.

Leaving RGGI was a major Republican goal. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that his chamber was unlikely to move energy legislation until the state courts resolved a lawsuit regarding Pennsylvania’s entrance into the program.

With the program out of the way, Shapiro said he expects action.

“For years, the Republicans who have led the Senate have used RGGI as an excuse to stall substantive conversations about energy production. Today, that excuse is gone,” Shapiro said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “It is time now to look forward.”

Energy auctions in Pennsylvania offer a window into the challenge facing utility companies and consumers. The auctions are held by the operator of the state’s vast energy grid and are used to procure enough electricity for the future, and in recent years, prices have skyrocketed. In 2024, prices increased by more than 800% from the year prior. And at the December auction, energy prices hit a record high and would likely have increased further without a cap agreed to as part of legal action brought by Shapiro.

The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission also told consumers this past summer that the state saw “soaring power usage during multiple heat waves since mid-June and scorching conditions that pushed electricity demand on the regional power grid to its highest level in 14 years.” Supply and demand are the biggest factors in prices, an expert told Spotlight PA at the time.

Rob Routh, a lawyer and advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he’s watching the state Senate in particular to see if lawmakers are willing to move legislation that would increase renewable energy production or if the caucus will only support the natural gas industry.

“Are they just going to be ideologically fixed on one type of resource to generate electricity — gas?” Routh told Spotlight PA. “Are they willing to consider an all-of-the-above energy approach, or is it an explicit rejection of renewables?”

More energy on the table

Lawmakers' proposals to increase energy production take many approaches — from speeding up permitting to adjusting tax credits. They’ve also focused on various industries, from solar to nuclear power.

Shapiro told reporters that he wants to see state Senate Republicans pass his energy package, a slate of bills also known as the “Lightning Plan.”

It includes legislation that would amend some tax credits to benefit clean energy production, create a new board to streamline permitting for energy projects, and require electric companies to buy more renewable energy.

Another key part of Shapiro’s plan is to create a Pennsylvania-specific carbon cap-and-trade program, similar to RGGI. A majority of the payments from power producers to emit carbon dioxide — 70% — “would be returned to Pennsylvanians as rebates on their electric bill,” according to the Shapiro administration.

Pittman has shot down that idea outright, saying that his caucus is not interested in supporting “any type of artificial cap-and-trade” program.

He has been more open to the other parts of the plan. He told Spotlight PA that revisiting the renewable energy standards “has merit,” and that the caucus is “willing to have a conversation over” the tax credit rewrites. These tax credits currently can be claimed by companies for a variety of purchases, including natural gas to manufacture petrochemicals, milk for dairy processing, and hydrogen fuel. Shapiro’s rewrite would include a new tax credit for clean energy producers.

“We would certainly be willing to have a conversation about any initiatives that help speed up projects in development so shovels get in the ground as soon as possible,” Pittman said.

Pittman said his caucus’ energy priorities include efforts “to enhance the use of our resources,” naming carbon capture as an example — a process through which carbon emissions are contained before they reach the atmosphere and are injected into deep underground wells. The waste can also be used to drill for more oil.

He also talked about speeding up efforts “to lower the taxes on job creators,” and issuing permits more quickly. However, he did not name specific legislation that he would support in the new year.

“I really think the best approach is to be as nimble and inviting as possible, to not try to have government programs and government initiatives artificially attempt to drive the marketplace,” Pittman told Spotlight PA days after the final budget deal.

Renewable energy, not climate protection

State House Democrats have proposed a range of legislation to lower barriers to increasing renewable or low-carbon energy sources, such as requiring that new warehouses be built to be compatible with solar panels and reducing permitting fees for small nuclear power plants.

Both the state House and Senate have passed bills that touch on solar energy with bipartisan support in recent years, although they had different goals.

Last session, the state House passed a proposal that would allow third parties to operate community solar energy facilities, which consumers could opt into. The idea is that “solar energy reduces the load on the grid while lowering electric bills,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The bill was reintroduced last year, but hasn’t been considered by either chamber.

Last summer, the state Senate passed a measure that would tighten oversight of Pennsylvania’s growing solar energy industry to help ensure that solar panels are properly decommissioned and all waste is properly disposed of. The requirements would not apply to homes and businesses that use solar panels to “generate electricity for their own use,” according to the bill’s prime sponsor. The full state House has not taken it up.

Katie Blume, legislative director for Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, doubts that Democrats and Republicans will push energy bills to the finish line.

She pointed to other unresolved disagreements, including the regulation of slot-like skill games, that both parties have agreed are priorities but have been unable to advance.

“Why should I have faith in the Senate to do anything on energy, let alone affordability, when they can't even figure out skill games in their own caucus?” Blume told Spotlight PA.

Rob Bair, chair of the Pennsylvania State Building & Construction Trades Council, which represents many unionized workers who build power plants, echoed Blume’s concern. Bair said lawmakers will have to compromise and bolster both natural gas and solar, industries that are often pitted against each other.

“Everyone understands we need to do it,” Bair said of increasing power generation in the state. “But we are watching everything closely to see if the chambers can actually come together.”

Environmental protection bills have even worse odds of passing the General Assembly, said state Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware) at a December advisory committee meeting on climate change issue.

Vitali said that the “political reality” in the Capitol is that legislators have to focus on proposals that are “in conformance [with] labor and labor jobs.”

“Climate isn’t among the top five issues of legislators,” Vitali said. “There’s a need for leadership. … They have to do more than introducing bills and paying [climate change] lip service.”

Data centers on deck

Lawmakers have also singled out data centers as a major reason to increase energy production in the state.

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build out data centers in Pennsylvania. These facilities require huge amounts of both energy and clean water — the latter is used to cool the campuses. One projection estimates that global energy demand will increase by up to 165% by the end of the decade because of AI.

At the same time, Pennsylvania’s grid operator — PJM Interconnection — is seeing record-high prices at energy auctions. Those higher prices trickle down to consumers, according to utilities.

The most recent energy auction hit the price cap negotiated by Shapiro and the grid operator, and still failed to procure the amount of energy PJM had targeted.

Pittman has also identified data centers as a key cause for increasing energy production in the state. Though he has not identified specific regulatory procedures that he supports for the burgeoning industry, he said consumer prices and energy production go hand in hand.

“The best way to protect consumers with the advent of data centers is to make sure supply meets demand,” Pittman said at a news conference following the budget’s passage. “We want to see responsible growth of data centers. We want to see [the] responsible growth of power supply.”

Any energy-related legislation will likely be referred to the state Senate’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, and its chair, Gene Yaw (R., Lycoming), said he doesn’t think more renewable energy is the answer.

“Renewable energies and data centers, they don't go together at all,” Yaw told Spotlight PA. “Data centers require continuous, non-intermittent power. And renewable power — it's intermittent and of limited duration at best.“

Routh, the advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said gas plants have their own limitations and argued that Yaw’s comments ignore the effectiveness of battery storage technology for renewable energy.

Still, he called the data center issue “top of mind for legislators and their constituents,” and said there’s potential for state House Democrats and Senate Republicans to collaborate on regulating their energy usage.

He pointed to a bipartisan agreement in the state budget deal related to the PUC, which oversees utilities across Pennsylvania. The legislation, which is now law, allows the agency to review and validate utility companies’ predictions to PJM of the amount of electricity needed — those estimates help set costs for consumers.

Routh said that one bill he’s keeping an eye on would direct the commission to draft regulations to oversee data centers and prevent spikes in electricity costs.

“It's a new issue. It's the key driver for why people's electric bills are going to be going up in Pennsylvania,” Routh said. “There is the potential for bills around data centers to break through traditional partisan ideological lines.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f3ff73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x788+0+42/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0b%2F37%2F8dcfa9ff4d459873d71b76bc7767%2F01mn-gcy1-ywjz-yr0y.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 09:14:30.761897

Uruguay's story of how this small South American country successfully transitioned its electric grid to be almost completely powered by renewable energy, could be a good model for NY and provide evidence that it is achievable in as little as one and a half decades if the political will and needed policies are put in place.

NY is a wealthy state and has no valid excuse for not being further along in transitioning to renewable energy, especially since it enacted its climate law, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) in 2019 and stated it was going to move toward renewable energy many years (1.5 decades) before enacting the CLCPA.

Key Milestones in NY's Renewable Goals:

2004: Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS): Mandated 25% renewable energy by 2013, setting the initial push for clean energy.

2016: ""50 by '30"" Goal: The Public Service Commission (PSC) ordered a Clean Energy Standard (CES) to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2030, building on earlier efforts. (I note that NY's current trend from NYISO 2024 Power Trends report, graph on page 51, implies we will be 30 years late on even this modest goal.)

2019: Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA): A landmark law establishing ambitious statewide goals:

70% Renewable Electricity by 2030. (I note that NY's current trend from graph on page 51 of NYISO 2024 Power Trends report, implies we will be 70 years late unless NY speeds up to go 15X faster.)

100% Zero-Emission Electricity by 2040.

Uruguay has a population of 3.4 million, almost no fossil fuel resources, but significant hydropower (50% of elect generated) and it developed good wind (about 40% of elect generated) & solar power resources in just one and a half decades, with 50,000 jobs created by the transition to 98% renewable electricity, while its poverty rate dropped from 40% to just 10%.

Excerpts and articles about Uruguay's transition are below. As the first article says, Uruguay completely avoided nuclear power!

In 2005, oil made up 55% of Uruguay’s total energy supply, and residents still experienced blackouts and energy rationing.

“In dry years…cost overruns could be as high as $1 billion. And for a small economy like Uruguay, this is 2% of GDP”, Mendéz explained in an interview with NPR in November 2023.'

Generating 98% of its electricity from renewable sources, Uruguay’s rapid adoption and expansion of sustainable sources of energy has been lauded internationally as a model for transitioning national power systems away from fossil fuels.

Avoiding nuclear power entirely, Uruguay first embraced wind turbines as a source of cheap, reliable power; providing 40% of the country’s capacity in less than a decade. It then expanded its solar and biomass capacity to an almost fully decarbonized mix of energy sources, joining a very short list of high-income countries producing over 90% of their energy needs with low-carbon sources – including Iceland, Sweden, and France. Once a net importer of energy, Uruguay now exports its surplus energy to neighbouring Brazil and Argentina.

In less than two decades, Uruguay broke free of its dependence on oil imports and carbon emitting power generation, transitioning to renewable energy that is owned by the state but with infrastructure paid for by private investment. Can such a feat be replicated elsewhere?

Uruguay has significantly reduced its carbon footprint and nurtured domestic development that is credited with reducing poverty rates from 40% to 10% in less than two decades.

The Uruguay Way is a framework of laws, regulations, institutional support, and consensus building.

Additional excerpts/articles about Uruguay's swift transition to renewable energy:

Uruguay did what most nations still call impossible: it built a power grid that runs almost entirely on renewables—at half the cost of fossil fuels. The physicist who led that transformation says the same playbook could work anywhere—if governments have the courage to change the rules.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2025/10/19/uruguays-renewable-charge-a-small-nation-a-big-lesson-for-the-world/

Just 17 years ago, Uruguay used fossil fuels for a third of its energy generation, according to the World Resources Institute.

Today, only 2% of the electricity consumed in Uruguay is generated from fossil sources. The country’s thermal power plants rarely need to be activated, except when natural resources are insufficient.

Half of Uruguay’s electricity is generated in the country’s dams [hydropower], and 10% percent comes from agricultural and industrial waste and the sun. But wind, at 38%, is the main protagonist of the revolution in the electrical grid.

[President] Vázquez needed rapid solutions. He turned to an unlikely source: Ramón Méndez Galain, a physicist who would transform the country’s energy grid into one of the cleanest in the world.

“I had been working abroad for 14 years, and when I came back, there was this energy crisis, but the only solution people were giving was to install a nuclear power plant – that was it,” Galain remembers. “I was a nuclear physicist, so I thought I could understand a little about this problem.”

The more Galain researched the issue, the more he became convinced that nuclear power was not the answer for Uruguay. Instead, he argued, it was renewables. He published his findings in a paper that laid out his belief that the country should go all in on wind power. Soon after, he received a phone call inviting him to become Uruguay’s energy secretary and to implement his plan.

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/27/uruguays-green-power-revolution-rapid-shift-to-wind-shows-the-world-how-its-done?CMP=share_btn_url

He [Méndez Galain] started researching different potential paths for Uruguay's energy future and reaching out to experts he knew around the world. Ultimately, he wrote up an entire plan for how Uruguay could change its energy mix so that it relied almost entirely on renewable energy. There would be less pollution, it would be better for the climate, and, he thought, in the long run, it would be the most economical choice Uruguay could make.

private companies would be in charge of setting up and maintaining the wind turbines that would power Uruguay's grid, while the public utility would continue to distribute that energy to its customers

His scheme had the built-in advantage of pushing the billions of dollars in upfront cost to construct all those wind turbines onto the private companies. In exchange, the public utility would agree to buy all the energy those turbines produced at a set rate for 20 years.

""Investors need to have the security that their investment will be paid back,"" explains Méndez Galain, ""and for that they need a certain amount of time.""

On clean industrial policy in 2025, the Trump administration folded, and the EU doubled down.","Headline figures from the International Energy Agency’s 2025 World Energy Investment report paint a persuasive picture: Clean energy is the house favorite.

Combined public and private sector inflows to renewable energy, grid infrastructure, alternative fuels, and energy efficiency approached $2.2 trillion. Clean technologies’ share of sector-wide investment continued to rise year-on-year, falling just short of two-thirds of total investment in 2025, and annual flows to fossil fuel infrastructure declined for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.

But this winning streak is, in key respects, an illusion.

As previously discussed in Carbon Critical, encouraging investment signals fail to reflect the reality that emissions continue to exceed established greenhouse gas budgets. And institutions remain unprepared to respond to the physical risks associated with climate change. One decade after the signing of the Paris Agreement, the international community is not on track to achieve a single 2030 target assessed in Climate Analytics’ 2025 State of Climate Action report.

The first year of the second Trump administration added fuel to the climate-denying fire while casting a general malaise over climate-conscious institutions in the United States. The administration’s actions—most notably withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and rolling back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act—prompted debates regarding Europe’s alignment in the energy transition and geopolitics more broadly. Washington’s retreat left Brussels alone at the table, compelled to accelerate climate action while attempting to kickstart its industrial competitiveness.

The US Disappearing Act

The widening gap between the United States and Europe on industrial policy is glaringly obvious, but while Trump’s flashy rejections of international climate arrangements have attracted the most media attention, deeper divergences can be observed in each government’s treatment of early-stage clean technology demonstrations.

Government funding for technology commercialization accounts for a small share of the investments outlined in the IEA’s WEI reports but carries enormous weight with regards to future emissions reductions, particularly for hard-to-abate industrial sectors like steel, cement, and clean fuels.

While mature technologies like solar, wind, and battery storage have benefited from investment and production incentives like tax credits in the United States (until recently) and contracts for difference in the European Union, technologies moving from pilot stages to first-of-a-kind field demonstrations require support from unique government vehicles. The creation of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) in the United States in 2021 and the European Union’s Innovation Fund in 2019 demonstrated a commitment to financing the next generation of clean technologies on both sides of the Atlantic.

That is, until the US Department of Energy imposed sweeping cuts to more than 600 programs in October 2025 and erased OCED from the Department’s revised organizational chart in November. The initial announcement on October 2 terminated 321 awards issued under the Biden administration amounting to $8 billion. A leaked second list surfaced five days later, which appeared to expand the cuts to 647 awards, ballooning the revoked funding total to nearly $24 billion. The expanded list also cuts projects managed by the Offices of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, and Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.

The exact contours of the Trump administration’s cuts to clean technology funding have yet to be defined, but it is clear that the signature regional collaboration platforms laid out in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and managed by OCED have been put to rest. The hydrogen and direct air capture hubs—together representing over $11 billion in appropriated funding—were wiped off the map. Critical industrial decarbonization grants awarded to majors like Vale, Cleveland Cliffs, and Eastman Chemical were slashed, setting back first-of-a-kind decarbonization pathways for steel and plastics production and recycling processes. Cuts to low-carbon cement projects hit several ventures managed by European firms, including French cement major Vicat and Germany’s Heidelberg Materials.

Toward the European Clean Industrial Deal

As the US claws back funding for innovative industrial processes, Europe is accelerating its decarbonization agenda. The Innovation Fund launched three funding opportunities at the end of 2025 with up to €5.2 billion available for disbursement. One fifth of the funding is earmarked for projects attempting to decarbonize industrial process heat, responsible for three quarters of European industrial emissions. The platform, managed by the Industrial Decarbonization Bank, is the first European-wide auction focused on emissions associated with high-temperature process heat and creates an “auction-as-a-service” scheme, which aims to support national funding platforms for similar industrial transformations.

With the recent funding announcement, the Innovation Fund is on its way to surpassing the funding for clean energy demonstrations in the United States before the Trump administration’s cuts. Since its first call for projects in 2020, the Innovation Fund has disbursed €13 billion ($15.25 billion) across 225 projects and over 500 participating entities. The Fund is capitalized with allowances from the EU Emissions Trading System, which could amount to €40 billion ($46.91 billion) by 2030, nearly double the value of the Trump administration’s recent cuts to clean technology demonstrations.

Europe’s funding flows are backed up by an expanding policy framework designed to incentivize investment in carbon-free technologies as drivers of reindustrialization and economic growth. The Clean Industrial Deal (CID), launched last February, establishes a bloc-wide approach to developing, financing, and deploying the energy and industrial infrastructure required for deep decarbonization.

The CID connects an ecosystem of funding platforms, from early-stage research funding out of Horizon Europe to the Innovation Fund’s catalytic commercialization assistance and InvestEU’s financial guarantee mechanisms. Across all platforms bundled under the CID, the EU aims to mobilize €100-150 billion ($117-176 billion) for industrial decarbonization and energy sector development. CID funding is further supplemented by billions in member-state contributions to the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) for clean hydrogen market creation, similar to the US hydrogen hub approach.

Crucially, demand-side signals are also under development at the European Commission and member state levels. Starting this year, the commission will begin a review of its public procurement policies to ensure alignment with industrial sustainability and resilience, likely strengthening “European preference criteria.” The European Climate Law and Fit for 55 package provides the legislative and regulatory backdrop for the implementation of CID policies and funding.

These policies should sound familiar to American readers given the overlap with the clean energy and industrial provisions included in the US IIJA and Inflation Reduction Act. The key difference, of course, being that the EU’s policies and funding opportunities remain in place and backstopped by (theoretically) binding emissions reduction goals.

Facing a withdrawn and increasingly oppositional partner in the United States and accelerating Chinese industrial innovation, European policymakers are leveraging the EU’s technocratic strength to take up the mantle of Western clean industrial policy. Whether the funding and policies are sufficient to drag Europe out of its Draghi-defined industrial competitiveness crisis is a subject for debate, but the persistent and seemingly well-crafted support from the European Commission is certainly a positive development for the bloc’s industrial decarbonization ambitions.

Up for Grabs

The US rollback of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement were defining stories of 2025, at least within clean energy circles. But the expected impacts of tax credit repeals are less dire than they once seemed and Trump’s withdrawal from Paris is, after all, a rerun of his first administration’s greatest hits. The administration’s pullback of obligated grant funding for early-stage, potentially transformative industrial technologies may be of greater consequence in the decades to come.

European leaders appear convinced that this will erode long-term US competitiveness and are betting significant political and financial capital against the Trump administration’s approach. After all, solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage were commercialized over the last decade. Technological solutions for hard-to-abate industrial applications must be commercialized in the decade to come. Ownership of these nascent technologies is currently up for grabs and will require concerted, stable government support. It goes without saying that Beijing is a top contender and remains focused on dominating the clean industrial technologies of the future.

The first half of this decade has made it clear that policymakers in Washington and Brussels are uncomfortable with the concentration of manufacturing for mature clean technologies in China. The desire to avoid a similar concentration of nascent clean energy and industrial technologies is what makes the current reinforcement of the European industrial decarbonization agenda so vital—and the Trump administration’s abandonment of early-stage clean technology so reckless.

On clean industrial policy in 2025, the Trump administration folded, and the EU doubled down. The next four years and the decades that follow will determine who played their cards right and who bet the house on a losing hand.

Two additional awards were also made to Richland Community College and Kankakee Community College to offer training programs in clean energy manufacturing.
“Manufacturing Training Academy grant funding supercharged the Heartland Community College effort to develop our leading-edge EV Technology program.
“Illinois community colleges are uniquely positioned to help power the state’s manufacturing future,” said Brian Durham, Executive Director of the Illinois Community College Board.","Grant funding will increase advanced workforce training facilities at Illinois community colleges

On Monday, January 5, 2026, Governor JB Pritzker and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO) announced $24 million is now available in grant funding to establish six new Manufacturing Training Academies (MTAs) at community colleges in the state’s downstate regions to expand training for high-demand manufacturing jobs in Illinois. This initiative will create new opportunities at the Manufacturing Training Academy level. Grantees will be selected through a competitive Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) process.

“Our skilled workforce is part of what makes Illinois a manufacturing powerhouse, and this critical grant funding will empower more Illinoisans to pursue high-demand, well-paying jobs in our growing manufacturing sector,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “My administration is committed to investing in Illinois’ workforce and expanding job training opportunities across the state. I encourage all eligible community colleges to apply and help support the future of our manufacturing economy.”

As part of the State of Illinois’ mission to offer customized programs to make it easier and more affordable for Illinoisans to train for careers in high-growth industries as outlined in Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, the State is deploying capital grants to strategically support the creation of additional MTAs and provide facility upgrades and equipment needed to train the next generation of manufacturing workers. These new advanced workforce training facilities will foster development in priority industries, such as advanced manufacturing, and clean energy production and manufacturing.

“Every community in Illinois deserves access to affordable education and job training.” said Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton. “These investments ensure people can build their lives here at home. As we continue to grow as a hub for manufacturing and innovation, we’re making sure our workforce grows with us—so Illinoisans can train for good-paying careers, support their families, and thrive, without ever having to leave the communities they love.”

Governor Pritzker has committed to growing Illinois’ world-class manufacturing industry, which continues to thrive because of strong state leadership and a commitment to fostering innovation, sustainability, and long-term economic competitiveness. This announcement builds upon recent success in the manufacturing industry as a growing list of manufacturers have chosen to expand or establish their business in Illinois, including Rockford Brake Manufacturing, Cache Energy, NANO Nuclear, and more.

“Since the program’s inception, Manufacturing Training Academies have been an important link between growing manufacturers and the skilled workforce they need, creating stronger ties between industry and community colleges to build new opportunities for people in those regions,” said DCEO Director Kristin Richards. “Guided by the principles in Illinois’ Economic Growth Plan, expanding the MTA program is a critical step to prepare Illinoisans for a successful future in priority industries.”

The MTA program was first envisioned in Illinois’ 2019 Economic Growth Plan, which led to DCEO providing two competitive awards to construct and equip MTA facilities in north central and southwestern Illinois. In February 2024, Heartland Community College in Normal, Illinois, opened a first-of-its-kind Electric Vehicle Energy Storage Manufacturing Training Academy in partnership with automotive manufacturer Rivian, with programs focused on robotics, HVAC, welding, digital media and electric vehicles. Five months later, grant funding enabled Southwestern Illinois College in Belleville, Illinois, to open doors to a 33,000-square-foot manufacturing education hub, which included expanding its offerings by launching additive manufacturing, tool and die mold-making and advanced automation/multi-axis computer numerical control certificates. Two additional awards were also made to Richland Community College and Kankakee Community College to offer training programs in clean energy manufacturing.

“Investments in skilled workforce training not only help fill a vital need for employers but also offer life-changing opportunities for students looking for a pathway to a good-paying job,” said Heartland Community College President Keith Cornille. “Manufacturing Training Academy grant funding supercharged the Heartland Community College effort to develop our leading-edge EV Technology program. We were able to leverage that funding to create facilities for a variety of advanced manufacturing training programs for high-demand job sectors. By strengthening our Career Technical Education programs, we’ve offered our students a pathway to a job, that can stack into a better job, and eventually a career.”

Eligible applicants include community colleges outside of Cook and the collar counties, excluding previous MTA awardees. Through this competitive NOFO, qualified entities can apply for grants from $3 million to $6 million. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until April 30, 2026, at 5:00 p.m. or until funds are exhausted. To view the NOFO and apply for the grant, please visit the DCEO website. Interested parties are encouraged to reach out to CEO.GrantHelp@illinois.gov for application assistance. DCEO will be hosting a technical assistance session on January 28, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. to provide assistance, answer questions, and provide information on becoming GATA pre-qualified.

“Illinois community colleges are uniquely positioned to help power the state’s manufacturing future,” said Brian Durham, Executive Director of the Illinois Community College Board. “Through programs like the Manufacturing Training Academies, we’re connecting education and industry to deliver hands-on, high-tech training that meets the evolving needs of employers and opening opportunities to well-paying careers for Illinois residents.”",https://chicagocrusader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Full-Sized-Single-Photo-63.png,N,,2026-01-07 03:58:10.029523

While vortex hydroelectric power is operational on a small scale in several countries, engineers have now unlocked its potential for large-scale hydrogeneration.
Challenges to vortex engineering There are challenges when trying to harness the power of large-scale vortexes.
Improving the efficiency of hydropower systems is essential to sustainably reducing greenhouse gases, and meeting the reliable, clean energy demands of the future.
Vortex engineering is an innovative solution that could pave the way for more efficient hydropower, leveraging natural forces to enhance energy output and contribute to a more sustainable power grid.","Among alternative energy solutions, wind, solar, and hydrogen capture the majority of attention. Yet the combined output from these sources pales in comparison to that of hydroelectric power. Producing more than 4,300 TWh worldwide, hydroelectricity produces enough energy every year to power the entire US – which consumed a record 4,070 TWh in 2022 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

However, for a number of countries, like those in North America and Europe, the energy generated by hydroelectric dams is limited for new locations. Even if there were suitable locations to build new dams, high costs and environmental concerns often become overriding factors limiting their expansion.

Yet the advantages of hydroelectric energy have led researchers to pursue practical ways to increase the efficiencies of the existing hydropower infrastructure.

As part of that research, engineers have been working to tap into the power of vortexes. Unlike a typical hydroelectric system where water is fed down through a penstock allowing gravity, force, and pressure to spin a wheel connected to a turbine. In a vortex hydroelectric system, the water is spun as it enters the top of the feedstock creating a very strong whirlpool that harnesses more than just gravitational force to produce abundant energy. In fact, depending on the design, engineers project hydro vortex turbines could be retrofitted onto existing hydroelectric systems, increasing output by at least 10%.

While vortex hydroelectric power is operational on a small scale in several countries, engineers have now unlocked its potential for large-scale hydrogeneration.

“Essentially what we first accomplished in Australia was to spin water in a cylinder as it came down river, similar to the water going down a drain, to create energy,” explains David Sattler, a vortex engineering expert who helped design and build the first small scale vortex hydropower systems. “However, what we are able to do now could be more aptly compared to harnessing the power of a tornado.”

The science behind vortex engineering

“Interestingly enough, engineers have worked really hard to eliminate vortexes within the hydroelectric power systems,” adds Sattler. “That’s what we were taught in engineering school, but having now figured out the math and physics, we are seeing a tremendous amount of available energy in utilizing the vortex.”

Sattler’s team at Marstecs – a company looking to help solve the energy challenges on Earth and beyond – has been able to boost the mass flow rate through the penstock by as much as 10%, increasing the amount of electricity the turbine can capture at the bottom of the system. At the same time, additional energy can also be captured at the top of the penstock, further amplifying the overall electrical output.

“We’ve found that beyond the mechanic energy driving a turbine, there is an enormous amount of power that we can tap into as the water is running down the penstock,” adds Sattler. “This comes from pulling the electrostatic power out of the air, or the atmosphere, like a controlled black hole on Earth.”

Hydro vortex turbines can be added to new hydroelectric stations as well as retrofitted onto existing units. New construction would allow for greater efficiencies, which Sattler believes could double or even triple the power output of a traditional hydroelectric power station.

Challenges to vortex engineering

There are challenges when trying to harness the power of large-scale vortexes. For example, in 1980 in Louisiana, a massive whirlpool was created on Lake Peigneur when a Texaco Oil miscalculation while drilling pierced a salt mine beneath the lake. The vortex was powerful enough to suck in 3.5 billion gallons of water along with 11 barges and one $5 million drilling platform. While nine of the barges later resurfaced like an “iron cork” the others have never been found.

“The power you can draw in from a vortex is potentially endless, but you need to be able to manage it. You need to be able to turn it on, turn it off, slow it down, or speed it up, and that’s all been figured out. So, it is safe as any other form of power generation,” concludes Sattler.

Pollution from gas stoves accounts for more than half of some Americans’ total exposure to nitrogen dioxide, a toxic substance linked to asthma, a study in the academic journal PNAS Nexus concludes. The findings, published last month, provide the first nationwide, community-level estimates of residential NO2 exposure.

The study assessed both outdoor air pollution and indoor emissions and determined that stoves were the primary source of indoor nitrogen dioxide pollution. Unlike gas furnaces or water heaters, stovetops lack direct ventilation. The devices typically rely on a hood above the stove, which does not capture all emissions, is not always used and, in some cases, recirculates air back into the living space.

“This tiny appliance punches way above its weight when compared with bigger emitters like road traffic and power plants,” said Yannai Kashtan, the study’s lead author and an air quality scientist at PSE Healthy Energy, a scientific research institute focusing on energy policy. He conducted the bulk of the study’s work during his time as a Stanford University graduate student.

Nitrogen dioxide is one of six “criteria air pollutants,” regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act; the reddish-brown gas is emitted by burning fuel. NO2 can irritate airways and aggravate respiratory diseases, particularly asthma, and can contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone or smog, according to the EPA.

For Americans who cook with gas or propane, stoves account for roughly one-quarter of the average person’s NO2 exposure. For those who use their stoves more often and for extended periods, indoor exposure can account for more than half of their total nitrogen dioxide exposure.

Kashtan and colleagues estimated the average NO2 exposure for each U.S. ZIP code. Their assessment included measurements they made of indoor NO2 emissions and concentrations in more than 15 cities. They then paired this information with outdoor nitrogen dioxide concentrations collected from sites across the country. The researchers also assessed housing stock data for 133 million apartments and homes, along with statistical samples of occupant behavior, including how often people used their stoves and opened their windows while cooking.

The group found that the total contribution of NO2 from stoves was highest in cities where people generally live in smaller spaces and where there is less room for NO2 to disperse.

Kashtan and colleagues estimate that the average total residential long-term NO2 exposure across the U.S. is 24 percent lower for people with electric stoves, which do not emit NO2.

The average American’s exposure to NO2 exceeds the World Health Organization’s recommended levels. However, approximately 22 million Americans would fall below the WHO-recommended limit if they stopped cooking with gas or cut back their use of it, Kashtan said.

Gas industry officials dismissed the findings. American Gas Association spokesperson Emily Ellis said the study “does not use any new data and also doesn’t produce any new epidemiological evidence linking gas stoves to asthma or other health outcomes.”

Kashtan emphasized that the study is the first to estimate the specific proportion of total NO2 exposure attributable solely to gas stoves, rather than to all sources of NO2 combined.

A 2023 report by the Climate Investigations Center, an environmental watchdog organization, and an investigation by National Public Radio found that the gas industry was aware of adverse health impacts from gas stoves as early as 1970. By 1972, the American Gas Association funded research that found no link between gas stoves and respiratory illness, the organization and news outlet noted.

The American Gas Association pushed back against what it described as “unsubstantiated claims about the health impacts of natural gas appliances” in a detailed response to NPR’s reporting.

“The available body of scientific research, including high-quality research and consensus health reviews conducted independently of industry, does not provide sufficient or consistent evidence demonstrating chronic health hazards from natural gas ranges,” Ellis said in a written statement provided to Inside Climate News. The AGA issued the same statement to NPR prior to publication of their 2023 report.

Ellis pointed to a 2024 study on stoves published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. That study, funded by the World Health Organization, “found no significant association between natural gas and asthma, wheeze, cough or breathlessness, and a lower risk of bronchitis when compared to electricity,” Ellis said in a written statement.

However, the same study also noted that “compared with electricity, use of gas significantly increased risk of pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.”

The American Medical Association warns that cooking with a gas stove increases the risk of childhood asthma and the American Public Health Association states that nitrogen dioxide emissions from gas stoves are a “public health concern.”

A study published last year by Kashtan and others suggests high gas stove usage without proper ventilation increases the risk of cancer due to emissions of benzene, a known carcinogen.

The American Gas Association states on its website that residential gas cooking appliances represent a “minor source” of NO2. “The principal source of indoor NO2 is polluted outdoor air that migrates indoors from vehicles and other sources,” the website states.

Kashten said he is confident in the research team’s ability to separate nitrogen dioxide from indoor and outdoor sources in their study and reiterated that for those who rely heavily on gas stoves for cooking, more than half of their nitrogen dioxide exposure comes from their stove.

Nathan Phillips, a professor in the Department of Earth & Environment at Boston University who was not involved in the study, said its findings were not surprising given the established connection between gas stove emissions and respiratory health.

“But the scale of the finding significantly helps end any remaining doubts about the broad health benefits of transitioning off gas – and other combustion sources that contribute to air pollution, indoor and out,” Phillips said.

Dylan Plummer, the Sierra Club’s acting deputy director for building electrification, agreed.

“Years from now, we will look back at the common practice of burning fossil fuels in our homes with horror,” Plummer said. “Regulators at the local, state and federal level must take action to adopt consumer protections in order to mitigate the risks posed by gas appliances.”

Some states have tried to address the problem.

Regulators in California are considering new guidelines for indoor air quality that would significantly lower the limits for nitrogen dioxide concentrations. Lawmakers in the state passed a bill in 2024 that would have required appliance manufacturers to place public health warning labels on new gas stoves. However, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill.

In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis signed a similar labeling requirement law for gas stoves in June. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers has filed a lawsuit challenging the law.

""This complicates the notion that the US would unambiguously 'win' from a Venezuelan oil revival.","Not all American energy companies stand to benefit from a potential revival of Venezuela's oil industry following the US's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Energy stocks rose on Monday as investors priced in potential gains from renewed US access to Venezuela's massive oil reserves. But analysts say smaller companies could struggle to benefit from a recovery in the country's energy sector.

Additional Venezuelan oil supply over the coming years could be ""negative for shale producers"" that don't have a footprint in Venezuela, Daan Struyven, the head of oil research at Goldman Sachs, said on the firm's ""Exchanges"" podcast, published on Tuesday.

That's because prices and volumes could come under pressure if supply growth over the next five to 10 years comes from Venezuela rather than from US shale, he added.

The potential strain on shale reflects a key difference in oil quality. Venezuelan crude is heavy and sulfur-rich, while US shale production is dominated by lighter oil. Many US Gulf Coast refineries were originally designed to process heavier crude, making Venezuelan barrels a better fit.

Greater access to Venezuelan crude could therefore benefit refiners while undermining demand for lighter shale barrels.

While light shale oil and heavy crude like Venezuela's are not directly interchangeable, increased supplies of heavy oil can still reshape refinery demand and pricing across the broader market. That kind of change would indirectly pressure US shale producers, who have long been the engine of America's shale revolution.

""In the US, the first casualties would likely be some oil producers, particularly smaller shale firms with high debt and thin margins,"" Philippe Le Billon, a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies the political economy of natural resources, wrote in The Conversation on Sunday.

Furthermore, oil prices have already been under pressure in recent years due to ample supply and sluggish demand growth.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude futures are trading around $56 a barrel, while Brent futures are around $60 a barrel. Both are down around 2% so far this year after falling 20% last year.

Even an increase in Venezuela's oil production in the medium term could put downward pressure on oil prices, making it harder for higher-cost US shale producers to justify new drilling, researchers at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy said in a Sunday post.

That dynamic could intensify the pressure on US shale producers.

It’s true of the Trump administration’s market interference in Indiana and Michigan.","The Trump administration is badly stretching the law to keep open coal-fired power plants throughout the Midwest that otherwise would have shuttered under well-thought-out, long-term strategies.

The latest examples are in neighboring Indiana, where the Department of Energy late last month ordered utilities not to close two aging power stations that otherwise would have been taken out of service by the end of last month. The orders mean that the Schahfer station in Wheatfield, Indiana, and the F.B. Culley station in Warrick County, Indiana, will remain open for 90 days.

If DOE’s previous actions in Michigan are a guide, where DOE saved a coal-fired plant about 35 miles east of Grand Rapids from closure beginning in May, those Indiana plants will likely get another 90-day reprieve after the current one expires and likely more such orders once the next 90 days pass by.

President Donald Trump long has supported the continued burning of coal to produce electricity despite risks to human health as well the emissions’ well-established contributions to Earth’s warming climate. At the same time, Trump recently acted to kill five large-scale wind farms already under construction in the Atlantic that are slated to generate enough power to serve 2.5 million household and business customers. Trump seems to detest wind power as much as he professes to love coal power.

In the case of the Michigan and Indiana coal plants, the Energy Department is ordering them kept alive under provisions of the Federal Power Act that are meant for reliability crises, such as those caused by natural disasters.

The Schahfer plant, located about 75 miles southeast of Chicago, was slated for closure years ago under a comprehensive plan put together by Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO), which serves much of the northern third of the state. While there are legitimate concerns throughout the Midwest about future reliability due to new data centers and their substantial power consumption, there is no looming emergency that justifies the administration’s action here.

Regional power-grid managers, in concert with utilities, have the ability to order plants on the chopping block to continue running if there are threats to reliability, and they use that authority from time to time. The Energy Department doesn’t get involved in those decisions ordinarily.

That’s how such decisions should continue to be made.

Heavy-handed government involvement in energy markets is not unique to Washington. We’ve seen governments at the state level, including in Illinois, get overly involved in determining the proper mix of power generation — usually to the detriment of ratepayers. Trump’s thumb on the scale to favor coal burners will have the same effect. After all, these plants were closing in part because they’re more expensive than other available energy sources. Ratepayers will shoulder that cost at a time when inflation and affordability are top public concerns.

Slowly but surely, the U.S. is moving in the direction of clean energy. With some exceptions, the market is doing a pretty good job of making that transition as cost effectively as possible. Government has a role to play — as a setter of environmental standards, for example — but shouldn’t be picking winners and losers.

It may help to compare the way the power grid works to a ride-sharing app, like Uber.
To protect the broader grid, MISO ordered a reduction in electricity demand in New Orleans.
Without MISO, Louisiana would lose crucial ties to a system designed to improve affordability and manage risk across a broader region.
The upcoming Risk Assessment will give Louisiana a roadmap to strengthen its grid and prevent future outages.","In 2026, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, will begin a South Load Pocket Risk Assessment focused on Louisiana. While the study may sound technical, it is relevant to the 10,000 New Orleanians who lost power for 3.5 hours during the May 25th “loadshed event” – the power outage that hit the city last year.

The risk assessment will help Louisiana address key questions around the loadshed event: why it happened, how to prevent future outages, and who is responsible for grid reliability in Louisiana.

MISO manages the flow of electricity across 15 states, including Louisiana. Its job is to balance the supply and demand of electricity in real time, help manage congestion on transmission lines, and prevent large-scale outages. In simple terms, MISO allows utilities like Entergy New Orleans to buy and sell power across state lines so that electricity can be delivered to where it is needed most.

This regional coordination matters in Louisiana, which imports about 14% of its electricity from neighboring states. Without grid access, utilities would need to build and maintain more local power generators, which would raise costs for customers.

It may help to compare the way the power grid works to a ride-sharing app, like Uber. During peak times, when supply is limited and demand surges, prices rise quickly. An interconnected regional grid helps avoid those spikes by increasing access to supply from other states. That improves reliability and stabilizes costs.

The May 25th outage was linked to what we call “load pockets” – areas where electricity demand is high but transmission of outside energy into the area is constrained. For New Orleans in May, those constraints meant that even though power was available on the grid elsewhere, it could not be delivered fast enough to the city, where it was needed most.

If demand exceeds supply, it can cause cascading failures of power plants and other equipment, leading to a more serious grid failure. To protect the broader grid, MISO ordered a reduction in electricity demand in New Orleans. This is known as a loadshed event.

Load pockets in Louisiana are not new. They are the result of an under-developed electric grid, and they existed long before Entergy New Orleans and other Louisiana utilities joined MISO in 2013. Several years before that, in 2006, Entergy had identified the need for transmission upgrades to address its clear constraints.

That is why the Load Pocket Risk Assessment is so important. Once it begins later this year, the study will evaluate remaining transmission limitations and the increased risks that come with rising demand and extreme weather. After analysts identify problems, they will move to proposing solutions to improve reliability across southern Louisiana.

A well-planned regional grid protects against load-shed events and also delivers vital economic benefits. Modern transmission systems reduce congestion costs, support industrial growth, and attract investment by providing reliable and affordable power.

Delays in that work have the opposite effect. Research consistently shows that delaying transmission development increases long-term costs for consumers and limits economic opportunity.

This work also comes at a critical moment: Louisiana’s economy and public safety are increasingly dependent on reliable electricity, from hospitals and ports to data centers and emergency response. Grid Strategies predicts that electricity use will grow 5.7% annually over the next five years, driven by data centers, an increase in manufacturing, and electrification of industrial processes and manufacturing.

Extreme temperatures and stronger storms are also placing greater strain on our aging electric grid.

We also need coordinated planning to prepare for the addition of new renewable energy resources – including wind and solar – that are coming to Louisiana and are now the lowest-cost technology for bringing new electricity to the grid in the next five years. Planning for these realities requires tangible, long-term coordination and transparency, not short-term reactions after outages occur.

Some policymakers have suggested that Louisiana should leave MISO following the May load shed event. That’s not the solution.

Without MISO, Louisiana would lose crucial ties to a system designed to improve affordability and manage risk across a broader region. More importantly, leaving now would halt valuable progress just as MISO begins its study aimed directly at addressing South Louisiana’s grid challenges.

Yet, in his Nov. 24 opinion, “Time for Connecticut to rethink its climate strategies,” Noah Kaufman includes this quote: “The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas but in escaping from old ones. ” The opinion’s subtitle, “A lot has changed in climate policy over the last few years — meriting a new path,” tips off the reader to the “old is new, up is down” nature of his essay.

Kaufman’s “new idea” is for Connecticut to be less ambitious in its climate strategies and goals that are described in the Governor’s 2021 Executive Order but are now, apparently, an “old idea.” It’s hard to believe that plans laid out less than five years ago are old. But the approach becomes clearer in Kaufman’s statements: “Under Trump, the U.S. is retreating from domestic decarbonization and actively undermining global efforts,” and Connecticut should “recalibrate its goals to better align with today’s economic and political realities.”

In other words, retreat from the path forward because it has encountered bumps in the road. Instead, Kaufman recommends that Connecticut stick with the actual old and familiar habit of using fossil fuels no matter how sick they make us (cancer, asthma, worsening of other respiratory diseases) and what the cost (destruction of forests and wildlife, pipeline leaks, increased cost of natural gas).

Should Connecticut, along with Rhode Island, have accepted the stop-work order from the Trump administration for the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt wind farm, even though the project was fully permitted and 80 percent complete? Would the loss of wind energy and all the construction and operating jobs have been a wise decision? Does Kaufman disagree with the state’s evaluation that “Strategic investment in our port assets, a history of advanced manufacturing, innovative technology and research and development capabilities, have uniquely positioned Connecticut to serve as a first-mover in this new industry, already serving as a launchpad for three offshore wind projects supporting three states?”

No, to Connecticut’s credit (for example), it didn’t fall for Trump’s “I hate wind,” approach and instead pursued and won a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project. Work resumed on September 22, and the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not appeal the restart. Connecticut refusing to bow to today’s supposed economic and political realities. On December 22, the Trump administration again halted construction of the project, along with pauses against four other offshore wind farms on the East Coast, for the reported purpose of evaluating national security concerns.

Once again, Connecticut is fighting back. The governors of Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island “are demanding either a briefing on purported security threats or an immediate lifting of stop work orders on five offshore wind projects under construction, including the Revolution Wind project.” In addition, Attorney General William Tong released a statement objecting to the stop work order and declaring that, “We are evaluating all legal options, and this will be stopped just like last time.” These actions show what the “new idea” really is – for Connecticut to be bold and courageous in pursuing a clean energy future.

The state should move rapidly to adopt other clean technologies that are being aggressively pursued by other states, such as solar in many forms, solar plus battery storage and geothermal networks. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that solar is expected to contribute more than half of new electric generating capacity planned for 2025, with battery storage accounting for almost 20% of the remaining capacity additions. These increases reported year over year will build the solar and battery capacity quickly.

Connecticut should also move promptly to build its geothermal network capacity. Connecticut has been cautious and slow to move forward with geothermal networks, which are considered one of the most efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. Our neighboring states are ahead of us, and we can learn from their experiences. In fact, even in “today’s economic and political realities,” Massachusetts and New York are moving forward on several geothermal projects. The nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network in Framingham, MA, whose first section was completed in 2024, recently announced that an $8.6 million grant from the US Department of Energy will provide funding for the network to double in size. A Boston-based nonprofit is the lead recipient of the funding, and Eversource and the city of Framingham are co-recipients.

Connecticut should also move rapidly from “studying” solar canopies (required by 2025 legislation) to building them. Tremendous capacity is available on parking lots and other usable spaces near transmission connections. Solar canopies can provide other benefits such as battery storage, reducing heat islands, protecting cars, and directing the flow of rainwater.

So yes, we should be clear about what are “new” ideas and what are “old” ideas, and we should work hard to develop the true new ideas for clean and renewable energy instead of backsliding on our climate goals and commitments.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap-offshore-wind-portland.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:58:27.186533

The department reported that, over its lifetime, the program would reduce 7.5 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions. Only it won’t. It’ll only reduce 78,000 tons of emissions. The department blamed a clerical error for the vastly different numbers.

“We made an error in reporting data for this program. The Climate Commitment Act is a vital part of the state’s efforts to control carbon emissions, and we’re committed to ensuring that the information we share is complete and accurate,” Jennifer Grove, assistant director of Energy for Commerce, said in a statement.

She said they’ve taken “corrective measures” to prevent future mistakes.

The incorrect information was submitted to the Washington State Department of Ecology, which puts together an annual report for the state legislature on how state agencies are spending the more than $1.5 billion raised through the CCA. The money is meant to support programs that reduce carbon emissions in order to combat climate change.

Data is compiled from more than 3,600 projects by 37 agencies.

“We’re updating our processes to more thoroughly check data reported by agencies so this doesn’t happen again,” Joel Creswell, manager of Ecology’s Climate Pollution Reduction program, said.

Ecology now reviewing all agency data

To that end, he said agencies plan to report greenhouse gas reductions through an online tool to reduce the potential for human error.

Since the error came to light, Ecology said it has been conducting a full review of all the data submitted and will issue a corrected report in the coming weeks.

The Washington State Legislature passed the CCA in 2021. It requires businesses that generate greenhouse gas emissions to buy credits to offset the pollution that they generate. Money raised by the purchase of credits — or allowances — is meant to be invested in programs that reduce fossil fuel pollution.

Representing the most prolific oil- and gas-producing region in the country, Rep. Pfluger knows firsthand that energy security is national security. In his piece, he warns that the Biden administration's unprecedented drawdown of the SPR has left America's emergency crude oil stockpile running on fumes, leaving the nation exposed to global instability and sudden supply shocks.

With oil prices projected to remain relatively low through 2026 and geopolitical tensions escalating worldwide, Rep. Pfluger argues that Congress has a narrow but critical window to act. Kicking the can down the road, he cautions, would squander an opportunity to replenish the reserve at a discount and risks leaving the nation vulnerable when the next global crisis inevitably strikes. As Rep. Pfluger writes, “Congress must build on the momentum from the WFTC and prioritize appropriating the necessary funds to fully replenish the SPR now– not after the next global disruption drives prices up or exposes a crippling vulnerability.”

The op-ed comes as Republicans outline their 2026 priorities. After making historic progress toward restoring American energy dominance in 2025, Rep. Pfluger argues the path forward is clear: refilling the SPR is a no-brainer.

Refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now, before it’s too late

By Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11)

Following the 1970s oil crisis, Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) as America’s insurance policy against global energy supply disruptions. For nearly half a century, this emergency crude oil stockpile has served as an indispensable safeguard – ready to cushion the blow from unexpected market shocks, natural disasters, or geopolitical conflicts.

Today, however, this vital insurance policy is running on fumes. At just 409 million barrels, the SPR is at its lowest level since its inception, with less than 60% of its capacity currently being utilized.

This depletion stems largely from the Biden administration’s unprecedented drawdown of more than 290 million barrels in 2022 in an attempt to ease high gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the move temporarily worked, it was the largest drawdown in the reserve’s history and came with no viable plan to replace what was taken.

Three years later, the SPR remains dangerously depleted, and now the structural integrity of the salt caverns that protect the remaining barrels is at serious risk.

Fortunately, there is a clear solution, and Washington must act on it.

Now it's lawmakers' move","Paul Specht, WRAL state government",,,,,https://www.wral.com/news/nccapitol/cutting-8000-vacant-state-jobs-save-millions-nc-jan-2026/,"Those empty seats vacant jobs are valued at a combined $1.04 billion for state agencies, he said.
He referred them to an interactive database on the auditor’s website that provides details of each agency’s vacant positions.
The auditor’s office identified 5,275 positions vacant for one year or more; 2,945 positions vacant for two years or more; and 1,377 positions vacant for three years or more.
In total, the auditor’s office identified 746 positions that state agencies acknowledged having no intent to fill.
The auditor’s office calculated salary information using definitions outlined by the Office of State Budget and Management, he said.","North Carolina could free up hundreds of millions of dollars by eliminating state government jobs that have been vacant for six months or more, State Auditor Dave Boliek told legislators Tuesday. But lawmakers should be judicious in which job — if any — they choose to cut, he said.

Legislators last year tasked Boliek’s office with assessing the employment needs of each state agency and identifying positions that could be cut — a program similar to the federal department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Such savings could be redirected to other priorities throughout the state or help fund planned tax cuts.

Boliek’s team — the Division of Accountability, Value, and Efficiency, or DAVE — has reviewed employment records of 46 state agencies and presented its findings to a legislative oversight committee on Tuesday.

Nearly 9,000 of the state’s 79,800 positions — about 11% of the state government workforce — had been vacant for six months or longer as of August, Boliek told lawmakers. Those empty seats vacant jobs are valued at a combined $1.04 billion for state agencies, he said.

Boliek advised lawmakers to consider each agency’s needs before implementing any cuts. He referred them to an interactive database on the auditor’s website that provides details of each agency’s vacant positions.

“I would recommend not making too generalized conclusions” about the vacancies, Boliek said.

He also encouraged lawmakers to consider each job’s potential benefit to the state.

“There are likely — and should be — deliberations from this body across state government of where adding full time employees delivers return-on-investment to the state of North Carolina,” Boliek said.

Some agencies want to fill their vacant jobs but struggle to compete for potential employees because the state-offered salaries are low, Boliek said. Some are slow to hire new employees because the hiring process is too lengthy or cumbersome, he said.

Agencies have also struggled to compete with the private sector for talented employees.

Some agencies are intentionally keeping jobs vacant and using the unused salaries for operational purposes, said Jared Cronk, director of performance audits in the auditor’s office.

“The way that these state agencies are using lapsed salaries provides a great opportunity for state agency budgets to be reviewed … to determine the actual expenditures necessary for them to perform and provide their services,” Cronk said.

The auditor’s office identified 5,275 positions vacant for one year or more; 2,945 positions vacant for two years or more; and 1,377 positions vacant for three years or more. In total, the auditor’s office identified 746 positions that state agencies acknowledged having no intent to fill.

Boliek’s report comes as legislators are at a stalemate over state spending. Republicans control both the state Senate and state House of Representatives, but haven’t passed a comprehensive state budget for the current fiscal year.

The Senate’s budget proposal would pay for new tax cuts in part by slashing a variety of government services and jobs.

Republican legislative leaders have presented competing proposals for funding major projects, changing future tax rates, and boosting state employee pay. Legislators can use the auditor’s report as a resource in the budget-writing process, Boliek said.

Gov. Josh Stein’s office cast doubt on the auditor’s findings, saying the total value of the vacant positions doesn’t add up to $1.04 billion.

Seth Dearmin, Stein’s chief of staff, said in a letter to Boliek that $246 million in lapsed salary reported by the auditor comes from “854 unfunded placeholder positions that have never generated lapsed salary.” Another $47 million in lapsed salaries reported by Boliek comes from federal and receipt-funded positions “that do not generate lapsed salary.”

“We welcome opportunities to engage in a constructive and meaningful dialogue regarding appropriations and budgetary processes that improve the way state government serves North Carolinians,” Dearmin said in the letter. “However, the analysis shared in the draft report and public dashboard released on December 30, 2025, is inaccurate in its accounting of long-term vacancies and lapsed salary, undermining the credibility of its conclusions.”

Randy Brechbiel, communications director for the auditor’s office, told WRAL there’s nothing misleading or inaccurate about the office’s findings. The auditor’s office calculated salary information using definitions outlined by the Office of State Budget and Management, he said.",https://images.wral.com/51712c05-4a25-4c41-b121-3d40a07f7bd4?w=1200&h=630,N,,2026-01-07 02:58:32.487481

Geely's communications chief says the company will announce the U.S. entry of Zeekr and Lynk & Co within the next three years.

The company brought several vehicles to CES 2026 and hinted that they could be locally manufactured.

Zeekr and Lynk & Co vehicles could be produced at the Volvo factory in South Carolina.

The Chinese carmaking giant Geely Group is already present in the United States with its Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus brands, but it’s looking to expand its presence in the near future. The company was present at CES 2026 with models from some of its other brands for journalists to examine, hinting that they could be offered here in the future.

In an interview with Autoline Network, Geely's global communication boss Ash Sutcliffe reiterated that the group is always looking at expanding into new global markets, including the United States. And in the next few years as well, if all goes according to plan.

""The big question for us is when, and where will we go to the USA,"" Sutcliffe said. ""I think we'll have an announcement on that in the next 24 to 36 months.""

He didn't give too much away, but said that Zeekr and Lynk & Co would be a good fit for the market—something we have also felt at InsideEVs testing those brands' SUVs, sedans and crossovers in both Europe and China.

Some of the models brought to Las Vegas include the Zeekr 7X and Lynk & Co 08 midsize plug-in crossovers, which we’ve tested in Europe and were very impressed with. The former is an 800-volt EV with 400 kW charging and the latter (which is closely related to the Volvo XC70) is a big-battery plug-in hybrid with an electric range of up to 124 miles (200 km).

They are both class-leading vehicles in many respects and are already popular in Europe, but tariffs will prevent Geely from importing them into the U.S., as both are built in China. Sutcliffe suggested they could be assembled locally and pointed to the Volvo plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, as a likely location for their construction on U.S. soil.

The facility, which saw a $1.3 billion investment over the last 10 years to become a North American manufacturing hub for plug-in Volvos, currently assembles the Volvo EX90 and Polestar 3 for the U.S. market. It will also begin production of the Volvo XC60 toward the end of the year.

Geely sold just over 3 million vehicles in 2025, which met its expectation for last year. The plan is to sell 3.45 million vehicles this year, most of which will wear a Geely badge. The global targets for Lynk&Co and Zeekr in 2026 are 400,000 and 300,000 units, respectively.

The company also had the Geely EX5 electric crossover in Las Vegas, but Sutcliffe didn't mention any plans to bring that more mainstream brand to the States. It clearly wants to maintain a more premium presence here, and given that it is already present in the country through its Volvo subsidiary, bringing in additional brands shouldn't be too difficult, especially since their vehicles are built on common platforms already being built in America.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jkZ8IlliWwHxKlVycQQZMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/insideevs_articles_320/d48d237959d34a73b0c79d07e96cc7ca,N,,2026-01-07 08:58:42.767780

SCOTUS Quick Hits

The court’s January argument session will begin on Monday, Jan. 12. The court will hear seven arguments over two weeks, including on transgender athletes; the latest chapter in the court’s gun rights jurisprudence; and President Donald Trump’s bid to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors.

Morning Reads

Louisiana will use challenged congressional map after Supreme Court declines to expedite ruling (Piper Hutchinson, Louisiana Illuminator) — After the Supreme Court announced in June that it would hear a second round of arguments on Louisiana’s challenged congressional map, the state pushed back its election deadlines in hopes of having enough time to redistrict after the court released its decision. Nearly three months after hearing argument in October, the court still hasn’t ruled, and Louisiana now plans to use its “existing six congressional districts … for the 2026 midterm election,” according to the Louisiana Illuminator.

US abortion pill access under fire: Lawsuits and regulatory battles to watch in 2026 (Daniel Wiessner, Reuters) — The Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion has driven “a surge in medication abortion” and “a new wave of legal battles” over access to abortion drugs, according to Reuters. “Six Republican-led U.S. states in three separate pending lawsuits are seeking to curb access to mifepristone, the first of two pills used for medication abortion in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.” Disputes are also developing over whether Republican-led states can prosecute doctors in other states for providing abortion drugs by mail.

Supreme Court Increasingly Favors the Rich, Economists Say (Adam Liptak, The New York Times)(Paywall) — A new study “from economists at Yale and Columbia contends … that a good way to guess the outcome of a [Supreme Court] case is to follow the money,” according to The New York Times. Researchers concluded that the court rules in favor of wealthy parties more often today than it did in the past and that there’s “a growing partisan divide between the justices.” In decisions from 1953, according to the study, “Democratic and Republican appointees are statistically indistinguishable, deciding on average about 45 percent of the cases in favor of the rich.” But by 2022, “that share is about 70 percent for the average Republican justice and 35 percent for the average Democratic justice.” “Legal scholars had mixed reactions” to the study, per the Times, with some arguing that cases had been mischaracterized.

Who is the Chief Justice’s Audience? (Steve Vladeck, One First) — In a post for his Substack, Steve Vladeck reflected on Chief Justice John Roberts’ latest year-end report, considering why Roberts chose not to directly confront recent attacks on judicial independence and to, instead, only subtly reference them. “[I]t seems fair to describe 2025 as a year of unprecedented assaults on the very constitutional structure and judicial independence the Chief Justice appears to be so invested in publicly defending. Against that backdrop, the fact that his year-end report doesn’t even indirectly allude to any of those assaults … is, frankly, inexcusable,” Vladeck argued.

Supreme Court’s 2026 rulings could define America for decades to come (Ilya Shapiro, Fox News) — In a column for Fox News, Ilya Shapiro previewed upcoming cases on “equal protection, executive power and even the meaning of citizenship itself,” contending that decisions released in the next six months “will shape the legal and political landscape for years to come.” “Taken together,” Shapiro wrote, “the Supreme Court’s upcoming work reflects a federal judiciary charged with resolving the hardest questions of our constitutional order.”

A Closer Look: The Supreme Court’s “Customer Service” Ratings

While here at SCOTUSblog we analyze and explain the court’s rulings, a different (and somewhat less weighty) analysis of the court is happening across the internet. From the pages of Yelp to Google Maps, the court is treated like any other “business” … and its “customers” are, at times, rather displeased. We decided to dig in and see what, if anything, this tells us.

1. The Yelp Perspective: “Favorite building in D.C.”

The Yelp page for the Supreme Court (which we briefly mentioned in our closer look about courtroom lectures) often reads more like a political protest than anything else. With the court averaging a 4.3 out of 5 star rating, reviews typically fall into three categories:

Organizational praises: Some laud the experience of being inside SCOTUS, from the self-guided tours to docent lectures and oral arguments (“DC’s version of gladiator matches”) to the building’s architecture. One added bonus, per reviews: the court doesn’t require tickets, so it’s a “great place to visit on a whim when you have some free time.” Some offer advice such as getting in line around 5 a.m. to secure a spot prior to an oral argument. One self-proclaimed SCOTUS nerd said although she doesn’t agree with all the court’s decisions, she was “smiling like an idiot and got goosebumps standing in front of the Supreme Court building.”

Organizational critiques: Others negatively rate their experience at the court, complaining about the security lines, windowless cafeteria seating, and the unfriendly “bouncers” (aka members of the Supreme Court of the United States Police Department, who will – reportedly – yell at you if you’re on the back steps and not exiting). Another cited the issue that 1) there is no food or water allowed in the building and 2) the alternative, water in the cafeteria, is “overpriced.” “Given the shape of the court,” one individual wrote, the view “from anywhere but the front is not that great … unless you happen to be a member of the Supreme Court Bar, you can’t have the best seats.”

Institutional critiques: Users also have used the star system to “vote” on recent rulings, providing comments like “all 9 should be ashamed of themselves … it is politically biased.” One person recommended firing all the justices, while another suggested term limits. Another commented “there exists no enforcement of ethics violations in the Supreme Court or even an appearance of one, as in Congress.”

2. Google Maps: Subpar “Customer Service”

On Google Maps, the court holds a 4.2 star rating. Many folks have strong negative feelings about their experience at the court. However, the architecture frequently boosts the overall score, with several users admitting the building is 5-stars even if the “service” is subpar. That said, the definition of service can be awfully broad (“Service is terrible — they only have 9 staff to make decisions for the whole country.”)

Some claims are also fairly hard to verify: one person states he was “first here in 1977 and met with William Rhenquist [sic] in chambers. He kept falling asleep.”

3. Glassdoor: The “Corporate” Grind

For a more “internal” review, the court’s Glassdoor profile (as an employer) offers a unique glimpse into the court as a workplace, with the rating sitting at 4.1 stars and 86% willing to “recommend [working there] to a friend.” The titles aren’t exactly right, with the “about” section listing “John G. Roberts, Jr.” as the “CEO” (though with a 100% approval score!).

Pros: “Individual justices are friendly,” and “Great Staff – Honest Hardworking People.”

Cons: Reviews often highlight the pressure and long hours, with some noting the “very hierarchical structure,” and that the job “requires use of literal rubber stamps.” One review by a purported law clerk reads simply: “Hard work lots of reading.”

The Bottom Line: If you’re looking for a deep dive into Chevron deference, go to SCOTUSblog. But if you want to know if the grilled cheese is worth the 40-minute security line, the above sites may be the place to look.

“It is the nature of the human mind to press a favourite hypothesis too far.”

— Delivers rapid, durable responses in wAIHA, the more common form of this potentially life-threatening disease —

HONG KONG and SHANGHAI and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Jan. 07, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“ HUTCHMED ”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) today announces that the Phase III registration part of the ESLIM-02 clinical trial of sovleplenib, a novel spleen tyrosine kinase (“Syk”) inhibitor, in adult patients with warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (“wAIHA”) in China has met its primary endpoint of durable hemoglobin (Hb) response rate within weeks 5 to 24 of treatment.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (“AIHA”) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (“RBCs”) due to the production of antibodies against RBC. The incidence of AIHA is estimated to be 0.8-3.0/100,000 adults per year with an estimated prevalence of 17 per 100,000 adults and a death rate of 8-11%. 1 , 2 wAIHA is the most common form of AIHA, 3 accounting for about 75-80% of all adult AIHA cases. 4

ESLIM-02 is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled China Phase II/III study in adult patients with primary or secondary wAIHA who had relapsed or were refractory to at least one prior line of standard treatment. Results from the Phase II part of the study published in The Lancet Haematology in January 2025 demonstrated encouraging hemoglobin benefit compared with placebo, with overall response rate of 43.8% vs 0% in the first 8 weeks, and overall response rate of 66.7% during the 24 weeks of sovleplenib treatment (including patients that crossed over from placebo) with a favorable safety profile. 5 Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov , using identifier NCT05535933 .

Professor Fengkui Zhang of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Blood Diseases Hospital , and one of the leading principal investigators of the ESLIM-02 study, said: “Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia is a highly heterogeneous and often chronically relapsing disease. Patients often experience symptoms like fatigue significantly impacting patients’ quality of life. In severe cases, the disease can become life-threatening if not managed effectively. The positive topline results from ESLIM-02 highlight sovleplenib's potential to deliver rapid and durable hemoglobin responses in wAIHA patients who have limited options after failing standard therapies. This could represent a meaningful advancement for managing this challenging condition.”

Professor Bin Han of Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Professor Lianshan Zhang of The Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were also co-leading Principal Investigators of the study. Full results of the ESLIM-02 study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference. HUTCHMED plans to submit the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for sovleplenib for wAIHA to the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in the first half of 2026.

About Sovleplenib and wAIHA

Sovleplenib is a novel, investigational, selective small molecule inhibitor for oral administration targeting the spleen tyrosine kinase, also known as Syk. Syk is a major component in B-cell receptor and Fc receptor signaling and is an established target for the treatment of multiple subtypes of B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune disorders.

The accelerated clearance of antibody-coated RBCs by immunoglobulin Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) bearing macrophages is thought to be the pathogenic mechanism in wAIHA. 6 Activated Syk mediates downstream signaling of the activated Fc receptors in phagocytic cells, resulting in phagocytosis of RBCs. 7 In addition, activation of Syk through the B-cell receptor mediates activation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes into antibody secreting plasma cells. 8 Inhibition of Syk may have potential effects in the treatment of wAIHA through inhibition of phagocytosis and reduction of antibody production.

In addition to wAIHA, sovleplenib is also being studied in immune thrombocytopenia (“ITP”). Positive results from ESLIM-01 (NCT05029635), a Phase III trial in China of sovleplenib in patients with primary ITP, have been published in The Lancet Haematology . An NDA resubmission for sovleplenib for second-line ITP is planned in the first half of 2026.

HUTCHMED currently retains all rights to sovleplenib worldwide.

Today’s package is the second step forward in finishing our twelve funding bills for fiscal year 2026.
In November, we enacted into law our first three-bill package.
With passage of these three measures, we will have full-year funding in place for many of our most crucial programs.","Chairwoman Foxx, Ranking Member McGovern, and esteemed members of the Rules Committee, I thank you for your warm welcome and your kind invitation to testify today.

I appear before you today on H.R. 6938, a three-bill package covering the Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment appropriations measures for fiscal year 2026.

Today’s bills are the result of a bipartisan and bicameral negotiation. As such, they are a compromise product, with buy-in from members of both parties and in both chambers of Congress. The Appropriations Committee has long sought to operate in a bipartisan and collaborative manner, and with today’s package, we fulfill that longstanding commitment. The end result is a reminder for us all that consensus – not partisan obstruction – is not only possible, it is preferable.

Today’s package is the second step forward in finishing our twelve funding bills for fiscal year 2026. In November, we enacted into law our first three-bill package. Today, we build on the momentum of what we accomplished then. In the coming weeks, I look forward to appearing before you again on additional packages, with the goal of completing all fiscal year 2026 funding by the January 30 deadline.

With passage of these three measures, we will have full-year funding in place for many of our most crucial programs. The Department of Justice will be able to fulfill its important mission protecting Americans from wrongdoers, including combating illicit drugs like the scourge of fentanyl. We prioritize American energy dominance and safeguarding critical mineral resources. National parks will be open and operating, and essential wildfire protection programs will remain in place. Other vital public safety programs like the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, will likewise continue to serve the American people. The Army Corps of Engineers will continue its important work of water development and flood control, as will the Department of Energy’s critical programs, including maintenance of our nuclear weapons stockpile.

I could go on and on, but I think the Committee sees the point: this three-bill package provides funding for countless critical programs that assist Americans every single day of the year. All three measures also include member-requested community project funding, ensuring that Congress maintains control over the power of the purse, and allowing members and communities to address their most pressing needs.

Perhaps what is most important is what this package does not do. In moving this process forward, we avoided an omnibus spending package at the Christmas holidays, an outcome that was a high priority for many members, including myself. And we accomplished this by negotiating these bills at the committee level, thereby taking another strong step toward returning the appropriations process to regular order.

I thank each of you for your time – and look forward to your questions today.",https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/appropriations.house.gov/files/favicon_1.ico,N,,2026-01-06 20:59:25.995946

Supreme Court dismisses appeals to revive RGGI carbon credit program,"Peter Hall, Kiley Bense, Inside Climate News",,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/pa-supreme-court-dismisses-appeals-to-revive-rggi-carbon-credit-program/,"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday ended appeals of a lower court’s ruling that the commonwealth’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was illegal.
It also came more than six months after the state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.
The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction.
Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution.
It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.","The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday ended appeals of a lower court’s ruling that the commonwealth’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was illegal.

The court’s order dismissing the cases as moot follows Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s agreement to withdraw from the multi-state climate compact as part of his deal with Republican state lawmakers to bring the five-month budget stalemate to a close in November.

It also came more than six months after the state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.

While many who opposed the program said it would drive up energy costs and constitute a drag on the economy, environmentalists argued a well-designed carbon cap program would reduce climate warming emissions while generating billions of dollars for the commonwealth.

The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction. Money from the credits is invested in sustainable energy projects in the states.

Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution.

They claimed Gov. Tom Wolf overstepped his executive authority by entering into the agreement without approval from the General Assembly and the cost of carbon credits constituted an illegal tax.

Siding with challengers, the Commonwealth Court ruled in November 2023 that to pass constitutional muster, Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI “may only be achieved through legislation duly enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.”

In a series of eight orders, the Supreme Court dismissed appeals by Constellation Energy, Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club. It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.

The commonwealth entered the compact during Wolf’s administration in April 2022 when the final regulation was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as required by state law.

Pennsylvania joined neighboring states New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware in RGGI more than three years after the regulatory process first began and after considerable bipartisan pushback from opponents who said Wolf’s decision to join the multi-state agreement was an example of executive overreach.

In arguments before the seven-member Supreme Court last spring, environmental groups argued the state constitution guarantees the protection of public resources including clean air and that the DEP’s plan to limit carbon emissions is constitutional because it is part of its program to protect the public’s environmental rights.

“Air is a public trust resource, and the department and other trustees have to act to protect it,” Jessica O’Neil, who represented Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AES_PETERSBURG1-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 20:59:49.208765

“I sat at this very seat in August of ’23 asking the General Assembly for help,” said Marshall.
“We’ve consistently communicated to the General Assembly leadership the need for additional staff positions.
State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, a Republican, joined Marshall in criticizing the failure of lawmakers to address the state’s budgetary needs.
The governor noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in per-pupil spending and 50th in the country in terms of funding effort of K-12 education.","Members of the North Carolina Council of State kicked off the new year with a direct message for the General Assembly: Finalize the budget and properly fund state agencies.

Leaders in the House and Senate could not agree on a general operating budget in 2025. With the chambers divided over the state’s planned income tax cuts and how much to increase pay for state workers and teachers, they left town with negotiations in a holding pattern until this year’s short session.

In the meantime, much of state government has been running on a continuation of the 2024 budget. Republican legislative leaders say that level of funding is adequate, but agency heads on both sides of the aisle disagree.

Democratic Secretary of State Elaine Marshall told the governor and other members of the council that more than 172,000 new businesses were created in North Carolina last year, nearly 10,000 more than in 2024.

While the growth has been remarkable, Marshall said on Tuesday, it was disappointing that her calls for additional personnel within the agency have fallen on deaf ears at the legislature.

“I sat at this very seat in August of ’23 asking the General Assembly for help,” said Marshall. “Two years later, that help has still not come. This is now our second year without a new state budget.”

The workload at the Secretary of State’s office has essentially doubled since 2017, yet staffing levels have remained largely unchanged, Marshall said. The agency has implemented technology improvements to manage a flood of new filings, but technology alone cannot solve every issue.

“People are essential,” said Marshall.

But Marshall said her employees are the second lowest paid employees in state government.

“We’ve consistently communicated to the General Assembly leadership the need for additional staff positions. While there’s growing awareness on Jones Street, the reality remains that there has been no budget,” she said.

State Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, a Republican, joined Marshall in criticizing the failure of lawmakers to address the state’s budgetary needs.

Causey said his department’s team of 50 criminal investigators was called to investigate more than 7,600 cases of possible insurance fraud in 2025.

“Last year, these teams made 380 arrests,” said Causey. “We’re still only scratching the surface when it comes to fighting fraud.”

From 2017 to 2025, the Department of Insurance recovered over $76.6 million for people who were victimized by insurance fraud, according to the commissioner.

“I don’t think there’s an agency here that couldn’t use more staffing,” said Causey. “But both the Senate and the House, when they came out with their proposed budgets, were asking us as a self-funded agency to cut 20 positions or $2 million from our budget at a time when we need to be adding that many [positions] or more.”

Governor Josh Stein empathized with both agency heads and echoed their call for state legislators to get moving and pass a comprehensive budget that should have been in place last July.

“We have public safety officers who are not paid well. We have teachers who are earning less money on a real basis today than they were a year ago,” lamented Stein.

In this edition, we highlight the people, partnerships, and places shaping the next chapter of economic growth across Southeast Louisiana, from workforce pipelines and inclusive entrepreneurship to regional competitiveness and community leadership.

We begin with a look at the Greater New Orleans Infrastructure Partnership, a landmark effort aligning community colleges, employers, and public partners to prepare residents for high-demand infrastructure careers. Backed by a U.S. Department of Labor grant, this initiative is building coordinated, employer-driven pathways into construction, energy, manufacturing, transportation, and emerging fields like electric vehicle technology.

Turning to the Northshore, we explore how St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, and Washington parishes are translating sustained population growth into targeted economic development. With major investments like Niagara Bottling and ChillCo, long-range planning through THRIVE2029, and a sharpened focus on site readiness, the Northshore continues to strengthen its industrial base while protecting quality of life.

We also take a closer look at Startup Noir NOLA, an initiative created to ensure Black founders are showcased as a driving force behind the region’s growing innovation economy. Through investor tours, founder convenings, and community-building programs, Startup Noir NOLA is working to expand access to capital and customers while positioning New Orleans as a national model for Black innovation.

This issue also features two profiles that humanize the region’s progress. We meet Allison Hotard, Executive Director of the Young Leadership Council, whose journey reflects the power of civic engagement and the importance of cultivating the next generation of leaders. We also profile Delta Administrative Services, a family-driven company redefining HR by pairing operational expertise with a deep commitment to people, culture, and community impact.

Startup Noir NOLA works alongside partners such as The Idea Village, Louisiana Economic Development, Corridor Ventures, Camelback Ventures, and JPMorgan Chase.
Startup Noir NOLA seeks to change that.
One early milestone came during New Orleans Entrepreneur Week, where Startup Noir NOLA hosted its first summit.
Recently, Startup Noir NOLA launched a Supper Club to give founders space to speak openly about barriers and opportunities within the ecosystem.","Startup Noir NOLA emerged during a pivotal moment for New Orleans’ startup economy. In 2021, two major exits — including Louisiana’s first unicorn — signaled a turning point, showing that billion-dollar outcomes could happen locally. That momentum sparked new companies, attracted investment, and brought renewed attention to the region’s growing innovation landscape.

Recognizing the significance of that shift, GNO Inc.’s Chief External Affairs Officer, Jasmine Brown-DeRousselle, created Startup Noir NOLA to ensure Black founders could fully participate in — and help shape — the region’s growth. The initiative builds on New Orleans’ existing strengths: a high concentration of Black residents with entrepreneurial talent, a cluster of HBCUs producing skilled graduates, and a creative culture shaped by generations of Black innovators. Paired with a startup support network that is expanding and becoming more coordinated, the region is increasingly suited for founders looking to launch and scale here.

Workforce & Entrepreneurship Manager Salem Habte, who leads the initiative, notes that the program’s name is intentional and direct.

“It’s very literal in name! It conveys who this initiative is intended to serve,” she said.

That clarity is central to the mission: elevating Black-led startups in Greater New Orleans and expanding the resources available to them.

Startup Noir NOLA works alongside partners such as The Idea Village, Louisiana Economic Development, Corridor Ventures, Camelback Ventures, and JPMorgan Chase. The initiative aims not only to address persistent gaps but also to strengthen what New Orleans has historically done well. The city has a long history of entrepreneurship — from some of the nation’s earliest Black self-made millionaires to one of the highest percentages of Black-owned businesses in the country today. But data continues to show an imbalance.

“Access to capital and customers remain the top challenges Black startup founders here face,” Habte said.

Despite strong ideas and growing companies, BIPOC-led firms are still less likely to receive traditional loans or venture funding, slowing both business development and the region’s broader economic potential.

Startup Noir NOLA seeks to change that. Its work focuses primarily on founders who have already gained traction and need targeted support to reach their next milestone.

“We’re now rolling out programs to attract outside startup capital and assist with access to it within the ecosystem,” Habte said.

By helping founders reach new customer segments and prepare for growth, the initiative accelerates their progress toward major goals, including future funding and business expansion.

One early milestone came during New Orleans Entrepreneur Week, where Startup Noir NOLA hosted its first summit. The event drew more than 100 attendees and featured conversations on the state of Black entrepreneurship, founder wellness, and strategies to encourage more high-net-worth individuals to become investors. It also included a fireside chat with Erik Moore, founder of Base Venture Partners. The response underscored a long-standing need.

“I heard repeatedly, ‘FINALLY! Conversations centered around our experience,’” Habte said.

The summit is set to return to NOEW in March 2026.

Capital access remains a central focus. Because many investors in major markets tend to “fly over” the Gulf South when sourcing deals, Startup Noir NOLA launched a familiarization tour to bring interested investors directly to New Orleans. Ten representatives from venture capital funds, angel groups, and a CDFI participated. The day highlighted local Black founders in biotech, beauty, and music technology, while offering investors a deeper look at the city’s strengths.

“We aimed to help them understand our city’s history, areas of excellence, and most importantly, introduce them to local Black entrepreneurs that are raising capital for their companies,” Habte said.

The impact was immediate: founders began receiving follow-ups, and several investors started conducting diligence on companies they met during the tour. Habte believes this is the start of deeper engagement.

Another key piece of the initiative is community building. Recently, Startup Noir NOLA launched a Supper Club to give founders space to speak openly about barriers and opportunities within the ecosystem. Each dinner is co-hosted by a founder or funder who helps guide the conversation. It’s part of creating an environment where founders feel supported and heard. Habte envisions a future where New Orleans becomes a national model for Black innovation.

“We see a future where this city births a new paradigm for Black entrepreneurship,” she said. “In New Orleans, it should not only be possible to scale your company, but advantageous to do so.”

Looking ahead, Startup Noir NOLA has an ambitious slate of programs planned for 2026. In January, the initiative will host masterclasses designed to help founders strengthen their supply chains, secure working capital, and reach new customer bases. The investor tour, Venture Voir, will also return with a new cohort of visitors. Throughout this expansion, the initiative remains open and accessible.

“If you are a Black startup founder, please reach out so we can talk about your work and goals,” Habte said. “If you are an entrepreneurial supporter passionate about this mission, I’d love to get you involved.”",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2026/01/SNN_01.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:58:36.217277

The project in question, known as Cactus Wren BESS, will have up to 800MW/3,200MWh of capacity on approximately 40 acres of land located around 7.6 miles south of the City of Maricopa in Pinal County, Arizona.

Interconnection to the electricity grid will be achieved via Salt River Project’s (SRP’s) Duke 500kV substation that’s located to the north of the project amongst three other substations.

Shortlisted for procurement

Also present at the recent meeting was SRP’s director for local relations, Buchanan Davis, who revealed that the project has been shortlisted for procurement by the utility.

“We are in active discussions with the developer as we explore a potential energy storage agreement,” said Davis.

The success of the project was described by Davis as being important for both SRP and Pinal County, especially with the utility predicting a 12% growth in annual energy usage across the county during the next decade.

SRP attributes this increasing demand to population growth and hotter summers, but also points to further industrial developments in the area – particularly where data centers are concerned.

Just last month, Pinal County’s BoS approved a data center development from Copia Power that will feature a BESS, known as the Energy Generation and Technology Campus, that will be located adjacent to esVolta’s recent BESS proposal.

As well as SRP, the project is also being considered for procurement by public utility Electric District No. 3 (ED3), which described the project as being located in an “ideal location.” According to a letter of support for the project, ED3 has requested pricing for a portion of Cactus Wren BESS which will be evaluated as part of the utility’s power procurement process.

After little discussion amongst the BoS, esVolta’s three requests were approved unanimously.

Construction is expected to take around 12 months to complete, with esVolta aiming to break ground sometime next year.

Supreme Court dismisses appeals to revive RGGI carbon credit program,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pa-supreme-court-dismisses-appeals-revive-rggi-carbon-credit-program,"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday ended appeals of a lower court’s ruling that the commonwealth’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was illegal.
It also came more than six months after the state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.
The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction.
Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution.
It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.","The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday ended appeals of a lower court’s ruling that the commonwealth’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was illegal.

The court’s order dismissing the cases as moot follows Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s agreement to withdraw from the multi-state climate compact as part of his deal with Republican state lawmakers to bring the five-month budget stalemate to a close in November.

It also came more than six months after the state’s highest court heard oral arguments in the cases in May.

While many who opposed the program said it would drive up energy costs and constitute a drag on the economy, environmentalists argued a well-designed carbon cap program would reduce climate warming emissions while generating billions of dollars for the commonwealth.

The initiative, which is ongoing in 11 states, requires major carbon dioxide emitters, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants, to purchase carbon credits in an auction. Money from the credits is invested in sustainable energy projects in the states.

Challengers argued Pennsylvania’s membership in the program violated the state constitution.

They claimed Gov. Tom Wolf overstepped his executive authority by entering into the agreement without approval from the General Assembly and the cost of carbon credits constituted an illegal tax.

Siding with challengers, the Commonwealth Court ruled in November 2023 that to pass constitutional muster, Pennsylvania’s participation in RGGI “may only be achieved through legislation duly enacted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly.”

In a series of eight orders, the Supreme Court dismissed appeals by Constellation Energy, Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club. It also dismissed appeals by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the Environmental Quality Board, which issued the regulations establishing RGGI in the commonwealth.

The commonwealth entered the compact during Wolf’s administration in April 2022 when the final regulation was published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin as required by state law.

Pennsylvania joined neighboring states New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware in RGGI more than three years after the regulatory process first began and after considerable bipartisan pushback from opponents who said Wolf’s decision to join the multi-state agreement was an example of executive overreach.

In arguments before the seven-member Supreme Court last spring, environmental groups argued the state constitution guarantees the protection of public resources including clean air and that the DEP’s plan to limit carbon emissions is constitutional because it is part of its program to protect the public’s environmental rights.

“Air is a public trust resource, and the department and other trustees have to act to protect it,” Jessica O’Neil, who represented Penn Future, the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/aes_petersburg1-2048x1365-1-1024x6831767744576.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=KIoPAKnL,N,,2026-01-06 19:13:32.420211

“We are pleased to work in partnership with Call2Recycle to launch an extended producer responsibility program for batteries,” Recycle NB CEO Tim LeBlanc says. ""Call2Recycle is planning to significantly expand its network of battery drop-off locations that were already established in New Brunswick through its voluntary program, leading to greater diversion rates for our provincial landfills and a cleaner, safer environment.”

As the program ramps up, Call2Recycle says New Brunswick residents will have access to drop-off options and collection events, public education and outreach initiatives and bilingual resources for English and French speakers.

“This initiative helps strengthens our overarching commitment to environmental protection,” Environment and Climate Change Minister Gilles LePage says. “By aligning with the objectives of our Strategic Action Plan for Solid Waste Management, it enhances our collective capacity to reduce waste, promote responsible resource use and advance sustainable practices. Together, these efforts reinforce a cohesive, integrated approach to safeguarding the environment while achieving the long-term goals established for effective and responsible waste management.”

Since its inception, Call2Recycle has collected more than 55 million kilograms of batteries across Canada. The organization says that expanding to New Brunswick further strengthens its impact by increasing end-of-life options for consumer batteries and helping prevent potential safety risks associated with improper storage or disposal. Call2Recycle promotes the safe handling and transport of used batteries, including taping lithium-based batteries and bagging them individually before drop-off.

“This program supports New Brunswick’s environmental ambitions by making battery recycling easy for families and businesses across the province,” Zenobio says. “Together with our retail and municipal partners, we’re bringing New Brunswickers a reliable, provincewide solution that keeps batteries out of landfills and valuable materials in circulation.”",https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/fileuploads/image/2026/01/06/batteries---dimaberlin.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:13:54.716516

These impacts must be weighed against proposals to bestow tax rebates on the billion-dollar companies building these data centers (Google, Meta, Amazon).","Would you be surprised to learn that using ChatGPT, artificial intelligence photo editing, or even asking your Alexa/Siri a question contributes to significant water and electricity consumption?

While it may seem like this information is simply lost in the ether, it is actually stored in data centers, which have been popping up across the United States. And we are now starting to see them in our own backyards. Data centers are being proposed in places such as Sioux Falls, Toronto (Deuel County), and even at the gate of the sacred Black Hills, in Rapid City’s new industrial complex.

AI developers state that they are targeting colder climate areas to reduce the amount of energy needed to operate these data centers. Addressing the energy needs, employment promises and overall environmental impact of data centers will allow South Dakotans to decide whether we really want this infrastructure to be developed in our state. We live here, and our voices matter.

Politicians and data center developers are downplaying the massive energy requirements that the proposed data centers will demand. Approximately 400 megawatts of power from our electric grids could be needed for one data center, consuming half of the energy that South Dakota has spent over 75 years sizing up to sustain the expanding population and economic growth we are seeing today.

Congressman speaks in support of data centers in SD, calling anti-development rhetoric ‘un-American’

These massive data centers are filled with computers to store AI and cryptocurrency data, and computers generate a lot of heat. To avoid overheating and ensure proper functioning, large amounts of water are needed to cool the systems down. Some data center developers claim that water usage for the proposed data centers here will be no more than that of the average U.S. household. However, our cold season does come to an end, and as temperatures continue to rise and display record summer highs year after year, these claims will become less valid. There is already a strain on our water resources here in South Dakota, so potential water shortages could result if the issue is aggravated.

Furthermore, claims that the demand on our energy grid will not increase our already rising energy bills are sugarcoated at best. Americans have seen about a 13% national increase in electricity prices since the beginning of 2025, and this trend is expected to continue.

Transparency is a must when it comes to grandiose promises, such as the statements that data centers will create substantial job growth for South Dakotans. While the construction of these large buildings will bring temporary employment, once construction ends, so will most of these jobs. Also, the construction of a data center requires highly skilled workers. We can’t be sure that out-of-state companies won’t be brought in for the construction.

On average, an operating data center needs between 30 and 100 full-time employees. There is currently no data to show how the hundreds of jobs promised compare to the jobs that are actually created, or what kind of jobs those even are.

Data centers also bring a slew of environmental problems in their wake. As stated previously, they will consume a large amount of water. We’re talking hundreds of thousands to millions of gallons of water per day for an evaporative-cooled system in the data center. On the low end, this water usage is equivalent to the needs of a city the size of Pierre. On the high end of consumption, it would be more comparable to the water needs of Sioux Falls. There is technology that operates on a closed-loop system where the water is cooled and recycled. However, this could increase the electricity demand by more than 20% and further burden our fragile energy grid, contributing to ratepayers’ increased energy costs.

The message is clear — communities need to have transparency around proposed data centers so they can weigh the economic and environmental impacts in order to protect hardworking South Dakotans and our beautiful lands. These impacts must be weighed against proposals to bestow tax rebates on the billion-dollar companies building these data centers (Google, Meta, Amazon).

More factual information regarding the jobs promised, the electrical and water usage, and environmental risks needs to be brought forward and discussed before any construction begins. Finding ways to mitigate the environmental and economic effects that are correlated with data centers should be a top priority for South Dakotans as we take a stand to protect our communities.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47647/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2212150245-scaled-1-1024x6821767741116.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=mGl1SUhH,N,,2026-01-06 22:58:22.809729

Cure with Confidence: Tools and Models for Resin Process Control

The performance of the final product depends heavily on the degree of cure - making it critical to ensure that the reaction goes to completion for the highest quality and reliability. Achieving this requires both a deep understanding of the resin’s curing behavior and precise control of process parameters. Tools such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dielectric analysis (DEA) and oscillatory rheometry provide powerful ways to characterize thermal transitions, cure progression and flow behavior. Each method delivers distinct insights. In this presentation, NETZSCH will discuss when to use DSC, DEA or oscillatory rheometry. These techniques also serve as the basis for kinetics analysis using Kinetics Neo software. Kinetics modeling allows simulation of resin behavior under any time or temperature conditions. This not only enables process optimization and consistent product performance but also helps reduce manufacturing variability and thus scrap rates by predicting and preventing potential processing issues.

Tool Smarter, Repair Stronger: Kaneka’s Low-temp BMI and Advanced Resin Repair System

Kaneka Aerospace specializes in high-performance composite materials tailored for aerospace and industrial applications. Its portfolio of prepregs, resins and adhesives delivers properties that go beyond lightweight and strength — enabling customers to achieve greater value in manufacturing and sustainability. In this session, Kaneka Aerospace will unveil recent innovations in tooling and structural repair, two critical areas for the economics and longevity of composite structures. Kaneka Aerospace has developed a unique BMI prepreg designed to lower tooling costs while maintaining high performance. Unlike traditional BMI tools that require high-temperature master molds and costly fabrication processes, this prepreg cures first at 250 °F (121 °C) and then undergoes a free-standing post-cure at 400 °F (204 °C). The lower initial cure temperature allows the use of less expensive master molds, while testing demonstrates the carbon fiber reinforced BMI tools’ thermal and dimensional stability under extended use. To further support the composites market’s growth and sustainability goals, Kaneka offers a proprietary repair resin engineered for efficient structural repair. Its low viscosity and balanced mechanical properties ensure effective filling of damage such as delamination and matrix cracks. Comparative testing of repaired versus undamaged composites highlights strong performance across tensile strength, fracture toughness, compression after impact (CAI), and combined loading compression (CLC), showcasing repair as a cost-effective alternative to part replacement.

UV Curing for Composite Manufacturing

Ultraviolet energy (UV) curing, also known as energy curing, has been used by the composites industry for some time, but it is still not quite as well-known as some other curing chemistries. The extremely rapid cure speed leads to high throughput and productivity, while the breath of physical properties of the cured resins allow them to be used in a variety of applications. The possibility of making lower VOC/styrene free formulations with very long pot life and reduced waste are also benefits of UV technology. In this presentation, allnex will briefly review what UV curing entails and compare the advantages and challenges of energy curing with thermally curing technologies (for example, peroxide curing of UP resins). In addition to comparing the chemistry of these approaches, we will also look at which composite manufacturing methods best lend themselves to energy curing. We will show some examples of UV curing being used in today’s composites world and where it might go in the future. Finally, this session will review allnex’s line of RAYLOK C products for UV curable composite manufacturing. Agenda: UV technology review Properties of UV cured composites Examples of UV composite technology being used today and possible future uses Review of the allnex RAYLOK C product line

But ... - Vail Daily,"Robert Tann, rtann@vaildaily.com",,,,,https://www.vaildaily.com/news/colorado-solar-clean-energy-subsidies-fewer/,"Coloradans begin 2026 with fewer options for how to pay for clean energy home upgrades after lucrative tax credits ended well before their initial expiration date.
Another tax credit program, the Residential Clean Energy Credit, covered 30% of the cost of solar installation for a home.
That law also ended another tax credit program for new and used electric vehicles on Sept. 30.
But even without those incentives, Coloradans still have options for subsidies for a host of clean energy appliances.
“Coloradans want access to clean energy technology to save money, and these rebates will help accomplish that,” Gov.","Coloradans begin 2026 with fewer options for how to pay for clean energy home upgrades after lucrative tax credits ended well before their initial expiration date.

The programs were part of a suite of clean energy initiatives enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a sprawling climate and health law passed by congressional Democrats and championed by former President Joe Biden.

Included in the Inflation Reduction Act was the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which provided up to $3,200 in tax credits for heat pumps, water heaters and biomass stoves and boilers, as well as home efficiency measures such as air sealing, insulation, new doors and windows. Another tax credit program, the Residential Clean Energy Credit, covered 30% of the cost of solar installation for a home.

The initiatives were meant to incentivize consumers to move away from fossil fuels and, when paired with the Inflation Reduction Act’s other climate measures, were projected to help cut U.S. carbon emissions by approximately 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Both tax credit programs expired on Dec. 31, however. The subsidies were supposed to last through 2032, but they were eliminated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed earlier this year by congressional Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump.

That law also ended another tax credit program for new and used electric vehicles on Sept. 30.

But even without those incentives, Coloradans still have options for subsidies for a host of clean energy appliances.

$14,000 worth of rebates for home upgrades

In November, the state launched the Home Energy Rebate Program , which provides income-qualified Coloradans with up to $14,000 in discounts for electric energy appliances and home efficiency upgrades.

“Coloradans want access to clean energy technology to save money, and these rebates will help accomplish that,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement announcing the program. “These rebates can help more Coloradans make a variety of home upgrades that will bring down energy costs and provide more efficient home heating and cooling.”

The funding comes from federal money that was preserved in the Inflation Reduction Act, with Colorado receiving just over $140 million to launch its program. The rebates are expected to be available through 2029, or until funding runs out.

Under the program, Coloradans could be eligible for:

Up to $8,000 for a cold climate heat pump for space heating or cooling

Up to $4,000 for a breaker box upgrade

Up to $2,500 for electric wiring

Up to $1,750 for a heat pump water heater

Up to $1,600 for insulation, air sealing and ventilation

Up to $840 for an electric stove, cooktop, oven or heat pump clothes dryer

The rebates are income-based. Households making below 80% of their county’s area median income are eligible to receive the full amount, while those making between 80% and 150% could see up to half.

The subsidies are available for both homeowners who work with a state-registered contractor and renters who have permission from their property owner. More program information, including a list of eligible contractors, income limits, and how to apply, can be found at EnergyOffice.Colorado.gov/home-energy-rebates .

State officials have touted the subsidies as a way of not only lowering home energy costs but also reducing carbon emissions and improving indoor air quality. Colorado has a goal of reaching 100% net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, relative to 2005 levels, by 2050.

“Burning fossil fuels in buildings, such as for heating and water heating, is among the leading sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Colorado,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, in a statement.

“These incentives will make innovative and efficient technologies that improve home health and safety more affordable, and will save people money on their energy bills, while playing a key role in achieving our climate goals,” Toor said, adding that the new rebates are the “biggest home energy incentives the state has offered to date.

Coloradans also have the opportunity to pair those rebates with other existing clean home energy programs. More information on that can be found at PUC.Colorado.gov/energy-savings .

Western Slope-specific programs

In Colorado’s mountain communities, where energy costs can be much higher, local and regional initiatives exist to help households pay for home upgrades.

The Carbondale-based nonprofit Energy Smart Colorado partners with local governments and groups to offer programs in more than a dozen western Colorado counties, including Summit, Grand, Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield and Routt.

Eligible households can receive a subsidized home energy assessment and rebates for solar installation and electrical appliances. Benefits differ by county, and more information can be found at EnergySmartColorado.org .

Boosted EV rebates

After Congress ended tax credits worth up to $7,500 for electric vehicles on Sept. 30, Colorado officials increased state-level EV rebates.

The state’s Vehicle Exchange Colorado Program provides rebates for Coloradans who replace their gas- or diesel-powered vehicles with cars that are all-electric or a plug-in hybrid.

As of Nov. 1, rebates for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle have increased from $6,000 to $9,000 for new cars, and from $4,000 to $6,000 for used ones. More information can be found at EnergyOffice.colorado.gov/vehicle-exchange-colorado .

Colorado also has its own tax credit for electric vehicle purchases. That benefit, however, was reduced from $3,500 to $750 starting in 2026, due to ongoing budget shortfalls in the state’s general fund.

While the rebate program is somewhat insulated from budget pressures since its funding is derived from fees on package and food delivery services, the state’s electric vehicle tax credit is directly tied to available tax revenue.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/7/2026/01/06155938/Solar.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 19:00:05.434971

Changes to PFAS reporting requirements The EPA is also working to roll back some PFAS reporting requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act, reporting that was called for in a 2023 rule (PDF).
A final rule that closely resembles the proposed rule will likely emerge in the first half of 2026, she tells C&EN.
“The tsunami of state PFAS reporting obligations shows no sign of abating.” With attention focused on midterm elections in 2026, legislative and regulatory action will likely slow down at the federal level.
“Every single state at some point is going to be enacting, if it has not already, reporting obligations and/or product restrictions on PFAS.”","The US Environmental Protection Agency begins 2026 amid a move to rescind drinking water standards for four types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), along with other ongoing actions on these “forever chemicals.” Policy and regulation experts tell C&EN that we may see less new federal action on PFAS this year but that litigation and state action show no signs of slowing down.

Asked about this effort and other agency priorities regarding PFAS in 2026, an EPA spokesperson wrote to C&EN, “The Trump EPA is committed to addressing PFAS with gold-standard science to ensure that Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water, carrying out our core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

The federal drinking water standards for the four PFAS were established in 2024 as part of a package that also limits perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).

Water utility groups have sued the EPA over these standards. The EPA will defend the limits on PFOA and PFOS but has asked the court in this case to annul the limits for the other four chemicals: perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA).

The 2024 regulation came amid a groundswell of awareness about PFAS.

“It’s not new to people that PFAS are a problem, but I think what has really grown, say in the last decade, is awareness of how widespread the issue is,” says Alissa Cordner, an environmental sociology professor at Whitman College who coleads the PFAS Project Lab. “We have seen a pretty dramatic increase in legislation and regulation,” she tells C&EN.

If the EPA succeeds in rolling back some of the drinking-water standards, Cordner expects opposing litigation.

Meanwhile, controversy over the exact definition of PFAS will continue. “The question of what counts as a PFAS is really top of mind for people on all sides of the issue,” she says.

Changes to PFAS reporting requirements

The EPA is also working to roll back some PFAS reporting requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act, reporting that was called for in a 2023 rule (PDF). In November, the EPA proposed changes to that rule, most notably for imports of certain PFAS-containing products, such as textiles, cookware, electronics, and car parts, to be exempt from reporting requirements.

“There was a considerable sigh of relief” from industry, says Lynn Bergeson, an attorney and managing partner of the Bergeson & Campbell law firm.

A final rule that closely resembles the proposed rule will likely emerge in the first half of 2026, she tells C&EN.

But companies’ preparations for the Joe Biden–era rule “will not be for naught,” she adds, because states are also creating new requirements. “The tsunami of state PFAS reporting obligations shows no sign of abating.”

With attention focused on midterm elections in 2026, legislative and regulatory action will likely slow down at the federal level. “I would expect there to be PFAS initiatives, but maybe not as robust or as numerous as in other years, because politics is everything,” Bergeson says.

But at the state level, she expects momentum to continue. “States have picked up on a sense that the federal government has retreated a little bit from limiting and restricting PFAS and have really rushed to fill a perceived void,” she says. “Every single state at some point is going to be enacting, if it has not already, reporting obligations and/or product restrictions on PFAS.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/WCO--PFAS-actions-by-EPA---274048:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-06 19:00:20.698467

“Our diversified fleet, anchored on natural gas and nuclear generation, will play a critical role in the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of U.S. power grids,” Burke said. “The addition of this natural gas portfolio is a great way to start another year of growth for Vistra as we’ve completed, acquired, or developed projects in each of the competitive power regions where we operate. Vistra continues to look for opportunities that allow us to meet the growing demand of customers and meet our disciplined investment thresholds.”

The Cogentrix portfolio is composed of a modern and efficient set of gas assets that adds baseload-weighted capacity, complements Vistra’s fleet, and enhances Vistra’s efficient generation capabilities, the company said. The acquisition also diversifies and expands Vistra’s geographic footprint by adding 5,500 MW of net capacity across some of the most attractive and fastest-growing power regions in North America.

“We’re pleased to have reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the Cogentrix portfolio to Vistra,” said Wil VanLoh, founder and CEO of Quantum Capital Group. “We’re excited to become shareholders of Vistra and have much confidence in Vistra’s ability to deliver long-term value through its industry-leading portfolio and operational excellence. Quantum thanks the Cogentrix team for their partnership and looks forward to seeing the business continue to grow as part of Vistra.”

Combined with its current fleet, Vistra’s generation portfolio will consist of approximately 50,000 MW of capacity across the U.S., stretching from Maine to California, the company said.

The deal is subject to certain regulatory approvals, including by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and certain state regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in mid- to late 2026.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC. is serving as exclusive financial advisor, and Latham & Watkins LLP, Sidley Austin, LLP, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP are serving as legal advisors, to Vistra.

The department announced contracts for three reactor fuel companies on Monday in an effort to undercut Russia’s dominance in the market for advanced reactor fuel.

The funding comes as electricity demand increases and federal policy shifts away from renewable energy development. The Trump administration is betting on a larger role for nuclear power in America’s energy future. But the U.S. relies heavily on imported fuel for its existing nuclear power plants, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

In a press release, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the administration is “committed to restoring a secure domestic nuclear fuel supply chain capable of producing the nuclear fuels needed to power the reactors of today and the advanced reactors of tomorrow.”

What will the nuclear fuel be used for?

The Energy Department’s awards focus on two types of nuclear fuel: low-enriched uranium (LEU) and high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Both are produced by enriching natural uranium to increase concentrations of uranium-235, the isotope that sustains fission reactions underpinning nuclear power plants. LEU powers the large commercial reactors currently operating in the United States. HALEU contains higher concentrations, enabling more efficient reactor designs such as small modular reactors.

Advanced reactors using HALEU can operate at higher temperatures than those at conventional plants, potentially improving efficiency and reducing waste. Many advanced designs are also smaller and more flexible, allowing deployment at remote communities, military bases and industrial facilities.

The HALEU enrichment effort is separate from another Trump administration initiative to make plutonium from decommissioned nuclear warheads available to the power industry. That plutonium would be used in conventional reactors, while HALEU is specifically designed for advanced reactor technologies.

While one U.S. company has produced HALEU, it’s not available at a commercial scale. Russia’s state-owned nuclear company Rosatom is one of the few sources of commercial HALEU supply, creating a dependency that Congress sought to address with a 2024 ban on Russian uranium imports.

How is the $2.7 billion distributed?

The Energy Department awarded $900 million each to three companies operating in the United States.

American Centrifuge Operating, a subsidiary of Centrus Energy, will develop domestic HALEU enrichment capacity at its facility in Piketon, Ohio. Centrus began producing HALEU in October 2023 under a previous department contract, becoming the only domestic source of the fuel.

General Matter will develop HALEU production using laser-based enrichment technology. The approach uses precise light frequencies to selectively excite and separate uranium isotopes.

Orano Federal Services will expand domestic LEU enrichment. Orano Federal Services is the U.S. subsidiary of France’s state-owned Orano Group. The company plans to build a new $5 billion enrichment facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Wright said the awards would be “distributed to the companies under a strict milestone approach,” requiring them to meet benchmarks before receiving payments.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1356860443_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 17:14:10.310279

Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa.
“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said.
Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force.
Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump.","Efforts to expand nuclear energy in Iowa have kicked off in 2026 with the formation of a state nuclear energy task force and the Linn County approval of a rezoning request for Iowa’s sole nuclear plant’s planned restart.

The Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force, initiated by Gov. Kim Reynolds, will generate a report and advise state leadership on opportunities to embrace nuclear energy in the state of Iowa.

Reynolds said in a news release the task force marks a “strategic step forward” to ensuring Iowa has a “safe, efficient, and responsible integration” of nuclear energy.

“Nuclear energy is a vital part of Iowa’s energy future, and I am committed to advancing reliable, sustainable energy solutions that strengthen our energy independence and fuel economic growth,” Reynolds said. “With our strong foundation in manufacturing and energy innovation, we are uniquely positioned to lead the nation in developing and deploying nuclear technologies.”

Presently, Iowa has no operational nuclear energy plants, but NextEra Energy is working to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Linn County. The company’s request to rezone close to 400 acres at the site was approved by Linn County Supervisors Monday, though there are still several regulatory hurdles NextEra must cross to be operational at the start of 2029 as it plans.

The plant, if restarted, would generate 615 megawatts of energy and have more than 400 onsite, full-time jobs. Google signed an agreement with NextEra in October to purchase power from Duane Arnold nuclear site to power Google cloud and artificial intelligence operations.

Lane Witten, a vice president at NextEra, was chosen as one of 14 members to serve on the Iowa Nuclear Energy Task Force.

The task force is chaired by Mark Nutt, a graduate of Iowa State University’s Nuclear Engineering program and the director of Nuclear Energy Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Other members represent utilities, local government, industry and the Iowa Utilities Commission.

State legislators Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny; Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines; Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter; Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, and Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, also serve on the task force.

According to the news release, the task force is asked to assess emerging nuclear technologies for Iowa’s energy sector, engage with industry leaders to help develop the necessary workforce for the industry, as well as engage with manufacturers and other stakeholders to identify potential barriers to entry in the nuclear field.

The task force is also asked to explore engagement opportunities with federal nuclear energy programs to “ensure Iowa’s policies and initiatives align with national regulations” and to evaluate opportunities for economic growth within the nuclear energy sector.

While energy consumption remained fairly stable across the U.S. from 2000-2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a recent report from the consulting firm ICF projected overall energy demand will increase by 25% by 2030. The report attributes the growth in part to data centers that power cloud and artificial intelligence models, as well as increased electrification in transportation and building sectors.

Reynolds has identified nuclear energy as one of her priorities to build an “affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system” for the state. The governor’s energy bill from the 2025 legislative session also called for the General Assembly to “encourage the development” of nuclear electric power generation, but the bill did not make it to the floor for debate in either chamber.

Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump. NextEra’s website for the Duane Arnold restart claims the project contributes “toward the Administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.”

According to the news release, the task force has 180 days to submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor, per the executive order.

Additional task force members include:

May Farlinger, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa company, Interstate Power & Light Company; Mike Fehr, senior vice president of renewable generation and compliance at MidAmerican Energy; Brandy Meisheid, chair of the Linn County Board of Supervisors; Jim McCalley, distinguished professor at Iowa State University; Sarah Martz, chair of the Iowa Utilities Commission; Matt Resor, business manager for IBEW Local 405, and Andy Roberts with Central Iowa Building & Construction Trades Council.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2177851416-2048x1535.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 17:14:14.261154

The public-interest balancing test does not consider whether a project’s economic activity could be used to overcome disproportionate health impacts.
Though other New Jersey environmental laws balanced economic growth against public or environmental health, the Environmental Justice Law did not, the three-judge panel found.
Rules requiring reviews for expansions at existing facilities — including ones that do not alter a facility’s physical footprint — are not overbroad because those expansions could still strain public health, the court said.
He said it is too early to say whether his clients would petition the New Jersey Supreme Court for an appeal.","Environmentalists are cheering after a New Jersey appellate court upheld controversial new state environmental regulations and rejected a challenge from scrap recyclers and a labor union that alleged regulators had acted arbitrarily and exceeded their statutory authority.

The court’s Monday decision will keep in place, for now, the landmark New Jersey law that requires additional environmental reviews for projects in overburdened communities and allows the Department of Environmental Protection to block those projects if they would disproportionally worsen public health there.

“Today’s decision was a win for all New Jersey residents, but primarily for the environmental justice communities that have long championed this fight. When our environmental laws protect our most vulnerable communities, they protect us all,” said Casandia Bellevue, an attorney with Earthjustice, which represented supporters of the law.

Plastic pellets known as ‘nurdles’ are polluting beaches and waterways

Some business groups lamented the decision. Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the environmental rules “have had, and will continue to have, a chilling effect on New Jersey’s business community.”

The law is meant to limit further contamination in parts of New Jersey that historically saw significant pollution during the state’s industrial era, though provisions allow some projects to continue based on public need or mitigation technology approved by regulators.

The public-interest balancing test does not consider whether a project’s economic activity could be used to overcome disproportionate health impacts. The New Jersey branch of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries and the Engineers Labor Employer Cooperative Local 825 argued that excluding economic gains from the test is impermissibly arbitrary because a better economy could boost education and employment levels, reducing public health stressors.

But the court agreed with state officials who said economic benefits are difficult to quantify while reviewing a project’s application, adding that they cannot enforce promises of economic growth.

Though other New Jersey environmental laws balanced economic growth against public or environmental health, the Environmental Justice Law did not, the three-judge panel found.

“It is clear from the Legislature’s intent in [the Environmental Justice Law] that it requires prioritizing the health, safety, and environmental needs of the individuals in [overburdened communities] and that neither DEP nor applicants for approvals are allowed to trade fewer pollution reductions for more jobs and tax ratables,” Judge Heidi Currier wrote for the panel.

New Jersey marks all or part of 341 municipalities covering more than 5.2 million residents as overburdened communities, according to data maintained by the Department of Environmental Protection.

Those include portions of cities — swathes of Newark and Atlantic City, for example — but they also include parts of wealthier suburbs like Voorhees, where significant percentages of residents in a given census block are low-income, are non-white, or speak limited English.

The court rejected the plaintiffs’ other challenges for similar reasons. Rules requiring reviews for expansions at existing facilities — including ones that do not alter a facility’s physical footprint — are not overbroad because those expansions could still strain public health, the court said.

Rules requiring additional environmental reviews in census blocks with zero residents bordering overburdened communities are likewise permissible because pollution generated there could flow to areas covered by the law.

Regulations requiring air pollution controls at some sites are also permissible, the judges ruled. Scrap recyclers and the union had charged that those provisions conflict with the Air Pollution Control Act and are impermissibly vague.

The court also rejected plaintiffs’ claims that the department violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to provide meaningful analysis of the rules’ impact on jobs and the economy, arguing its impact reports were “devoid of meaningful analysis or information.”

The department had released all required economic impact statements alongside the rule proposal, the judges said, adding the law does not require the department to make a more fulsome analysis of how the rule might affect New Jersey’s economy.

“Neither the rule nor the APA require an agency to provide specific cost information or quantify the expected costs and revenues generated or lost. ‘All that is required is for the agency to describe the expected economic impact,’” Currier wrote, citing an earlier case.

Dennis Toft, who represented the engineers union, expressed disappointment in the ruling.

“We’re disappointed that the appellate division deferred completely to DEP when circumstances where it was admitted by the DEP that the legislation had gaps in it that DEP, on its own, decided to fill those gaps without pointing them out and going back and having the robust legislative debate that would’ve been called for,” he said.

He said it is too early to say whether his clients would petition the New Jersey Supreme Court for an appeal.

The task force is chaired by Mark Nutt, a graduate of Iowa State University’s Nuclear Engineering program and the director of Nuclear Energy Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Other members represent utilities, local government, industry and the Iowa Utilities Commission.

State legislators Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny; Sen. Izaah Knox, D-Des Moines; Rep. David Young, R-Van Meter; Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, and Rep. Sean Bagniewski, D-Des Moines, also serve on the task force.

According to the news release, the task force is asked to assess emerging nuclear technologies for Iowa’s energy sector, engage with industry leaders to help develop the necessary workforce for the industry, as well as engage with manufacturers and other stakeholders to identify potential barriers to entry in the nuclear field.

The task force is also asked to explore engagement opportunities with federal nuclear energy programs to “ensure Iowa’s policies and initiatives align with national regulations” and to evaluate opportunities for economic growth within the nuclear energy sector.

While energy consumption remained fairly stable across the U.S. from 2000-2020, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a recent report from the consulting firm ICF projected overall energy demand will increase by 25% by 2030. The report attributes the growth in part to data centers that power cloud and artificial intelligence models, as well as increased electrification in transportation and building sectors.

Reynolds has identified nuclear energy as one of her priorities to build an “affordable, reliable and sustainable energy system” for the state. The governor’s energy bill from the 2025 legislative session also called for the General Assembly to “encourage the development” of nuclear electric power generation, but the bill did not make it to the floor for debate in either chamber.

Nuclear energy expansion and acceleration has also been a priority outlined by President Donald Trump. NextEra’s website for the Duane Arnold restart claims the project contributes “toward the Administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.”

According to the news release, the task force has 180 days to submit a final report on its findings and recommendations to the governor, per the executive order.

Additional task force members include:

May Farlinger, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa company, Interstate Power & Light Company; Mike Fehr, senior vice president of renewable generation and compliance at MidAmerican Energy; Brandy Meisheid, chair of the Linn County Board of Supervisors; Jim McCalley, distinguished professor at Iowa State University; Sarah Martz, chair of the Iowa Utilities Commission; Matt Resor, business manager for IBEW Local 405, and Andy Roberts with Central Iowa Building & Construction Trades Council.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2177851416-1024x7671767735278.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=m4AiBI21,N,,2026-01-06 20:59:45.685095

Dive Brief:

Battery maker LG Energy Solution has agreed to sell its stake of its electric vehicle joint venture battery plant building in Ohio to Honda Development and Manufacturing of America for $2.85 billion, according to a Dec. 23 regulatory filing.

The plans for the joint venture EV battery plant were announced in August 2022 and included an initial investment commitment of $3.5 billion by Honda and LG Energy Solution to produce lithium-ion batteries for electric Honda and Acura models for the North American market beginning in 2026.

The transaction includes the building and infrastructure assets related to the joint venture, but excludes the land and equipment. The joint venture will continue to use the facility under a lease agreement, with no changes to production or operational plans, according to the Korea Herald. The deal is scheduled to close on Feb. 28.

Dive Insight:

The L-H Battery Co. joint venture between LG Energy Solution and Honda was formally establishedin January 2023 to produce battery cells in the U.S. for future Honda and Acura EVs.

Although the two companies planned an initial investment commitment of $3.5 billion in the Ohio plant, the total investment was expected to reach up to $4.4 billion, with a targeted annual capacity of 40GWh of battery cells.

According to LG Energy Solution’s regulatory filing, the deal to divest its stake in the battery plant building is intended to “increase the operational efficiency” of its joint venture with Honda. However, the plant may expand production of batteries for energy storage system applications, according to the Korea Herald.

In October 2024, LG Energy Solution announced it will focus more on producing energy storage system batteries as part of its mid-to-long-term business strategy, which are in high demand due to the AI data center construction boom in the U.S. But the company said its long-term plans to develop advanced batteries for the auto industry will remain a priority.

Honda announced plans to establish an “EV Hub” in Ohio in March 2023, which included the construction of the joint venture battery plant with LG Energy Solution. But with changing market conditions, Honda and other automakers, including General Motors and Ford Motor Co., have revised their EV timelines and no longer require the battery capacity previously anticipated.

In October, GM announced it was cutting thousands of jobs at its U.S. EV factories and battery plants amid slowing demand. The plans include the laying off 550 workers at its Ultium Cells EV battery joint venture plant in Ohio and pausing production at a second Ultium Cells production site in Tennessee.

Last month, Ford Motor Co. and battery maker SK On reached an agreement to dissolve their EV battery joint venture “BlueOval SK.” The JV was established in September 2021 as part of a planned $11.4 billion investment by the two companies to build three large-scale manufacturing plants in the U.S. to produce batteries for Ford’s future EVs.

Also last month, Ford terminated its multi-billion-dollar supply deal with LG Energy Solution for 75 GWh of battery cells due to weakening EV demand.

Key Sales Figures","Key Moments

Hybrid Momentum and Budget Trucks Drive Growth

Ford reported that its U.S. auto sales increased in 2025, supported by continued interest in hybrid vehicles and an emphasis on more affordable pickup options, even as electric vehicle sales slowed.

The automaker said total annual U.S. sales reached 2,204,124 vehicles in 2025, up from 2,078,832 in the prior year, reflecting a 6% gain.

Hybrid models were a key contributor. Ford described 2025 as its strongest year to date for hybrid sales, with volumes climbing nearly 22% to 228,072 units compared with 187,426 units a year earlier.

Ford also highlighted the performance of its compact Maverick pickup, positioned as an affordable option in the truck segment. Maverick sales rose about 18% to 155,051 units, up from 131,142 units a year ago, as demand for the lower-priced truck remained firm.

“(Maverick sales) really had a big impact on how we addressed affordability in the market,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations, on a Monday evening call.

Shift Toward Lower-Priced Models

According to the company, customers increasingly focused on entry-level versions of its vehicles to navigate elevated price levels across the auto sector. Ford said buyers were gravitating toward more affordable base models as high industry pricing persisted.

Industry Context and Competitive Landscape

Ford’s sales update followed similar reports from other global automakers. The company’s announcement came one day after Toyota, Hyundai and General Motors also reported increases in their annual U.S. sales.

The broader industry faced a challenging backdrop, with the year described as turbulent due to tariffs and the elimination of a $7,500 electric-vehicle tax credit. Despite those pressures, several major manufacturers, including Ford, still recorded overall sales growth.

EV Retrenchment and Large Writedown

While hybrids and compact pickups supported Ford’s volumes, the company has been reassessing its electric vehicle strategy. In December, the Detroit-based manufacturer disclosed that it would record a $19.5 billion writedown and discontinue several electric vehicle models.

The move was presented as a prominent example of the sector’s pullback from battery-powered vehicles in light of policies under the Donald Trump administration and softening demand for EVs.
