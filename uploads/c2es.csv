Most of it, $100 million, goes to Business Development and Community Revitalization programs run by the Michigan Economic Development Corp and the Michigan Strategic Fund.
One plank of House Republicans' plan to increase road funding by around $3 billion is using $500 million in projected ""surplus"" tax revenue.
""We're not getting the results,"" he said of the business subsidies and the universities' technology programs.
The Business Development and Community Revitalization programs have been appropriated at least $1.5 billion since they were created in 2011 to replace tax credit incentives.","LANSING — There appears to be bipartisan support for making deep cuts to state business-attraction incentives and nixing funding for programs designed to commercialize universities' technology and research.

A week after the Democratic-led Senate voted to strip $75 million, or nearly two-thirds, from the initiatives in the next budget, Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said Tuesday he favors axing all $115.7 million.

Most of it, $100 million, goes to Business Development and Community Revitalization programs run by the Michigan Economic Development Corp and the Michigan Strategic Fund. One awards performance-based grants and loans to companies for creating jobs, making investments or both. The other gives incentives to developers for redeveloping brownfields and historic preservation sites if milestones are reached.

The remaining $15.7 million backs the Tech Transfer Talent Network, also known as T3N, and the Michigan Translational Research and Commercialization program, or MTRAC, which have helped launch hundreds of startups. Seven universities benefit from one or both programs.

One plank of House Republicans' plan to increase road funding by around $3 billion is using $500 million in projected ""surplus"" tax revenue. That figure fell to about $180 million under a revised estimate released Friday, Hall said at a news conference.

He said lawmakers could make up the $320 million difference by cutting the $115 million in ""corporate giveaways"" along with $28 million for the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity's Office of Global Michigan, $22 million for a COVID-19 task force, all $11 million arts and cultural grants issued by the MEDC, and $150 million by not filling 2,900 vacant state jobs.

""We're not getting the results,"" he said of the business subsidies and the universities' technology programs. ""We're just saying local roads is probably more important to more people than these big corporate giveaways. So we'll just get rid of the rest of them.""

The elimination of the funding would be a blow to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration, which has so far failed to persuade lawmakers to renew much bigger yearly deposits into the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund. The $500 million in annual funding for attracting ""critical"" industries and prepping sites — electric vehicle battery plants, for instance — is due to expire after this fiscal year despite having the backing of major business groups.

The Business Development and Community Revitalization programs have been appropriated at least $1.5 billion since they were created in 2011 to replace tax credit incentives.

Universities and entities like Invest Detroit, which has a venture capital arm, have expressed concerns that cuts to T3N and MTRAC would reverse progress on fostering an innovation economy.

The House has not proposed a full 2025-26 budget plan yet, but Hall’s comments signal what is likely coming from the chamber. Whitmer has proposed keeping the initiatives' funding flat at $115.7 million.

""We respect and understand the budget process and recognize that it evolves,"" MEDC spokesperson Otie McKinley said. ""We remain supportive of the funding levels proposed in Gov. Whitmer's executive budget recommendations. Alongside the governor, we look forward to working with our bipartisan legislative partners to ensure we are appropriately funded to execute the Make It in Michigan economic development strategy focused on people, places and projects.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/IMG_6102.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 09:08:19.878175

With XPENG's lineup of EVs parked by the water, the walls at the venue's entrance displayed a timeline of the company's history, stretching from its founding in 2014 up until the present day. There was also a graphic displaying the markets XPENG is targeting, covering countries in Latin America, the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, and pan-European regions.

Conspicuously absent from XPENG's international vision board? America.

XPENG sees U.S. tariffs as 'opportunity' for global expansion

Tesla is the reigning king of electric vehicles within the U.S., accounting for over 50 percent of the country's new EV registrations in 2024 according to an analysis by EV Volumes. Elon Musk's company faces little real competition, with distant runner up Ford responsible for just six percent of registrations.

However, the EV landscape looks markedly different beyond U.S. borders. While Tesla still has a significant foothold, its sales last year were more than doubled by Chinese giant BYD, which dominated the global market with over 22 percent of all EV sales. Coming in third was Wuling, another Chinese company which most Americans will likely have never heard of.

XPENG hasn't yet achieved such heights, ranked 10th last December at almost two percent of global EV market share. Though considering the competition, that's still no mean feat. The company also has clear ambitions to continue climbing, with vice-chairman and president Dr. Brian Gu stating that he considers the U.S. tariffs on China both ""a challenge and opportunity.""

""As a company, we cannot escape from economic volatilities that come with such tension,"" said Gu. ""We need to be prepared to make sure that our products continue to sell well. We also need to prepare that it may have an impact on the potentially global supply chain… However, I think it does raise an opportunity for a company that has aspirations globally.""

Gu noted that XPENG is closely monitoring the U.S.-China tariff feud to ensure its supply chain isn't impacted. ""With the tariff situation, it also means that we have to be even better at making sure we are self-sufficient,"" he said.

However, as the company hasn't expanded to the American market, its sales haven't been affected by the turmoil. XPENG's global expansion plans don't appear to have been adversely affected either.

""We will continue to expand our footprint, because we see that our product is now welcomed by a lot of the international markets that we enter,"" said Gu. ""The customer feedback has been great. We think we have a strong confidence and appeal to tackle into more markets, to offer our product to more customers…

""I would say a crisis always leads to opportunity, and we feel like we can actually take advantage of that to really [put] more focus on our mission, more focus onto making ourselves better, but at the same time to be more diversified and more strong, [and] introducing our product [and] technology to global customers.""

Tariffs, tariffs, everywhere, but not an EV to drive

While global Tesla sales have plummeted in recent months, demand for electric vehicles in general isn't waning. As of March, global sales of electric vehicles have reportedly increased by 30 percent compared to the same time last year, with the U.S. market in particular growing by 28 percent. However, U.S. tariffs mean that anyone hoping to buy an EV in the land of the free has significantly fewer options than their counterparts across the globe.

Tariffs play a significant part in this. President Donald Trump initially increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles during his first term in 2018. Such vehicles had already been subject to a standard 2.5 percent tariff, however Trump added an extra 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods to bump the rate up to 27.5 percent. His successor Joe Biden subsequently increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent in 2024.

U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs then skyrocketed to a whopping 247.5 percent earlier this year, courtesy of Trump's second term tariff blitz. Specifically, Trump added a further 145 percent tariff on all Chinese goods, plus a 2.75 percent tariff on electric vehicles in general. A recent 90-day pause has temporarily dropped the U.S.' tariffs on China from 145 percent down to 30 percent. However, this still leaves Chinese EVs subject to a tariff rate of 132.5 percent.

This means that if launching the X9 in the U.S. were to make financial sense, XPENG would have to charge local drivers a significantly larger sum than its pre-order price tag of ¥399,800 ($54,800 U.S.) in other parts of the world.

Yet despite this relative affordability, XPENG's X9 is packed with extravagant features you won't see in Tesla EVs twice the price. These include massage chair functions, a storage box for keeping food either cool or warm, and a 21.4-inch ceiling-mounted screen to keep rear passengers entertained.

""We also see [the U.S. tariff situation] as an opportunity for us to differentiate from the rest of [the] EV players, because we feel like we're bringing something different,"" said Gu. ""We're not just another affordable China brand in a foreign market.

""We want to be viewed as bringing the best in technology, the highest quality, and the coolest brand to these local customers. And that's something I think will position us well when there's actually these difficulties and tensions around the world.""

Fuelling an EV industry with subsidies

An aggressive shift toward electric cars in the U.S. would have a notable beneficial impact on the environment. China has already seen carbon emissions from vehicles drop significantly due to its adoption of EVs. However, when it comes to U.S. policies, business and economic concerns prevail.

When raising tariffs last year, part of Biden's reasoning was that Chinese EV manufacturers have been assisted by their government's subsidy programs. The now former U.S. president claimed that such support helped Chinese companies to ""cheat"" by selling cars at ""unfairly low prices"" which drove competitors out of business.

""Our competitor is not a domestic one [local to the markets XPENG is expanding to],"" said Gu via a translator, indicating disinterest in nationalistic EV rivalries. ""It is more about who is able to provide the most forward looking, most competitive technology, as well as with quality.""

The Chinese government has heavily invested in local EV manufacturing since 2009, reportedly offering over ¥200 billion ($27.5 billion U.S.) in subsidies and tax breaks in the following 13 years. It also actively encouraged EV adoption by entering contracts for its public transport fleet, and enacting policies which cut obstacles to car ownership for those who chose to go electric. Local companies aren't the only ones that benefited though. U.S.-based Tesla was reportedly the second largest beneficiary of Chinese subsidies, receiving over $450 million U.S.

The U.S. government has its own subsidiary programs for local EV manufacturing as well. However, its efforts to invest in the industry don't appear to have fostered a similarly strong or diverse local EV scene. Electric and hybrid vehicles only accounted for around 21 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales in the U.S. during Q2 of 2024, while last July almost half of all new vehicle sales in China were EVs.

Instead, the U.S. government's investment appears to have had one primary beneficiary: Tesla. The EV company has reportedly received at least $38 billion from the U.S. government in the form of subsidies, tax credits, loans, and contracts, spread over more than 20 years.

In fact, Tesla only became profitable after it began selling regulatory credits to other auto manufacturers — a revenue stream made possible by U.S. government incentives. Under this policy, auto manufacturers are required to build a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles. Companies who don't meet their target can make it up by buying credits from other manufacturers who have a surplus.

As Tesla only sells electric vehicles, it has a significant number of credits to sell. Tesla's regulatory credit sales account for around a third of its $35 billion in profits since 2014, and were responsible for the company turning its first year of profitability in 2020.

XPENG aims to win over the world

China's investment in the EVs has fuelled hundreds of local companies, as well as fierce competition between them. As such, not all of them are realistically expected to survive. Speaking via a translator, XPENG's CEO He Xiaopeng stated that those which have performed well centered software and AI. He believes companies will therefore focus on research and development moving forward.

""We used to have hundreds, thousands, of [mobile phone manufacturers], and right now only six Chinese mobile phone companies [remain],"" He said via a translator. ""For automakers, we used to have 100 to 200, and with EVs we have 400 to 500. I think that in the end, only 10 will survive.""

XPENG first ventured into the international market in 2020, launching its G3 SUV in Norway. It has expanded to around 30 countries in the years since, with He telling reporters that they plan to double this number to 60 by the end of 2025. The EV company has already debuted in Indonesian and Polish markets this year, and has announced it will arrive in Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Q2. This is already significant, though many more launches can be expected if XPENG intends to keep up with its ambitious growth plans.

""In the countries where Tesla sells well we also sell well, because these are the countries that have been educated [in EVs], they would recognize these technology driven vehicles,"" said Gu, also speaking via a translator.

""[In the] next 10 years we hope that more than half of XPENG's sales come from outside China, so revenue is not a single stream,"" said He through a translator.

Such confident expansion plans seem to have been informed by XPENG's apparent success overseas. The company recently reported it had delivered 94,008 of its smart EVs in Q1 2025 — a 331 percent increase since the same time last year. It further saw a 23.4 percent increase in revenue in Q4 2024 when compared to the same time in 2023.

""We are continuing to expand despite the current geopolitical situation, because we see that having a more diversified portfolio will ultimately benefit our company,"" said Gu.

Such expansion may eventually include bringing local manufacturing jobs to its new markets. Gu believes that if XPENG is to become a leading EV manufacturer internationally, it's inevitable that it will transition to having operations that are more locally based.

""Local brand, local operations, local services, maybe local charging capabilities and also local production capabilities,"" said Gu. ""You cannot rely on the export-only strategy to tackle such an important market [as Europe]. But the timing and how to do it is something that we're working on intently.""

The U.S. may soon be left behind

With U.S. trade relationships having become increasingly volatile, public sentiment in other countries has become more open to exploring alternate options for partnerships. And as Gu noted, it seems the perfect opportunity for Chinese companies such as XPENG to show what they have to offer.

In the Emerald Pavilion at Hong Kong's Hopewell Hotel, reporters from around the world questioned He and Gu about XPENG's plans in various countries. When might it expand to South Korea? What are their views on the Italian market? Will XPENG be addressing its voice recognition software's issues with the Australian accent?

Amidst this global conversation, the U.S. barely merits a mention.

The bidirectional electric vehicle (EV) charger market is in the early growth phase for several reasons. Bidirectional charging technology is a relatively new concept, and as such, it has not yet penetrated the market fully. This technology enables electric vehicles to not just consume energy from the grid but also feed it back to the grid, providing grid services and enhancing the overall stability and resiliency of the grid.

The adoption of electric vehicles is still in its early stages. However, with the increasing demand for greener mobility and the decreasing cost of battery technology, the adoption of electric vehicles is expected to increase in the coming years. As more and more electric vehicles hit the road, the demand for bidirectional charging will increase. Lastly, there is a growing need for grid services such as frequency regulation, which bidirectional charging can provide.

Additionally, this need is expected to grow as the share of renewable energy in the grid mix increases, as solar and wind energy are inherently intermittent and require flexible solutions like bidirectional charging to help balance the grid. As a result, the bidirectional electric vehicle charger market is expected to flourish in the forecast period.

05/21/2025 - 07:00 AM

TORONTO, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electra Battery Materials Corporation (NASDAQ: ELBM; TSX-V: ELBM) (“Electra” or the “Company”) commends the Ontario government for its landmark C$500 million Critical Minerals Processing Fund, unveiled in the 2025 provincial budget announced last week. The investment commitment represents a significant step toward building a domestic, vertically integrated supply chain for clean energy technologies.

Prioritizing critical mineral processing in Ontario will strengthen local industry capabilities and accelerate the development of strategic mineral processing projects that feed directly into the province’s growing electric vehicle and battery manufacturing ecosystem. The fund is expected to create economic opportunities in key Northern Ontario communities and support the growth of clean energy and electric vehicle manufacturing — outcomes that align closely with Electra’s mission to build a sustainable North American battery materials supply chain.

At the 2025 SelectUSA Investment Summit in Washington, D.C., Electra CEO Trent Mell engaged with key stakeholders, including newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, and Canada’s Ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman. The Summit brings together global business leaders, U.S. government officials, and international representatives. This event included an ""Industry Spotlight on Critical Minerals,"" underscoring growing bilateral urgency to reduce foreign dependence.

In addition, Electra extends its congratulations to the newly appointed federal cabinet ministers. Their leadership will be instrumental in advancing both national and regional priorities in clean energy, critical minerals, and economic resilience. The Company looks forward to continued collaboration with all levels of government and working together to support industrial innovation, energy security, and sustainable growth.

“As the global race to secure critical mineral supply chains intensifies, the need for a North America-first approach has never been clearer. Recent U.S. policy discussions on partnerships for mineral rights, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, underscore the strategic importance of securing domestic resources,” said Mr. Mell. “Electra remains at the forefront of this effort, with the only cobalt sulfate refinery on the continent, positioned to play a vital role in both new energy innovation and national security.”

Electra is committed to building a resilient and secure supply chain that supports North American energy independence in response to growing global competition, particularly in the face of China’s dominance in critical mineral processing and battery supply chains. As gigafactory timelines evolve and the clean energy market rapidly expands, Electra’s leadership in refining cobalt and other critical materials will be essential to supporting this transformation.

These barriers make it nearly impossible for many to access the cost savings and resilience offered by clean energy technologies like solar panels and battery storage.","In short:

Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s, becoming the main driver of sea level rise.

By 2050, just 20 cm of sea level rise could cost $1 trillion annually in damage to 136 major coastal cities.

Scientists say a rise of one to two meters is now unavoidable, with the “safe limit” for adaptation likely already surpassed at 1C of warming.

Key quote:

“What we mean by safe limit is one which allows some level of adaptation, rather than catastrophic inland migration and forced migration, and the safe limit is roughly one cm a year of sea level rise.”

— Jonathan Bamber, professor at the University of Bristol

Why this matters:

Sea level rise is no longer a distant risk. It’s a relentless force reshaping coastlines and economies. As the planet warms, polar ice sheets are melting at alarming rates, swelling oceans and threatening coastal areas where billions of people live. The most vulnerable populations — those in low-lying developing nations like Bangladesh or small island states — will face the harshest consequences. But even wealthy countries with sophisticated defenses, like the Netherlands or parts of the U.S., are not immune to the long-term costs and upheaval. Sea level rise amplifies the impact of storms, floods infrastructure, contaminates drinking water, and erodes habitats. Crucially, these shifts won’t happen centuries from now—they’re accelerating within our lifetimes.

In short:

The Trump administration has dismantled key climate research efforts, dismissed scientists, and stopped tracking greenhouse gas emissions, undermining decades of work that informs climate policy.

Cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Weather Service are eroding the nation’s capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, with federal aid denied to communities hit by recent tornadoes and floods.

The administration is halting clean energy projects, slashing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations on pollution, and withdrawing from international climate efforts, positioning the U.S. as a global outlier in climate denial.

Key quote:

“Here we see a government that is taking a hatchet to the scientific enterprise. It’s the kind of destruction that will have implications for a while to come.”

— Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program, Union of Concerned Scientists

Why this matters:

Scientific data from agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration underpins early warning systems for hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts—tools that save lives and limit destruction. The Trump administration’s cuts to climate research, pollution regulation, and disaster preparedness hollow out that safety net, leaving communities more vulnerable. Without consistent tracking of emissions or federal support for resilience, local governments are left to fend for themselves, often without the resources or expertise required. The rollback of EPA authority and clean energy investments also threatens public health: Pollution from transportation and power plants contributes to heart and lung disease, particularly in children and low-income communities. And with climate disasters becoming more frequent and severe, the lack of a coordinated federal response magnifies both human suffering and economic losses.

Related: New FEMA chief says states must take the lead on disaster recovery this hurricane season

In short:

Forty-two people died as tornadoes swept across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia, highlighting the importance of fast and accurate weather alerts to save lives during rapidly developing disasters.

The National Weather Service has lost more than 10% of its staff amid budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency, leaving 40% of forecasting offices short-staffed and impairing use of vital tools like Doppler radar and weather balloons.

While some observers credit local efforts for maintaining alert coverage in this storm, experts warn that broader, long-term damage to the alert infrastructure may be felt as hurricane season approaches.

Why this matters:

As climate patterns shift, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing, from hurricanes to fast-moving tornado outbreaks. Accurate, timely forecasts can be the difference between life and death, especially when storms strike with little warning. The National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration form the backbone of the nation’s severe weather alert system, but proposed budget reductions threaten this safety net. These cuts come at a dangerous time, as climate volatility accelerates and populations grow in vulnerable areas like the Midwest and Southeast.

In short:

The Empire Wind project, stalled by an April executive order halting offshore wind work, will resume after Hochul held multiple calls with Trump urging him to lift the stop-work order.

Equinor had been losing $50 million per week during the pause and warned it would cancel the project if no resolution came soon. Work had already begun onshore in Brooklyn, with offshore construction set to start this month.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum praised Hochul’s willingness to work with the administration on energy infrastructure.

Trump has pushed to revive the Constitution Pipeline to bring shale gas from Pennsylvania to the Northeast; New York State did not provide environmental approval for that project and it was abandoned in 2020.

Key quote:

“We feel strongly that this is bigger than Empire Wind and the offshore wind industry. This is about energy projects that are under construction being stopped.”

— Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewable Americas

Why this matters:

The Empire Wind case shows just how precarious the clean energy transition remains. Offshore wind promises thousands of union jobs and zero-emission electricity for millions, but abrupt reversals in federal support threaten to chill investment and derail progress. The Trump administration’s initial pause on Empire Wind sent shockwaves through the industry, signaling that even shovel-ready projects with major capital invested could be upended by political whim.

In short:

More than 480 European “green” funds governed by the EU’s sustainable finance disclosure regulations (SFDR) regulations collectively held $33.5 billion in fossil fuel stocks, including stakes in ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, and TotalEnergies.

Fund managers, including BlackRock, JP Morgan, and DWS, argue these investments enable shareholder influence over fossil companies, though climate analysts say the companies are not aligned with Paris climate agreement targets.

Upcoming European Securities and Markets Authority guidelines — set to take effect May 21— will allow regulators to hold funds accountable for the use of sustainability-related labels, though the rules are not legally binding.

Key quote:

“It is diabolical for banks and asset managers to invest billions in major fossil fuel companies under the rubric of ‘green investing’ when we need to accelerate investments in non- and low-carbon energy, in carbon efficiency, and in carbon removal technologies.”

— Richard Heede, Climate Accountability Institute

Why this matters:

The term “green investing” carries a promise: that your money supports environmental progress. But when so-called sustainable funds funnel billions into oil giants, that promise is broken. Funds operating under vague or loosely enforced definitions of sustainability risk misleading individuals, institutions, and governments alike. While regulators have begun to react — tightening rules around fund naming and disclosure — investors may still find themselves funding fossil fuel expansion through portfolios meant to fight climate change.

In short:

Detroit’s St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center is still waiting on $2 million in federal funding for clean energy upgrades, one of many delays linked to Trump’s freeze on Biden-era climate equity funds.

Neighborhoods historically subjected to redlining suffer higher rates of power outages, energy shutoffs, and barriers to clean energy adoption, including aging infrastructure and housing stock.

Community solar and subsidy programs show promise but remain inaccessible to many due to state restrictions, utility resistance, or poor program design.

Key quote:

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don't fix that, we'll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system.”

— Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan

Why this matters:

Across the country, historically redlined communities, often home to Black and brown residents, face compounding challenges: old electrical grids, outdated housing, and disproportionately high utility bills. These barriers make it nearly impossible for many to access the cost savings and resilience offered by clean energy technologies like solar panels and battery storage. And the problem isn’t just technical — it’s systemic. Federal support programs meant to close this gap have been frozen or gutted, while utilities often prioritize upgrades in wealthier, whiter neighborhoods. The result is a power system that reinforces old inequalities even as it modernizes.

Ontario’s Progressive Conservative government plans to cut emergency preparedness funding and slash wildfire response budgets, despite recent ice storms and ongoing evacuations in northern communities.

The province is recommitting to large infrastructure projects like Highway 413 and a pumped hydro energy project in Georgian Bay, while blocking cities from using congestion pricing and failing to fund new transit.

The Ford government is accelerating mining development in the Ring of Fire, despite unresolved environmental assessments and opposition from some First Nations over lack of proper consultation.

Key quote:

“We always put money aside for what we can’t predict might happen. But we’re there financially. We’ve always been there, whether it’s fire, floods or whatever may come.”

— Peter Bethlenfalvy, Ontario Finance Minister, addressing cuts to emergency preparedness and firefighting

Why this matters:

As climate change accelerates, Ontario is leaning into fossil fuels and car-based infrastructure while scaling back climate mitigation and adaptation. The province's emissions-free electricity supply has eroded sharply, down to 84% last year from 96% seven years ago, as natural gas replaces phased-out renewables. At the same time, Ontario’s budget slashes critical spending on wildfire management and emergency preparedness — services already strained by extreme weather. Environmental advocates say the current policy direction undermines environmental safeguards and public transparency, along with sidelining urban transit, clean building standards, and congestion reduction tools that could make cities more resilient and livable in a warming world.

The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen.","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The world’s sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt economies and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency’s report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity — but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.

It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.

China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75%. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.

“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ”The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”

Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.

“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. “And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.”

Market forces are important in developing new sources but won’t be enough. “There is a need for well-designed government policies” in the form of financing and other measures, he said.

China is a massive global source of critical minerals required for a wide range of goods that includes computer chips, robots, electric autos, batteries, drones, and military equipment. It also dominates the refining and processing of many of these critical minerals, including lithium, cobalt, graphite and more.

China has placed export limits of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation’s ability to find quick alternatives. Without access to China’s significant reserves, U.S. manufacturers have a harder time competing amid mounting global supply tensions.

Trump has made reducing U.S. dependence on foreign critical minerals a core tenet of his first 100 days back in office as part of a national security and economic resilience agenda.

This goes beyond China; the Trump administration finalized a rocky deal with Ukraine granting American access to the nation’s vast mineral resources earlier this month.

Trump is also looking to expedite deep-sea mining in international waters, much to the chagrin of environmental groups. He called for a boost in the domestic copper industry in a February executive order alongside other calls for the federal government to fast-track new mine permits; has reviewed a minerals proposal from Congo, a conflict-riddled nation also rich with mineral reserves; and attempted to strong-arm Greenland into providing more of its minerals to the U.S.

The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned however that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30% shortfall by 2030.

Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make good on the promises Republicans have made — and that’s why advocacy groups and other stakeholders are coming out in droves to urge Congress to immediately pass the landmark bill.

Here’s what they’re saying about the One, Big, Beautiful Bill:

American Exploration & Production Council CEO Anne Bradbury: “On behalf of America’s leading independent producers of oil and natural gas, AXPC urges all House Republicans to pass the budget reconciliation and advance President Trump’s agenda to unleash American energy. This legislation takes decisive steps towards improving our nation’s energy landscape by repealing the Biden-era menthane tax, unlocking oil and gas development on federal lands, and alleviating regulatory pain points that have stymied the build out of American energy. Passing this bill is essential to secure America’s energy dominance through smart, durable reforms.”

NumbersUSA: “For decades Congress has promised to secure the border and failed to deliver. The House Reconciliation bill delivers on the promise of building the border wall, 10,000 ICE officers, detention beds, historic funding for Customs and Border Patrol and a tax on money illegal aliens send out of the country. The Trump Administration needs this funding to deport illegal aliens, millions of whom entered the country over the last four years. The American people voted in mess this last election to secure our borders and return law and order to our immigration system. Congress must not fail them.”

Airlines for America: “A4A strongly supports the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and applauds the inclusion of a critical investment of $12.5 billion in modernizing the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic facilities, systems and infrastructure. For years, A4A has been sounding the alarm about ATC staffing shortages and antiquated equipment, such as copper wires and floppy disks. Given the challenges facing the air traffic system, these funds are a vital down payment on updating the technology that guides 27,000 flights, 2.7 million passengers and 61,000 tons of cargo every day—all while driving five percent of our nation’s GDP. The legislation also makes smart, strategic investments in Customs and Border Protection personnel and training for the aviation workforce of tomorrow while supporting American energy dominance in aviation fuel production. We encourage the House to pass this legislation and deliver on the Department of Transportation’s plan to help keep our skies safe and efficient. Modernizing our National Airspace System is necessary, and passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will help ensure the United States has a world-class aviation system.”

National Federation of Independent Business SVP for Advocacy Adam Temple: “On behalf of NFIB, the nation’s leading small business advocacy organization, I write in support of the Committee’s legislative proposal to comply with reconciliation instructions contained within the concurrent resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2025, H. Con. Res. 14. As written, this is one of the most pro-small business pieces of tax legislation in recent history.”

CTIA—The Wireless Association President and CEO Ajit Pai: “The wireless industry urges swift passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The critical spectrum and tax provisions in this legislation will allow the wireless industry to invest, create jobs, propel economic growth, and secure America’s edge in innovation.”

Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz: “House Republicans’ big, beautiful reconciliation bill is exactly what the country needs to jumpstart the economy and guarantee the safety and prosperity of Americans for decades to come. It helps people of all backgrounds but especially small businesses, the backbone of our economy, by making permanent and expanding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It increases the small business tax deduction used by 26 million entrepreneurs annually from 20% to 23% — a tax cut Job Creators Network has long been the leading voice for. The bill also restores 100% immediate expensing, allowing businesses to write off investments, expansion, and modernization. It will empower Main Street to expand, hire, raise wages, and reinvest in their communities, while also providing significant tax relief for ordinary folks. All Republicans should unite to support this historic reconciliation bill. We need Tax Cuts Now.”

Business Roundtable President & COO Kristen Silverberg: “Business Roundtable strongly supports the House budget reconciliation bill. This important legislation ensures a more competitive, pro-growth tax system, secures our borders and takes the necessary step of raising the debt ceiling. We urge members of the House Budget Committee to swiftly pass this measure.”

Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council President & CEO Karen Kerrigan: “SBE Council strongly supports the One Big, Beautiful Bill and urges every member of the U.S. House to vote in support of this economically powerful package. The One Big, Beautiful Bill provides entrepreneurs and small businesses with the tools and policy environment they need to invest in their businesses and workforce, to innovate and strengthen their firms, and to lead America’s economic resurgence.”

Associated Equipment Distributors SVP Daniel B. Fisher: “This legislation will spur economic growth and job creation, incentivize capital investment, and ensure AED members, which supply and maintain the equipment needed to build, feed and fuel America, remain competitive for years to come. We urge support for the bill and look forward to working with the entire House of Representatives to approve it as soon as possible.”

National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association Interim CEO Michele Stanley: “NSSGA appreciates that ‘The One, Big, Beautiful Bill’ includes aggregates industry priorities, such as bonus depreciation, the Research and Development Tax Credit, small business deductions, keeping the corporate tax rate at the status quo and protecting percentage depletion and estate taxes. Additionally, we appreciate the committee’s commitment to safeguarding associations’ tax-protected status. NSSGA thanks the committee for introducing this bill and encourages the Ways and Means Committee and the House of Representatives to pass this package in a timely manner.”

60 Plus Association Chairman Jim Martin: “It’s a win for seniors across the country. The President and House Republicans are providing much needed tax relief to middle and low-income seniors.”

Association of Mature American Citizens Action SVP Andrew J. Mangione, Jr.: “This bill is a win for seniors, for taxpayers, and for the future of our country. We urge swift passage and full support from lawmakers who value liberty, accountability, and the financial security of AMAC members across the country.”

RATE Coalition Executive Director Dan Combs: “This legislation is a clear step toward preserving a tax code that spurs job creation, boosts wages, and builds on the legacy created by President Trump and Congress under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Now is the time for Congress to come together, finish the work, and deliver a strong, stable economic foundation for American workers and businesses. A competitive corporate tax rate is key to keeping the U.S. ahead and a top destination for investment in the global economy. This bill goes a long way towards making that possible.”

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi: “We’ve said from the start: No Tax on Tips should include @Uber drivers & couriers. Grateful the new House Ways & Means bill does just that. Thanks to @POTUS and @RepJasonSmith for backing all tipped workers—no matter how they work. Let’s get this done!”

DoorDash CEO Tony Xu: “Thanks to @POTUS and @RepJasonSmith, millions of Dashers may soon get a tax break on their hard-earned tips. Following advocacy from 40K Dashers, including dozens in DC last week, the House’s budget bill is an important step in making #NoTaxOnTips a reality.”

Americans for Prosperity Chief Government Affairs Officer Brent Gardner: “The Republican Party has an incredible opportunity to put the country on the right track for long-term economic growth by making the Trump Tax Cuts permanent and avoiding the largest tax hike in American history. This bill is smart pro-growth policy that would provide certainty for American businesses and lead to sustained prosperity for millions of working Americans. This legislation also takes meaningful action to cut billions in special interest giveaways, reforming broken programs, and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse – ensuring that taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars are spent wisely. It’s about making government work better for the people it serves. We’re encouraged by the foundation laid in the House and stand ready to work with Senate lawmakers to get this measure across the finish line. The moment for action is now. We urge all Members to support this legislation and put our economy on the path to growth and opportunity.”

Concerned Veterans for America Executive Director John Vick: “Failing to extend President Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would impose the largest tax hike in U.S. history on American families and businesses. Congress must seize its opportunity to protect our long-term prosperity while improving the lives of middle-class Americans. The American people sent a clear message last November: they are tired of massive tax hikes, higher prices, reckless government spending, and Biden-era “Green New Deal” giveaways. Congress must answer this call by moving budget reconciliation forward. As veterans, we fought for a better future for our fellow Americans. We also understand that a strong economy is the bedrock of American strength at home and abroad. Today, CVA calls on Congress to act to protect the promise of long-term economic growth and prosperity for all Americans.”

The LIBRE Initiative Executive Director Sandra Benitez: “We commend the House Budget Committee for taking a positive step to ensure that we continue extending tax relief to middle-class families and job creators, including Latinos who cannot afford a tax hike. Now it is critical that the House of Representatives have a full House vote as quickly as possible and approve this pro-growth legislation to help unleash prosperity and opportunity for all. The LIBRE Initiative looks forward to educating and activating the Latino community on the benefits of this critical legislation.”

America First Policy Institute: “Conservatives must deliver to the American people! The One, Big, Beautiful Bill cuts taxes for ALL Americans, secures the border, stands up to the woke mob by empowering parents and protecting women and children, and much more!”

Independent Women Center for Economic Opportunity Director Patrice Onwuka: “Passing the Big, Beautiful Bill is an imperative. The stakes are high. If Congress fails to pass this bill, average Americans face a massive 22% tax increase, 40 million families will see their Child Tax Credit slashed in half, and 26 million small businesses face a 43.4% top tax rate. Republicans should not hold up tax relief for American families and small businesses to bail out high-tax blue states.”",https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WH47-Social-Share-Card.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:35.425336

2 Republican and a leading advocate of undoing the waivers, said that the fight was a “smoke screen” for Democrats who want to use federal waivers to ban gas-powered cars nationwide.
Despite reluctance to overrule the parliamentarian, Republicans say they are confident they have the votes to move forward.
“The only people that have attempted to get rid of the legislative filibuster are the Democrats,” Mr. Thune said on Tuesday.","Senate Republicans plan to move on Wednesday to overturn California’s landmark vehicle emissions law, using a little-known federal statute that allows Congress to strike down regulations and that Democrats claim would erode the filibuster.

The fight has serious implications for both environmental policy and the institution of the Senate. Republican leaders intend to use the statute, the Congressional Review Act, to force a vote to nullify federal waivers granted in the last days of the Biden administration to allow California to phase out gas-powered vehicles by 2035 and impose other emissions reductions.

They are acting even though the Government Accountability Office and their own Senate parliamentarian determined that the Environmental Protection Agency waivers were not subject to the review law, which is meant to give the legislative branch a way of undoing federal regulations, not state ones.

“Republicans seem to be putting the wealth of the big oil industry over the health of our constituents,” Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, said on Tuesday as he and other Democrats laid out their case against the Republican effort to undo his state’s emissions requirements.

Because resolutions of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act need only a majority vote, they are some of the only legislation that can avoid a filibuster in the Senate. Democrats have accused the Republicans of “going nuclear” on the California emissions standards. In the Senate, that refers to employing a simple majority to overrule precedents on issues that otherwise require a 60-vote supermajority under the filibuster.

Republican leaders dismissed the Democratic complaints. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, who has vowed to protect the filibuster, said the dispute was over the “novel and narrow” issue of whether an E.P.A. waiver constituted a rule — not anything central to the future of the filibuster governing legislation.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican and a leading advocate of undoing the waivers, said that the fight was a “smoke screen” for Democrats who want to use federal waivers to ban gas-powered cars nationwide.

“What they are trying to do is force-feed the American public electric vehicles that the public doesn’t want and can’t afford,” Mr. Barrasso said. He said Republicans were protecting the power of the Senate to determine what could be considered under the law.

“The determination is going to be made by the Senate,” he said in an interview.

The House, with significant Democratic support, voted two weeks ago to overturn the waivers, sending the matter to the Senate.

Senators are traditionally reluctant to upend their chamber’s rules, fearing that “going nuclear” will come back to haunt them when the other party gains control. But it has happened repeatedly in recent years, with serious repercussions.

In 2013, Democrats, frustrated at Republican obstruction of federal appeals court nominees, overruled Senate precedents to establish that a simple-majority vote was sufficient for confirming most judicial and executive branch nominees. When Republicans gained control in 2017, they then lowered the filibuster threshold for Supreme Court justices to a majority as well, empowering President Trump to name three justices to the court over Democratic objections.

Republicans have sought to focus the dispute mainly on the Government Accountability Office, arguing that the watchdog agency improperly interfered when it determined that the emissions waivers were not subject to congressional review.

Mr. Thune said it was “the first time ever the Government Accountability Office has decided to insert itself into the process and affirmatively declare an agency rule submitted to Congress as a rule is not a rule,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary deviation from precedent for an agency that should be defending Congress’s power.”

Democrats said the Republican focus on the watchdog agency was a diversion, and took to the floor on Tuesday evening to note that the Senate parliamentarian — the nonpartisan protector of Senate rules — had also determined that the waivers did not qualify for filibuster-free consideration under the Congressional Review Act.

“To use the C.R.A. in a way that Republicans propose is going nuclear,” said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader. “No ands, ifs or buts.”

He and other senators said a decision to overrule the Government Accountability Office and the parliamentarian would have future consequences as lawmakers try to take advantage of a new route around the filibuster.

“Just as we saw with judges, there is no cabining a decision to overrule the parliamentarian,” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. “And so any suggestion that this situation is ‘exceptional’ or that the precedent it would create would be ‘narrow’ is magical thinking.”

Democrats also said they feared that the Republican action on the California waivers was a prelude to Republicans potentially overruling the parliamentarian on the major tax and spending cuts legislation expected to be considered later this year. That measure is subjected to special rules sparing it from a filibuster that are enforced by the parliamentarian.

Despite reluctance to overrule the parliamentarian, Republicans say they are confident they have the votes to move forward.

Their efforts to nail down the votes got a significant boost last week when Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the former party leader and a staunch defender of the filibuster, told colleagues in a private luncheon that he would support the move, according to people who attended the lunch but spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.

Republicans also said that Democratic hypocrisy on the issue was rampant, given that many of those complaining about their push on the California standards were ready in 2022 to jettison the filibuster on voting rights legislation, a move that would have significantly eroded the reach of the legislative filibuster. But Democrats fell short of the required votes in that instance.

“The only people that have attempted to get rid of the legislative filibuster are the Democrats,” Mr. Thune said on Tuesday. “Every single one of them up there that’s popping off and spouting off has voted — voted literally — to get rid of the legislative filibuster.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/21/multimedia/21dc-filibuster-gpmk/21dc-filibuster-gpmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 06:03:03.112197

“A construction permit is part of a two-step licensing process.
You get a construction permit, and then you’re allowed to start building the plant.","Senate Republicans plan to vote this week on California’s ability to set its own emissions standards, Majority Leader John Thune said on the Senate floor Tuesday. Since 1967, the Environmental Protection Agency has granted California a waiver to set stricter-than-federal restrictions on emissions in acknowledgment of the state’s unique air pollution challenges, including smog; due to the state’s size, however, those standards have largely been adhered to by automakers nationally. The House voted earlier this month to end California’s waiver — which has long been opposed by Republicans, who’ve called it, erroneously, an “electric vehicle mandate” — although there had been some uncertainty over whether the Senate would take up the vote, since Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough and the Government Accountability Office had both ruled that the EPA waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act, which is what Republicans have called upon to attempt to overturn it.

Thune confirmed that the chamber would take up the three House resolutions unwinding the California waiver, claiming Democrats were “attempting to derail a repeal by throwing a tantrum over a supposed procedural problem.” In response, Senator Alex Padilla of California, a Democrat, said, “If this attempt is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, not only for our clean energy economy, the air our children breathe, and for our climate, but for the future of the CRA and for the Senate as an institution.”

2. For the first time, U.S. utility seeks permit for an SMR

The Tennessee Valley Authority is seeking a permit to build a small modular reactor, the Journal-News reports, the first utility to do so. On Tuesday, the TVA — the nation’s largest public power provider — took another step toward adding an SMR to its nuclear fleet by applying for a construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build a site on Tennessee’s Clinch River.

While the project had previously been touted by the Biden administration as helping advance the nation toward “a clean energy future,” my colleague Matthew Zeitlin noted that language has vanished from the construction application, which now argues the SMR is the next step in “establishing America’s energy dominance to power artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.” Regardless of spin, the fastest Clinch River could go into operation is about five years, Adam Stein, the director of the nuclear energy innovation program of the Breakthrough Institute, told Matthew.

3. CATL goes public — with no onshore American investors

The world’s biggest manufacturer of electric vehicle batteries, CATL, raised $4.6 billion in its debut on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Tuesday, making it the largest share offering of 2025 to date. The stock surged 16% over the subscription price, although onshore U.S. investors were largely shut out by the company in order to “limit its exposure to U.S. legal liability,” with the Pentagon having put the Fujian province-based company on a blacklist earlier this year for its alleged links to China’s military, Bloomberg writes.

CATL’s manufacturing is done almost entirely within China, although the company has said it will use 90% of its proceeds from the Hong Kong offering on the construction of a new factory in Hungary, The Economist reports. Though the company faces an uphill battle making inroads in the U.S. due to slowing demand for electric vehicles and scrutiny of Chinese companies by American politicians, The Economist adds that CATL also has “plenty of room for further expansion,” including growing its “higher-margin energy-storage business.”

4. Honda to pivot from EVs to focus on hybrids

Japanese automaker Honda announced Tuesday that it will pivot away from its investment in electric vehicles in order to focus on growing demand for hybrids, Reuters reports. The company revised its electrification investment from about $69 billion to $48 billion, while at the same time planning 13 hybrid models between 2027 and 2031.

Honda cited a slowdown in EV sales as justification for its decision, though as Electrek points out, “It’s estimated that this year – not 2030 – 25% of cars sold globally will be EVs,” and that “any company that sells less than that is lagging behind the curve, losing ground to companies that are ready for the transition that is already happening.” Electrek adds that Honda’s profits have largely slipped due to competition in the Chinese auto market from domestic EVs.

5. Even 1.2 degrees of warming could ‘profoundly alter’ world’s coastlines: report

If the world merely sustains the current level of warming, at 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, ice melt off of Greenland and Antarctica could still “profoundly alter coastlines around the world, displacing hundreds of millions of people, and causing loss and damage well beyond the limits of adaptation,” a grim new study published in Nature has found. Even keeping global temperature rise beneath the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold established in the Paris Climate Agreement could result in “catastrophic inland migration and forced migration,” the University of Bristol’s Jonathan Bamber, one of the authors of the report, told The Guardian. In fact, “you don’t slow sea level rise at 1.5,” lead author Chris Stokes of Durham University told CNN. Rather, “you see quite a rapid acceleration.”

Around 230 million people live less than a meter, or 3.2 feet, above sea level, including many residents of Miami. The researchers estimated that due to ice melt, seas could rise 40 inches by the end of the century, requiring “massive land migration on scales that we’ve never witnessed since modern civilization,” Bamber told CNN. As Stokes added, “There’s very little that we’re observing that gives us hope here.”

THE KICKER

Svea Solar

Ikea has begun selling air-to-water heat pumps in Germany, in partnership with Svea Solar. “Sustainable living should be accessible to the masses,” Jacqueline Polak of Ikea Germany said in a statement.

Because of the long lead times for nuclear projects and the promise (for now, at least) of government support, how developers talk about them tends to change along with the partisan revolutions of power.

TVA has been considering the Clinch River site for new nuclear since 2010, applied for an early site permit from the NRC in 2016, and received it in 2019. When TVA announced in 2022 that it would spend another $150 million on the project, in addition to the $200 million that had already been authorized, the public utility’s then-CEO Jeff Lyash justified the investment as part of an overall effort to convert America to clean energy. “We believe advanced nuclear technologies will play a critical role in our region and nation’s drive toward a clean energy future,” he said. The following year, when then-Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholmvisited the Clinch River site, the TVA touted how new nuclear generation would reduce the system’s overall carbon emissions.

As the project marches on under Donald Trump, however, the emissions talk is gone.

In Tuesday’s announcement, “carbon,” “emissions,” and even “clean” go unmentioned. Instead the construction application is “TVA’s next step in … establishing America’s energy dominance to power artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing.”

American energy — and nuclear — policy is in flux, but rhetoric aside, TVA’s nuclear ambitions appear to be an area of continuity between the Trump and Biden administrations. The Trump White House is reportedly working on a series of executive actions to speed up regulatory approvals for nuclear projects and remove some of the NRC’s power and independence.

At the same time, energy policy experts have lambasted Republicans in Congress for their proposed cuts to the Loans Program Office andphase-out of tax credits for nuclear power. Contra the legislative winds, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Tuesday that he supports “every incentive” for nuclear power, and that he favorsextending tax credits for nuclear and geothermal for another 15 years while more quickly phasing out wind and solar credits.

While this is not the first construction permit application for a SMR, it is the first for a utility that seeks to connect the planned reactor to the grid. Both the Bill Gates-backedTerraPower and the partnership of X-Energy and Dow have applied for construction permits for reactors.

The TVA application is another step in a long journey towards new nuclear for the power authority, which is one of two organizations to actually turn on a nuclear plant in the United States this century. It’s also a big step for Ontario Power Generation, TVA’s Canadian counterpart, which recently received a construction permit from Canadian regulators to build a BWRX-300. By building the same design multiple times in sequence — first in Ontario, then in Oak Ridge, and then hopefully in Ontario again — the projects’ developers hope to be able to apply lessons learned from one reactor to the next, as well as shuttle specialized workers back and forth between construction sites.

“If you flip flop sites, they can transition from one site that’s ready to another site that’s ready for the stage that needs that speciality. That’s better utilization of workforce and supply chain,” Adam Stein, director of the nuclear energy innovation program of the Breakthrough Institute, told me.

GE-Hitachi, meanwhile, applied to the NRC for a license for its SMR design in 2019. Despite all the excitement and investment around SMRs, there is onlyone licensed design, NuScale’s US600 — and no current plans for anyone to build it.

The fastest the Clinch River project could actually go into operation is about five years, Stein told me. “A construction permit is part of a two-step licensing process. You get a construction permit, and then you’re allowed to start building the plant. Then you need to get an operating license,” he explained.

The environmental review should go quickly, Stein said, because TVA already has its site permit. “They should be able to do less intensive environmental review to make sure that nothing changed in the application versus what it’s already approved,” Stein added.

While TVA is a government entity, it funds itself and operates independently, albeit with a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed board. The board currently does not have a quorum thanks to the Trump administration firing two Biden-appointed members, and would not be able to make a final investment decision on the project until it adds new members. The firings came after Tennessee’s two Republican senators, Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn, wrote an op-ed criticizing the TVA for moving too slowly on its SMR work. TVA also has a new chief executive, Dan Moul, who took over in March, after Lyash announced in January that he intended to resign and looked forward to “spending more time with family.”

Nuclear already comprises over 40% of TVA’s generation capacity. The utility has asked for assistance from the Department of Energy to increase that, including an $800 million grant to help speed up construction at Clinch River and an $8 million grant to specifically defray licensing costs for the SMR.

The Trump administration has shown some friendliness to Biden-era nuclear initiatives, including honoring aloan guarantee to restart the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

Considering the long and uncertain time frame for building any nuclear reactor, it’s almost certain that, if TVA’s application is approved, the project will be completed under a different president than Trump. By then, it might be a carbon-free and emissions-reducing one again.

That number is a reflection of the narrow subset of policies the group modeled and does not take into account Trump’s tax cuts. In theory, those could have a positive effect on GDP that offsets some of the loss. But the effects on energy costs and jobs on their own tell a grim story.

By 2030, the average American would spend $120 more per year on transportation and home energy costs than they otherwise would. By 2035, the increase would climb to more than $230. Lower demand for clean technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels would kill more than 700,000 potential jobs across the economy in 2035.

Energy Innovation isn’t the only group warning of dire consequences. The bill “represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the CEO and president of the Solar Energy Industries Association said in a statement yesterday. The group estimates that the bill would put 287 factories that serve the solar industry at risk of closing or never opening in the first place. Most of those are in red states.

The forecasts stem from key changes the GOP is proposing to make to tax credits that incentivize wind and solar development, domestic manufacturing, and consumer adoption of electric vehicles and energy efficiency upgrades. The bill would end these subsidies earlier than currently planned (though how much earlier is currently in flux), and impose stricter materials sourcing requirements, tighter development timelines, and more rigid project finance rules for the years they remain in effect, making it nearly impossible to use them.

As a result, fewer wind, solar, and energy storage projects would get built. Those that did get built would cost more, meaning that natural gas would set the price in energy markets more frequently. Natural gas would also be more expensive because of higher demand. The Energy Information Administration already expects natural gas costs to rise this year and next, even without changes to tax incentives. Altogether, generating electricity would cost about 50% more in 2035 than it otherwise would, according to Energy Innovation, which would translate to roughly 17% higher bills for consumers.

Budget hawks in the House are now pushing for an even more aggressive phase-out of the green tax credits before they agree to send their legislation to the Senate, and the Republican leadership can afford to lose just three votes on the floor, giving them a narrow window to please everyone. But the earlier phase-out would have little impact on Energy Innovation’s findings, Robbie Orvis, the senior director for modeling and analysis for the group, told me. The existing provisions in the bill that prevent companies from sourcing materials from China would be so difficult to meet that the model assumes the affected credits would be unclaimable beginning next year.

The modeling shows a similar effect in transportation costs. Terminating the tax credit for electric vehicles would lower demand for EVs and increase demand for gasoline, causing prices at the pump to go up. Less demand for EVs would also mean fewer domestic jobs producing them, and fewer jobs producing the components that go into them. Then there’s the overall tightening of purse strings that would come as a result of higher energy costs, which could reduce hiring still further.

Orvis said the estimates for job loss are likely conservative, as the model looks at changes in demand for EVs and other clean technologies but doesn’t do a good job accounting for the changes in supply that would result from early repeal of 45X, the clean manufacturing tax credit.

Notably, energy costs go up in the model despite provisions in the bill that are designed to lower the cost of oil and gas. Those include more frequent lease sales and lower royalty rates for companies that pay to drill on federal lands and waters. But Energy Innovation found that demand-driven price increases more than offset any price declines resulting from these measures.

The tax credit termination also isn’t the only factor here. Energy Innovation included the House’s proposed repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency’s emissions standards for cars and trucks, which amplified the effects. This provision may not make it into the final text, however, as the special rules governing the budget reconciliation process in the Senate prohibit policies that aren’t budgetary in nature. As the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund put it in a memo to reporters, the regulations were issued to protect public health, and while they do result in costs and benefits for Americans and companies, they do not change the federal budget. “Even if Republican leadership tries to claim any budgetary impacts here, they would be clearly incidental to the main purpose of the proposed legislation,” the group said.

Of course, at least seven Senate Republicans have been vocal about their disapproval of the House’s treatment of the tax credits, so the whole thing may still be subject to change.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDI3MTM0MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDExNTM4OX0.FKZXZNikjhqMHjwafFQXghMCeUpJ9ubLtkwyO3ViwGA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-21 09:07:56.309394

Chinese EV and battery companies, like BYD, have grown quickly on the back of strong government investment and subsidies.","Lithium-ion batteries were invented in the United States. But years ago, as part of a push toward electric vehicles, China took the lead in mass-producing them.

Now there's a great race underway to see who will dominate the future of EV batteries.

Chinese automakers are announcing newer, better batteries at a breakneck speed, including vehicles promising 5-minute ""flash charge"" times first demonstrated this spring. And, not coincidentally, more than half of new cars sold in China come with a plug.

In the U.S., plug-in sales are lower and policies promoting EVs are politically divisive. The Trump administration has started the process of rolling back incentives, infrastructure and requirements encouraging them.

But globally, battery-powered cars remain a crucial part of plans to reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change, thanks to their smaller carbon footprint. They're also widely believed to be the technology of the future, and companies want to make sure they can compete in tomorrow's auto market as well as today's. So U.S. companies are still feeling intense pressure to improve their battery offerings. Last week, General Motors engineers in Detroit announced a cheaper long-range battery, and work is frantically underway to unlock even more dramatic innovations.

""Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology,"" says Bob Galyen, a retired executive whose long career in automotive batteries spanned both GM and the Chinese battery giant CATL. Today, profits from making batteries are being poured back into R&D in China, he says. ""Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind.""

But, he says, American labs are still coming up with new ideas: ""There is hope for us.""

In Shanghai, a futuristic auto show

To enter the Shanghai Auto Show this spring, first visitors had to pass through facial recognition scanners. It was a taste of the technology on display inside, one of the main reasons why thousands of people, like Shanghai resident Dai Yiyao, flocked to the event.

Dai was accompanied by his 12-year-old son. ""I brought my kid to see the development, to see what this era is like,"" Dai said. ""He can't be ignorant of it.""

Booth after booth, car company after car company, there was a lot to absorb. Cars that can pivot on the spot. Cars that can operate in water, like a boat. Concept cars with quadcopter rotors. BYD, the world's biggest EV maker by sales and China's top brand, put on display a drone pod that attaches to the roof of a car and opens automatically.

A salesman called it ""the world's first drone system only designed for the vehicle."" The drone, made by the Chinese company DJI, can follow the car automatically, or it can be controlled from inside the car — if there's a traffic jam, the salesman said, you can deploy it to see what's going on ahead of you.

A few steps away, BYD was demonstrating what is perhaps a more consequential development: ""flash charging."" It's car battery charging at 1 megawatt (1,000 kW) — far more power than competitors — with batteries designed to be so efficient that they don't overheat under the high power load.

""How fast is it? It can add two kilometers of range per second, or 400 kilometers in five minutes,"" said an engineer on site who declined to be named, citing company policy.

That's more than three times faster than U.S. market leader: Tesla's Supercharger.

""Charging a mobile phone is slower. We're faster,"" the engineer said.

BYD says it's pioneering fast charging to eliminate anxiety about charge times and limited vehicle range, a major concern for EV owners. It's planning to install 4,000 fast charging stations across China.

None, however, will be installed in the United States. Chinese cars are largely absent from U.S. roads, thanks to a combination of heavy tariffs and U.S. restrictions on web-enabled Chinese car tech.

As a result, U.S. consumers can't buy any of the buzzy Chinese EVs on the market — at least, for now.

In Detroit, remixing the battery ""recipe""

But while Chinese EVs aren't on U.S. streets, they're very much on automakers' minds.

Executives from multiple companies have publicly acknowledged that trade barriers can only go so far. Eventually, companies will have to be able to go toe-to-toe with Chinese counterparts on their merits, or risk being relegated to irrelevance on the global market. And that means better EV batteries.

No American company has announced anything like five-minute charging. But companies are very focused on bringing down battery costs to make EVs more affordable — without sacrificing the long range and large vehicles that American buyers prefer.

GM's new battery chemistry, announced last week, is designed to do just that. It's a ""lithium manganese-rich,"" or LMR, battery, to be produced in partnership with LG Energy Solutions and deployed in vehicles starting in 2028.

Lithium-ion batteries are made up of alternating layers of different chemicals, some of which are more expensive than others. GM says its new battery uses a lot more manganese — which is cheap — and less of pricey materials like nickel and cobalt.

GM says the battery can store almost as much energy as today's most expensive EV batteries, but at a cost comparable to the cheapest version, without compromising on lifespan. It's a little bit like if you made a cake cheaper by cutting back on expensive ingredients, like eggs and butter — but changed how you mixed and baked the cake to keep it just as tasty.

""It's all about: How much of each ingredient, how do you process it, how do you mix it?"" says GM battery engineer Andy Oury. He points out that starting with eggs, milk and butter, you could wind up with anything from scrambled eggs to popovers. The steps you follow determine the final product.

In GM's research and development labs north of Detroit, scientists have been working on this new battery recipe for years. Engineers say they've cracked the right one, and now it's about figuring out how to efficiently produce the battery in huge quantities. That's its own kind of challenge, a little bit like scaling up cake production from a home kitchen to Costco.

Leading journalists on a tour of GM's battery labs, Shriram Santhanagopalan, the company's senior manager of advanced battery cell development, pointed through a window into a sealed, humidity-controlled room featuring a waist-high silver metal device with tubes running in and out. It blends chemicals together, kind of like an oversized KitchenAid mixer, he said.

The chemicals do indeed have the texture of batter. They were about to go on a sheet of foil, get baked, then stacked up like a layer cake. (Tesla's process, by contrast, is to roll up the layers like a jelly roll.)

Santhanagopalan laughed. ""When we hire people, we say that good cooks make good batteries,"" he said.

Bigger breakthroughs are on the horizon

The recipe that GM has cooked up is ""exciting,"" says Evelina Stoikou, with the research company BloombergNEF. It should translate directly into longer range, she says, ""which is quite important for consumers.""

Sam Abuelsamid, a longtime auto analyst now with the strategic communications firm Telemetry, says it has other benefits too. For one thing, while China dominates existing battery supply chains, using more of a cheaper input like manganese can make it easier to find alternative supplies, he says: ""You get that lower cost, but also you've got the ability to source the materials from more places."" (GM has invested in a company called Element 25 that plans to build a U.S. refinery for Australian-sourced manganese.)

At the same time, they both point out, GM's announcement is essentially a tweak to today's battery recipes, offering higher performance at lower cost. It's ""more about optimizing,"" Abuelsamid says, rather than being a ""next-generation"" battery — a radical change in chemistry or design that would lead to dramatically improved performance.

Companies around the world are racing to build those, too. They include batteries based on sodium, for instance, which is cheaper and more abundant than lithium. Or ""solid-state"" batteries, entirely made from solid components instead of the liquid electrolyte used in today's batteries. These have gotten particular attention from the industry and the press because of their potential to be safer and cheaper while storing more energy. A variety of companies are trying to perfect one that's ready for use in a mass-market EV.

No one has nailed it yet — although many companies say they're only a few years away.

Kurt Kelty is GM's vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, after an influential career at Panasonic, Tesla and the battery start-up Sila. He says GM is talking with start-ups about their solid-state technology and continuing to research other radically different battery recipes, while also rolling out more incremental improvements.

He acknowledges in the race for new battery tech, China has an advantage. ""Some of these Chinese companies have massive R&D teams and they're getting a lot of funding from their governments,"" he says. ""It's hard to compete against that, but we've got quite a good, nimble team here.""

At the same time, he points out that the types of batteries that Chinese companies make so well today were developed in the U.S. before being scaled up in Asia, where the companies buying them were located.

Things could work out differently this time, he says — if American scientists can keep innovating new battery tech, and big companies can figure out how to commercialize them here and there's enough domestic demand. ""We can build an amazing battery industry here,"" he says. ""We have the opportunity here to really, really accelerate.""

And it's worth noting that while the U.S. and China are competing, there could be room for collaboration, too. Ford is licensing some technology made by Chinese battery maker CATL for use in American-made vehicles. And many battery experts see the potential for more cooperation, when it makes business sense — even if political tensions and trade wars are a major barrier.

In Shanghai, a sense of confidence

Meanwhile China, which has already built up its domestic battery industry, is in the process of a global expansion.

At the Shanghai auto show, reporters and bloggers were flown in from around the world. Bloomberg reported that BYD alone ""hosted some 150 journalists and influencers from Latin America.""

Geo Taveras, an influencer from the Dominican Republic who makes videos about cars and said he had been flown, all expenses paid, to the show by BYD, was filming a demonstration of flash charging. ""This is happening in real time,"" he said. ""I mean, the technology is already developed. You took the same time when you go to the gas station to put gas in your car.""

Chinese EV and battery companies, like BYD, have grown quickly on the back of strong government investment and subsidies. Years ago, the government recognized that batteries were going to be a key sector and made development of a battery supply chain, among other industries, a strategic priority.

The massive subsidies that followed are one reason they've built such enormous success — although Bob Galyen, who worked for years in China, said it's not the only reason. He said China's experience building consumer electronics for the rest of the world also positioned it for success in batteries — and the ""development and education of the people that go into building batteries,"" including scientists, engineers and factory workers, was also crucial.

Ahead of the auto show, CATL announced that it, too, is rolling out ultra-fast-charging car batteries. It's also launching a battery powered by sodium.

Dai, the Shanghai resident who brought his son to the car show, said China's world-leading technologies are now the envy of the world.

""I told my son, it used to be that we were the ones with our pens out evaluating the cars. Now [foreigners] are taking out cameras, pens, color charts to evaluate our cars,"" he said. ""The times have changed.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1200x675+0+63/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2F7c%2F5ca58a4342fea9b0005db5c7a7ce%2Fgmbatteries01.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 06:02:58.957865

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is warning that legislation recently passed by the House Ways and Means Committee could shut down or prevent nearly 300 solar and battery storage factories from opening. If this bill becomes law without changes, the US could lose enough solar generation by 2030 to power the state of Pennsylvania for a year. That’s 145,000 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity that could vanish.

The SEIA analysis paints a grim picture: Nearly 300,000 US jobs are at risk, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing alone. And here’s the twist, as I’ve pointed out before – about 80% of the jobs and factories at risk are in red states that voted for Trump.

“There is still time to improve this bill, which, as written, represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

The SEIA says the legislation would slam the brakes on solar and storage investments just as energy demand is soaring, thanks partly to the explosion in AI and data centers. SEIA estimates the bill could wipe out $220 billion in potential investments by 2030.

The House bill also repeals the Section 25D residential solar tax credit, which has been a critical driver of solar adoption for middle-class families. Without it, installing solar gets way more expensive – and out of reach for many households.

As Electrek reported last week, solar and wind accounted for almost 98% of new US electrical generating capacity added in Q1 2025, according to new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) data.

Solar and wind also made up an impressive 100% of new capacity in March, and March was the 19th consecutive month in which solar was the largest source of new capacity.

The US needs to add 206.5 gigawatts of new energy capacity by 2030. Solar is expected to deliver nearly three-quarters of that. If the bill guts solar incentives, we’re looking at higher electricity bills and slower economic growth. SEIA says the rollback could drive up consumer energy costs by $51 billion.

Hopper didn’t mince words: “Passing this bill would create a catastrophic energy shortfall, cede AI and tech leadership to China, and damage some of the most vital sectors of the US economy.”

She added that the Senate can still step in with a smarter proposal that aligns with Trump’s push for US energy dominance.

SEIA’s message to lawmakers? Fix the bill or energy production will plummet, blackouts will become more frequent, and the US will face a devastating – and completely avoidable – energy shortage.

Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday morning that the Senate will take up the vote to overturn waivers the Environmental Protection Agency granted to California that allowed the state to phase out gas-powered cars. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the Congressional Review Act — the legislative vehicle Republicans plan to use to overturn the policy — does not apply to waivers.

Ignoring Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough could open the door to ignoring her decisions later this year, when she will decide which policies can be part of the reconciliation bill and which should be subject to a 60-vote threshold filibuster. Democrats have warned that overruling the parliamentarian foreshadows how Republicans approach Senate rules in the near future, particularly as it applies to the Byrd Rule, which restricts what can be part of a reconciliation bill.

Thune dismissed this possibility in this floor speech, saying that Democrats’ concerns “are entirely misplaced.”

Thune called concerns that overruling the parliamentarian on this waiver will eventually open the door to ending the filibuster “hysterical.”

“We are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate,” he said. “The EPA has submitted the waivers to Congress as rules, which is all that Congress has ever needed to decide something under the Congressional Review Act.”

Conservative and liberal legal experts are sharply divided about whether the Senate’s move can be subject to legal challenge because the Senate is making a choice about its own procedures and has the authority to do so. The CRA has been used so rarely since its creation that its boundaries have not been thoroughly tested, and many gray areas remain, experts told NOTUS.

Many automakers and industry alliances lobbied for Congress to take up the repeal of California’s EV mandate, concerned more with the economic consequences of the EV mandate than any question of Senate procedure.

The California Air Resources Board criticized Senate Republicans’ decision to overrule the parliamentarian.

“The use of the Congressional Review Act resolution is inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the Congressional Review Act itself as recognized by both the nonpartisan and well-reasoned analyses of the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian,” a spokesperson with CARB told NOTUS. “The vote does not change CARB’s authority. CARB will continue its mission to protect the public health of Californians impacted by harmful air pollution.”

Instead of the initial plan to invest 10 trillion yen ($69 billion) in an electrification strategy through the fiscal year ending in 2031, Honda is reducing that investment by 3 trillion yen ($21 billion) to 7 trillion yen ($48 billion).

Honda Motor Co. Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe called the decisions “a switch in the planned course,” while stressing the long-term shift toward electrification remained unchanged, just pushed back in time.

Mibe didn't mention U.S. President Donald Trump. But Trump’s policies on tariffs, as well as his lack of enthusiasm for electric vehicles, have Japanese automakers scrambling to adapt.

“The environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day. Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of the EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations,” Honda said in a statement.

Mibe did not give a specific timeline for a new course for electrification. But Honda, which makes the Civic and Accord car models, will be more aggressive in producing hybrids instead, he said.

Honda’s auto plant in Marysville, Ohio, for instance, will be adapted to produce both EVs and hybrids under the new plan.

Mibe pointed to Honda’s motorcycle business as its core strength, as sales continue to grow in India, and Honda’s global market share was steadily rising.

Mibe also said the Tokyo-based automaker was working on the use of various digital technology to strengthen safety, including assisted driving that will bring deaths from traffic accidents down to zero, a longtime Honda goal.

Talks that began late last year to bring together the operations of Honda and Japanese rival Nissan Motor Corp., as well as smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp., in a merger, collapsed earlier this year. Mibe told reporters talks were still ongoing to have the three automakers work together on developing technology. He remained vague and did not say when a deal might be reached.

Nissan is sinking into losses, reducing its work force and shuttering plants. Its new chief executive, Ivan Espinosa, is promising a turnaround by speeding up decision-making.

Honda’s profit for the fiscal year through March slipped 24.5% from the previous year. But much of the negative impact is from external factors like tariffs and sliding sales in China.

“Honda’s profitability outlook remains robust, supported by cost-cutting initiatives,” said Aaron Ho, equity analyst at CFRA Research.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/20/PDTN/83745370007-ap-25140245196395.jpg?crop=4994,2811,x0,y243&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-21 05:04:48.819781

And increasingly, you don’t need to go looking to use AI: It’s being integrated into every corner of our digital lives.","AI’s integration into our lives is the most significant shift in online life in more than a decade. Hundreds of millions of people now regularly turn to chatbots for help with homework, research, coding, or to create images and videos. But what’s powering all of that?

Today, new analysis by MIT Technology Review provides an unprecedented and comprehensive look at how much energy the AI industry uses—down to a single query—to trace where its carbon footprint stands now, and where it’s headed, as AI barrels towards billions of daily users.

This story is a part of MIT Technology Review’s series “Power Hungry: AI and our energy future,” on the energy demands and carbon costs of the artificial-intelligence revolution.

We spoke to two dozen experts measuring AI’s energy demands, evaluated different AI models and prompts, pored over hundreds of pages of projections and reports, and questioned top AI model makers about their plans. Ultimately, we found that the common understanding of AI’s energy consumption is full of holes.

We started small, as the question of how much a single query costs is vitally important to understanding the bigger picture. That’s because those queries are being built into ever more applications beyond standalone chatbots: from search, to agents, to the mundane daily apps we use to track our fitness, shop online, or book a flight. The energy resources required to power this artificial-intelligence revolution are staggering, and the world’s biggest tech companies have made it a top priority to harness ever more of that energy, aiming to reshape our energy grids in the process.

Meta and Microsoft are working to fire up new nuclear power plants. OpenAI and President Donald Trump announced the Stargate initiative, which aims to spend $500 billion—more than the Apollo space program—to build as many as 10 data centers (each of which could require five gigawatts, more than the total power demand from the state of New Hampshire). Apple announced plans to spend $500 billion on manufacturing and data centers in the US over the next four years. Google expects to spend $75 billion on AI infrastructure alone in 2025.

This isn’t simply the norm of a digital world. It’s unique to AI, and a marked departure from Big Tech’s electricity appetite in the recent past. From 2005 to 2017, the amount of electricity going to data centers remained quite flat thanks to increases in efficiency, despite the construction of armies of new data centers to serve the rise of cloud-based online services, from Facebook to Netflix. In 2017, AI began to change everything. Data centers started getting built with energy-intensive hardware designed for AI, which led them to double their electricity consumption by 2023. The latest reports show that 4.4% of all the energy in the US now goes toward data centers.

The carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it’s likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be. According to new projections published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in December, by 2028 more than half of the electricity going to data centers will be used for AI. At that point, AI alone could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households.

Meanwhile, data centers are expected to continue trending toward using dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy (like gas) to fill immediate needs, leaving clouds of emissions in their wake. And all of this growth is for a new technology that’s still finding its footing, and in many applications—education, medical advice, legal analysis—might be the wrong tool for the job or at least have a less energy-intensive alternative.

Tallies of AI’s energy use often short-circuit the conversation—either by scolding individual behavior, or by triggering comparisons to bigger climate offenders. Both reactions dodge the point: AI is unavoidable, and even if a single query is low-impact, governments and companies are now shaping a much larger energy future around AI’s needs.

We’re taking a different approach with an accounting meant to inform the many decisions still ahead: where data centers go, what powers them, and how to make the growing toll of AI visible and accountable.

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X.

That’s because despite the ambitious AI vision set forth by tech companies, utility providers, and the federal government, details of how this future might come about are murky. Scientists, federally funded research facilities, activists, and energy companies argue that leading AI companies and data center operators disclose too little about their activities. Companies building and deploying AI models are largely quiet when it comes to answering a central question: Just how much energy does interacting with one of these models use? And what sorts of energy sources will power AI’s future?

This leaves even those whose job it is to predict energy demands forced to assemble a puzzle with countless missing pieces, making it nearly impossible to plan for AI’s future impact on energy grids and emissions. Worse, the deals that utility companies make with the data centers will likely transfer the costs of the AI revolution to the rest of us, in the form of higher electricity bills.

It’s a lot to take in. To describe the big picture of what that future looks like, we have to start at the beginning.

Part Two: A Query

If you’ve seen a few charts estimating the energy impact of putting a question to an AI model, you might think it’s like measuring a car’s fuel economy or a dishwasher’s energy rating: a knowable value with a shared methodology for calculating it. You’d be wrong.

In reality, the type and size of the model, the type of output you’re generating, and countless variables beyond your control—like which energy grid is connected to the data center your request is sent to and what time of day it’s processed—can make one query thousands of times more energy-intensive and emissions-producing than another.

And when you query most AI models, whether on your phone within an app like Instagram or on the web interface for ChatGPT, much of what happens after your question is routed to a data center remains a secret. Factors like which data center in the world processes your request, how much energy it takes to do so, and how carbon-intensive the energy sources used are tend to be knowable only to the companies that run the models.

This is true for most of the name-brand models you’re accustomed to, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude, which are referred to as “closed.” The key details are held closely by the companies that make them, guarded because they’re viewed as trade secrets (and also possibly because they might result in bad PR). These companies face few incentives to release this information, and so far they have not.

“The closed AI model providers are serving up a total black box,” says Boris Gamazaychikov, head of AI sustainability at Salesforce, who has led efforts with researchers at Hugging Face, an AI platform provider of tools, models, and libraries for individuals and companies, to make AI’s energy demands more transparent. Without more disclosure from companies, it’s not just that we don’t have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

Without more disclosure from companies, it’s not just that we don’t have good estimates—we have little to go on at all.

So where can we turn for estimates? So-called open-source models can be downloaded and tweaked by researchers, who can access special tools to measure how much energy the H100 GPU requires for a given task. Such models are also incredibly popular; Meta announced in April that its Llama models have been downloaded more than 1.2 billion times, and many companies use open-source models when they want more control over outputs than they can get using something like ChatGPT.

But even if researchers can measure the power drawn by the GPU, that leaves out the power used up by CPUs, fans, and other equipment. A 2024 paper by Microsoft analyzed energy efficiencies for inferencing large language models and found that doubling the amount of energy used by the GPU gives an approximate estimate of the entire operation’s energy demands.

So for now, measuring leading open-source models (and adding estimates for all these other pieces) gives us the best picture we have of just how much energy is being used for a single AI query. However, keep in mind that the ways people use AI today—to write a grocery list or create a surrealist video—are far simpler than the ones we’ll use in the autonomous, agentic future that AI companies are hurling us toward. More on that later.

Here’s what we found.

Text models

Let’s start with models where you type a question and receive back a response in words. One of the leading groups evaluating the energy demands of AI is at the University of Michigan, led by PhD candidate Jae-Won Chung and associate professor Mosharaf Chowdhury. We worked with the team to focus on the energy demands of one of the most widely adopted open-source models, Meta’s Llama.

The smallest model in our Llama cohort, Llama 3.1 8B, has 8 billion parameters—essentially the adjustable “knobs” in an AI model that allow it to make predictions. When tested on a variety of different text-generating prompts, like making a travel itinerary for Istanbul or explaining quantum computing, the model required about 57 joules per response, or an estimated 114 joules when accounting for cooling, other computations, and other demands. This is tiny—about what it takes to ride six feet on an e-bike, or run a microwave for one-tenth of a second.

The largest of our text-generation cohort, Llama 3.1 405B, has 50 times more parameters. More parameters generally means better answers but more energy required for each response. On average, this model needed 3,353 joules, or an estimated 6,706 joules total, for each response. That’s enough to carry a person about 400 feet on an e-bike or run the microwave for eight seconds.

Part Three: Fuel and emissions

Now that we have an estimate of the total energy required to run an AI model to produce text, images, and videos, we can work out what that means in terms of emissions that cause climate change.

First, a data center humming away isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If all data centers were hooked up to solar panels and ran only when the sun was shining, the world would be talking a lot less about AI’s energy consumption. That’s not the case. Most electrical grids around the world are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. So electricity use comes with a climate toll attached.

“AI data centers need constant power, 24-7, 365 days a year,” says Rahul Mewawalla, the CEO of Mawson Infrastructure Group, which builds and maintains high-energy data centers that support AI.

That means data centers can’t rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity. One preprint study from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers was 48% higher than the US average. Part of the reason is that data centers currently happen to be clustered in places that have dirtier grids on average, like the coal-heavy grid in the mid-Atlantic region that includes Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. They also run constantly, including when cleaner sources may not be available.

Data centers can’t rely on intermittent technologies like wind and solar power, and on average, they tend to use dirtier electricity.

Tech companies like Meta, Amazon, and Google have responded to this fossil fuel issue by announcing goals to use more nuclear power. Those three have joined a pledge to triple the world’s nuclear capacity by 2050. But today, nuclear energy only accounts for 20% of electricity supply in the US, and powers a fraction of AI data centers’ operations—natural gas accounts for more than half of electricity generated in Virginia, which has more data centers than any other US state, for example. What’s more, new nuclear operations will take years, perhaps decades, to materialize.

In 2024, fossil fuels including natural gas and coal made up just under 60% of electricity supply in the US. Nuclear accounted for about 20%, and a mix of renewables accounted for most of the remaining 20%.

Gaps in power supply, combined with the rush to build data centers to power AI, often mean shortsighted energy plans. In April, Elon Musk’s X supercomputing center near Memphis was found, via satellite imagery, to be using dozens of methane gas generators that the Southern Environmental Law Center alleges are not approved by energy regulators to supplement grid power and are violating the Clean Air Act.

The key metric used to quantify the emissions from these data centers is called the carbon intensity: how many grams of carbon dioxide emissions are produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed. Nailing down the carbon intensity of a given grid requires understanding the emissions produced by each individual power plant in operation, along with the amount of energy each is contributing to the grid at any given time. Utilities, government agencies, and researchers use estimates of average emissions, as well as real-time measurements, to track pollution from power plants.

This intensity varies widely across regions. The US grid is fragmented, and the mixes of coal, gas, renewables, or nuclear vary widely. California’s grid is far cleaner than West Virginia’s, for example.

Time of day matters too. For instance, data from April 2024 shows that California’s grid can swing from under 70 grams per kilowatt-hour in the afternoon when there’s a lot of solar power available to over 300 grams per kilowatt-hour in the middle of the night.

This variability means that the same activity may have very different climate impacts, depending on your location and the time you make a request. Take that charity marathon runner, for example. The text, image, and video responses they requested add up to 2.9 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In California, generating that amount of electricity would produce about 650 grams of carbon dioxide pollution on average. But generating that electricity in West Virginia might inflate the total to more than 1,150 grams.

AI around the corner

What we’ve seen so far is that the energy required to respond to a query can be relatively small, but it can vary a lot, depending on the type of query and the model being used. The emissions associated with that given amount of electricity will also depend on where and when a query is handled. But what does this all add up to?

ChatGPT is now estimated to be the fifth-most visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. In December, OpenAI said that ChatGPT receives 1 billion messages every day, and after the company launched a new image generator in March, it said that people were using it to generate 78 million images per day, from Studio Ghibli–style portraits to pictures of themselves as Barbie dolls.

Given the direction AI is headed—more personalized, able to reason and solve complex problems on our behalf, and everywhere we look—it’s likely that our AI footprint today is the smallest it will ever be.

One can do some very rough math to estimate the energy impact. In February the AI research firm Epoch AI published an estimate of how much energy is used for a single ChatGPT query—an estimate that, as discussed, makes lots of assumptions that can’t be verified. Still, they calculated about 0.3 watt-hours, or 1,080 joules, per message. This falls in between our estimates for the smallest and largest Meta Llama models (and experts we consulted say that if anything, the real number is likely higher, not lower).

One billion of these every day for a year would mean over 109 gigawatt-hours of electricity, enough to power 10,400 US homes for a year. If we add images and imagine that generating each one requires as much energy as it does with our high-quality image models, it’d mean an additional 35 gigawatt-hours, enough to power another 3,300 homes for a year. This is on top of the energy demands of OpenAI’s other products, like video generators, and that for all the other AI companies and startups.

But here’s the problem: These estimates don’t capture the near future of how we’ll use AI. In that future, we won’t simply ping AI models with a question or two throughout the day, or have them generate a photo. Instead, leading labs are racing us toward a world where AI “agents” perform tasks for us without our supervising their every move. We will speak to models in voice mode, chat with companions for 2 hours a day, and point our phone cameras at our surroundings in video mode. We will give complex tasks to so-called “reasoning models” that work through tasks logically but have been found to require 43 times more energy for simple problems, or “deep research” models that spend hours creating reports for us. We will have AI models that are “personalized” by training on our data and preferences.

This future is around the corner: OpenAI will reportedly offer agents for $20,000 per month and will use reasoning capabilities in all of its models moving forward, and DeepSeek catapulted “chain of thought” reasoning into the mainstream with a model that often generates nine pages of text for each response. AI models are being added to everything from customer service phone lines to doctor’s offices, rapidly increasing AI’s share of national energy consumption.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni.

Every researcher we spoke to said that we cannot understand the energy demands of this future by simply extrapolating from the energy used in AI queries today. And indeed, the moves by leading AI companies to fire up nuclear power plants and create data centers of unprecedented scale suggest that their vision for the future would consume far more energy than even a large number of these individual queries.

“The precious few numbers that we have may shed a tiny sliver of light on where we stand right now, but all bets are off in the coming years,” says Luccioni. “Generative AI tools are getting practically shoved down our throats and it’s getting harder and harder to opt out, or to make informed choices when it comes to energy and climate.”

To understand how much power this AI revolution will need, and where it will come from, we have to read between the lines.

Part four: The future ahead

A report published in December by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is funded by the Department of Energy and has produced 16 Nobel Prizes, attempted to measure what AI’s proliferation might mean for energy demand.

In analyzing both public and proprietary data about data centers as a whole, as well as the specific needs of AI, the researchers came to a clear conclusion. Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year. AI-specific servers in these data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity. On the high end, this is enough to power more than 7.2 million US homes for a year.

If we imagine the bulk of that was used for inference, it means enough electricity was used on AI in the US last year for every person on Earth to have exchanged more than 4,000 messages with chatbots. In reality, of course, average individual users aren’t responsible for all this power demand. Much of it is likely going toward startups and tech giants testing their models, power users exploring every new feature, and energy-heavy tasks like generating videos or avatars.

Data centers in the US used somewhere around 200 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, roughly what it takes to power Thailand for a year.

By 2028, the researchers estimate, the power going to AI-specific purposes will rise to between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year. That’s more than all electricity currently used by US data centers for all purposes; it’s enough to power 22% of US households each year. That could generate the same emissions as driving over 300 billion miles—over 1,600 round trips to the sun from Earth.

The researchers were clear that adoption of AI and the accelerated server technologies that power it has been the primary force causing electricity demand from data centers to skyrocket after remaining stagnant for over a decade. Between 2024 and 2028, the share of US electricity going to data centers may triple, from its current 4.4% to 12%.

This unprecedented surge in power demand for AI is in line with what leading companies are announcing. SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and the Emirati investment firm MGX intend to spend $500 billion in the next four years on new data centers in the US. The first has started construction in Abilene, Texas, and includes eight buildings that are each the size of a baseball stadium. In response to a White House request for information, Anthropic suggested that the US build an additional 50 gigawatts of dedicated power by 2027.

AI companies are also planning multi-gigawatt constructions abroad, including in Malaysia, which is becoming Southeast Asia’s data center hub. In May OpenAI announced a plan to support data-center buildouts abroad as part of a bid to “spread democratic AI.” Companies are taking a scattershot approach to getting there—inking deals for new nuclear plants, firing up old ones, and striking massive deals with utility companies.

MIT Technology Review sought interviews with Google, OpenAI, and Microsoft about their plans for this future, and for specific figures on the energy required to inference leading AI models. OpenAI declined to provide figures or make anyone available for an interview but provided a statement saying that it prioritizes efficient use of computing resources and collaborates with partners to support sustainability goals, and that AI might help discover climate solutions. The company said early sites for its Stargate initiative will be natural gas and solar powered and that the company will look to include nuclear and geothermal wherever possible.

Microsoft discussed its own research on improving AI efficiencies but declined to share specifics of how these approaches are incorporated into its data centers.

Google declined to share numbers detailing how much energy is required at inference time for its AI models like Gemini and features like AI Overviews. The company pointed to information about its TPUs—Google’s proprietary equivalent of GPUs—and the efficiencies they’ve gained.

The Lawrence Berkeley researchers offered a blunt critique of where things stand, saying that the information disclosed by tech companies, data center operators, utility companies, and hardware manufacturers is simply not enough to make reasonable projections about the unprecedented energy demands of this future or estimate the emissions it will create. They offered ways that companies could disclose more information without violating trade secrets, such as anonymized data-sharing arrangements, but their report acknowledged that the architects of this massive surge in AI data centers have thus far not been transparent, leaving them without the tools to make a plan.

“Along with limiting the scope of this report, this lack of transparency highlights that data center growth is occurring with little consideration for how best to integrate these emergent loads with the expansion of electricity generation/transmission or for broader community development,” they wrote. The authors also noted that only two other reports of this kind have been released in the last 20 years.

We heard from several other researchers who say that their ability to understand the emissions and energy demands of AI are hampered by the fact that AI is not yet treated as its own sector. The US Energy Information Administration, for example, makes projections and measurements for manufacturing, mining, construction, and agriculture, but detailed data about AI is simply nonexistent.

“Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

Individuals may end up footing some of the bill for this AI revolution, according to new research published in March. The researchers, from Harvard’s Electricity Law Initiative, analyzed agreements between utility companies and tech giants like Meta that govern how much those companies will pay for power in massive new data centers. They found that discounts utility companies give to Big Tech can raise the electricity rates paid by consumers. In some cases, if certain data centers fail to attract the promised AI business or need less power than expected, ratepayers could still be on the hook for subsidizing them. A 2024 report from the Virginia legislature estimated that average residential ratepayers in the state could pay an additional $37.50 every month in data center energy costs.

“It’s not clear to us that the benefits of these data centers outweigh these costs,” says Eliza Martin, a legal fellow at the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard and a coauthor of the research. “Why should we be paying for this infrastructure? Why should we be paying for their power bills?”

When you ask an AI model to write you a joke or generate a video of a puppy, that query comes with a small but measurable energy toll and an associated amount of emissions spewed into the atmosphere. Given that each individual request often uses less energy than running a kitchen appliance for a few moments, it may seem insignificant.

But as more of us turn to AI tools, these impacts start to add up. And increasingly, you don’t need to go looking to use AI: It’s being integrated into every corner of our digital lives.

Crucially, there’s a lot we don’t know; tech giants are largely keeping quiet about the details. But to judge from our estimates, it’s clear that AI is a force reshaping not just technology but the power grid and the world around us.

We owe a special thanks to Jae-Won Chung, Mosharaf Chowdhury, and Sasha Luccioni, who shared their measurements of AI’s energy use for this project.

Have you been curious about purchasing an electric vehicle or an electric bike? Or, maybe you’ve heard about the instant torque of EVs and e-bikes and want to test it out for yourself?

Well, mark your calendars for the upcoming EV Ride ‘n Drive and E-Bike Demo , a hands-on celebration of electric mobility and climate action that puts you in the driver’s seat of the clean energy transition. This year’s EV Ride ‘n Drive and E-Bike Demo will be on Sunday, June 1, from 2-6 p.m. at the Brush Creek Pavilion in Eagle. This event is put on in partnership with Walking Mountains and the Climate Action Collaborative , Clean Energy Economy for the Region , and the town of Eagle .

Whether you’re EV-curious or already dreaming of trading gas for green, this event is your chance to experience the thrill of EVs and e-bikes. With knowledgeable community experts on hand and a local fleet of various EV models, attendees can test drive a wide range of EVs, from zippy compacts to spacious SUVs, and hop on an e-bike for a pedal-assisted ride around downtown Eagle.

The e-bike demo will be supported by several local e-bike shops across Eagle County, and four lucky event participants will have the chance to win a $150 gift card from one of the participating e-bike shops. Even more, this event will include food, live music, an EV 101 workshop, and an e-bike maintenance station!

While this event will bring family fun for everyone, it’s also primarily about action. Every electric mile driven or ridden is a small victory for cleaner air, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and a more sustainable transportation future.

We’re fortunate to have Holy Cross Energy as our primary electric utility in Eagle County, which also happens to be a sponsor of this event. Holy Cross Energy has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy to the electricity grid by 2030, and we’re eager to share that they’re well on their way to achieving this goal. In Eagle County, the transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to carbon pollution, and shifting to electric forms of transportation is one of the most impactful moves we can make, individually and collectively.

Perhaps you’re skeptical about the environmental impact of EVs, and if they’re really all that better than a gas-powered vehicle. First and foremost, the cleaner the electricity used to power the EV, the fewer overall emissions will come from the life cycle of the EV.

In 2023, Holy Cross Energy’s power supply was 50% renewable. The Bronco Plains II Wind Project, which came online in 2024, has raised its renewable portfolio by nearly 25%, meaning that in 2024, our electric utility’s power supply mix was nearly 75% renewably powered. Additionally, EVs are simply more efficient and less wasteful than their gas counterparts. Today’s gasoline-fueled cars waste around 80% of the energy that gets pumped into their gas tanks, due to heat loss and thermodynamics.

EVs, on the other hand, operate with 10 % to 20% energy loss, converting most of the energy put into them into movement. Beyond these essential points, it’s important to consider that EVs don’t idle with air-polluting emissions, and they have regenerative braking that captures energy when slowing down. All to say, even if you aren’t driven by the environmental impact, the efficiency and operational cost savings of an EV should surely spark your interest.

If you leave this event awe-inspired to purchase an EV or e-bike, don’t miss out on the great incentives available for doing so! Consider the following:

Holy Cross Energy e-bike and EV charging rebates

Energy Smart Colorado rebates are administered through Walking Mountains, for EVs and EV chargers

The State of Colorado’s EV tax credit and e-bike tax credit

Federal government clean vehicle tax credits

So, whether you’re a local community member looking for a day of fun, a commuter tired of gas prices, a tech enthusiast, or in the market for a new vehicle, the EV Ride ‘n Drive and E-Bike Demo has something for everyone. The road ahead is electric, and everyone’s invited.

Two of the most contentious issues now awaiting votes would have particularly heavy impacts on California.

One pending measure would cancel, or at least try to cancel, California’s long-standing waiver of federal clean air rules that allows the state to impose tighter restrictions on emissions. More specifically, legislation that passed the House of Representatives — with support from several dozen Democrats — is pending in the Senate and would undermine California’s decree that no new gasoline-powered cars could be sold in the state after 2035.

Another issue is whether a $10,000 cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal tax returns, passed in 2017 during Trump’s first stint as president, will remain in force, be repealed or be altered.

It has the effect of raising federal levies on taxpayers in states with high income tax rates, such as California, and is seen by leaders of those states as punitive. When the cap was enacted, California tax authorities estimated that it would cost Californians another $12 billion a year.

When the House voted a few weeks ago to cancel California’s Clean Air Act waiver — and those of other states that have followed its lead — Gov. Gavin Newsom cried foul, contending that the action illegally invoked the Congressional Review Act.

“Trump Republicans are hellbent on making California smoggy again,” Newsom said in a statement. “Clean air didn’t used to be political. In fact, we can thank Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon for our decades-old authority to clean our air.

“The only thing that’s changed is that big polluters and the right-wing propaganda machine have succeeded in buying off the Republican Party — and now the House is using a tactic that the Senate’s own parliamentarian has said is lawless.”

During his first presidency, Trump tried to cancel California’s waiver but failed. The nation’s automakers, although displeased by the 2035 decree, didn’t back Trump’s move.

That was then and this is now. Sales of zero emission vehicles, which were booming a few years ago, have flattened. California had contended that 35% of new vehicle sales in California would be zero emission cars by 2025, but purchases seem to be stuck at about 25%. Major automakers, such as General Motors, now contend that the 2035 mandate is unrealistic.

On Tuesday, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared that the chamber would soon vote on the waiver, indicating that he has the votes, and it could garner support from some Democrats, as it did in the House. Its passage probably would touch off a legal battle.

The aforementioned deductibility of state and local taxes, dubbed SALT by the issue’s political warriors, is less settled.

“The SALT deduction has become an outsize stumbling block for Republicans trying to pass a $3.8 trillion tax proposal that would extend President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and roll back subsidies for clean energy, among other things,” the New York Times reported last week.

“A group of Republican House members, mostly from New York, New Jersey and California, have vowed to vote no on the package unless the cap, which helped pay for the 2017 cuts and expires this year, is raised or abolished. And even among the holdouts, there is dissension — something that drew attention … during a Republican caucus meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson.”

The issue cuts across party lines, pitting legislators from the most affected states against mostly red states that are largely unaffected. While Trump apparently wants to keep the $10,000 cap, the possibility of raising it, perhaps to $30,000, is kicking around. The issue remains deadlocked.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/022724_EV-Chargers-LA_CC_CM_29.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-21 07:08:11.340516

PLANO, Texas — The top-selling SUV in the United States will exclusively be offered as a hybrid model as part of a redesign of the RAV4 lineup, Toyota Motor announced Tuesday night.

The world's largest automaker said the 2026 Toyota RAV4 only will be offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid, eliminating a traditional gas engine in the vehicle for the first time. It will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, but with hybrid technologies such as batteries and electric motors.

Despite a slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, automakers have looked to hybrid models — which combine electric vehicle technologies with traditional internal combustion engines — to increase performance and help them meet fuel economy regulations.

Toyota, which started offering hybrids with the Toyota Prius in late 1990s, has been a global leader and advocate for hybrid adoption, despite an industry push in recent years for automakers to exclusively offer all-electric vehicles.

Toyota's electrified vehicle sales in the U.S. — including hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles — accounted for 43.1% of the company's 2.3 million units sold domestically in 2024.

Toyota

RAV4 sales increased 9.3% last year to nearly 475,200 units sold, including a 29.3% increase in RAV4 hybrids and 19.3% gain in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids.

Sales of all-electric vehicles and hybrid models reached a record 20% of new car and truck sales in the U.S. last year, to 3.2 million electrified vehicles, according to auto data firm Motor Intelligence. That encompasses 1.9 million hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models, and 1.3 million all-electric models.

Hybrid-only

David Christ, head of the Toyota brand in North America, said the company decided to exclusively offer the RAV4 as a hybrid because of its already established popularity and growing customer demand.

""The hybrid is faster turning; it has more sales orders on it, and the consumers and dealers are asking for it,"" he told CNBC Tuesday during an event at the automaker's North American headquarters. ""It was pretty clear that the consumer is voting for the hybrid.""

Christ said the automaker expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.

Seven of Toyota's current vehicles are exclusively hybrid models, including the Camry and Prius cars, Sienna minivan and Sequoia SUV. RAV4 will be the eighth.

Toyota

RAV4 hybrids accounted for 44% of sales last year, Toyota reported, while plug-in models — which offer all-electric ranges with a traditional engine that needs to be plugged in — were 6.5%.

The redesigned RAV4 is set to go on sale at U.S. Toyota dealerships in later this year. The all-hybrid RAV4 lineup is part of a next-generation redesign of the vehicle that included interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to the vehicle's performance and technologies.

The company declined to disclose pricing until closer to the vehicle's launch. The current RAV4 starts at $30,645. The hybrid variant starts at about $33,700. Pricing includes mandatory delivery fees.

The RAV4 has steadily increased sales since its U.S. introduction for the 1996 model year. Last year's sales of the vehicle increased 9.3% year-over-year to a new record — making it the best-selling non-pickup nameplate in the U.S. last year.

Tariffs

The RAV4 faces new challenges this year with President Donald Trump's ongoing tariffs of 25% on vehicles imported into the U.S., as well as many auto parts.

Toyota produces the RAV4 at a plant in Kentucky, but a majority of its U.S. sales come from vehicles built at a plant in Ontario, Canada. It currently exclusively imports plug-in hybrid models for U.S. consumers from Japan.

Roughly half of Toyota's U.S. sales are imported from outside of the U.S., including 84.3% of RAV4 models, as well as its popular Tacoma midsize pickup truck from Mexico.

Toyota

Mark Templin, chief operating officer of Toyota Motor North America, said the company plans to produce more RAV4 models at its Kentucky plant, but declined to offer specific plans for potential changes in production to mitigate tariffs.

""It'll work its way out. I think we'll build more RAV4s in Kentucky, which will help. But that's such a big volume car. … It was the No. 1 selling vehicle in the entire market, even beating out the F-150,"" he told CNBC. ""Now we're bringing out one that's even better than that car. So, I think that we're going to need multiple plants to build that.""

Cox Automotive reports the RAV4 finished third in sales last year behind the Ford F-Series and Chevrolet Silverado truck models, which include several variants. However, other third-party data firms have said the RAV4 topped sales of the Detroit pickups last year when breaking out the models, such as the Ford F-150 from the larger group.

Toyota's days' supply — an adjusted number based on the rate of sales — has been among the lowest in the automotive industry, especially for the RAV4.

Cox Automotive reports Toyota's recent days' supply is at 29 days and the RAV4 is among the fastest-selling vehicles in the automotive industry. The industry average is 66 days, according to Cox.

Templin said the automaker has been conducting scenario planning for different tariff and production outcomes, but the situation remains fluid amid Trump's trade negotiations with other countries.

""The worst thing for an industry is uncertainty,"" Templin said. ""Consistency is the best thing we could all ask for.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108148250-1747768797659-RAV4.JPG?v=1747768950&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-05-21 05:04:54.814869

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments.","Supporters of electric vehicle ownership said there are a number of advantages to owning one.

Studies show EVs can convert 85% to 90% of their energy into forward movement. A majority of the electricity used in an EV vehicle is American-made and an EV can be charged at home, just like a cellphone.

Despite the benefits and their popularity, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., the Speaker of the House, has proposed removing a $7,500 tax credit for EV owners as part of President Donald Trump's goal to restructure the country's budget.

John Higham, board member of the Electric Vehicle Association, wondered if it will cause potential EV car buyers to back away.

""Do I think if this $7,500 tax credit suddenly disappeared, it's not going to kill the electric vehicle?,"" Higham asked. ""It might slow the acceleration of the adoption of the electric vehicle but it's certainly not going to reverse the trend.""

Trump's budget proposal could pass between the end of May and the end of July. Higham acknowledged the tax credit is a strong motivator for people to buy or lease an electric car. And he expects a 10% to 12% growth rate for purchases. Higham admitted the number could drop to between 8% and 9% if the tax credit disappears.

As of December 2023, the Department of Energy shows slightly more than 26,000 Hoosiers own an electric vehicle.

The Republican controlled House has proposed legislation to extend the tax credit until the end of 2025 and analysts said the largest EV automaker, Tesla, owned by Trump associate Elon Musk, would be affected the most if the tax credit ends. Higham noted the fallout of repealing the tax credit could break down along party lines.

""That economic engine that is in those red districts, where there's new battery manufacturing put in, new automotive manufacturing put in,"" Higham pointed out. ""Those are the voters that are going to feel it the most, are in those red districts. And so there are Republican congressmen who are saying, not quite so fast. It is harder to repeal than I think most people realize.""

In 2024, it is estimated the federal government spent about $2 billion in advance point-of-sale EV tax credit payments. Buzz about the tax removal may push consumers to buy EVs sooner than later, to take advantage of the credit before it disappears.

Some Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, are considering repealing the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives. Supporters of the measure say cuts would threaten jobs in Alaska. The efforts come as Alaska's liquid natural gas supplies will not be enough to meet demand in the state. That means the state may have to begin importing gas causing prices to rise.

Jennifer Hyde, federal infrastructure coordinator at the Alaska Center, hoped clean energy projects could begin benefitting the state before the crisis takes hold.

""We're hoping that communities can seize on IRA funds in order to actualize on solar projects, on wind projects, on hydro projects, on a number of other alternatives before this crisis happens,"" she explained.

Begich and other Republicans signed a letter arguing that the clean energy subsidies in the IRA will undermine America's energy dominance - and inflate energy costs. But Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has supported the clean energy incentives.

Anchorage business owner Ben Kellie is concerned about the impacts of the possible repeal of clean energy incentives on Alaska's economy, and said the incentives can mean major savings for Alaska families.

""This isn't just saving a few cents off of a bill. A lot of these projects are in communities where people are paying over a thousand dollars to heat and light small homes off the road system,"" Kellie said. ""This is real money that not only stays in the community and circulates, but helps families make ends meet through cold winters.""

In 2023, about a quarter of all Alaska energy came from renewable sources.

A bill before Indiana legislators that would have prevented city officials from requesting energy information from large commercial buildings failed in this year's legislative session.

One nonprofit believes if Senate Bill 197/House Bill 1389 had become law, Hoosiers would have faced higher utility bills. The Thriving Buildings Program relies on utility usage data gathered between 2021 and 2025 to help lower utility bills.

Paula Brooks, justice director for the nonprofit Hoosier Environmental Council, said conversations between community stakeholders, public officials and residents about building environments are key to the program's success.

""It gave building owners the opportunity to benchmark -- which is, make comparisons of their energy and water usage -- to be able to identify ways to save money on utility costs and most importantly, improve the air quality, reduce carbon emissions,"" she explained.

A building environment consists of building and construction materials and is a major contributor to global gas emissions. With the program's collected data, it is predicted that public health savings in Indianapolis could reach $77 million by 2030. Indianapolis is responsible for 66% of community-wide greenhouse gas emissions.

Brooks applauds the Thriving Buildings Program because residents feel their voices are being heard as their communities develop. But these voices also oppose President Donald Trump's recent executive orders to build more coal plants to boost electricity generation, and to ensure the EPA is assisting in promoting America's energy security.

Brooks believes there is another alternative to using coal as a power source.

""Renewables is not only the future, but it's happening now. This distribution model that we have now, where the energy companies hold all the power, it's only about 75 years old,"" she continued.

Renewable energy creates opportunities to look at new energy delivery models or ""energy democracy,"" with solar for microgrids. So, rather than having a huge power plant somewhere, she noted, the electricity could be in a community and owned by the community, while contributing to the electric generation for industrial use.

A new report from the Ohio River Valley Institute argued the oil and gas industry, not taxpayers, should cover the cost of plugging up hundreds of thousands of abandoned oil wells across Appalachia.

Plugging wells in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia could cost nearly $40 billion, with most of the burden coming from shale wells.

Dwayne Purvis, founder and principal consultant at Purvis Energy Advisors in Fort Worth, Texas, and co-author of the report, said he analyzed the Ohio River Valley along with other states, finding old shale wells are often unable to fund their own decommissioning.

""Of course, there are some shale wells are getting older and depleting, producing at slower rates, and even some that are shut in or marginal,"" Purvis explained. ""What we did in this study that was new for the first time, was to offer ideas on how financial assurance reform can address this disparity.""

Purvis pointed out there are currently more than 265,000 unplugged non-shale wells across the three states too, many of which also pose environmental risks. He added hundreds of thousands more were plugged decades ago but often to outdated standards, meaning they may still leak.

Purvis noted the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law jump-started efforts to plug oil wells but the funding was never meant to be permanent. He contended operators should pay for decommissioning the wells but acknowledged many cannot afford to do it.

""The next best option is what we've offered, that it needs to come from, the money for decommissioning, needs to come from other companies in the oil and gas business, who do have the income necessary to cover the liabilities of the industry as a whole in order to protect the public,"" Purvis outlined.

According to the report in the three states studied, Purvis' proposal would directly increase oil and gas employment by an estimated 32% and create more than 19,000 new jobs.

“There’s a lot that can be done to revitalize West Virginia,” he told me last fall.
West Virginia therefore faces a dire economic situation, with a poverty rate well above the national average, falling life expectancy, and a declining population.
In Ravenswood, West Virginia, BHE Renewables had broken ground on a 2,000-acre project.
He shirked child support, and without her solar job, she couldn’t have afforded her son’s school supplies or doctor visits.","Nine months ago, Marqees, 42, began a training program for adults facing employment barriers and felt energized about his future. His program in Huntington, West Virginia—once dubbed “America’s drug death capital” —was preparing people for careers in solar, and Marqees felt drawn to projects on abandoned mine lands. Though his father worked in coal, the national coal miner workforce has fallen from 900,000 in 1923 to about 40,000 today. West Virginia has fewer than 4,500 such positions.

Drug probation had taken Marqees from McDowell County, West Virginia, to Huntington, where he completed rehabilitation and entered transitional housing. McDowell is the poorest county in the state, and one of the most remote. It has lost 83 percent of its population since 1950. Marqees described the people still there as “those who couldn’t afford to leave.” Securing a spot in the training program felt like a promising first step toward a sustainable future in the new green economy.

West Virginia might not seem like a probable place for a solar boom. Coal still generates 86 percent of its electricity, more than any other state, but modern businesses demand renewable power—if for no other reason than it’s typically cheaper. In Huntington, Marqees was learning construction techniques to qualify as a solar installer. “There’s a lot that can be done to revitalize West Virginia,” he told me last fall. “I’m ready to build.”

The Inflation Reduction Act gave federal agencies financial tools to help communities eliminate environmental hazards on abandoned mine sites and spur clean-energy production.

Until January, the Inflation Reduction Act directed clean-energy investment to regions tied to fossil fuels. While large-scale solar carries risks from price shifts and permitting hurdles, new tax credits increased returns to investment, and major developments gained traction. The credits also made the shift to residential solar more attractive to homeowners.

“We can move on from coal,” Marqees said. “Coal was never good for miners.” He saw how coal companies stripped value from his motherland and people. “Everything in McDowell died, leaving no jobs, no hope, no nothing. And it’s been like: What can I do? Where do I fit in? That’s why I’m glad to be in my program.” His training organization had partnerships with solar developers hiring legions of workers to construct new installations. Most relied on the federal incentives.

On his first day back in office, President Trump signed an executive order suspending the funding. With most of the money going to places that voted for him in 2024, the loss of clean-energy incentives hit red states hardest.

With green investment canceled, paused, or at best uncertain, Marqees’s plans quickly unraveled. He left his program and returned to McDowell County, where adult labor force participation falls below 30 percent.

MOST COAL JOBS DISAPPEARED before the 1990s due to automation. Methods like strip mining and mountaintop removal required far fewer workers than traditional mining. Today, cheaper natural gas and renewables are simply driving it out of the market. Twenty years ago, coal accounted for about half of American electricity; today, as of 2023 it was 16 percent and falling fast. West Virginia therefore faces a dire economic situation, with a poverty rate well above the national average, falling life expectancy, and a declining population. When mines close with nothing to replace them, entire communities suffer as jobs vanish and spending falls. Lower tax revenues shrink public services. Local utilities have also passed the high costs of coal plants on to consumers, raising electricity rates.

The EPA has long backed solar development on former mine lands, especially closed mountaintop removal sites, which otherwise persist as devastated wastelands. Unremediated, the locations can leach toxins and emit methane, a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Conversely, the sites often offer roads and transmission lines useful to renewable-energy generation. Reclaiming mined land, however, entails dealing with acid mine drainage, uneven high walls in the terrain, and contaminated soil, as coal company bonds haven’t covered the cost of repairing all the damage.

Cost-benefit concerns had stalled redevelopment until the IRA tipped the scales. The legislation gave federal agencies financial tools to help communities eliminate environmental hazards on abandoned mine sites and spur clean-energy production there. Then-Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) cast the deciding vote, insisting on fossil fuel support in the bill, but signaling West Virginia’s need to begin moving on from coal.

With the boost from the IRA, a trickle of renewable-energy plans grew into a flood of projects for old energy communities like Marqees’s. In 2022, a developer gained approval to build solar on two former West Virginia mines, creating over 300 construction jobs and powering 90,000 homes. The plans included a workforce center to retrain miners for renewable-energy positions. Construction was slated for spring 2026.

In lower-income neighborhoods, residential rooftop solar was previously far out of reach, due to high costs, but the IRA funded programs to ensure low-income West Virginians benefited. Over 3,000 residents installed panels, supporting hundreds of jobs, with more growth expected. Schools and churches were preparing to go solar.

Then Trump won. Alas, the very structure of the Biden-era legislation made it vulnerable. Unlike traditional government programs with up-front appropriations, the IRA used tax incentives to quietly rewire the economy by making clean-energy projects more profitable than fossil fuels. It was policy by encouragement, not mandate. Any whiff of repeal or reduction would send investors scrambling.

After the presidential election, Trump and other Republican leaders began targeting green-energy spending as bloated and ideologically driven, despite the fact that red regions like McDowell County—which Trump won by almost 60 percentage points—collected the vast majority of the benefits. In Ravenswood, West Virginia, BHE Renewables had broken ground on a 2,000-acre project. Almost immediately after Trump took office, talk of delays circulated. More companies that had made bold moves under the promise of stable federal policy began reconsidering the viability of their commitments. Residential projects in West Virginia were also floundering. A trainer mobilizing the solar construction workforce described his efforts as “terminated.”

LIKE MARQEES, ALISON, from outside Huntington, had unexpectedly begun to see a future for herself in solar. After dropping out of high school, she worked in retail, without stability or benefits, and married young. One Fourth of July, she spotted a Facebook ad for a program that prepared women for skilled trade apprenticeships. “What do I have to lose?” she thought. “I could just submit an application.”

Within a week, Alison began learning technical skills and also about herself. “The confidence boost was huge,” she said. “You can build a whole wrong idea about who you are based on the situation you’re in.”

The program required Alison to complete a job shadow, which she did at a local residential solar company. When she climbed a roof and saw a shed below plastered with pro-coal slogans, she judged the energy transition well under way. She gained experience in panel installation and project management and was offered roles in both. Project management provided a flexible schedule, stable income, generous benefits, and time to supervise her child’s homeschooling.

Soon after, Alison divorced her husband. He shirked child support, and without her solar job, she couldn’t have afforded her son’s school supplies or doctor visits. She felt grateful for her freedom. Her confidence and stability continued to grow. “When I see solar panels,” she said, “I feel proud to play a part in them. I don’t ever want to do other work.”

A FEW YEARS AGO, Lee, from Putnam County, bought a solar startup. Not long before, he hadn’t known solar existed in West Virginia.

Lee had worked for the county park system, where he performed the occasional electrical job, though he lacked professional licenses. When an inspector noticed, the park system paid for Lee to return to school. In night classes, he learned about circuits and maintenance, and familiarized himself with building codes.

When he completed the program, Lee saw an ad for an installation position at a residential solar company. It seemed like an interesting opportunity. He applied and got the job, then quickly learned what he needed to know. The tasks didn’t seem complicated. Turning on solar systems from his phone felt thrilling, and he enjoyed traveling to varied job sites.

Before long, Lee installed solar at his own house, saving $70 a month as electricity rates climbed. Others saw the same potential, and Lee’s installations picked up pace.

Lee joined another startup aiming for larger projects. Soon the company put the largest construction outfit in the state on solar, with 1,200 panels. Seeing opportunity solarizing schools and libraries, the construction firm acquired the startup. As the landscape at the federal level threatened to change, however, the construction company’s executives moved to shutter their new solar subsidiary.

Lee decided to buy the solar firm himself and paid with credit card debt. But the factors motivating the construction executives to divest from solar have only grown stronger.

In addition to the loss of Biden-era incentives, the developing trade war has led to a sense of panic in the renewables industry. Though solar costs fell more than 80 percent between 2009 and 2024, panel prices rose ahead of new Trump tariffs, echoing earlier trade barriers. 2018 taxes on imported solar panels had caused job losses and market disruption.

While the Biden administration left some of those levies in place, it paired them with subsidies for domestic clean-energy manufacturing now on the chopping block. The IRA gave panel buyers 30 percent tax credits for U.S.-made equipment. In two years, solar module production nearly quadrupled, and the U.S. became almost self-sufficient in panel production. But American solar panel makers continued to rely on other imported components—ones subject to Trump’s latest tariffs. Building just one new production facility would cost over $10 million and take time to certify. Meanwhile, increases in solar energy prices threaten existing distribution and installation positions in the domestic solar sector.

Lee had planned to partner with a state organization helping people with barriers to employment to double his installation staff. Knowing how to use tools, read a tape measure, and do basic math was sufficient to pick up the remaining skills on the job. Now he has frozen hiring, and keeping the firm afloat feels tenuous.

ON APRIL 8, as the S&P 500 hit its lowest level since President Trump started his global trade war, he signed an executive order to reinvigorate the coal industry. “We’re bringing back an industry that was abandoned,” he said. “We’re going to put the miners back to work.” The order proposed saving retiring coal plants and using emergency powers to boost output. Miners flanked the president in work gear in symbolic support.

Nearly simultaneously, however, the Trump administration slashed funding to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, limiting black lung prevention efforts. A rule to cut silica dust exposure limits stalled. Mine Safety office leases went under review. And the trade war prompted swift retaliation from China—15 percent tariffs on American coal and gas—with profound effects on West Virginia.

The White House had ignored the centrality of Chinese demand to remaining coal jobs. About half of West Virginia’s coal gets exported, supplying nearly half the U.S. metallurgical coal sold to China.

With the tariffs sparking debate about what American workers should be producing domestically, renewables seem to offer a smarter investment than coal. Even Chinese coal demand is falling fast, as the country embarks on a breakneck transition away from fossil fuels. Promises of the first Trump administration to revive the coal industry did not pan out; by the end of his term, the industry had fewer mining positions than when he took office. While the latest orders blamed coal job losses on regulation, the documents ignored the major economic shifts that have rendered coal increasingly uncompetitive, in addition to the danger and pollution.

ALISON’S SMALL-BUSINESS CLIENTS with federal funding for clean energy no longer knew whether the money would materialize, and some canceled projects. Alison still felt she had a future in the industry, if the political and economic turbulence abated, but she couldn’t foresee when that might happen.

Realistically, Alison understood some solar companies would fail, and other customers shared similar concerns. They were asking whether her firm would exist to service their systems.

Residential solar approvals took months, and cancellations stung when installations were ready to proceed. To Alison, energy was energy, and there was no need to play politics around the transition to a green economy.

Across town, a new curriculum for an associate’s degree in solar energy was moving forward, but one of the designers now worried about opportunities for graduates. He had already told 400 trainees their jobs installing mine-land solar might not start. He hoped solar technologies would eventually prevail.

In McDowell, Marqees attended a county commission town hall. “No one’s talking about solutions,” he said. To him, his neighbors’ presidential votes had reflected feeling unheard. He saw little improvement since. Before the meeting ended, he decided to challenge a political insider for mayor, on a platform of workforce training and future-oriented jobs. The election takes place this summer.",https://prospect.org/downloads/22899/download/Kirshner-WV%20green%20future%20052025.jpg?cb=9cce94d1501fe6233a8e9bb6a75422c0&w=1024,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:03.106629

The Trump administration is looking to claw this funding back.

The Energy Department is getting ready to ""cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees that had been conditionally approved under the Biden administration,"" reports Semafor. This action will cancel approximately $5 billion worth of funding for a transmission project by a New Jersey utility company, a loan program for low-income homeowners to install rooftop solar panels by Sunnova, and a Monolith Nebraska factory to produce low-carbon ammonia. The remaining four projects, which collectively received over $3 billion, include three battery factories and a plastics and recycling facility, which ""were already previously cancelled by their companies because of other various headwinds,"" according to Semafor.

The three active projects that will have their federal loans axed have faced their own share of problems.

In September 2023, Sunnova received a $3 billion partial loan guarantee from the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) for Project Hestia—a program that would make residential rooftop solar, battery storage, and virtual power plants ""available to more American homeowners."" Hestia was expected to provide loans to as many as 115,000 homeowners in the United States and Puerto Rico for these technologies, while creating ""3,400 good-paying, high-quality American jobs.""

After receiving the federal loan, Sunnova came under fire for its alleged history of predatory practices and scamming elderly clients, which led to subsequent congressional scrutiny. In April, Sunnova began filing for bankruptcy. The company recently said it was no longer planning to use the programming funding and was working with the Energy Department to return the remaining guarantees.

Monolith received a $953 million conditional loan guarantee from the LPO to accelerate its clean hydrogen and carbon utilization project in Nebraska. The company, which has received backing from BlackRock and NextEra Energy and was valued at over $1 billion in 2022, creates hydrogen fuel with renewable energy (which can be used to make ammonia in fertilizers) and carbon black. Despite the federal funding and private sector support, The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2024 that the company was ""running short on cash and facing project delays.""

The third project facing the ax is New Jersey's Clean Energy Corridor, ""a project to upgrade and expand transmission infrastructure to accommodate planned generation in New Jersey to meet growing electricity demand."" Run by Jersey Central Power & Light Company, the project received a conditional loan guarantee of up to $716 million in January to support the state's goal of ""introducing 11,000 MW of offshore wind-generated electricity by 2035."" When First Energy, which owns Jersey Central, first announced the project in 2022, Danish energy company Orsted was planning two large wind projects off New Jersey's coast. The projects were canceled in 2023. Another New Jersey offshore wind project was recently halted after the Environmental Protection Agency rescinded the project's environmental permits.

Despite these project cancellations and the LPO's history of questionable and risky investments, it does not appear that the office is going away soon; Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told lawmakers that his agency would use the LPO to advance nuclear energy projects.

Assuming Wright fully cuts billions of dollars worth of wasteful projects and narrows the agency's scope to only fund nuclear power projects, it's possible that the LPO's budget—which ballooned to over $400 billion under the Biden administration—could meaningfully shrink.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/5-20-25-v4.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:07.161360

The current RAV4 debuted seven years ago and has begun to show signs of age.
Templin said Toyota aims to keep the vehicle affordable to new car buyers at the lower end of the scale.
Toyota did not specify expected fuel economy, but the plug-in’s electric-only mode range grows to 80 kilometres, which is 20 per cent greater than the current version.
That vehicle is made by Toyota Industries, which is the target of a takeover bid by Toyota Motor chairman Akio Toyoda.","[DETROIT] Toyota Motor is scrapping the petrol-powered version of its best-selling vehicle in the US as the Japanese carmaker doubles down on its push into hybrids.

The latest generation of the RAV4 compact crossover available later this year comes equipped with a standard or plug-in hybrid powertrain, dropping the gas-powered option that makes up the bulk of current sales, the company said on Thursday (May 22). The move follows last year’s shift to an all-hybrid Camry sedan.

“The success overall that we have had with selling hybrids gave us complete confidence we could do it with this car too,” Mark Templin, Toyota Motor’s chief operating officer in the US, said of the new RAV4.

Toyota has long been sceptical on the industry push to go all-in on fully electric vehicles (EVs), opting instead for a multipronged approach that sees a place for hybrids, gas-guzzlers and even hydrogen-powered cars in its lineup. While the slow roll out of EVs left the carmaker open to criticism, the strategy has helped Toyota weather a cooling in demand for all-electric cars.

At the same time, demand for hybrids has skyrocketed in recent years and Toyota has emerged as the US market leader. Electrified models accounted for more than half of Toyota and Lexus volume in the US in the first three months of the year, up from just 37 per cent in the same period a year ago.

A 25 per cent US tariff poses a major threat to the new RAV4, with imports accounting for more than 60 per cent of US sales volume. Nearly half the 475,000 RAV4s sold in the US last year came from Canada and almost 20 per cent were made in Japan. The company has not disclosed pricing as it awaits more clarity on trade policy.

Templin said Toyota does not plan to stop importing RAV4s from its factories in Ontario and Japan, and remains hopeful for some reprieve on tariffs from US President Donald Trump’s administration.

“We need more capacity than we can crank out of any one of those plants. We need all three of them,” Templin said. “I believe there will be some form of tariff, I just don’t think it’s going to be 25 per cent.”

The RAV4 competes with similar compact crossovers such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue, Hyundai Tucson and General Motors’ Chevrolet Equinox. Those models also have depended on foreign production for at least some US sales volume.

The current RAV4 debuted seven years ago and has begun to show signs of age. It ranked sixth of eight in a comparison test by Car and Driver magazine. But it’s still the top-selling vehicle outside of pickups.

Hybrid options

Michael Speigl, dealer principal at a Toyota in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said he’s confident the new version will be a hit with buyers, noting the current RAV4 hybrid is among his dealership’s most popular vehicles.

“I’m not in the business of second-guessing Toyota,” Speigl said. “The numbers speak for themselves.”

Toyota has vowed by this year to offer an electrified option for every model it makes globally. So far, just under 80 per cent of Toyota and its Lexus brand models sold in the US offer a hybrid or fully electric powertrain. The carmaker sells two all-electric vehicles in the US and last week announced plans to sell a third EV next year.

The latest RAV4 is not a complete redo: It uses the same chassis and underpinnings as the current version, and borrows the Camry’s hybrid powertrain. The hybrid version of the current model starts at US$32,300, which is about US$3,000 more than the cheapest gas-only RAV4.

Templin said Toyota aims to keep the vehicle affordable to new car buyers at the lower end of the scale.

“I’m not saying it’s going to be below US$30,000, but it needs to stay in that entry-level price,” he said. “And a lot of that depends on what happens with tariffs.”

The sixth generation of the RAV4, a model which made its US debut in 1996, boosts output by as much as 236 horsepower, up from 219 currently. Toyota did not specify expected fuel economy, but the plug-in’s electric-only mode range grows to 80 kilometres, which is 20 per cent greater than the current version.

That vehicle is made by Toyota Industries, which is the target of a takeover bid by Toyota Motor chairman Akio Toyoda. BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5ded60c53acfdd49a6982d31edafa7c20dd9ea9407c15c9be3fc5743255c8c91?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-05-21 05:04:59.309357

Since the time the Trump administration has taken office, American political scientists and scholars have encountered the phrase ‘constitutional crisis’ more than ever before. Executive Orders (EO) and presidential directives are at the heart of that debate.

During his first term, President Donald Trump signed 220 EOs. Just a month into his second term, Trump has signed 73 EOs, 23 proclamations and 12 memorandums as of February 20, 2025—108 executive actions in all.

Every president since George Washington has signed an EO, and their frequency has increased with modern presidencies. Trump, in his second term, has sped ahead of all presidents in signing the highest number of EOs in the first 100 days.

EOs have always been important in the American political scene, especially in the context of the presidential system, but in the context of the second Trump administration which took office on January 20 this year, it has acquired heightened importance.

The legal basis for presidents to issue EOs lies in the Article II of the American Constitution which establishes the Executive branch of the government and vests power in the president to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”. Living up to his campaign promise, President Trump has issued a slew of EOs targeting almost all-important areas of governance and policy, setting a net policy reversal from the Biden administration.

The Trump administration has cited a US Supreme Court ruling to justify the obligation of the Executive to defend the nation’s sovereignty. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that the ‘check and balances’ of the American constitution will kick in and some of the executive actions by president Trump will be challenged in courts, some blocked and some still, implemented.

Now in the second Trump presidency, it is perhaps timely to take a stock of the EOs signed and the impact they could have.

Table 1: Trump’s Executive Orders’ Status as of February 20, 2025

Note: The data has been updated as of 1 May 2025.

EOs have been a handy tool for US presidents to enforce the power of the Executive over the other branches of the government. For Trump, in his second term, it could be a contestable path with the other two branches, particularly the Judiciary. With quite a few of the EOs challenged in court and some overturned, it remains to be seen what role the legislature plays in all this. In the end, the EOs cannot replace the Congressional process in lawmaking. If anything, it is the Congress that retains the power to override a presidential veto.

Amidst a flurry of EOs by the Trump administration that may change the quintessential nature of America as a country internally and externally, it will be interesting to see if the checks and balances by the other two branches of the government manage to reign in an Executive on steroids.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-181.jpeg,N,,2025-05-21 04:02:51.371449

The move happened ahead of President Donald Trump’s meeting with GOP lawmakers Tuesday morning. His goal was to urge them to advance the tax cut, energy and national security budget reconciliation package as soon as possible.

One point of contention delaying progress is the fate of climate law tax credits. Trump also discussed pipelines after leaders struck a provision on permitting.

When it comes to the language affecting nonprofits, the package had at one point included a measure to allow the Treasury secretary to revoke tax-exempt status for groups deemed to have supported terrorist organizations.

Environmental group leaders sounded alarm bells that Trump could use such authority to punish organizations who countered his objectives.

But the language was struck from the megabill in an updated version posted on the House Rules Committee’s website Monday.

A spokesperson for Rep. David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), who championed the proposal, said the language did not adhere to Senate rules requiring budget reconciliation legislation — meant to bypass the filibuster — to have a clear fiscal nexus.

Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the group was surprised to see the provision stripped out while the megabill moved through the House. They were expecting to have to appeal to the Senate parliamentarian.

“We’re cautiously optimistic,” Hamadanchy said. “It looks like we’re OK on reconciliation, but the expectation is this will come back from the dead at some point, and we’re going to have to continue to make sure it doesn’t become law.”

Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that the elimination of the provision from the megabill is “good news for all nonprofits.”

Pipelines

Republicans on Monday axed two measures that would have allowed accelerated permitting for pipeline developers willing to pay high fees. And they removed a number of funding clawbacks at the Department of Energy.

Trump spoke about the need to accelerate pipeline permitting. The legislation still includes measures to accelerate National Environmental Policy Act reviews and natural gas exports.

“He talked about getting pipelines approved,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said. “We’ve been trying to get some kind of approval on pipelines in the bill to expedite permitting. This has been a problem for a long time.”

Asked whether stripped provisions could be inserted back in the legislation, Scalise demurred. “We’re going to go talk about what we’re going to do to expedite permitting in America.”

Tax credits

Still up for debate is the future of clean energy credits established in the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. Some GOP hardliners have said the current bill does not go far enough in repealing the credits. But over a dozen moderates want the bill revised to make the credits usable for a longer period of time.

One of those lawmakers, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), who is also pushing for higher state and local tax deductions, said Trump did little to quell concerns.

“There’s a lot of problems if they put the bill on the floor as is,” Garbarino said.

Industry pressure has been increasing. The Solar Energy Industries Association launched a new campaign, Solar Under Threat, in response to GOP plans to scrap or limit Inflation Reduction Act incentives.

On Tuesday, the American Clean Power Association released a report saying clean energy manufacturing pumps in $18 billion a year into the gross domestic product and that nearly three-quarters of new clean energy manufacturing plants are in red states.

“For American energy manufacturers to continue creating jobs and strengthening our economy, we need policy certainty,” ACP said, specifically naming the clean energy credits.

The Trump administration selected McNeese State University as the site for a new center of excellence.

The Transportation Department’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has selected the Lake Charles-based university as its first National Center of Excellence for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Safety. It’s the first undergraduate institution in the U.S. to offer a certificate program in LNG Business. The university already offers its own LNG Center of Excellence.

“Producing and exporting LNG is one of the most powerful ways we can unleash American energy, and the Lake Charles region is a critical hub of LNG activity in the U.S.,” Duffy said. “The sheer volume of product supplied by the state of Louisiana is unparalleled and growing, and there is no better place to locate our Center of Excellence.”

The designation came after U.S. Sen. John Kennedy, R-LA, established the PHMSA National Center of Excellence for LNG five years ago in the 2020 PIPES Act under the first Trump administration. Included in the law was a provision Kennedy added to create “the first-ever National Center of Excellence for LNG Safety, but I didn’t stop there,” Kennedy said. “I made sure in that bill that the newly created Center was required to be in Louisiana.”

Under Trump’s second term, the center was chosen to be headquartered at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, an oil and natural gas powerhouse in Calcasieu Parish along the Gulf of America.

The PIPES Act, which improves pipeline safety and infrastructure, created the PHMSA center to “enhance the United States as the leader and foremost expert in LNG operations by furthering the expertise of the Federal Government in the operations, management, and regulatory practices of LNG facilities; acting as a repository of information on best practices for the operation of LNG facilities; and facilitating collaboration among LNG sector stakeholders.”

The center will facilitate research and development, training, and regulatory coordination to develop “LNG safety solutions to real-world challenges through global and domestic collaboration among LNG stakeholders.”

“The Center will advance LNG safety by promoting collaboration among government agencies, industry, academia, and other safety partners,” PHMSA Acting Administrator Ben Kochman said. “Consolidating such remarkable levels of expertise will benefit the LNG sector for many generations to come.”

Being located at McNeese “will be a game-changer for our region in terms of workforce development and groundbreaking research,” McNeese State University President Dr. Wade Rousse said. “We are excited to be on the forefront of helping ensure safety and sustainability in the energy sector and look forward to working with PHMSA to develop a world-class facility to house their staff.”

The U.S. is the top LNG exporter in the world, with the U.S. oil and natural gas industry and Louisiana and Texas ports propelling it to its number one status, The Center Square reported.

While BEVs are making up a larger portion of automobiles sold, with sales accounted for more than 9% of new vehicle sold in the U.S. and 10% of new vehicles sold in Canada in March, adoption of EVs “is now being threatened by tariffs and the anticipated impact to manufacturing costs and, ultimately, the MSRP of new BEVs as well as the supply of used BEVs,” the report states.

The report also shows that original manufacturing equipment parts are more frequently used in the repair of BEVs: In Q1, 88% of the parts dollars on estimates for repairable BEVs were for OEM parts compared with 64% for ICE automobiles.

But renewable energy stakeholders argued the proposal could add chaos “to an already complex process.” In a 2-1 vote, FERC commissioners denied the proposal.
“MISO proposes up to 14 opportunities to enter the ERAS process through 2028, which could further impede MISO’s ability to process ERAS requests on an expedited basis,” according to the decision.
“We worked closely and collaboratively with stakeholders to develop ERAS as a temporary process that will enable urgent generation projects to be built more quickly.
Environmental groups celebrated the decision, saying the ERAS proposal would favor the construction of gas-fired power plants over renewables and batteries.","Federal regulators on Friday rejected the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s plan to fast-track new generation interconnections, arguing the proposal lacked limits on the number of projects that could be considered.

MISO filed its Expedited Resource Addition Study process, or ERAS, in March, to provide a framework for the accelerated study of generation it said could address urgent resource adequacy and reliability needs. Under the proposal, projects entering the ERAS process would have been studied serially each quarter and granted an expedited interconnection agreement within 90 days.

But renewable energy stakeholders argued the proposal could add chaos “to an already complex process.”

In a 2-1 vote, FERC commissioners denied the proposal.

The ERAS proposal “places no limit on the number of projects that could be entered in the ERAS process, which could result in an ERAS queue with processing times for interconnection requests that are too lengthy to meet MISO’s stated resource adequacy and reliability needs,” Commissioners David Rosner and Lindsay See wrote in their decision.

MISO’s proposed tariff language, for example, did not limit the number of interconnection requests or total megawatts of interconnection requests that are eligible to enter the ERAS queue, they noted.

“MISO proposes up to 14 opportunities to enter the ERAS process through 2028, which could further impede MISO’s ability to process ERAS requests on an expedited basis,” according to the decision.

FERC Chairman Mark Christie dissented, though he said he did not disagree with the majority’s criticism.

“I am willing, however, to extend to both the states and MISO a trust that they would implement the ERAS proposal in a manner that would promote the construction of badly needed generation capacity that serves resource adequacy and reliability,” Christie wrote. “One thing we know with no need for further proof: This country, including MISO, is heading for a reliability crisis caused by early retirements of dispatchable resources coupled with the failure to construct sufficient equivalent capacity, all while demand rises at an unprecedented pace largely driven by data center growth.”

The MISO region has less supply capacity available now than it did last summer due to generator retirements and less firm imports and “could face supply shortfalls during above-normal peak demand,” North American Electric Reliability Corp. said Wednesday in its annual 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment. MISO officials have said they expect peak demand may reach nearly 123 GW, but they say there is about 138 GW of regularly available generation expected across the operating footprint.

MISO is reviewing the commission’s decision and “determining our appropriate next steps,” a spokesperson for the grid operator said.

“We worked closely and collaboratively with stakeholders to develop ERAS as a temporary process that will enable urgent generation projects to be built more quickly. We will continue to engage with stakeholders as we evaluate options,” MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris said.

Environmental groups celebrated the decision, saying the ERAS proposal would favor the construction of gas-fired power plants over renewables and batteries.

“It’s good to see FERC taking a deep look at extreme proposals like MISO’s here. Interconnection fast-track proposals like ERAS are fundamentally discriminatory, and the Commission made clear that discriminatory tools should only be used to address the most severe emergencies,” Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier said in a statement.

“FERC rightly rejected the proposal from MISO to fast track connection of utility-owned methane gas projects over the queue of clean energy projects that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” Christine Powell, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice’s clean energy program, said in an email. “FERC’s role as an independent agency is to protect consumers, and ensure reliable affordable energy. The best way to do that is let clean energy compete fairly and openly.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xeDhr5lxGJaRE_xF6sx3i2U0nYJYU-Gkg4NYmKBzogk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTc2MTM5NzlfaUdWNURJdC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:21.397202

The sheer complexity of coordinating a diverse set of distributed energy technologies, however, takes a lot of time and design calculations. And with distributed energy possibly expanding to account for 40% of U.S. electricity generation within the next two decades, the collaborations around connection must accelerate or risk projects dying in long interconnection queues.

For those reasons, microgrid design, automation and management firm Schneider Electric unveiled its EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex solution to work on creating synergies with partners which, united as one, can reduce project timelines to meet critical customer needs.

New York-based developer Sprocket Power is becoming the inaugural partner of the Microgrid Flex Partner Program, which will bring companies into collaboration around microgrid projects for many types of facility customers seeking on-site power solutions. Both companies bring expertise that together are designed to enhance streamlining of the microgrid project process.

“Microgrids are being installed throughout the U.S. at hospitals, universities, businesses, schools, and airports, as the country’s grid experiences failures due to age and weather-related disruptions,” said Don Wingate, Vice President Sales – Strategic Customers and Solutions – New Energy Landscape at Schneider Electric, in a statement. “We recognized Sprocket Power as a trailblazer in the implementation of microgrid systems. Their expertise and collaborative approach have made them an invaluable partner in advancing this dynamic and rapidly growing sector of sustainable energy.”

Sprocket Power has led several higher-profile commercial microgrids lately, including distributed energy solutions at five automobile dealerships in New York. It has developed specific capabilities in on-site power development for EV charging infrastructure, while Schneider Electric is a long-time integrator of microgrids totaling more than 350 microgrids generating about 100 GW of capacity throughout the U.S.

The increasing frequency of extreme weather forcing grid outages, as well as concerns about utility resource adequacy for a variety of economic sectors such as data centers and manufacturing, is accelerating the adoption of microgrids through this decade.

“Microgrids are deeply valuable, but potential host sites often face barriers to accessing and maximizing that value,” Maria Fields, CEO and co-founder of Sprocket Power, said. “Schneider Electric brings critical resources, a well-earned reputation, and a smart approach to opening this market, and we are looking forward to partnering with the company to deliver on this promise.”

The standardization and simplification movement behind EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex helps combine and coordinator microgrid control, electrical distribution, software and battery storage components within systems.

Sprocket Power, already adept at working within the commercial customer markets, will identify candidates for the Microgrid Flex system and help develop projects from concept to execution and operation. Schneider itself has completed a fleet of microgrids across multiple sectors, from wineries to public transportation depots.

The 2-year-old Flex program expects to mature this year with additional collaborations across various partners within the microgrid ecosystem.

“Schneider Electric is expanding the Microgrid Flex partner network with a handful of select partners this year. It is our ambition to go to market with a focused group of highly qualified companies who are developing portfolios of microgrids,” added Samantha Childress, Director, Microgrid Partner Strategy & Channel Sales at Schneider Electric.

“Recruitment and selection of Microgrid Flex partners is dependent on an organization's experience determining and pitching the business case to end users, defining the appropriate use cases and site-level engineering, and the ability to install and maintain the microgrid solution for years to come,” Childress said.

The global microgrid market rose to between $32 billion and $35 billion last year, according to various reports, and could more than double by 2033. The expanded power needs of artificial intelligence, reshoring of U.S. manufacturing capacity and fleet electrification are drivers of this anticipated growth.

In addition, repairing and upgrading an outdated utility grid transmission and distributed system likely benefits from capital investment in modernization at the edge of the grid. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded U.S. energy instructure at a D+ and lacking some addition $700 billion of capital investment needs.

The value proposition of microgrids not only resides in the power resiliency benefits of the distributed energy resources but also is aggregating that capacity into grid services such as demand response and virtual power plants.

How to meet rising demand is the million dollar question with billion dollar solutions, like building new natural gas power plants.

Natural gas power is relatively cheap, cleaner than coal and it can generate power all day and all night, unlike wind and solar. But it’s got a supply chain problem.

There’s a bit of a scramble right now to get the supplies needed to keep the lights on as demand for electricity goes up, said Ramteen Sioshansi, an electrical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

Take natural gas turbines, which are in relatively short supply:

“Suppliers have fairly lengthy backlogs to be able to get those components to utilities and others who are building electricity infrastructure,” Sioshansi said.

So why can’t manufacturers just ramp up production of gas turbines?

“These are big industrial machines, right? So you need big, heavy forging and casting components. You need really skilled labor,” said Sam Huntington, director of Climate & Sustainability: North American Power at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

Plus, turbines require a lot of specialty materials and manufacturers are hesitant to make a big investment in ramping up production when there could be an overcount of how much electricity data centers will need.

“There's just a ton of uncertainty about the sort of range of projections of how much load growth could we actually see,” Huntington said.

He said the wait for some natural gas turbines is four years.

And the limited supply of turbines, which are a critical component to a natural gas plant, can add challenges and delays to these energy projects, said Tom Mergen, a vice president and Central/East U.S. business development lead at Stanley Consultants.

“It is difficult to get equipment,” he said. “There's definitely a race to get your orders in now.”

Mergen said projects will place turbine orders early on if they can. “But there's some risk in that, right? You're going to be starting to order equipment before you've done the environmental due diligence,” he said.

And it’s getting worse. It’s not just the gas turbines for big power plants that are in high demand.

“Now you've got the market kind of converging that the demand is for any type of technology, and pretty much any size is in high demand,” Mergen said.",https://img.apmcdn.org/460fb5875530b2512a6d9f28f037152e4385352e/widescreen/8b7ab2-20250520-aerial-view-of-a-natural-gas-plant-in-texas-2000.jpg,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:28.715729

Apex Power Conversion Celebrates Ribbon Cutting Of U.S. Headquarters In Mesa

Earlier this month, Apex Power Conversion, a solar and storage company, celebrated the ribbon cutting of its U.S. headquarters and manufacturing facility in Mesa. The event took place in conjunction with the American Clean Power Association’s CLEANPOWER 2025 Expo in Phoenix. Apex Power will initially employ up to 300 people, with plans to employ up to 700 by 2029.

Representing an over $60 million investment, the 206,000-square-foot facility is currently used for customer engagement and product training, and will be expanded for advanced multi-megawatt power conversion manufacturing for integrating renewables and energy storage with the grid. The first full units are expected to be manufactured in the first quarter of 2026.

“At Apex Power, we are relentless in pursuing our mission to develop and manufacture the most advanced power conversion systems – technologies that directly enable the integration of renewable energy and storage onto our power grids,” said Jacob Marshall, President & Co-Founder, Apex Power Conversion. “It is a humbling honor to launch Apex Power’s headquarters and manufacturing operations in my family’s hometown of Mesa. Apex’s culture is grounded in our purpose and our partnerships, and we look forward to showing the world exactly what we are capable of.”

A group of Congressional Republicans are asking their party to further tweak proposed changes to clean energy tax credits that the House Ways and Means Committee included in its reconciliation bill text.

The proposed budget reconciliation bill would decrease the credits for a number of clean energy technologies after 2028 and phase them out entirely after 2031, as well as additional requirements to qualify for the credits and an early sunset for their transferability. Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Virginia Republican, led 13 other House members in a joint statement Wednesday seeking to extend the transferability mechanism through the phase-out period and make other changes.

The GOP tax bill, as currently constructed, passed the House Budget Committee late on Sunday, after the committee failed to clear the bill on Friday. However, as Kiggans and the other lawmakers seek changes to the bill to further protect the clean energy tax provisions, others in the party are looking to speed up the phaseout.

Dive Insight:

While the original Inflation Reduction Act had technology-neutral clean energy production and investment credits available until 2032, the House Ways and Means Committee’s bill text would move the sunset dates up and phase them out over a four-year period. Companies would be able to receive 80% of the credit values in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031, with the credits phasing out entirely in 2032. Another nuclear power production credit would be phased out on the same schedule.

Kiggans and her colleagues said they commended the committee “for including reasonable phase-out schedules” for the credits, but said in the May 14 joint statement that a few more changes are needed “to fully realize the intent of these phase-out schedules.”

“While many of these provisions reflect a commitment to American energy dominance through an all-of-the-above energy strategy, we must ensure certainty for current and future energy investments to meet the nation’s growing power demand and protect our constituents from higher energy costs,” the statement said.

Kiggins was joined on the statement by Reps. Andrew Garbarino, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York; Mark Amodei of Nevada; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania; Juan Ciscomani of Arizona; Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Young Kim and David Valadao of California; and Dan Newhouse of Washington.

The members said retaining the transferability mechanism for the entirety of the credits’ lifecycle would provide companies “with the flexibility necessary to make long-term investments in American energy.”

In addition to extending the tax credit transferability mechanism through the entire phase-out period, the House lawmakers are also asking that adjustments be made to the “Foreign Entity of Concern provisions” and for a “placed in service” standard to be included in the proposed changes.

The foreign entity of concern provisions are “overly prescriptive,” according to the lawmakers, and “should be revised to allow companies additional time to reorganize their supply chains, ensuring a strategic and successful transition.” The “placed in service” provision, which adopts an Internal Revenue Service standard of preparedness for the credits, would require a project to be ready and available for use to qualify.

Kiggins and other moderate Republicans backing last week’s statement said the “placed in service” standard is misaligned with the phaseout schedule, and should be replaced in the text with a “start construction” standard. They said that adjustment “is essential to supporting the energy development needed to meet the growing power demand and protect thousands of high-quality American jobs in communities across the country.”

Clean energy developers and industry groups are “hoping that this draft isn’t the final text,” Robert Neifert, commercial and residential solar developer Solar Gain’s director for business development, said on a press call organized by Clean Energy for America last week.

“The way that the current rules are written with the placed in service rule … we're going to have to stop selling projects at the current tax rates in a year-and-a-half,” Neifert said.

Gilbert Campbell, founder and CEO of utility scale solar developer Volt Energy Utility, said on the May 13 call that the bill as written would lead to less private investment, increasing the price of building projects and leading to small businesses taking a “big hit.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mcX2Wcd05a1EileaQQSrCfEcbF8u4H7N39yugFqI2mg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODY1MjkwMTJfVFBrNm5uTy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-21 07:07:32.019916

Members of Congress and candidates for state office were also questioning the role of other fossil fuel companies in spreading disinformation on the climate crisis.
“It is a transaction that furthers BP’s business interests, resulting in more fossil fuel expansion, and empowering their broader political lobbying to impede international climate action,” he said.
“Big Oil’s multi-pronged scheme to lock in fossil fuel dependence relies on masquerading as a trusted clean energy partner,” said Sen. Whitehouse.
Sponsorships of the Girl Scouts, museum exhibitions, and marathons “in no way make up for the damage that the fossil fuel companies are causing.","In the fall of 2017, the American Petroleum Institute (API) sponsored a workshop for Pennsylvania Girl Scouts, featuring “activities that mimicked work in the energy industry.” Each scout left with a “coveted patch and a greater understanding of natural gas and oil,” API’s CEO Jack Gerard reported in an “Executive Update” email — one of the API member companies that co-funded the event.

What America’s most powerful oil lobby likely did not tell the Girl Scouts, however, was that API had hosted the seminar as part of its mission to cultivate “nontraditional local allies,” described by Gerard as some of the “best and most influential voices with targeted policymakers on industry issues.”

For years, campaigners have warned cultural institutions against accepting oil money, arguing that sponsorships are a key weapon in the public relations arsenal the industry deploys to thwart climate action.

Dozens of documents uncovered by a U.S. Congressional investigation appear to confirm those suspicions – demonstrating that API and oil giants BP, Shell, and Chevron have used sponsorships to allay public concerns over their role in the climate crisis while simultaneously lobbying against policies aimed at tackling it.

DeSmog discovered the documents by combing through thousands of internal memos, emails, and other communications subpoenaed by the Congressional investigation into climate disinformation by the fossil fuel industry, which published its report last year.

Dated between 2015 and 2021, the documents show oil companies funding sponsorship programs meant not only to enhance their reputations as socially responsible corporations, but also to ward off anti-climate change regulations that might undercut their oil and gas business.

The documents (which can be viewed online) reveal how BP America communications staff were instructed to use the company’s sponsorships to protect BP from “external threats” such as “the policy and politics of climate change,” how Chevron leveraged its sponsorship programs to “advance business objectives” with investors, government and customers, and how Shell used philanthropy to tackle the problem of “low credibility and trust” amid “rising societal expectations on climate action” while ensuring that oil and gas remained “a profitable cash engine.”

As the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections and slashes U.S. climate commitments, the documents cast new light on the oil industry’s long-term strategy to burnish its reputation and influence policy through partnerships with groups as diverse as the Girl Scouts of the USA, Ford’s Theatre, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Chicago Architecture Biennial and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

“Big Oil exploits its partnerships with some of America’s most trusted institutions, to greenwash its image, block progress on climate safety, and avoid accountability for the escalating costs of climate-driven disasters,” saidSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), who helped lead the congressional investigation as then-chair of the Senate Budget Committee.

The congressional investigators’ final report, published in April 2024, found that while BP, Chevron, and Shell publicly claimed to support pro-climate reforms between 2015 and 2021, they continued to underinvest in cleaner energies and increase oil and gas production.

All three companies also lobbied against climate policies during this time through trade groups such as the API, the Western States Petroleum Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The measures ranged from export restrictions on liquefied natural gas (LNG), certain state carbon taxes, and fracking moratoriums to policies relating to electric vehicles as well as regulations designed to reduce emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. These efforts were documented in their own in-house publications, as well as reports by climate accountability groups including Lobby Map and the California Climate Accountability Project.

Most of these climate protections have now been revoked or placed under review by the Trump administration, whose first-day executive order to “unleash American energy” was immediately “applaud[ed]” by current API CEO Mike Sommers.

In his 2017 “Executive Update” email to BP praising the value of partnering with the Girl Scouts, API’s then-CEO Gerard also referenced an API-sponsored “Tribute to Black Women luncheon” in Colorado, attended by “1,500 female leaders including more than 27 elected officials and candidates for state office.” The event “allowed API to reach many of the most influential and strong voices for public policy across Colorado.” Gerard also described a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) tour in Michigan by Grand Hank, a “scientist entertainer who engaged more than 700 students in an interactive way through music, dancing, and experiments.”

API’s efforts had “cemented existing relationships and laid the groundwork for new ones that could make the difference in future campaigns,” concluded Gerard.

“What these sponsorship programs really amount to is an attempt to enhance reputation while continuing to produce fossil fuels, which are leading to the collapse of the climate system,” said Robert J. Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Brown University’s Institute for Environment and Society.

“It’s sort of like giving out life jackets to hurricane survivors,” Brulle said, “while at the same time contributing greenhouse gases to cause the hurricanes.”

BP, Chevron, Shell, and API are among the companies and groups being sued by several U.S. states and municipalities for allegedly defrauding consumers with climate denial and disinformation campaigns.

Speaking on behalf of the industry in 2024, an API spokesperson described such litigation as “meritless” and “politicized,” arguing that “climate policy is for Congress to debate and decide — not the court system.”

BP, Shell, Chevron and API did not respond to requests for comment on their sponsorship programs or the contents of the documents.

ExxonMobil has been another major sponsor of cultural and community organizations. While the subpoenaed documents contain little information relating to its sponsorship programs, Congressional investigators noted that “Exxon withheld multiple documents “for privilege” without specifying the privilege it was claiming and notwithstanding that Congress is not required to recognize common law privilege claims.”

ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.

BP’s Strategy to Address ‘Negative Sentiment’

Between 2010 and 2015, BP America’s PR strategy largely focused on rebuilding its reputation following 2010’s deadly and environmentally devastating Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 2016, however, the documents show that Deepwater Horizon was receding as BP’s biggest reputational concern, with the company pivoting its PR strategy to address threats related to climate action. An internal 2016 summary of “BP America Group-Level Risks,” reported that “although DWH [Deepwater Horizon] is increasingly less of a drag on reputation, other litigation issues present risk to our public standing. Overall negative sentiment about the oil and gas industry also threatens to drag down BP’s reputation.”

The summary identified the “policy and politics of climate change” as one of the risks capable of causing “damage to BP’s reputation,” with the potential to undermine not only BP’s “public standing and credibility but also investor confidence in the company.”

In response to these threats, a separate “2016 Plan” instructed BP America’s Communications & External Affairs team to “position BP as a leading and trusted voice in the national dialogue” while at the same time to “expand the company’s capacity to influence regulators on key climate-related initiatives.”

The team was told to mitigate the potentially harmful impact of “detrimental policy and political developments” by “leveraging our distinctive position as a champion of STEM education” as well as demonstrating the company’s “commitment to communities,” through sponsorships, which were described as “focused community investments.”

A separate “Strategic Objectives Overview” for 2016 further instructed BP’s communications team to “leverage” sponsorships to “develop support for BP’s business objectives and stimulate advocacy on the company’s behalf.”

These “business objectives” included expanding an Alaskan liquefied natural gas (LNG) operation and developing “major Gulf projects” such as BP’s giant “Mad Dog 2” oil field located several hundred miles east of the Deepwater Horizon disaster site in the Gulf of Mexico.

To “protect current operations” and “support business growth,” the team was told to promote policies that favored BP’s business while preventing those that might cause harm — specifically those related to climate. The team should “influence the political, policy, legislative and regulatory environment to support policy outcomes that benefit business operations while preventing harmful legislation or regulation (examples include climate, ozone, RFS [renewable fuel standard], Dodd Frank, exports and taxes),” declared the memo.

In 2016, BP America’s sponsorships included the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the “BP MS 150” bike ride from Houston to Austin, the National Urban League, the Women’s Energy Network, and the Valor Games competition for veterans. The BP Foundation also sponsored multiple STEM programs across the country.

‘Strategic Relationships’

That same year, a BP External Affairs memo demonstrated different ways that sponsorships, referred to as “strategic relationships,” presented opportunities to “advance business interests” by securing “public support” from partners, as well as to “mitigate risks including those posed by “potential litigation.”

By April 2016, three attorneys general – from Massachusetts, New York, and the U.S. Virgin Islands – were investigating whether to sue BP rival ExxonMobil for deceiving the public about climate change risks, or misleading investors over how those risks could hurt business. Members of Congress and candidates for state office were also questioning the role of other fossil fuel companies in spreading disinformation on the climate crisis.

Outlining the precise “Business Benefit” afforded by sponsorships, the BP External Affairs memo stated: “Direct benefit comes when our partners engage as influencers, supporters or defenders regulatory, legislative, or other policy matters, while indirect benefits comes [sic] in our ability to access the network and platform provided by our partners to deliver our messages.”

A further goal was to “leverage” BP’s “strategic relationships to mitigate potential litigation or other sensitive matter [sic],” the memo said.

‘Defend BP Budget’

In June 2017, hundreds of thousands of people took part in the People’s Climate March in Washington, D.C. to protest the first Trump administration’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement

Six weeks later, a BP America “Key Priorities Review” directed communications staff to use sponsorships as a way of “mitigating external threats” as well as “building and maintaining relationships with government and communities to ensure strong business support.”

According to the review, sponsorships should deliver “functional support” for the company’s central “mission” of defending and supporting its U.S. business.

The review described “community investment” and sponsorships as key “ongoing activities to protect and grow BP’s reputation and license” — a reference to maintaining sufficient legitimacy, credibility and trust to sustain the public’s acceptance of its business practices.

A “Defend BP Budget” document that accompanied this review listed some of the company’s U.S. sponsorship payouts, including $1.2 million to the U.S. Olympic Committee for the paralympics team, $500,000 to the Chicago Architecture Biennial, and $300,000 to the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

In 2019, a “Strategic Plan” for the launch of BP’s partnership with the American Heart Association (AHA) revealed that the launch event was designed both to “utilize the AHA’s brand to reach thought leaders, policy makers” and “to raise BP’s brand and contribute to a healthy workplace.”

In response to a request for comment, the AHA stated that “more than 85% of revenue the American Heart Association receives is from individuals, their estates, sale of our educational products and other non-corporate sources. Any funding from the energy industry is an infinitesimal part of that 15% of total corporate revenue from all sectors.”

A separate 2019 “Executive Team Meeting” memo suggested that BP tailor its sponsorship programs according to prevailing cultural trends, in this case by aligning with the #MeToo movement.

The company’s “strategic relationship matrix” had been “refreshed,” stated the memo, with a “special focus on women’s organizations.” Handwritten notes on the subpoenaed copy of the document described the #MeToo movement as an example of a rapidly mobilizing “new agenda.”

BP’s “tweaks” to its sponsorship plans included an upcoming International Women’s Day event called “Pink Petro.” Melody Meyer, a female BP board member, was to “participate in this program [and] host a reception at her home as part of the programming.”

A confidential internal memo, dated July 29, 2020, argued that BP’s $200,000 annual sponsorship of Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C. was justified on the grounds that it boosted the company’s public image via “on-stage recognition and program recognition,” and provided “elevated access to and recognition with critical Washington stakeholders.” “Members of Congress, the Administration [sic] and more” regularly attend Ford’s Theatre VIP Opening performances, receptions, and events,” noted the memo, which also extolled the benefits of BP America’s then-president and board chair Susan Dio’s seat on the theatre’s board of trustees: “The value of the Trustee role is access to DC political figures.”

Backing the British Museum

Beyond BP’s operations in the U.S., an April 2016 internal “BP position” document, instructed “authorized recipients” to emphasize the message that over 50 million people in the UK had “engaged with a BP-supported activity” thanks to its arts and culture sponsorship of the British Museum, Royal Shakespeare Company, Tate Britain, and other institutions.

Another message for staff to convey while discussing these UK sponsorships was that BP was “a fossil fuel company that is playing its part in addressing the climate challenge by advocating for a carbon price, providing lower carbon products like gas and renewables, pursuing energy efficiency and supporting research.”

According to a “2020 review” produced by the company’s Policy and Advocacy Working Group, official positions like these formed the basis for ‘high-level’ external messaging” to be used at BP “investor events,” in “executive speeches and opeds [sic],” as “responses to press inquiries” and during “civil society (NGO) engagement.”

The following year, in 2021, a BP communications and advocacy team memo instructed staff to “pivot existing sponsorships” to “mitigate social risks of the business” and “showcase bp as a British champion.”

“These documents make it abundantly clear that BP’s cultural sponsorship has nothing to do with philanthropy,” said Chris Garrard, director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, which is calling on those UK arts and cultural institutions that have not already cut ties with the fossil fuel industry to do so.

Rather, he said, sponsorships are “a strategic attempt to access high-level decision makers, to secure the public backing of leading cultural figures, and to craft a positive public image.”

In Garrard’s opinion, sponsorship is not a donation. “It is a transaction that furthers BP’s business interests, resulting in more fossil fuel expansion, and empowering their broader political lobbying to impede international climate action,” he said.

Shell Seeks a Buffer Against ‘Negative News’

In 2016, Shell was also pursuing sponsorships as a means to improve its reputation with the U.S. public.

A PowerPoint presentation for a 2016 Shell “Reputation Workshop” noted that “trust in the energy industry” was “low,” and declared climate change “an emerging issue.”

To aid the company’s reputational planning, Shell identified social and community-based groups as well as emergency and other aid organizations, as potential “business-critical US stakeholders,” which should be assessed “for opportunities that advance Shell business and reputational objectives.”

The following year, an “influencer insight” report revealed why the company saw not-for-profit partners as “stakeholders/influencers.” According to this report, “community engagement” and “philanthropy” were helping Shell cultivate public trust, which in turn would “buffer” the company “in the face of negative news.”

Shell’s hoped-for outcomes were to strengthen “stakeholder inclination to speak up for Shell” and “in some circumstances [defend] Shell from critics.”

In 2019, following Trump’s withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Shell saw an opportunity to take on “an increased leadership role to shape effective policy at multiple levels,” according to a high-level internal discussion document produced for the company’s executive committee. The policies mentioned ranged from carbon pricing, to boosting support for government subsidies of carbon capture and storage technology.

According to the document, this could be done “while maintaining a strong societal license to operate.” The document emphasized the importance of protecting Shell’s traditional business, stating that its oil and gas operations required “continuous efforts to remain a “profitable cash engine,” identifying “an opportunity to leverage America’s abundant shale gas for LNG exports” and pronouncing that “in the near to medium term, oil and gas will continue to play a key role for the US, both at home and globally.”

However, the discussion document also noted that “following the 2018 midterm elections, climate change has once again become a topic in Washington, D.C.” and that the Green New Deal legislation proposed by Democrats “has helped propel climate change onto the agendas of both the Democrats and Republicans.” Shell predicted that climate change will be a key issue in the upcoming presidential campaigns.”

An accompanying “Reputation Plan” also highlighted the problem of “low credibility and trust” amid “rising societal expectations on climate action,” especially for “onshore unconventional exploration and production,” a reference to fracking.

Shell outlined key ways to overcome this problem, such as “secure partnerships with credible external influencers” that “support and strengthen societal license to operate and grow at country and asset level,” and “make meaningful, authentic connections with people.”

By engaging with “Non-profit (NGO) Influencers / Special Publics,” Shell believed it could develop a “network of third-party advocates” and portray itself as a “preferred partner in energy transitions.”

The reputation plan included a list of influencers to engage with — which Shell blacked out before giving the document to Congress.

Records show that in 2019 Shell sponsored the Houston Open (a golf event the company had sponsored for 26 years); the Houston Mayor’s Back 2 School Festival; the Shell Game-Changer Open House at the SXSW Festival in Austin; the Shell Eco-Marathon Americas in California (a U.S. chapter of the company’s global student competition program); the 100 Resilient Cities Network (which Shell began sponsoring following Hurricane Harvey); the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival (which the company began sponsoring in 2006 following Hurricane Katrina); and the United Negro College Fund Walk for Education.

In response to a request for comment the SXSW Festival said: “Neither Shell nor any other fossil fuel companies are participating at SXSW 2025 as clients or sponsors.”

None of the other organizations or individuals receiving sponsorship from oil companies referenced in this story responded to requests for comment.

Shell did not respond to inquiries about the redacted material.

Chevron saw its sponsorship programs — which it termed “social investments” — as “a key engagement tool to build and reinforce brand awareness and favorability.”

A 2015 confidential briefing document, produced for the Chevron board’s public policy committee, stated that the company’s “social investment programs advance business objectives and establishes [sic] the company as a leader in corporate responsibility.”

The internal brief identified “U.S. Federal Climate Policy” as one of the risks that could affect the company’s business, highlighting that the Obama administration continued “to drive an aggressive regulatory agenda designed to cement the President’s climate and environmental legacy.” On the state and local levels, the brief noted that “activism continues against industry.”

The brief highlighted two areas of special concern: Some communities and civil society organizations were “attempting to link human rights to climate change and hydraulic fracturing debates,” and others were calling for fossil fuel companies to pay for the costs of climate impacts.

The brief also summarized the positive value of Chevron’s sponsorship efforts, citing public opinion surveys showing that when people were familiar with these sponsorship programs, their attitudes about the company were more favorable, increasing “support for our operations in their communities by a margin of 2:1.”

By 2017, records show that Chevron was sponsoring organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering. The company’s own Appalachia Partnership Initiative was directing funding to projects in communities located near Chevron’s fracking operations in the Marcellus Shale, such as ShaleNET scholarships for regional workforces and the Inquire Within rural library program.

In July 2017, two months after the People’s Climate March, “an updated list of key global policy issues that can impact Chevron’s business” (prepared for a meeting of the same public policy committee) included “off-oil activism” in the U.S. The document characterized this activism as “aimed at transitioning to a low carbon economy” by “convincing the public and policymakers that economic growth can be decoupled from [greenhouse gas] emissions and that society can be powered by renewable energy.”

Chevron noted that this message was “being propagated to strengthen public support for anti-fossil fuel ballot initiatives, pressure consumer facing companies to make renewable energy and climate commitments, provoke protests involving physical disruption of infrastructure development, and significantly increase non-governmental organization (NGO) fundraising.”

In light of these threats, board members were assured that “Chevron’s global [social investment] activity remains focused on areas aligned with our business needs.”

That year, Chevron sponsored the annual Chevron Houston Marathon, attracting over 300,000 people (an event the company, according Feldman, began supporting in 2005), along with famous cultural organizations such as the San Francisco Symphony and the Smithsonian Institution.

A separate “Brand Positioning Brief,” also prepared for the July 2017 committee meeting, declared that “[T]oday more than ever, effective brand and reputation management is critical.” The brief described Chevron’s sponsorships as “a key engagement tool to build and reinforce” the company’s “brand awareness and favorability.”

The documents show that at the same time Chevron was seeking to bolster its reputation through sponsorships, the company was also closely monitoring developments in domestic climate policy, as well as tracking the continued momentum of what it termed an “anti-fossil fuel agenda” being pursued by climate activists and “leading environmental NGOs.”

A 2017 Chevron “Public Policy Update” reported that while activism was a continuing challenge at the state level, the fossil fuel industry was increasing its “ability to counter activism.”

On international climate policy, Chevron noted that “many governments in countries key to Chevron are adapting policies…to address climate change and to meet their [Paris] Agreement goals.”

An internal briefing document, prepared for the company’s board of directors ahead of a 2016 tour of Australia, stated that “partnerships are essential to our ability to develop energy resources. We build long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with host governments, national and international energy companies, and nongovernmental organizations.”

The briefing listed the community benefits achieved through Chevron’s support of Australian cultural events and groups such as the Chevron Focus Environment photography competition, the Perth International Arts Festival, and Many Rivers Microfinance. The document also emphasized that the company’s strategic partnerships “focus on maximising return on investment and help the ABU [Australian Business Unit] achieve its long-term business objectives.”

Chevron did not respond to a request for comment.

‘Denial and Doublespeak’

In their final report, titled “Denial, Disinformation, and Doublespeak,” the congressional investigators who subpoenaed the documents found that between 2015 and 2021, all of the companies examined (which also included ExxonMobil) “routinely misled the public and investors” about their emission reduction targets, plans to comply with the Paris Agreement, and commitments to support various climate policies.

“Big Oil’s multi-pronged scheme to lock in fossil fuel dependence relies on masquerading as a trusted clean energy partner,” said Sen. Whitehouse. “Just as Big Tobacco lied about the harms of its products to deceive the public, Big Oil is perpetrating a similar disinformation campaign against the American people, policymakers, and its investors.”

In the U.S. and around the world, oil and gas companies continue to sponsor cultural and community groups.

Following Hurricane Helene in September 2024, Chevron announced a donation of $250,000 to groups assisting with relief and recovery efforts. In January, as wildfires devastated parts of Los Angeles, Chevron announced a $1 million donation “to support relief efforts.”

The costs of these disasters are markedly higher. Hurricane Helene is estimated to have caused $59.6 billion worth of damage, and its destructive power was made 200-500 times more likely by the burning of fossil fuels, according to scientists at the World Weather Attribution project. Damages from the Los Angeles fires are estimated at $250 to $275 billion, according to AccuWeather.

A January study involving over 30 researchers worldwide found that climate change made the chances of such fires 35 percent more likely in 2025 compared to pre-industrial times.

Sponsorships of the Girl Scouts, museum exhibitions, and marathons “in no way make up for the damage that the fossil fuel companies are causing. It also buys the corporations more time to continue their business-as-usual model,” said Brulle, the sociologist at Brown University. “It fits to the larger strategy of the fossil fuel companies to maintain their business practices as usual for as long as possible to maximize their profits.”

Re: Oppose the Anti-Environmental Billionaire Tax Scam

Dear Representative:

The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) believes that everyone has a right to clean air, clean water, public lands, and a safe climate protected by a just and equitable democracy. Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of members of Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and the media.

We urge you to oppose the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” more accurately named the anti-environmental billionaire tax scam, the most extreme and sweeping anti-environmental piece of legislation in U.S. history. With nearly 100 separate anti-environmental provisions, it would increase costs for working families through higher energy bills, compromise the health of our communities by rolling back and cutting funding for critical environmental protections, and harm our global competitiveness in the race for a clean energy future, all to justify cutting taxes for billionaires and wealthy corporations and giving further handouts to polluters.

Clean energy is the fastest, cheapest way to bring new electricity onto the grid, increasing reliability and lowering household energy costs. Unfortunately, this partisan reconciliation bill would enable Congress to rescind hundreds of billions of dollars in tax credits and funding for clean energy, transmission, and energy efficiency, including rebates for household energy performance, increasing costs for working families while harming our environment. The bill uses these cuts to finance tax breaks for billionaires and polluting corporations who need it the least, while creating pay-to-play permitting schemes that allow polluters to pay for fast-tracked environmental reviews that block harmed communities from having their day in court. Rescinding tax credits that have already been promised to consumers and businesses to help them save money, create jobs, and reduce their carbon footprint in all 50 states will increase energy costs by hundreds of dollars per year for families, cut over 800,000 jobs, and stifle economic growth by risking over $500 billion in private investments.

In addition to cutting programs that lower costs in the first place, the bill cuts programs meant to provide assistance to those who need it most, including critical lifelines for millions of people like Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC. What’s more, this resolution plans to offset the costs of these cuts by selling off our pristine public lands and waters to the oil and gas industry for drilling, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, despite the fact that the most recent lease sale raised $0.

This partisan reconciliation bill puts our health and safety at risk. It cuts funding for all manner of environmental protections. It eliminates the penalty for fossil fuel companies that fail to reduce their dangerous methane pollution while cutting funds to monitor, enforce, protect and improve air and water quality. It also directs hundreds of billions of dollars to turbocharge mass deportations, militarize the border, fund immigration raids in schools and other community spaces, and tear families apart.

For all these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote NO on the anti-environmental billionaire tax scheme. While our typical vote recommendations note that we will consider including votes in our Scorecard, in this instance we are stating unequivocally that we will score this extremely damaging legislation in our 2025 National Environmental Scorecard.

In the United States, biodiesel is also extensively applied in transportation, agriculture, and the industrial sector. It fuels trucks, buses, and marine vessels, lowering greenhouse gas emissions as well as fossil fuel dependence. The agricultural industry is also helped by biodiesel through powering farm machinery, while fleets of government and the commercial sector use it to achieve sustainability targets. Biodiesel is also employed in home heating systems (bioheat) and as a substitute fuel in power production. With renewable energy policies and federal incentives encouraging its use, biodiesel remains a key player in the clean energy revolution in the U.S.

Growth Drivers in United States Biodiesel Market

Government Policies and Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS)

The U.S. government is a major driver of biodiesel market growth through policies such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). This law requires refiners of fuel to mix a portion of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel, into their fuel supply. Federal and state incentives, such as tax credits and grants, also promote the use of biodiesel. Initiatives like the Biodiesel Tax Credit (BTC) make biodiesel more cost-effective, further increasing consumption and production.

These regulations, which are designed to cut carbon emissions and enhance energy independence, are major forces driving the growing demand for biodiesel in the United States. Dec 2023, The EPA must establish volume requirements for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2023-2025 under the Clean Air Act, including cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel. This move entails a second addendum standard covering the judicial remand of the 2016 rulemaking and a number of regulatory adjustments to enhance the RFS program, especially in relation to biogas. The EPA is not finalizing provisions for the production of RINs from renewable electricity at this moment.

Increasing Demand for Low-Carbon and Sustainable Fuels

With growing concerns about climate change and carbon emissions, industries and consumers alike in the U.S. are making a turn towards cleaner energy options. Biodiesel, which has a huge emissions reduction advantage over petroleum diesel, is becoming increasingly popular in the transportation, agricultural, and industrial markets. Corporations and governmental fleets are increasingly using biodiesel to achieve sustainability objectives. Moreover, countries with aggressive emissions cut-off targets like California and Washington are promoting biodiesel consumption, fueling business growth.

The increasing demand for green fuels makes biodiesel a leading contender for shifting to sustainable energy. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has published its ""Pathways to Commercial Liftoff"" report, where it emphasized the capability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to greatly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. The report examines the preparedness of different SAF production technologies and provides recommendations for public and private sectors to make the U.S. a leader in SAF production by 2030.

Technological Advancements in Biodiesel Production

Ongoing technological advancements in biodiesel production are increasing efficiency and reducing costs, driving market growth in the U.S. Improved processing technologies, including transesterification and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) technology, enhance biodiesel yield and quality. Scientists also seek to develop alternative feedstocks such as algae-based and waste-derived biodiesel to further increase production capacity.

Enhanced refining processes make biodiesel more compatible with conventional diesel engines, leading to greater adoption by industries. With advancing technology and declining production costs, biodiesel grows into a competitive and potential substitute for conventional fossil fuels, boosting its market share. In 2023, Be8 moved into the US market and made investments in technology for biofuel production and a cereal-based ethanol venture. The firm wants to create a global tech company with a specialization in renewable energies.

Challenges in the United States Biodiesel Market

Feedstock Price Volatility

Production costs for biodiesel are greatly affected by feedstock prices, such as vegetable oils and animal fats. Price volatilities in soybean, canola, and other crops contribute to the cost of biodiesel, making it less competitive with traditional diesel when feedstock prices increase. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions in the global supply base, severe weather, and changes in agricultural policies also contribute to feedstock price volatility. This is a real challenge for biodiesel manufacturers since it influences production volume and profitability.

Competition from Other Renewable Fuels

Though biodiesel is the prime alternative fuel, other renewable energy options like renewable diesel, electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen fuel cells are increasingly posing competition to it. Renewable diesel, especially, has seen increased usage because it is chemically similar to petroleum diesel and can be integrated into existing infrastructure without any hassles or modifications. Government incentives for EV use and better battery technologies also pose a threat to biodiesel consumption in the long term. In order to sustain market share, the biodiesel sector needs to keep innovating and resolve issues of cost, efficiency, and scalability.

This funding, provided through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will enhance Louisville’s ability to clean up contaminated properties and transform blighted sites into productive, sustainable spaces.

“We are excited to receive these federal grants, which will allow us to continue addressing environmental challenges and drive reinvestment in our communities,” said Mayor Greenberg. “By revitalizing brownfield sites, we are not only improving public health and environmental conditions but also paving the way for new economic opportunities.”

The first award, a $750,000 supplemental grant, will strengthen Louisville’s existing revolving loan fund. These funds can be used for programmatic expenses and to create additional and larger cleanup loans for eligible recipients. Louisville qualified for this funding due to its demonstrated success in managing a high-performing revolving loan program and maintaining a robust pipeline of potential projects.

Additionally, Louisville Metro Government was awarded an additional $2 million joint application Community-wide Coalition Assessment Grant with the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection and Russell: A Place of Promise. Funding from this grant will enable Louisville Metro Government to conduct environmental site assessments on properties within the Russell neighborhood, a priority focus area for concerted efforts to counter decades of disinvestment. The allocation of funds to Louisville Metro will be determined collaboratively with the State as the coalition develops a workplan, which must be approved by the EPA before any funds are expended.

The Japanese car giant said on Tuesday it would cut investment in EVs from a planned 10 trillion yen (£51.7bn) by 2030 to 7 trillion yen (£36.2bn). The company is to focus on hybrids instead. It now expects electric cars to represent 20pc of sales by the end of the decade, compared to a previous forecast of 30pc.

Bosses blamed disappointing demand and moves by foreign governments to roll back green regulations designed to encourage EV purchases, such as those recently announced by the US and UK.

Toshihiro Mibe, Honda’s chief executive, said: “Based on the current market slowdown, we expect EV sales in 2030 to fall below the 30pc that we previously targeted.

“EV investment hasn’t been abandoned, just pushed back.”

Pivot towards hybrids

Honda said it will pivot towards boosting sales of hybrid vehicles – as it reduces focus on electric cars.

Only in China, where EVs now dominate new car sales, will it focus on purely electric models.

Sir Keir Starmer’s Government amended green rules, known as the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, earlier this year to provide greater flexibility for car manufacturers on targets for electric vehicle sales.

Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” passing through Congress aims to remove tax credits for EV buyers over the next few years.

Honda now expects to sell 2.2m to 2.3m hybrids by 2030, out of a total of 3.6m cars. By comparison, Honda’s forecasts suggest it expects electric sales to total just 700,000 to 750,000 cars.

Honda said it will launch 13 new hybrid models in the four years from 2027.

Despite the changes, Honda has insisted that it continues to work towards the goal of all cars it sells being either electric or fuel-cell powered by 2040.

The company last week warned it faced a huge hit to profits from President Trump’s trade tariffs on cars imported to the US.

Some 60pc of Honda’s US-sold cars are made in the country, but the president’s tariffs have made it much more expensive for Japanese manufacturers to import cars or parts from Canada and Mexico.

Amid the trade chaos, Honda has paused plans for a C$15bn (£8bn) EV production hub in Ontario, Canada.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000389883916_17477341594940_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqBAv6lVOesLvutkytnWmMFxxYQMflB4Mfwu-Ty6YYI2E.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-05-20 22:06:19.750015

The Tennessee Valley Authority announced Tuesday that it is the first utility in the U.S. to submit a construction permit application for the GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy small modular reactor (SMR) BWRX-300 technology to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission – the agency that issues licenses for constructing, operating and decommissioning nuclear power plants. This CPA is TVA’s next step in pursuing an SMR at its Clinch River site, near Oak Ridge, Tn., and establishing America’s energy dominance to power artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing.

“This is a significant milestone for TVA, our region and our nation because we are accelerating the development of new nuclear technology, its supply chain and delivery model to unleash American energy. TVA has put in the work to advance the design and develop the first application for the BWRX-300 technology, creating a path for other utilities who choose to build the same technology,” Don Moul, TVA president and CEO, said. “TVA looks forward to working with the Administration to accelerate advanced nuclear technologies that are key to our nation’s energy security. We believe deploying new nuclear is essential to providing American families and businesses affordable and abundant electricity for decades to come.”

Officials said, ""SMRs are advanced reactors with a smaller and more modular design than the nuclear technology that powers many U.S. states today. TVA is pursuing the BWRX-300 technology, with the potential benefits of enhancing safety, making them easier to replicate and more efficient.

But some states have suspended charging projects tied to that pot of money after the Trump administration paused implementation.","(Bloomberg) — Installation of high-speed chargers across the U.S. fell by more than 21% in the first quarter compared to the year-earlier period, according to an analysis of Energy Department data.

And with House Republicans proposing ending Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for buyers while the Trump administration rolls back auto emissions standards, it threatens to create a negative feedback loop of fewer charger installations and lower EV adoption. Such an outcome risks setting the sector back to trying to rev up EV sales with middling installation growth rather than rapid expansion that would give buyers the confidence they’d be able to find electrons.

“The uncertainty has automakers scaling back EV investments,” BloombergNEF analyst Ash Wang said in an email. She added that “if we continue in this direction, BNEF’s outlook for annual U.S. charger installations in 2030 could be adjusted downward by 30% or more.”

The group has already reduced its cumulative estimate for U.S. charging installations to 285,000 from 360,000 this year due to the threats to EVs.

The IRA, signed by former President Joe Biden in 2022, offers tax credits of up to $7,500 for EV buyers. Wood Mackenzie analyst Emil Koenig said his firm’s charging projections are based on the EV tax credit since it’s still in place, though WoodMac still lowered its charging outlook compared to last year.

Some Senate Republicans have indicated they’ll rewrite parts of the House proposal, so the tax credit may still survive. But its removal would “materially affect our forecast,” Koenig said.

The bipartisan infrastructure law also set aside $5 billion to build out charging infrastructure. But some states have suspended charging projects tied to that pot of money after the Trump administration paused implementation.

“President Biden’s ridiculous EV initiative promised much but delivered nothing, leaving American taxpayers to cover the cost of crony deals that enriched the Democrats’ base,” White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in response to questions about the slowdown in charging infrastructure. “President Trump was elected to dismantle the Green New Scam, and he is fully committed to doing so.”

A spokesman for Biden didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The U.S. currently has more than 208,000 public ports, according to the Energy Department. Additions are moving too slowly to meet EV demand, according to BNEF, with about 174,000 average installations required annually to keep up with its 2030 projection under a scenario that assumes no further energy policies are put in place globally. Halting government support for charging will deter investments in the sector, leading to plug scarcity and directly impacting EV ownership, according to an analysis by S&P Global.

Analysts are also closely watching how Trump’s tariffs will impact both EV sales and charging. About 35% of EVs sold in the U.S. last year were imported, and vehicles assembled locally with parts sourced overseas may see prices jump due to tariffs. That will keep price-sensitive buyers away, according to WoodMac.

Tariffs could delay the rollout of EVs in the $25,000 range, said Koenig. “These low-cost vehicle models will be pivotal for broader EV adoption and charging infrastructure deployment, so any delay would also materially set back the adoption curve.”

The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.","HONG KONG (AP) — Shares in CATL, the world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, jumped more than 16% Tuesday in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world's largest initial public offering this year.

The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.

CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.

A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.

The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China's military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a ""mistake.""

In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.

In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.

The U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the Chinese military and U.S. investors inside the U.S. were excluded from the ""Regulation S"" share offering. Such offerings do not require registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.

The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.

Government officials, including Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city's vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.

""Listing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it's also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,"" Zeng said.

Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.

In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is ""Ningde Era.""

CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.

Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn't seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.

The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.

The amount of funds raised through IPOs in Hong Kong rose 89% year-on-year in 2024 following a double-digit decrease in 2023, according to Yujia Li, an analyst at the Hong Kong Financial Research Institute of the Bank of China.

CATL recorded a profit of 55.3 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in 2024, up 16.8% from 2023. Its listing surpassed JX Advanced Metals' $2.9 billion IPO in Japan in March, which was previously the largest this year, according to Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs.",https://img.manufacturing.net/files/base/indm/multi/image/2025/05/CATL.682c82b88e21b.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&rect=0%2C6%2C4000%2C2250&w=1200,N,,2025-05-21 05:05:13.824103

Honda (HMC) on Tuesday scaled back its electric vehicle targets, citing diminishing U.S. demand. The Japanese automaker had initially planned to invest $69 billion in an electrification strategy by the end of 2031 but has reduced the figure to $48 billion.

“The environment surrounding the automobile industry is changing day by day. Uncertainty in the business environment is increasing, due particularly to the slowdown in the expansion of the EV market due to several factors, including changes in environmental regulations,” Honda said in a statement.

The decision is “a switch in the planned course,” said Honda Motor Co. Chief Executive Toshihiro Mibe. Although the company remains committed to its long-term electrification, the roadmap faces delays, he added.

And General Motors (GM) on Monday halted exports of Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicles to China, and announced it will forgo plans to export other high-end models there. G.M. began shipping the America-made Tahoes to China last year, a spokesman said, under a scheme called the Durant Guild, named after G.M founder, Billy Durant.

“Due to significant changes to economic conditions, we have decided to restructure the Durant Guild and correspondingly optimize G.M. China’s operations,” the automaker said in a statement. Yet, it’s worth noting, Durant exports account for less than 0.1 percent of the 443,000 vehicles that G.M. manufactures and sells in China.

There are several obstacles weighing on the domestic auto industry.

Trump introduced a 25% tariff on cars and parts imported into the U.S. in March. Shortly after, the S&P Global (SPGI) downgraded its 2025 forecast for U.S. vehicle sales by 700,000. This is on top tit-for-tax tariffs: a 30% levy remains on Chinese goods, and U.S. imports into China face a 10% tax.

The GOP also has launched an assault on EVs. House Republicans have proposed ending Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for buyers, and the Trump administration is rolling back auto emissions standards.

New data suggests that EV demand could be slowing as a result. Installation of high-speed chargers fell by more than 21% in the first quarter compared to the year-earlier period, according to a Bloomberg analysis of Energy Department data. BloombergNEF has reduced its cumulative estimate for U.S. charging installations by 20% this year, down to 285,000. BloombergNEF analyst Ash Wang foresees annual U.S. charger installations by 2030 even dropping by 30% or more, “if [we] continue in this direction,” she told Bloomberg.

Souring consumer sentiment toward Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk may also be hampering sales. An Axios Harris Poll 100 on Tuesday revealed a 30% drop in Tesla’s reputation over the last decade, plummeting from “Excellent” to “Poor.”

Shares in Tesla fell by more than 50% between December and April, although they have rebounded in recent weeks as Musk reassured investors he would be taking a step back from overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.","https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/df5f6b27198ae2341cb9b8c607b9fe19.jpg",N,,2025-05-20 22:06:29.038354

Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) is placing a hold on the Trump administration’s picks for key roles at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over Republican efforts to ax a California state rule that phases out new gas-powered cars in the state.

The hold may not ultimately block the four pending EPA nominees from being confirmed, but it will slow the process, requiring the chamber to spend hours debating and taking additional votes for each nominee.

With a handful of nominees, holds are more of an annoyance, though in some cases, like when Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) put holds on hundreds of military promotions, they have successfully delayed nominations for a significant period.

Padilla’s office said in a written statement that his hold would last “until Republicans stop their reckless attempts to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision regarding California’s clean air waivers.”

Republicans are attempting to overturn the Biden administration’s approval of a California state rule that bans the sale of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035. They’re similarly targeting approvals of state rules governing truck emissions and air pollution.

They’re trying to use a legislative tool called the Congressional Review Act (CRA) that allows Congress to target recently issued rules using a simple majority vote, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold.

However, internal arbiters in both the House and the Senate have ruled that the Biden-era approval is not a rule and therefore is not subject to the CRA. The House has moved ahead anyway, and the Senate has said it will do so as well.

Padilla, in a new statement, criticized how the Trump EPA has handled the approval, saying the agency submitted its predecessor’s moves as “rules” to Congress rather than a “waivers” to help get rid of them.

“This objection is a direct result of the agency’s cynical attempt to weaponize the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by attempting to submit as ‘rules’ three waivers issued to the State of California under the Clean Air Act (CAA),” he said in a statement.

“If this attempt is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, not only for our clean energy economy, the air our children breathe, and for our climate, but for the future of the CRA and for the Senate as an institution,” he added.

Democrats have accused their Republican counterparts of using the “nuclear option,” effectively eliminating the filibuster when it’s convenient for them. However, Senate Republicans argue that because their parliamentarian’s decision was based on a ruling from the GAO, it should not apply.

The conservative view Many conservatives are determined to repeal or at least delay and dilute most of the clean energy breaks.","Start saying goodbye to a lot of big clean energy credits if President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress have their way this week.

The GOP-run House is ready to vote on repealing or diluting a long list of measures that, among things, currently allow qualified buyers of energy-efficient vehicles to get $7,500 back. Or permit consumers to get credits for certain heat pumps and other household energy savers.

Opponents of the changes see environmental and economic disaster

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena, tried to keep the credits intact. His bid lost in a 25 to 19 party-line vote in the House Ways and Means Committee.

Thompson pointed out that the credits are helping create jobs in Republican as well as Democratic congressional districts.

“To say stop…is crazy,” he said.

Supporters of the changes countered that the legislation would end a system that’s complicated, favors higher-income earners and discourages the use of more traditional types of energy.

The changes are part of the “one big, beautiful” tax and budget bill the House is considering.

The bill would extend current income tax rates and breaks due to expire at the end of the year. Republican leaders see repealing most of the clean energy breaks enacted during President Joe Biden’s administration as a useful way to pay for the changes..

All this has a long way to go in Congress. A lot of more moderate Republicans are reluctant to repeal the clean energy incentives. A group of conservatives dislikes how the breaks add trillions to the nation’s debt.

Even if the bill does pass the House, and leaders are aiming for a Thursday vote, it has to survive the Senate, where it also faces strong Democratic and moderate Republican opposition.

Help for consumers

Under current law, consumers can qualify for a credit of up to $7,500 if they buy a new, qualified plug-in electric vehicle or fuel cell electric vehicles purchased from 2023 to 2031.

Buyers have to use it themselves, use it primarily in this country and have a modified gross income of no more than $300,000 for married couples filing jointly or surviving spouse, or $225,000 for heads of households and $150,000 for all others.

Another popular credit helps homeowners. The Residential Clean Energy Credit is 30% of qualifying products and services installed in a home in this country from 2022 to 2032. The credit can apply to solar electric panels, solar water heaters, wind turbines, geothermal heat pumps, fuel cells and battery storage technology.

The internal Revenue Service says credits can be used for “labor costs for onsite preparation, assembly or original installation of the property and for piping or wiring to connect it to the home.”

Clean energy advocates say that rolling back these credits will be costly not only in dollars, but in environmental damage.

“This bill would pull the rug out from under one of the most dynamic parts of the American economy. These tax credits have helped deliver billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy,” said Christy Goldfuss, Natural Resources Defense Council executive director.

The organization estimates that the cutbacks would increase residential electricity bills in California by 3% by 2032 and by 6% by 2040.

That means every state household would spend about $940 more on their electricity bills over the next two decades.

E2, a national nonpartisan business group, said clean energy and clean vehicle companies added 149,170 new jobs in just the first year after the passage of the 2022 law, including 21,600 jobs in California.

Today, about 3.5 million Americans work in clean energy-related jobs, including nearly 550,000 Californians, according to E2.

Overall, the credits and other grants are estimated to add $133 billion to the state’s economy and attract $246 billion in new investments over the next 10 years, according to the NRDC, supporting 91,500 jobs a year in the state.

The conservative view

Many conservatives are determined to repeal or at least delay and dilute most of the clean energy breaks.

The law “contains eight major energy subsidies, each of which burdens taxpayers, inflates energy costs, and threatens the reliability of our power grid,” wrote 38 Republicans – none from California – to Trump and congressional leaders last month.

“Each of these subsidies props up unreliable energy sources while displacing dependable, proven energy like coal and natural gas,” they said.

At the center-right Tax Foundation, Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst, had another take on why changes would be useful: The current system is a complex maze of laws that few consumers can understand. A more comprehensible tax code would make more sense, he said..

“Tax simplification has two aspects. The first is a code without a mess of targeted provisions for various social policy goals. The second is a code with provisions that are simple and easy to comply with,” he said.

While the bill succeeds at the first goal, he still saw it not going far enough in eliminating complex rules and establishing new ones.

A lot of conservatives remained adamant that the breaks get tossed.

“Congress has to stop repeating history — we know that keeping wind and solar credits in this bill will drain taxpayers, offshore American jobs, and prevent American energy dominance,” said Rep. Josh Brecheen, R-Okla. “President Trump has been clear: it’s time to end the Green New Scam.”

They’re in for a fight, especially in the Senate, where Democrats are planning their battle.

The changes are not about compromising this country’s energy strategy, said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

“It’s about protecting their oil and gas donors, ceding the global clean car market to China, and keeping Americans dependent on polluting vehicles that poison our air,” he said.

That was really the root of conceptualizing energy insecurity.

Jason Bordoff: While we often associate energy poverty with developing nations, the reality is that tens of millions of Americans struggle to pay their energy bills every month. Oftentimes, they forgo heating or cooling their homes in order to pay rent or buy food. And ultimately, they risk losing access to energy altogether through utility shutoffs. For families living in inadequate housing with poor insulation and inefficient appliances, energy insecurity impacts health, comfort and quality of life. For some, government assistance programs are a lifeline. Yet despite rising energy rates, federal energy assistance programs like LIHEAP are in danger of losing funding. So what policy solutions could address the systemic causes of energy insecurity? How can government assistance be reframed to better support and empower energy insecure households? And will the transition to clean energy alleviate or worsen the problem of energy insecurity?

This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Jason Bordoff. Today on the show, Professor Diana Hernández. Diana is an associate professor at Columbia University and she co-directs the Energy Opportunity Lab right here at the Center on Global Energy Policy, and she is just out with a fantastic new book, “Powerless: The People’s Struggle for Energy,” which she co-authored with Jennifer Laird, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology at Lehman College. It was released this year in April. Diana joined me to discuss the book, which documents the lived experiences of energy insecure Americans. We talked about her personal story growing up in subsidized housing in the Bronx and how that informs her research. We explored how innovative policy solutions might address the inadequacies of our current energy assistance programs, and we discuss the connections between energy justice and the clean energy transition. I really hope you enjoy this conversation.

Diana Hernández, welcome to Columbia Energy Exchange. So great to have you on the program to talk about your work.

Diana Hernández: Thank you, Jason. So excited to be here.

Jason Bordoff: And so great to have you as a colleague and have you as part of the Center on Global Energy Policy. The work you do is fascinating and you’re a phenomenal person, so just thanks for being part of the organization and congratulations on the new book, “Powerless,” which I was just rereading again this morning and just an incredibly valuable contribution, I think, to a topic we don’t talk about nearly enough. So in the world of energy, there’s a lot of discussion of energy access, energy poverty, and when people say words like that, I think they tend to think of places like Africa. They don’t think of our neighborhood in Harlem or other areas of the United States. So just talk a little bit for our listeners about your book and your life’s work.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, well, Jason, such a pleasure to be in conversation with you and to have the opportunity to just be on the podcast. So yeah, I mean definitely I think you kind of hit it on the nose. We think about people that are impoverished and lack access to something as basic as energy in other places, these are remote issues and they affect other people in other places, but in the shadows of what is happening in the US and in other developed economies, people that are poor and/or have limited access to high quality housing, for instance, do experience issues. I call it energy insecurity, and I can kind of explain why that terminology is important. Other people call it energy poverty. There’s been kind of evolutions around fuel poverty or energy burden. The work that I do in talking about it as household energy insecurity is really rooted in a parallel to food insecurity and in many parts of both academic research, but also policy, food insecurity receives a lot of attention, and it’s understood that it’s two-pronged. One is about the quality of food that people have access to and the ability to afford it. And the same thing is true around energy. There’s an affordability aspect to it that’s so fundamental where people just don’t have the financial wherewithal to be able to pay their utility bills. And those utility bills have been increasing and kind of inching up, and that’s part of what’s driving it, but also more drawdowns on household budgets. And so the affordability aspect is there are many different reasons for it, and then there’s housing quality issues, and some of that is about the systems of a home.

Jason Bordoff: So it’s not, when you said food, it’s quality and affordability. There’s healthy food, non-healthy food. But energy, it’s like you have heat, you have the lights go on you, so you’re not talking about the quality of the energy, you’re talking about

Diana Hernández: The home as the system through which energy flows, and that is actually what delivers comfort. For instance, we’re in a hot room right now, right? Yeah. Air conditioning is not

Jason Bordoff: Working in this room,

Diana Hernández: And it’s actually in those instances where you realize what it means to be in a room that ought to be at a comfortable temperature, and it isn’t. Now when that intersects with poverty, that actually sometimes is by choice so that people are under consuming energy in order to save on their utility bills, and that is a big driver. Destiny Knox’s work really talks about

Jason Bordoff: One of our former faculty affiliates.

Diana Hernández: That’s right. And the energy equity gap where people are waiting six degrees for the temperature outdoors to be six degrees higher before they’re actually turning on their air conditioning units. That’s an example of what,

Jason Bordoff: And in your definition of energy insecurity, if you’re accepting discomfort, it is uncomfortably hot to sleep or whatever, you don’t want to turn the air conditioning on because it’s expensive. Is that captured in your definition, sort of foregoing those comforts or basic needs, however you define it?

Diana Hernández: It is. So coping is a big dimension. So there’s an economic dimension. There’s the home, the physical dimension of energy insecurity, and then there’s the adaptive coping strategies that households use to get by. And some of those are juggling bills. And that is the difficult choices of poverty where people have to choose between the basics around food, medicine, clothing for children, etc., and their utility bill. Then some of it is discomfort, and some of that is based on the housing conditions. And then some of it is just deprivation, like depriving oneself of the use of energy because of the affordability challenges oftentimes.

Jason Bordoff: Meaning living in uncomfortable or even dangerous cold weather because you don’t have access to heat. You either can’t afford it, you need for food or other things, or maybe have been disconnected because of unpaid bills or something else.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, I mean then one of the things that comes out of this book, so kind of delineating the essential elements of energy insecurity, I come from a public health background. I’m a trained sociologist.

Jason Bordoff: Tell people about how you came to do this work, which I think you started 20 years ago or something like that, 15 years ago,

Diana Hernández: It feels like that

Jason Bordoff: With, as I recall it, a home-based study in Dorchester, Massachusetts, which kind of brought you to this work.

Diana Hernández: So I trained in sociology through and through undergrad, and I got my PhD at Cornell and I was studying inequality, and those were the kind of conceptual roots of my work. And in a really open-minded way in graduate school, I just decided to take on this research project that my advisor just couldn’t do, and she was like, I would do this project, but I don’t have the time, so why don’t you do it? And I really did go in with an open mind and what I learned to be kind of an open heart in doing this work because I was sitting in people’s living rooms trying to understand the relationship between housing and health, equipped to look at crowding and mold and lead and asbestos, but totally surprised by the energy stories that came up again and again. That was really the root of conceptualizing energy insecurity was just sitting in homes in Boston and trying to understand what was happening and then realizing that this was happening in many other places where I was carrying out research. Some of the issues, actually some of the topical focus areas of the research were none to do with energy, but it was still coming up because we know that energy is everywhere. And then I wanted to intentionally do this, follow up a national study based in 10 different places around the country, really varied. Montana, Arizona, California, Tennessee, Detroit, Pennsylvania, here in New York City, of course Puerto Rico, and I don’t think that’s 10, but you get the point. It’s far and wide. And just to really track people that were inside of the energy assistance orbit, like seeking assistance and then people that were outside of the energy assistance orbit, so maybe getting help elsewhere or through social networks.

And that was an important strategy because some of our prior research had shown, in fact, the paper that I co-authored with Jennifer Laird, who’s the co-author on “Powerless,” showed that people that energy assistance is a last resort. People aren’t necessarily going to energy assistance first. They usually go there in a moment of crisis oftentimes because you’re facing a utility disconnection. So it isn’t necessarily the first order response, it’s the last order response. And that’s why in many ways what we have as an energy assistance response or safety net in the US is really rooted in people on the brink of or already shut off.

Jason Bordoff: I mean, there’s a variety of assistance programs for important needs. Society has determined are important needs, food stamps obviously and others. Is there something different with energy where people are not using what is available to them and waiting until crisis, is that different than other things where we have social assistance programs?

Diana Hernández: Yeah, well, so, great question, and I think it really has to do with the fact that those other assistance programs are considered to be entitlements. So if you are income eligible, you are entitled to those programs. The way that energy assistance works, that it is a block grant to states, states determine how it’s allocated, but it’s limited and it’s limited both in terms of the geographies, what states have access to bigger pots of funding. All states have some energy assistance, some have more funding, and that depends on heating and cooling degree days. So what’s happening outside that might render necessary to heat or cool the indoor space. And then also the proportion of a state’s population that would be eligible by virtue of where they are on the poverty – in relation to the federal poverty levels. So there’s complexity to it. I think there are other drivers too.

Energy used to be really inexpensive and it is not a priority. So the first order priority in terms of a household budget is often rent or a mortgage, then food and then energy may be tertiary. So that’s part of why it also doesn’t get as much policy attention from the poverty world is that it just doesn’t rise up to the same level as healthcare costs or education or whatever. It’s like in the universe of basic needs. It seems like it’s the throwaway and usually for people that are able to meet their energy needs, it is a throwaway, but for people that are unable to, for whatever reason, it’s everything. I think this book really kind of shows the human toll.

Jason Bordoff: So talk about the book. It is for people who are low income, of course it is much more difficult to afford things many of us take for granted, food, healthcare, energy, and we probably don’t talk about that enough, but we know that is true. So what’s the contribution you’re making with this book beyond drawing attention to the issue?

Diana Hernández: So “Powerless” really just, I like to say that it tells a story of energy insecurity in the US, which by itself is a gift. And I say that because I was saying that I’m a trained sociologist and have been a researcher in public health for a very long time, and there really isn’t a book that lays this out in such a comprehensive way. And it was kind of a necessary story to tell because we can’t solve for problems like energy burden if we still don’t have a good handle on the why. So this book is really an answer to why should people care and how does it impact people on a day-to-day basis? And not just the neediest of needy, but also people that are just working, they’re on fixed incomes. They may have had a shock, they might’ve lost their job, and then all of a sudden they’re thrust into this hardship that is not that difficult to get into. But really challenging I think for some households to get out of. And I think this book really lays out how all of that unfolds using a narrative based approach that’s coupled with statistics from two different national studies. So not just showing that it’s consequential, but also that it’s pretty common.

Jason Bordoff: And that I think is what’s such a great contribution and makes it such a great book. And some academics, not all are able to do this the way you can. It’s both the narrative, the stories that really do put this in personal terms and help you understand how this affects people. But also it’s analytically rigorous. I mean, it’s research. You’re a faculty member here for a reason. It’s research and really, so for people listening, tell them what the findings of that research is, how we’re talking about what the problem is, how widespread a problem is this?

Diana Hernández: So on super conservative terms, right? Conditioned on affordability, you have a demonstrated need. You’ve either fallen behind on your utility bills or you report having difficulty paying your utility bills. We estimate that 10 to 13% of the US population experiences, actively, energy insecurity. And so that means that they have an economic demonstration of need, a physical and/or coping kind of combination of two or more indicators, but premised on having an economic need. But we also show that 40%, an additional 40% of the US population has a non-economic experience around energy insecurity. And that could be as simple as you live in an old home and you have single pane windows that are drafty. And no matter what you do, that draft is coming in and maybe you even live in an exclusive neighborhood that has, I

Jason Bordoff: Mean, half the buildings in New York leave their windows open in the winter because the radiators too, so they’re wasting energy. But for many people, I shouldn’t say most, but for many people that’s not an economic strain. So I just want to be clear between the 10 and 13% and the 40%, how you distinguish those two things

Diana Hernández: Because

Jason Bordoff: Those are both big numbers.

Diana Hernández: I mean, it means that one in two people in the US experience some aspect, an energy insecurity. We have only half of the population that is energy secure, meaning that,

Jason Bordoff: But sorry, just to be clear about what that 40% means. It means someone is drafty windows, whatever, and that imposes economic burden or that, what’s that

Diana Hernández: 40%? It’s the next experiential burden. I mean, it’s the same kind of discomfort that one feels in a room that’s too hot or cold. And when you don’t have control over the thermostat or in the building that we’re in right now, this is set by a date when they start to kick in the air conditioning unit.

Jason Bordoff: Is that why it’s so hot in here? I don’t even know why it’s so hot in here.

Diana Hernández: Well, yeah, no, oftentimes it has to do, right? These are mechanical issues. This is not necessarily about, I mean, I think Columbia can pay their utility bills for now, so that’s not really,

Jason Bordoff: Things have changed in the last two months – morbid humor, sorry.

Diana Hernández: But this is right. This is more of the, that’s why the physical piece is so important. That’s kind of why we distinguish between people that are experiencing the economic iteration of energy insecurity from people that have these other symptoms or it’s all part of a syndrome, a social syndrome. That’s what we call energy insecurity in the book.

Jason Bordoff: I sort of read the book as saying 40% of Americans may not meet your conservative definition of energy insecure, meaning they are currently foregoing basic needs, having utility shut off, but they’re like a step away from that.

Diana Hernández: That’s right. Or that you could be a high income person that lives in a building where the heat is controlled by someone else and they might be warming your apartment excessively. And for three or more days of the year, you’re experiencing excessive heat. And part of the reason why we use the more conservative number of 10% is that for us, the energy insecurity aspect is really rooted in not having the financial means to make the circumstances better. But you could still have these different expressions of energy insecurity, and in that case it’s really relatable, but you might be three paychecks away from a financial hardship. So you’re kind of at risk because we condition it on having two or more of the indicators at once. So these are people that already have one, and then they might be at risk of an economic circumstance that might render them, really put them in that 10% pool.

Jason Bordoff: And just to make sure our listeners understand, the 10 to 13% explain just again, that’s defined by

Diana Hernández: So yeah, prevalence rates, that’s usually in public health. You want to measure what proportion of a population is impacted by a particular disease state or diabetes, which is also 10% of the population in the US is impacted by diabetes and cancer. And in that sense, then you really do start to see the distinguishing factors around how much attention is given to conditions like diabetes and/or cancer, and not necessarily something like energy insecurity.

Jason Bordoff: And the actual utility shutoffs. What percentage of Americans are experiencing that?

Diana Hernández: So about 3% of the US population experiences disconnections and disconnections are the crisis point of energy insecurity. So it’s like what we call the tip of the iceberg. If you only focused on disconnections, you would only get the very worst cases, but you wouldn’t actually get all of the other indicators and escalations of risk that happen when people are experiencing difficulty paying, they’re missing or paying late, they’re only paying a portion of their utility bills, they’re accumulating debt, a lot of that debt that then becomes very difficult to get out of, especially for households that are on the financial margins.

Jason Bordoff: First, say a little more about how you came to this work because you grew up here in the Bronx, not far from where we’re sitting right now. And just talk a little bit about your personal story and why you’re passionate about this work.

Diana Hernández: I mean, this is not “me-search,” but there are ways in which growing up, I grew up in section eight housing. I grew up in a working class family. My surroundings were very much where there was just concentrated poverty because the US very much is segregated based on race, and my family is Puerto Rican, black Puerto Rican. And so that limited where we could live, right? In many ways, and that’s still true. I mean, we know redline communities still exists. There are still health consequences that are present day based on that. But I think what brings me to the work and where I can be a little more empathetic about it is that, first of all, I’m a nontraditional academic. I started my PhD too when I was 19, and I was sitting in people’s homes in my early twenties doing this dissertation research.

And first of all, the experience felt familiar. I was going in and out of people’s homes, but the people were people that I grew up with and I heard them and I heard their stories, and I trusted that they were true even if the academic literature had not yet caught up to the idea that this was happening. I feel like because I grew up under circumstances of need, my work is also informed by not just documenting the need and validating it, though I think that’s super important, but also really thinking about solutions. What do we do with this information, this book, I would not have felt that the book were complete if it didn’t also have an action framework, some sense of solutions that first we have in front of us and are available and need to be enhanced and amplified. But I think the other piece of it is we might just need to be a little bit more inventive. How do we absorb and support and center innovation community-based solutions really getting a little closer to the folks that know what’s going on so that we can also hear and imagine new ways forward. And I think this book really is, it lands there. It lands in this place where it’s like, okay, there’s hope.

Jason Bordoff: Is the problem getting worse or better?

Diana Hernández: Well, I

Jason Bordoff: Think in the data, do you see these numbers are going down or up?

Diana Hernández: There’s two ways that I can answer that. When you have a data-driven approach, you will always have nuance. So the way that I think about that in terms of rising rates and the fact that our utility bills are just more expensive is to me an indication that many more people will actually have energy affordability problems. And it’s not just because the utility bills are going up, but everything because of inflation is going up. Now we have the situation of tariffs. The cost of living is just higher. And so to meet basic needs, you just need more money. And that really is the root of the problem. But the other thing is that the health of our housing stock is also at best staying the same or getting worse. And so if we think about efficiency, installation drafts, all of the physical indicators of energy insecurity that we use over time, those are actually looking worse. And so if we think about the end, then we have issues like extreme heat where years ago you could be in New England and never have to even think about having an air conditioning unit that more and more places is less and less the reality.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, for sure. And so talk about the set of solutions that exist today. I presume you think they’re probably inadequate, but we have the low income heating assistance program. And what’s, what is the policy, the set of policies today to address this? What does that look like and how adequate is it?

Diana Hernández: Yeah, so the energy safety net in the US is really made up of two programs, and this is at the federal level. This is the low-income Home Energy assistance program, LIHEAP and the Weatherization Assistance Program, WAP. LIHEAP is administered through Health and Human Services, HHS. WAP is administered through the DOE, the Department of Energy. And that distinction is actually important because even though the energy safety net started in the same place, 1970s, the oil crisis, the need to provide heating fuels to homes around the US especially cold weather states, is

Jason Bordoff: Really, which disproportionately use oil for heating and oil tends to be more expensive.

Diana Hernández: Exactly. And that was really the beginnings of it. And at first it started out as a weatherization program, and then in kind of future iterations, it became a bill assistance program, but largely designed around being a heating assistance program. Still 40 plus years later, it remained largely a heating subsidy where the kind of secondary piece of it is around crisis. So this is why people are showing up to the energy assistance offices with a disconnection notice or an active disconnection. And then really down the line is cooling assistance and weatherization, much, much smaller parts of the energy assistance safety net. That is LIHEAP. And then you have weatherization assistance, which is really about improving people’s homes. Weatherizing, that’s usually a grant that’s just shy of about $5,000. So imagine the kind of home improvement projects that you could do with $5,000 where you also have the stipulation of a savings to investment ratio. And this savings to investment ratio means that you can only do the things – like maybe sealing and caulking – that would save enough money to actually justify the investment. So the big ticket items, those windows, we know the windows really matter, or sometimes upgrading the heating and cooling units to some more efficient version. Those are bigger ticket items that of course, exceed that limit and then also

Jason Bordoff: Exceed $5,000,

Diana Hernández: Exceed the 5,000, but they do

Jason Bordoff: Pay for themselves over

Diana Hernández: Time, over time, but that’s not how this kind of savings to investment ratio works. It’s a shorter time horizon. Plus the fact that, and we know this to be true also around heat pumps and other clean energy appliance upgrades, is that it’s much easier for homeowners to take that action than it is for renters to take those actions. So probably not surprisingly than many more renters –

Jason Bordoff: Just for people listening, the renters are not, you’re making a capital investment in the home, and if you’re renting, you’re not necessarily benefiting from the increased value that would provide. Right?

Diana Hernández: Exactly. Well, and then also if you’re a landlord and you don’t pay the utility bills, then you also don’t have as much incentive to incorporate these energy efficiency measures. And so there’s the split incentive problem, and then you also have the kind of decision making constraints and then the justifications around, I’m a renter, why would I actually go get into a program? I mean, there’s so many different administrative barriers to getting linked up so that only 20% of the US population, less than 20% of the US population, actually has access to LIHEAP and 0.2% of the US population. This is eligible households that have access to WAP.

Jason Bordoff: Oh, when you say only 20% has access to LIHEAP, in a sense, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Because it means you don’t want a lot of people to qualify for LIHEAP, right?

Diana Hernández: Oh, eligible, right? Well,

Jason Bordoff: You mean of the

Diana Hernández: Eligible household, so less than 20% of all eligible households.

Jason Bordoff: Oh, I see. Okay.

Diana Hernández: So if you’re eligible, right? If

Jason Bordoff: You’re eligible, you want people to

Diana Hernández: Be able to

Jason Bordoff: Access it.

Diana Hernández: Food stamps or SNAP, which is a supplemental nutritional assistance program, supports 82% of all eligible households. It’s an entitlement program. Meanwhile, LIHEAP, you’re looking at less than 20% of all eligible households.

Jason Bordoff: And the reason 80% of people who technically qualify just to say again, they don’t take advantage of it or,

Diana Hernández: Yeah. Well, I think it’s kind of limited and it’s understood to be a scarce resource. There are so many challenges to actually going to the energy assistance office, showing up with all the paperwork that’s necessary, usually reaching a point of crisis.

Jason Bordoff: But just to be clear, the 20% figure is the percent of eligible households who take advantage of the program would

Diana Hernández: Take advantage, who receive LIHEAP benefits. So a lot of the people that I met then in these energy assistance offices, so there are these networks of community action agencies, and they support households in different ways, including by providing access to energy assistance resources. Oftentimes when they’re showing up, they’re showing up not necessarily preventively. Again, if we use that health analogy, preventive health is the screening is all of the support that you need to maintain health, but then you have acute care, which is the emergency room or a hospital. So basically our energy insecure populations are going to the equivalent of an emergency room. They have an energy emergency that they’re facing oftentimes, and that’s when they’re actually going to seek help. But imagine that we structured our healthcare system in that way, in the way of supporting only people that are coming in with a crisis. We would never have health or longevity.

Jason Bordoff: We don’t do a good enough job with preventive care and we pay more for that treatment. You talked a lot about homes, right? Weatherization and heat and cooling. Your statistics in this book covers transportation, gasoline prices as well.

Diana Hernández: It doesn’t.

Jason Bordoff: Oh, it doesn’t. It’s just homes. No. Okay.

Diana Hernández: It’s just homes. So natural gas, electricity of course, and fuel oil would in some cases as well, but we really focus in on expenses for energy services, not necessarily transportation, although the government would actually think about it more in inclusive terms. Now, water, we do include. And water because it is a utility, not necessarily. We went in asking about difficulty paying water bills, and actually during the pandemic there was a water assistance program, the low income water assistance program that started and ended actually in a really short period of time. It didn’t have a long shelf life.

Jason Bordoff: So if you were policy maker of for the day and you could just make whatever policy you wanted, is the key simplifying these programs so everyone who’s eligible takes advantage of them, or is there a whole policy toolkit we don’t even have that we need to address this issue?

Diana Hernández: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think we need to, I mean, this is what I talk about in the book is reframing how we think about the safety net. So the safety net is really meant to catch people as they’re falling to break their fall. But if we want to actually take a more preventive approach to dealing with energy insecurity, we actually need to be rethinking how we actually provide coverage. And I think of that as being more like an umbrella. An umbrella covers someone, allows them to function, get around, operate, but they have a cover from the elements. And that cover in this book comes in the form of an action framework that stands for something. It’s called the SPARK action framework. The S is for screening surveys and public health surveillance. We actually need data. A lot of the data that we have is very dated, and it’s infrequent.

It’s also not localized. It’s really at the national level at best, at the state level. But what we really need are localized data sources, which is why anchoring public health surveillance actually is very helpful. This assumes that a lot of what we know will stay, but we’ll talk about that later. Then participation in energy, decision-making. Energy decisions are being made in terms of regulated utilities, for instance. It’s really meant to be in the public’s interest. Even municipal utilities, rural electric co-ops, same thing, right? There are really these missed opportunities for engaging energy consumers in all walks of life. And I’m talking about the other day I was presenting with college students and they’re like, I don’t even know where to begin. Well, they were graduate students, so they were actually paying their utility bills in terms of thinking about these issues. So that’s the P participation and energy decision making.

Affordable bills. I really do think we need to decouple all of the clean energy programs, for instance, from the fundamentals of making sure that bills, utility bills are affordable and affordable for households. So one of the big things that we talk about is that there isn’t a rate of variability in the same ways that other goods and services have different rates. So not everybody is living in an apartment that’s $12,000 a month. Some people are able to actually live in apartments that are based on their income and they pay what they can. And I think that we need to be thinking about rates not necessarily so evenly. Everybody pays the same amount per kilowatt hour. Well, that’s really, you have equal rates, but unequal burdens, right? And I think that that’s,

Jason Bordoff: So are you’re saying you would make electricity prices or even gasoline prices, income-based, like somehow different people show up at the pump, and I’m just giving that as an example. I know you were focused on homes and see different prices.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, I think if we really understand the human risks of, I mean in terms of health and survival, we would actually not overburden some households by paying one standardized rate. I think we would absolutely be able to slot people in and if they can afford more, they should pay more. And if that’s not within their means, we still have a societal obligation to ensure that people can meet their energy needs. I believe that strongly.

Jason Bordoff: How do you think about the policy responses – are they energy specific or are they broader issues of economic inequality? So I mean, I guess we’re talking about a theoretical world. You don’t get a first best set of policy solutions, but if you’re lower income, a lot of things are more expensive and a lot of things that are important to many others take for granted are a struggle day to day. The idea that you have the earned income tax credit or a host of other things we should do to reduce levels of inequality and give low income people more resources to work with, and then maybe they want to be a little colder or a little warmer, maybe they prefer to spend it on food. How much of the policy response is about economic policy and how much is about energy policy

Diana Hernández: That goes to the R though. I mean, this is literally about differentiating between a robust energy safety net, which actually would mean dealing with the gaps in LIHEAP and WAP, and then also a robust social safety net so that people had a living wage and they have affordable housing and they’re able to plug into an earned income tax credit. We know that the economic policy actually really does support low income households, and when they have relief from the economic pressures, they can go on to be professors at Ivy League universities. I feel like if I have to think about some of the investments in my own childhood, that was section eight housing, it was headstart, it was free lunch programs. You have to be able to provide those economic supports so that people can rise up to be all of the different things that are within their set. Those are the new imaginaries for their futures, but we have to believe first of all, that they’re deserving. And secondly that we have the social investments that we can see into the future that these are not just about right now investments and quick returns, but that these are also about, there’s real societal benefits. Let me just go through the SPARK framework.

Jason Bordoff: No, sorry.

Diana Hernández: The other pieces that came so many letters, we lost track. No, I know, but we were talking through, this is the umbrella, it’s comprehensive is about knowledge and energy literacy.

Jason Bordoff: That’s the K.

Diana Hernández: And you might appreciate this probably more than anybody because you’re such an important voice in energy thinking about energy policy, all of the different dimensions. But you know that this is kind of – the sliver of people that care about energy and think about it seriously is really small, but it impacts us in so many different ways. And it’s only in its absence that it becomes everything, otherwise it’s something that we just kind of take for granted and move on from. But I do think that there’s a lot of potential in building out energy literacy, and we need to do that well and better across populations. But I think specifically, and actually there’s a lot that poor people can teach us about energy and its consumption. It’s ethical consumption that I think makes it a bi-directional learning opportunity too. And then of course, energy efficiency and clean energy access.

Jason Bordoff: Sorry, when you say ethical consumption, are you talking about waste and inefficiency and is that what you mean?

Diana Hernández: Yeah. One of my first papers on energy justice before it became a very big field was about the ethical consumption of energy and how ethics are really about responsibilities. And responsibilities are also attached oftentimes to privilege. And as a society, we have to be thinking about places where we just use way too much energy. Part of the reason that our energy prices are increasing is because we have to be able, our utility providers are preparing for the worst case scenario, and they need to be able to provide enough energy when the temperatures are really high and everybody’s using their air conditioning units, etc. And I think that there’s so many drivers, but definitely the idea that ethical consumption falls on people that do have the privilege to not waste to be much more diligent and careful and leaving space and opportunity for people that are just trying to get by, make sure that their children are well taken care of, that they could be in their homes and be comfortable. Because right now we have haves or the energy haves and the energy have-nots. And I feel like the ethical consumption is really about checking the people that are the energy halves and waste.

Jason Bordoff: And part of that is about these domestic issues we’re talking about as I think I was just in India with our India program here at the center. And of course, that’s a whole different dimension where everyone there is, every time I come to New York, every light is on in the entire city and the middle of the night at three in the morning, and every time I go anywhere, everyone’s driving massive vehicles that use it. So this is a whole conversation with how the rest of the world views wealthy countries, particularly the United States.

Diana Hernández: No, I mean, I think that’s exactly right. And I think people don’t like to be uncomfortable or restricted in, definitely not in terms of energy use, but I think this book really just shows how restricted the poor operate when it comes to their footprint and energy consumption, and how much of that do we need to be thinking about for other populations that are not making decisions just solely based on affordability and then disconnection reform. And I really strongly believe that we need to revisit the practice of disconnections. What is the goal? We’ve moved a lot away from, or at least tried, let’s say in the realm of criminal justice, to move away from these harsh penalties and punishing issues that really are fundamentally rooted in poverty. And yet as a practice in the energy space, we still allow people to not have access to energy, despite the fact that this is not about grids and availability at a structural level, but it’s really about affordability. At what point do we take stock of this, make moral decisions about who has access to energy and who doesn’t, and under what circumstances should we extend more protections? And I just think that that practice has been increasing. There are more disconnections now. It is a very effective cost recovery strategy. And yet for households that are low income, it is jolting. It’s like,

Jason Bordoff: So, I mean, again, in a market based economy, if you don’t pay for something, eventually you won’t get it anymore. But is your point, whether it’s food or maybe even housing or energy for these basic needs, we just can’t think of it that way. And maybe it’s like public education. There are certain things that have to be a public good. Is that what you’re saying?

Diana Hernández: That’s exactly right. I, and remember that if you are hungry, and many, many, many millions of households are experiencing food insecurity, but there are resources like food pantries and SNAP benefits and other things that really allow people to meet their energy needs, people can get a hot meal somewhere. There are ways that that need can be met in kind in a way that is not true for energy, although one of the,

Jason Bordoff: You have cooling centers on very hot days, but it’s not about your home.

Diana Hernández: Exactly, yes. You have to leave your home, have to find a place. They’re usually not open 24 hours. So that means, and if they were, then that means that you have to sleep over in that cooling center. And again, those are important resources, and it’s not to take away from the importance of those kinds of resources, but it is to say that we just need to be thinking a little bit more robustly about why people might not have access to energy. And that might actually mean that in certain seasons we have more robust coverage, so people are not dying at home because it’s too hot or too cold.

Jason Bordoff: Can I ask you about the energy transition? If we want to move faster to a clean energy economy and install electric heat pumps and electrify and put more renewable energy on the grid, and does all that make this problem better or worse?

Diana Hernández: I think it makes it better. And

Jason Bordoff: Because it’s expensive to have an energy transition.

Diana Hernández: Yeah, no, it is of course. But as we think about public dollars and how we fund it, I think we should start with households that are presenting with energy insecurity and use that as a criteria for thinking about resource allocation and doing some of those upgrades for free. Because actually the payoff, right? Remember we were talking about the savings to investment ratio and weatherization assistance. If we broadened how we capture the investment, and we think about it as households that are relying on different public services as an example, we might actually, our investments could go further if they weren’t in the hospital,

Jason Bordoff: But in terms of the price of electricity,

Diana Hernández: Right?

Jason Bordoff: Coal super cheap. If you don’t think about negative externalities, if you don’t think about emissions and local pollution, and of course we know a lot of that in the environmental justice world related to energy justice like disproportionately falls on some of the communities we’re talking about. But if it means people talk about a carbon tax as a policy to reduce gasoline consumption or want people to drive electric vehicles, which might save money over the long run, but it’s more expensive to buy. So there’s a price impact in the transition. How do you think about that impact on the communities you’re talking about?

Diana Hernández: Alright, so I guess let me answer that question and just be a little bit more direct about what I think is the right pathway. So I think the right pathway is that people that can afford it should do more, and they might not necessarily have to have all of the subsidies or the same amount of subsidy, and that most of the subsidies that exist should really be targeted toward the lowest income groups. And in many cases, that actually might include not just some discount, but actually for some segments of the population upgrades that are done for free. And with the understanding that not doing it risks displacement and it risks other kinds of challenges on those households and communities. So I think that there are opportunities, and some of the work that we’ve done outside of the book here in New York City around upgrading appliances like stoves and access to solar.

There’s a lot of interest actually in solar. But if you’re living in a city, the question is how do I do that? And I’m living in a building and I don’t own this building, and even if I did, would I be the one that’s actually directly benefiting from the solar array on the rooftop? So there are really some big questions around the cost and the confusion and the logistics of getting access to solar in urban areas. Community solar subscriptions are a way around that. And though it may mean that the solar array isn’t necessarily on the rooftop, it does mean that there are benefits to the clean energy economy and that those are actually, there could be transfers of kilowatts. So one of the things that we talk about in the book is in-kind energy so that there are transfers. Your household could use a subsidy of 200 kilowatts or whatever, and there’s a pool and that pool provides it.

So kind of expanding energy assistance. But the other piece of it, and I want to raise this as kind of the fundamental issue that connects more directly to your question around stoves. So we asked this representative sample of New York City residents about their interest in moving from gas to electric stoves. Meanwhile, 86% of New York City residents are actually relying on a gas stove. And the vast majority of energy insecure households were very interested in transitioning to cleaner electric induction stoves. But the most privileged New Yorkers higher income white residents were less likely to be interested in giving up their gas stoves. And that to me is part of the tension. Who gets to choose who’s most hopeful about

Jason Bordoff: Why were they more interested? The bills are cheaper. The initial stove would be probably more expensive.

Diana Hernández: So the initial stove, I mean, and who knows if they’re renters, they probably wouldn’t be the ones making those decisions anyway, but there is this kind of hope for what the energy transition will mean in terms of people being able to meet their energy needs. And I think that hope really is around people that are having trouble today, meeting their energy needs, not really, and that their vested hope is more on the basis of the relief that this could offer, not necessarily in environmental terms or for some future, but the relief that is more to temporarily set in the now. And I think that’s kind of an important, we think about, oh, we need to reach scale and that needs to happen fast. And I mean, innovation in some ways is oftentimes rooted in solving problems that people face and that feel more proximal. So one of the challenges around the rollbacks of clean energy investments is that people don’t really see climate as an immediate concern. But people that are experiencing energy insecurity very much see energy issues as a right now issue. And they’re so willing to do more, but they’re facing different kinds of barriers. And I think those are barriers that we can overcome, actually.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, it’s the very local version of Europe is committed, I think, to an energy transition. But when energy security is really at risk because Russian gas is cut off, that’s when people really jump through hoops and do whatever it takes to find alternative supplies, US natural gas or coal. And they also did more efficiency and renewables. And that very important program for low-income heating assistance has been proposed to be eliminated. Is that right?

Diana Hernández: Yeah. So I like to say that LIHEAP is the backbone of the energy safety net in the US And earlier in April, the skeletal staff that administers all of LIHEAP for all of the states was let go. And then days later in the proposed budget, the Trump administration basically said that LIHEAP was redundant and ineffective and that it was a pass-through to utilities. It supported certain states like New York and California that are investing in clean energy and thereby increasing, arbitrarily, rates. And that’s what’s really concerning for, that’s the root of energy affordability problems, and that this was no longer necessary. And I actually think that that’s a really big problem because it is the primary way that the very, very, very needy that are basically using this as kind of to overcome crisis. Where will they turn?

Jason Bordoff: We’re just about out of time, but you co-lead something here called the Energy Opportunity Lab and your broader research agenda, which this book is a part, has helped shape that. Just talk a little bit about what that is and the work you’re doing more broadly even beyond this book.

Diana Hernández: So the Energy Opportunity Lab, and I’m so grateful to you, Jason, for trusting me to co-direct the lab and also to manage the domestic program itself is really rooted in energy access and affordability, both globally with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and in the US. And the whole point is, well first to elevate these issues and to give them the visibility that’s necessary. And that could only really happen in such a well-established energy center that has broad reach and where we could actually say, this is an issue. Listen to us. Not only are we experts in coming in with the data, but also with the credibility of being affiliated with the center and then thinking about it as research translation. That’s what I think of the Energy Opportunity Lab is really about saying the evidence base is really clear, so what do we do about it?

And we have goals around modernizing energy assistance. I mean, we walked in with that goal. Now we think about preserving it, but also maybe thinking about ways in which states and cities and utilities can start to amplify the issue of solutions for energy affordability. Thinking about rates as another place where we are now working on ways of thinking, re-imagining the ways that rates are structured so that they more support energy affordability. We have partnerships with government agencies, with utilities, with other groups, really to think about, well, what are the action steps that can be taken to support solving these problems, which in the US really show up as energy insecurity? At least my work really kind of suggests that. But in the energy transition, in light of what’s going on in terms of climate change, these opportunities to think about a more micro level, not only understanding of the issues, but also thinking about solution sets that are across the board, but also include issues that are a little bit closer to the ground.

Jason Bordoff: Well, you were kind to say thanks to us, but thanks to you for your leadership of that program and just your life’s work and for being such an important part of the senior research team here at the Center on Global Energy Policy and for this fantastic book and for talking with us about it. So Diana Hernandez, thank you so much.

,EVs,2025-05-21 00:06:56+00:00,Buffalo Toronto Public Media,Canadian Beat: Concerns arise over the future of Canada's electric vehicle market,"Dan Karpenchuk, www.btpm.org",,,,,https://www.btpm.org/from-btpm-npr-and-our-partners/2025-05-20/canadian-beat-concerns-arise-over-the-future-of-canadas-electric-vehicle-market,"There are questions about the future of the electric vehicle market in Canada.
It was only just over a year ago that the electric vehicle market appeared rosy, with a bright future as Canadians began to move away from gasoline-powered vehicles.
With this announcement, we will be investing to create Canada’s first comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain from start to finish,” Trudeau said.
Brian Kingston is president and CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
“Even more striking is the share of EV sales in the Canadian market.","There are questions about the future of the electric vehicle market in Canada. They’ve been prompted by Honda Canada postponing a $15 billion Canadian project in Ontario for two years. Federal government rebates are no longer being offered to Canadians who purchase E-V’s. Sales of the vehicles appear to be falling as Canadian consumer interest wanes.

It was only just over a year ago that the electric vehicle market appeared rosy, with a bright future as Canadians began to move away from gasoline-powered vehicles. Premier Doug Ford and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were on hand to announce a $15 billion project from Honda.

“Today Honda is making Canadian automotive history. With this announcement, we will be investing to create Canada’s first comprehensive electric vehicle supply chain from start to finish,” Trudeau said.

The $15 billion project would include an EV assembly plant, two parts plants, and a stand-alone battery manufacturing facility. The Ontario and Canadian governments would pony up $2.5 billion each to help make it happen.

Then a week ago, with President Trump’s tariffs looming large on the automotive sector in Canada and sales of EVs slumping, Honda hit the pause button, for two years, sending Premier Ford scrambling.

“When I’ve talked to Honda, they’ve promised us they’re going to continue on with their expansion. They’re going to keep that facility moving forward. So, we’ll see how that moves forward. But we’re very confident that we’ll continue producing Honda vehicles here in Ontario,” Ford said.

That could be wishful thinking. Statistics Canada recently announced that sales of electric vehicles in Canada fell by 44% from April of last year to April of this year. The federal government no longer offers Canadians a $5,000 rebate to offset the purchase of an EV, and Ontario hasn’t offered any incentives since 2018.

Brian Kingston is president and CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association. Kingston said Honda’s postponement is of concern.

“The fact is the EV market has slowed, and it has slowed quite markedly. And so, manufacturers have to respond to that,” Kingston said.

A recent survey by Auto Trader found that just 42% of Canadians show interest in electric vehicles – down from 68% in 2022.

“Even more striking is the share of EV sales in the Canadian market. At the end of last year, 20 percent of sales were zero-emission vehicles. Last month that dropped to 7.5 percent. So, the EV market is effectively collapsing at the moment in Canada,” Kingston said.

Kingston sees the elimination or lowering of government rebates, at a time when Canadians are facing tariff issues and higher prices, as a major factor. There is also concern about the charging infrastructure, which he says isn’t keeping pace.

When it comes to industry investment, uncertainty plays a part. Dimitry Anastakis of the Rotman School of Business said revolving tariffs from President Trump have put many industries into just that.

“Every day up and down, the tariff roller coaster goes, and that uncertainty means that if you’re a business leader you can’t make any real decisions around investment until you have some stability, security consistency going forward,” Anastakis said.

The renewed questions about the future of the EV market have many worried, especially among industry watchers to see how other large-scale EV projects in Canada, such as Stellantis and Volkswagen, will proceed. That’s put pressure on Canada’s newly appointed industry minister, Melanie Joly.

She said Honda has told her it’s fully committed to major electric vehicle investments in Canada, and she’s been in contact with the CEOs of GM, Ford, and Stellantis.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0162656/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F81%2Fd7%2F2e3bab4140b5a36034cbf5c92264%2Fap25127694489452.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 22:06:47.896591

Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe is adjusting his company’s course after recent events drastically altered the global outlook for combustion and electric vehicles. During the company’s annual business briefing, Mibe justified slashing Honda‘s global sales estimate for EVs while expecting hybrid sales to double between now and 2027.

Last year, Honda announced it expected to move somewhere around 2 million EVs over the next two years. That projected figure now sits at around 700,000 to 750,000 units. According to Automotive News, hybrid sales could instead skyrocket to over 2 million during the same time frame.

“It has become increasingly clear that the environmental regulations, which held promise for the widespread adoption of EVs, are becoming relaxed, mainly in the U.S. and Europe,” Mibe said. “In addition, the recent development in trade policies of various countries makes our business environment increasingly uncertain.

“If the EV penetration period is pushed back a little, I feel that it will be pushed back by about five years, especially in North America,” Mibe added. “The Trump administration will remain in power for four years, but that doesn’t mean that EV demand will bounce back immediately. I think it will be pushed back by about five to six years.“

While insightful, Mibe’s comments don’t exactly come as a surprise. Automakers throughout the globe remain invested—and therefore, persistent—in EV manufacturing and sales. However, they’re all dialing back their original estimates, which many analysts would claim were bullish to begin with. Perhaps the current climate is acting as a sort of reset button that’s emphasizing hybrids and PHEVs as the bridge to EVs.

It’s worth noting that Mibe’s mention of the Trump administration’s stance on EVs backs up what Honda’s former electrification boss, Shinji Aoyama, and President and CEO of American Honda, Kazuhiro Takizawa, told The Drive in August of last year. When asked what a possible Trump second term (at the time) would do to the company’s EV plans, Aoyama explained that such a thing would be foreseen by Honda (and therefore not a surprise). He also alluded that nothing lasts forever, meaning that the trajectory of EV development would continue, only with a built-in delay due to the political climate.

Mibe’s comments that EV demand would eventually resume growing lines up with the company’s long-term thinking, first shared with us in 2024.

“In contrast to the slowdown in the EV shift, demand for hybrid-electric vehicles is growing,” Mibe said. “In the end, the value of battery-electric vehicles is not yet equal to or greater than the value of the existing hybrid or plug-in hybrid vehicles. That is the main reason why customers have not yet jumped on the EV bandwagon.”

Honda has been on the hybrid bandwagon for many years, but it’s intensified its presence in the segment considerably recently. Even its racing portfolio in North America is made up of hybrid offerings, such as its presence in the IndyCar series and IMSA under the Acura brand. This weekend’s Indy 500 is being touted as the first hybrid 500 in history, something that Honda is very invested in, specifically from a marketing perspective.

Rival Toyota’s stance on EVs and hybrids has been drastically different from Honda’s, though both companies agree that having a balanced portfolio of vehicles is vital to surviving current market conditions. Both Honda and Toyota will continue to invest in EVs, but it’s clear that it’ll be done at a different rate than expected.

Under the Velvet-Wood deposit’s previous owner, Russian mining company Uranium One, a draft feasibility study did find economically viable uranium.
“Every mining company does this.
If you’re a publicly traded mining company and you want investors to give your mine money, you must provide a feasibility study.
Then there are special cases like the Resolution copper mine in Arizona, where the government’s hands are essentially tied under federal legal requirements to approve the conveyance of land to a mining company.","So far in his second term as president, Trump’s administration has claimed to have approved, expedited, or publicly endorsed at least 28 different mines and mineral exploration projects, according to a review of Bureau of Land Management notices and federal permitting databases, with more likely in the offing. Many of these projects may very well produce minerals required for key energy or defense purposes, and some of them are guaranteed to do so. But at least a few have not yet been proven to be economically viable in the way investors typically expect from mining companies.

Conservationists have decried these actions as an unnecessary risk to sensitive landscapes, which could be irrevocably changed without a guarantee of improved energy security. And even some in the mining industry are quietly noting these examples, saying they could represent a paradigm shift in how America treats the mining industry.

“This is what you’d expect from China,” a former veteran mining industry lobbyist told me, requesting anonymity to protect their current business from retribution. “The U.S. prides itself on mines that are good neighbors. The U.S. doesn’t have a perfect record, but those are things that it values.”

“I’m not saying the companies are going to do something wrong here,” the source continued, “but we don’t know that.”

The most headline-grabbing example of this rush to permit came last week, when the Interior Department said it would for the permitting of a large uranium mine in Utah known as Velvet-Wood. The department said it would complete Velvet-Wood’s environmental review within two weeks — a process that has historically taken years.

On first blush, abbreviating the approval process for a mine that will produce energy fuel for nuclear power plants resembles the sort of permitting reform that climate hawks and centrist policy wonks have craved for years. Velvet-Wood’s developer, Anfield Energy, claims the site will also produce vanadium, a strategic mineral used in defense-grade steel.

A deeper examination, however, exposes signs of haste that go beyond all deliberate speed.

Ordinarily, mines take years to develop for reasons wholly unrelated to the federal permitting process. Usually a project requires years of exploration and study to verify that the area where digging will happen holds proven “resources” and then “reserves.” Think of resources vs. reserves as the difference between lukewarm and high levels of confidence that minerals are not only present but also economic to mine and process. It is unusual for any mine to be built without proven resources, let alone reserves, and feasibility studies are the way companies usually communicate that level of proof to investors. These studies have also been a primary mode of conveying a project’s value and design to the government.

Until our present policy moment, the permitting process was so lengthy that it made little sense to pursue it without first giving investors the certainty brought by a feasibility study. Anfield and other companies appear to have found a work-around to demonstrate that certainty, however, at least to the government: Asking to dig in places where mines used to be decades ago.

Anfield has not yet completed a feasibility study for Velvet-Wood, which would include the site of a former underground uranium mine. The most recent study of the project was a 2023 “preliminary economic assessment” that documented some of the old mining infrastructure and otherwise largely referenced historical data about mineralization. The company stated in the report that the study was “too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them,” and that “there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.”

In Anfield’s own press release announcing the Trump administration’s decision to quickly permit the project, the company states that it “has not done sufficient work to classify these historic estimates” for uranium and vanadium at the site. Anfield did not respond to requests for comment on why the company requested government permits before finishing a feasibility study.

Under the Velvet-Wood deposit’s previous owner, Russian mining company Uranium One, a draft feasibility study did find economically viable uranium. But that study is more than a decade old and was not made public, according to press materials at the time.

In order to become operational, Anfield expected to have to update the decades-old plan of operations for Velvet-Wood, according to the 2023 economic assessment, which also said BLM would need to take into account the impacts of restarting a formerly operational mine, as well as mining in areas that have not previously been mined before. That’s quite a lot of work to complete in only two weeks. While it’s possible that staff at Interior got a head start on their review when Anfield submitted its mine plan last year, they have not confirmed anything to that effect since the department’s announcement about permitting the project.

Aaron Mintzes, senior policy counsel for the mining reform advocacy group Earthworks, told me the practice of approving a mine before feasibility studies have been done carries the risk of painting a misleading portrait to investors about a project’s viability.

“Every mining company does this. All of them. If you’re a publicly traded mining company and you want investors to give your mine money, you must provide a feasibility study. That’s how you know they’re telling the truth,” Mintzes said of this approach. “Investors should be upset about this.”

In an email, BLM press secretary Brian Hires told me that “feasibility studies are not legally required by BLM for mining projects.”

“The BLM continues to ensure appropriate environmental oversight including coordination with other agencies, balancing mineral development rights and responsible public lands management,” Hires stated.

On Velvet-Wood, Hires said the agency acted under “recently established emergency procedures” created under the Trump administration to quickly approve new resource projects. “The expedited review is expected to significantly contribute to meeting urgent energy demands and addressing key threats to national energy security.”

Time moves slow

Velvet-Wood is not the first mine Trump’s Interior Department has expedited so early in the approval process.

On April 8, the Trump administration gave Dateline Resources, an Australian company, a green light to build a large mine inside of the Mojave National Preserve. Like Velvet-Wood, the project, known as Colosseum, got this approval without a feasibility study. Colosseum would be a gold mine, according to Dateline’s website, which also states that the project is “prospective” for producing rare earth elements as a byproduct. The company cites previous radiomagnetic reviews by the U.S. Geological Survey and the project’s proximity of roughly 8 kilometers — or about 6 miles — from an operating rare earths mine, Mountain Pass. The company also cites decades-old information about the site from when it used to be an operating gold mine in the 1970s and 1980s.

Are there rare earths at the Colosseum dig site? There may be — but how much and how commercially useful they’d be are normally determined through a feasibility study process.

BLM approved Colosseum without any new environmental review, or at least nothing that was public at the time it made the decision known. Instead, it said in a five-sentence press statement that Dateline could rely entirely on a construction and operations plan from the previous mine, which shut down in the 1990s.

BLM’s press release also referred to Colosseum as a rare earths mine, with no mention of gold.

“For too long, the United States has depended on foreign adversaries like China for rare earth elements for technologies that are vital to our national security,” the release stated. “By recognizing the mine’s continued right to extract and explore rare earth elements, Interior continues to support industries that boost the nation’s economy and protect national security.”

Hires, the BLM press secretary, told me that the agency made this claim to highlight “the project’s potential to produce rare earth elements, which are required for economic and national security.”

On April 21, investors were informed that a “bankable feasibility study” was now “underway.” But that didn’t stop Trump from jumping far ahead of the usual process a few days later, publicly calling the project “America’s second rare earths mine” on Truth Social.

There’s a big reason this area stopped being mined, by the way: According to the National Park Conservation Association, the area is heavily restricted from mineral development under a law Congress passed in the early 1990s, the California Desert Protection Act.

There is a separate law that provides companies the ability to mine in national preserves and parks under very specific and limited conditions, and with the approval of the National Park Service, the association told me. Kelly Shapiro, an attorney representing Dateline, told E&E News in a story published last week that Interior told the company its mine plan of operations was “valid.” Shapiro also told the news outlet that “rare earths have been found at the Colosseum mine site.”

Dateline has now begun work at the mine site and conservation activists are sounding public alarms. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

Asked why BLM gave Colosseum the right to construct a new operating mine, Hires said the project site, which has not been active for decades, “is not a new mine.” He said the facility was granted the “right” to “continue mining operations” under the plan from when the site was active in the 1980s, which the agency said “includes exploration for rare earth minerals.”

A ‘critical’ issue

Before I came to Heatmap, I spent years writing about the mining industry. One of the stories I’m proudest of was an investigation into the amount of mining needed to build the vastly different energy and transportation systems we’ll need to fully decarbonize. So I can safely say this: We truly will need more minerals like lithium, copper, nickel, graphite and cobalt to decarbonize, and we might need to open more mines to get them, although recycling and technological innovation could easily reduce the tonnage required over time.

The Trump team has a different argument for mining this much. It says our country needs to wean off foreign sources of metals because relying on imports is a weakness in the eyes of hawkish security experts.

For the past decade, U.S. policymakers of both parties have rallied behind the basic notion that the country should stop relying as much on minerals from nations considered to be adversaries by the national defense apparatus, including China and Russia, as well as companies perceived to be substantially controlled by those nations. The idea first gained traction under Trump 1.0, leading to the creation of a list of so-called “critical minerals” that the military and domestically essential businesses rely on but are generally mined or refined in other countries.

Under Joe Biden, the “critical mineral” concept was magnified by multiple signature laws, including the 2021 infrastructure law and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which together established large grant and tax credit programs intended to stimulate a new American mining economy.

Trump has sped up the federal permitting process for some copper, nickel, and lithium mining and exploration projects. These commodities markets are ones in which China genuinely has an outsized influence, per national security experts, through market share and existing business relationships held by Chinese state-owned mining and refining companies.

Some of these U.S. mining projects likely would’ve been permitted no matter the outcome of last year’s election, either because their environmental impacts would be relatively limited or because they’d produce metals crucial for the energy transition that a Democrat-led government would have supported as a trade-off. Take South32’s Hermosa copper mine in Arizona, which the Biden administration fast-tracked and Trump 2.0 has signaled it will approve. A handful of these mines would supply a meaningful amount of defense minerals for which we currently rely on China, such as the Stibnite gold mine in Idaho, which would yield antimony for military-grade ammo as a byproduct.

Then there are special cases like the Resolution copper mine in Arizona, where the government’s hands are essentially tied under federal legal requirements to approve the conveyance of land to a mining company.

Other “transition metal” mining projects fast-tracked or endorsed by Trump 2.0, however, likely would not have been given priority — or even a second look — under a more neutral federal regulator. That’s because they are located in areas that officials under previous administrations fretted would produce outsized pollution risk and potentially run afoul of environmental laws.

Take for example the NewRange copper mine in Minnesota, which the company says would be the state’s only active copper mine if approved and constructed. NewRange is better known in the mining industry as PolyMet, which was its moniker for most of the nearly two decades it has been in the works. NewRange/PolyMet has struggled to get requisite permits, to the point of being referred to by its opponents as a “zombie” project, because it’s situated in an especially porous area of northern Minnesota covered in protected wetlands.

In 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency under Biden said the Army Corps of Engineers should rescind a water permit issued under Trump 1.0 because the project would violate the pollution standards of the Fond du Lac Tribe, which relies on the wet ecosystem to cultivate wild rice for subsistence and cultural practices.

At the beginning of May, the Trump administration added NewRange/PolyMet to a federal “transparency” dashboard that it says will soon have a timetable for approving the project under the same authority it fast-tracked Resolution. Representative Pete Stauber of Minnesota, whose congressional district includes the mining project, reacted in a statement that said the designation shows Trump “understands the vital importance of this project,” and that he looks forward to “seeing NewRange meet and exceed every permitting standard in a timely manner.”

This is an example of mine that, if approved hastily, would probably create new litigation just as fast.

At the risk of repeating myself, it’s not the only example of such a case, and there are more examples where the Trump administration has opened the door to new, legally risky directions on a mine.

Most notable in that pile is the Pebble mine in Alaska, which Trump halted during his first term but may be given what appears to be a last shot at survival under his new government. Decades of battle between a would-be gold mine and the denizens of Bristol Bay have dominated conversations around American mining. Opponents across the political spectrum have tried to stop the project because they fear construction would pollute the bay and its world-class fishing grounds.

The first Trump administration actually opposed Pebble after a private lobbying campaign by Donald Trump, Jr. and other conservative conservation advocates. Under Biden, the EPA issued a rare veto of the project area under a provision of the Clean Water Act. This was a step beyond simply rejecting the permit as it would, in the view of advocates, be a permanent restriction against development.

In February, the Trump 2.0 Justice Department requested a stay on the federal lawsuit filed against the veto by Pebble’s developer, Northern Dynasty Minerals, alongside top political leaders in the state of Alaska, who have argued that the agency overstepped its authority. On Wednesday, Justice Department attorneys filed a status report asking that the stay be extended for at least another month because while officials had been briefed on the subject, they “require additional time to determine how they wish to proceed.”

This indicates the government is still not ready to state its position, and leaves open a door for the Justice Department to flip sides. Northern Dynasty Minerals hopes a flip will happen. “This is an important position in any negotiation between a project proponent and a regulator, and for a process that could, hopefully, remove the veto and re-start the permitting process,” the company’s CEO Ron Thiessen said in a public statement made after the stay extension request.

It may be that even Pebble Mine is a bridge too far for Trump 2.0. But after all these other projects have gotten the skids greased, we must all wait with bated breath for the next shoe — er, pebble — to drop.

Everything’s going to be okay, Crux’s co-founder CEO Alfred Johnson told me late last week. In fact, “the business is in great shape,” he said. I was a tad confused. But as Johnson reminded me, the company always planned on being more than a mere tax credit marketplace. The question is whether developers will buy into this vision of Crux as the everything store for project financing.

In March, right before the company announced its Series B, Crux launched a debt marketplace, where developers and manufacturers can access financial tools such as short-term bridge loans, construction financing, and flexible lines of credit to fund the buildout of renewables projects. “The market size for transferable credits is $30 billion per year, while the market size for project finance debt is more than seven-and-half times as big: $230 billion,” Johnson told me.

This new offering may have come just in the nick of time. It’s also likely just the first in a series of platform expansions, some of which are already in the works.

“There are many more multibillion-dollar markets among the thousands of developers, manufacturers, investors, and corporate buyers that make up the market for U.S. energy and manufacturing project finance,” Johnson told me. Playing in all those markets is a lofty goal for a company that was founded just two years ago, but so far Crux has been good at defying expectations. After all, it’s been profitable since its second year, Johnson told me, a rare and rapid rise for an early-stage startup.

Crux shared some exclusive numbers with me that illustrate some ways in which it’s starting to outgrow its roots. For one, Johnson told me that Crux’s revenue for the first one-and-a-half quarters of this year is nearly 10 times higher than for the same period last year. While he wouldn’t reveal what portion of that was comprised of tax credit deals versus debt financing deals, he did say that in the two months since the debt marketplace launched, “lenders have issued $1.3 billion of term sheets.” Those are nonbinding loan offers, $700 million of which have turned into actual deals so far. “It took more than a year for the tax credit market to reach similar throughput,"" Johnson said.

In the meantime, Crux is by no means giving up on the embattled transferable tax credit marketplace. The company sounded a relatively optimistic note last week as it published a list of takeaways from the Ways and Means Committee’s proposal, stating, “This is the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.” The company looks like it’s preparing to fight for that outcome, too, as a few months ago it hired new teams of tax lobbyists and brought on Hasan Nazar, former federal policy lead at Tesla, to direct these lobbying efforts.

Johnson said that the debut of Crux’s debt marketplace had developers, manufacturers, and investors rushing to its website in numbers not seen since the company launched. It logged more “inbound interest” on that one day in March than when it announced its Series A and its Series B — that is, more than on both of those days combined.

“We didn’t invest in Crux with the belief that this would be a transferable tax credit business forever,” David Haber, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told me. The venture capital firm led the company’s $18.2 million Series A funding round. “We viewed that as a great wedge product to bootstrap a financial exchange that could help facilitate the types of financial products needed for this ecosystem,” he said. Clay Dumas of Lowercarbon Capital, which led Crux’s Series B, also saw the company as a so-called “wedge” into a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity to finance energy and advanced manufacturing through debt and a wide range of other products.”

Not all investors felt as confident that companies built around tax credit transferability could become a one-stop financing shop, however. As of now, most of Crux’s direct competitors — such as Basis Climate, Reunion Infrastructure, and Common Forge — haven’t expanded into other parts of the climate capital stack.

“We know the fundamental risk that a stroke of the pen can have in any of these sort of marketplaces,” Juan Muldoon, a partner at the climate software VC firm Energize Capital, told me. Thus far, Energize has not funded any tax credit-based marketplace, diligence platform, or underwriting tool. “We wanted to wait for signs of resilience and more complete platforms, more complete business models, versus solving for things that might be more transient in value,” Muldoon said. Last week’s committee proposals validate Energize’s core investment strategy, he added — supporting nimble software companies that can withstand political headwinds and change tacks quickly.

Crux certainly hopes that expanding into the debt market will put any fears of its potential transience to rest. After all, Johnson told me, “all parts of the capital stack are opaque, illiquid, bespoke and manual.” That includes not only transferable tax credits, but also debt and equity financing. “These are private transactions that require a ton of documentation, models, advisory lawyers. But it doesn't have to be as bad as it is,” he said.

But if the transferable tax credits do indeed disappear, many renewable energy developers may be forced to return to one of the most opaque funding mechanisms of all: tax equity financing, which Crux is not currently set up to facilitate. As my colleague Emily Pontecorvo recently explained, prior to the passage of the IRA, renewable energy developers who wanted to liquidate their tax credits had to partner with tax equity investors — usually banks — who would give them cash in exchange for an equity stake in their clean energy project and the benefits of their tax credits. But forming these types of partnerships is both legally complicated and costly, and thus not a viable option for many smaller developers.

Presumably, Crux could shake up and simplify this space, too. And while it’s made no official commitments to a tax equity product, the company’s website has been reconfigured to advertise it as the go-to platform to “source new opportunities for lending, equity, and tax credit transfers,” as it commits to “financing the future of energy.”

Crux has its work cut out for it, though, as often the more complex the financial transaction, the more customized it must be. “The competitors are offline advisors for the most part,” Haber told me. Thus, standardizing and digitizing as many esoteric and project specific elements of the capital stack as possible is going to be, as he put it, “their opportunity and their challenge.”

Johnson says Crux is up for it. “It’s never going to be, you know, one click buy it on Amazon. That’s a ridiculous and implausible concept for deals of this size and importance. But these negotiations and transactions can be so much better.” Efficiency, at the very least, seems to be something we can all get behind. So as the partisan fighting over tax credits and transferability commences and the clean energy incentives start to fall, maybe at least this one climate tech darling can weather the storm.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDI3NDczOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjkxMzAzNX0.YN1v1ada94hTVxE1hw0ndSTReEGwKpFwfLHZhHED5wI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-20 22:06:50.379494

In its 2025 Business Briefing, an annual report outlining its strategy, chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said that Honda was reducing its planned global investment in EVs by 30 per cent — to $67.5 billion (7 trillion yen) from $96.4 billion (10 trillion yen) — over the next roughly half-decade because EV adoption has fallen behind the company’s initial projections.

As a corollary shift in strategy, the company plans to instead increase its production of hybrid-electric vehicles, a technology that allows consumers the comforts of both internal combustion engines and battery-electric vehicles.

Article content

But that shift means that its comprehensive EV project in Canada, which Mibe said has a “central focus on batteries” is taking a back seat.

Article content

“We are reassessing our EV strategy and road map, including the plans for the product lineup and the timing of relevant investments, including the one to build a comprehensive EV value chain in Canada,” Mibe said according to a transcript of his speech accompanying the Business Briefing.

Article content

The company said last week that the two-year delay to its planned EV project in Canada is not a prelude to a cancellation.

Article content

The project was announced in April 2024 with an original timeline to begin production by 2028, and included an EV assembly plant, as well as battery-cell manufacturing and active cathode material plants. A battery recycling operation was also a possibility.

Article content

The overall project was expected to have eventual production capacity of 240,000 EVs per year, and had attracted federal and provincial government support, such as tax credits, that were expected to defray $5 billion of direct and indirect costs.

Mibe said Tuesday that the project in Alliston, Ont. — where Honda has produced vehicles since 1986 — is still key to Honda’s electrification plans.

“One of our goals with this project is to take batteries in-house, as the core of electrification technology,” he said.

But Mibe added that electrification cannot be Honda’s responsibility alone, and must be done in collaboration with other companies and governments of various countries.

He added that “environmental regulations, which had been the premise of widespread adoption of EVs” are being relaxed in both the U.S. and Europe.

SAVANNAH, Georgia — The 2026 Ioniq 9 three-row electric SUV is a dual-threat, with style and features to compete with premium brands like Acura, Audi, Buick, Lincoln and Tesla, but priced to take on upcoming three-row EVs from the likes of Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, and Toyota.

The six- or seven-seat SUV has room for families, youth soccer and the like, but feels a step above once you log a few miles. The Ioniq 9 is on sale now. Prices start at $58,955 ― about $3,000 more than the top models of gasoline mainstream brands like the Ford Explorer, GMC Acadia and Toyota Grand Highlander.

How big, how many, how much?

The Ioniq 9 seats six or seven, depending on whether the middle row is a bench or captain's seats.

The SUV’s wheelbase and overall length ― 123.2 and 199.3 inches, respectively ― are nearly identical to Hyundai’s Palisade internal combustion SUV, but the Ioniq looks tidier, lower and sportier, thanks to clever proportions and an elegant design that leans into elliptical shapes and body lines inspired by traditional Korean dress. A descending roofline and tapered “boattail” rear end contribute to a sleek and upscale appearance.

The base rear-drive model has a single motor that generates 215 horsepower, 258 pound-feet of torque rated 335 miles on a charge in EPA tests. Midlevel all-wheel-drive models have a motor on each axle, 333 hp, 446 pound-feet and 320 miles range. The top three trims also have AWD and are rated at 422 hp, 516 pound-feet and 311 miles.

A big 110.2 kWh battery can accept DC fast charging up to 350 kW and charge from 10%-80% in 24 minutes at a CCS charger. The same charge at less powerful Tesla NACS chargers takes 41 minutes, still pretty good.

Most owners generally charge overnight at home at 240v. That takes nine hours, 40 minutes for 10%-80%, enough to ensure starting most days with a full battery.

$7.6 billion invested and thousands of jobs created, without tariffs

Say what you will about Joe Biden ― and we all have ― the former president knew how to create manufacturing jobs and reduce prices. Hyundai built its “Metaplant America,” a $7.6 billion assembly and battery complex in response to incentives in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which encouraged U.S. manufacturing by offering tax credits on vehicles, batteries and materials sourced domestically.

Before the IRA, Hyundai planned to supply the U.S. with EVs and batteries built in South Korea for years before building any here.

Motivated by thousands of dollars per vehicle, the Metaplant plant shot up like a weed, building its first vehicle ― the smaller Ioniq 5 EV ― less than two years after groundbreaking. It's building 9s now, too, and will add other EVs or hybrids at a later date. The plant will eventually be able to build 500,000 vehicles annually.

A battery plant on the formerly wooded 2,906-acre site in Bryan County near Savannah will bring employment to 8,500 jobs paying 25% more than the county average, according to Hyundai.

Hyundai’s also building a second joint-venture battery plant in Georgia, raising total investment in the state to $12.6 billion, thanks to incentives passed into law years before the current flurry of tariffs. The current administration has threatened to eliminate the incentives.

'Here, Spot. Good robot.'

The Metaplant’s workforce includes two eerie but likable dog-like Boston Dynamics robots — both called “Spot"" — that inspect vehicle bodies with bright, digital eyes.

Management emphatically shot down social-media rumors they plan to replace humans with an all-robot workforce. Employment is rising, not falling, as demonstrated from a training center under construction and a welcome center that will include wings for Hyundai, Kia and Genesis, all of which are slated to build vehicles there.

Automatically guided vehicles that look a bit like self-driving card tables carry parts and vehicles through much of the plant, raising or lowering them as needed at each assembly station. Other automated equipment welds and positions heavy parts.

Driving impressions

I drove a loaded AWD Ioniq 9 Performance Calligraphy from the narrow cobblestoned streets of old Savannah over modern highways to its assembly plant, then on the winding, oak and marsh-lined country roads of the atmospheric Low Country.

It’s surprisingly maneuverable for a vehicle the same length as Hyundai’s hulking Palisade. The steering is responsive and direct. The suspension kept the SUV stable and level when accelerating, stopping and rounding curves quickly.

The Ioniq 9 is exceptionally quiet, thanks to active road noise cancellation, acoustic windshield and first- and second-row windows.

The seats are comfortable and accommodating, include a roomy second row and usable rear set. Cargo space is good. A small front trunk has room for charging cables or a little gym bag, but not much more

The displays are big and clear. Physical dials and buttons control temperature, volume, tuning and a handful of other features. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as is wireless charging.

What should be better?

The Ioniq 9 has few shortcomings. I wouldn’t mind a few more buttons in lieu of flat-panel touch points for climate control.

The base model’s power output ― 215 hp, 258 pound-feet of torque ― is unimpressive for a vehicle whose lightest model tips the scales at 5,507 pounds. Even peak output ― 422 hp, 516 pound-feet ― is mild compared with many EVs with flashy max-output settings.

The Performance Calligraphy I drove was more than capable in the kind of urban and highway driving most owners will do ― and I suspect few owners will use the other EVs' cutely named but range-sapping overdrive settings

Why buy a 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 9?

A flood of appealing EVs has hit the market in the last year, but few SUVs with three rows of seats. That’s a surprise, given how popular those family haulers are with the public. The electric competition is limited to the Kia EV9, Rivian R1S, Tesla X, Volkswagen ID Buzz and Volvo EX90.

The Ioniq 9’s looks, comfort and advanced features should make it a leader in that class.

FLINT, MI – After nearly a decade of sustained effort, oversight, and advocacy, on March 19, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it is officially lifting the emergency order placed on the City of Flint under the Safe Drinking Water Act in 2016. This marks a historic milestone in Flint’s ongoing recovery and resilience journey.

The emergency order—issued in response to the water crisis—required the City of Flint and the State of Michigan to implement a range of corrective actions. Through partnership, investment and accountability, the City of Flint has met or exceeded all those requirements. The EPA has confirmed that Flint’s water system is now in full compliance with federal lead standards.

“This moment is about the people of Flint—about their voices, their strength, and their determination,” said Mayor Sheldon Neeley. “For nearly a decade, we have worked tirelessly to restore trust and integrity to our water system, as well as meeting rigorous standards. While this milestone marks progress, our commitment to clean, safe drinking water remains unwavering. We will continue to advance infrastructure, strengthen safeguards and ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated. Flint families deserve nothing less.”

Since 2016, Flint has implemented a corrosion control plan to minimize lead release in water, remained below federal lead action levels for eight consecutive years, and replaced over 97% of lead service lines. The City has also expanded its team of certified water operators, modernized water system operations and constructed a backup water line to enhance long-term reliability.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin noted the significance of this milestone:

“Today we celebrate nearly a decade’s worth of hard work and partnership at the local, state and federal level to ensure the residents of Flint have access to clean, safe drinking water. Even though the emergency order is lifted, our shared responsibility to Flint continues. EPA will remain a committed partner in supporting Flint’s water system long into the future.”

EPA Region 5 Administrator Anne Vogel added, “This achievement reflects the dedicated efforts of the City of Flint, the State of Michigan and the EPA in addressing the lead crisis. Flint residents can trust in the quality of their water supply.”

With the order lifted, regulatory oversight will return to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), which will continue to work closely with the City to monitor compliance and ensure long-term system performance.

Background

The EPA emergency order was first issued in January 2016 in response to the Flint water crisis. In the years since:

EPA invested more than $100 million through the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act to help Flint upgrade its water system.

Flint conducted a corrosion control study and successfully implemented optimal treatment techniques.

A new backup pipeline was constructed to ensure continuity of service during emergencies or maintenance.

Flint strengthened staffing, training and standard operating procedures, resulting in 13 fully-certified drinking water operators.

In 2024, the City of Flint entered an administrative consent order with EGLE to ensure long-term compliance with both the Safe Drinking Water Act and the federal Lead and Copper Rule.

Mayor Neeley concluded, “The road to this day has been long and hard-fought—but Flint stood strong. We thank every resident, worker, and partner who helped us get here. This is a milestone for Flint, but not the end. Our eyes remain on the future—on healing, growth, and protecting our people.”",,N,,2025-05-20 21:01:31.405129

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?","The Cadillac six-passenger Vistiq electric luxury vehicle is expected to have a 305-mile range on a charge.

With the Vistiq all-wheel drive is standard.

The question isn’t whether buyers will love Cadillac’s six-passenger 2026 Vistiq electric luxury SUV. They will.

The question is why it took Cadillac decades to build this baby Escalade ― easier than the massive original to park and helm through city traffic, but still packing the luxury, technology and sheer presence that’s made the Escalade an icon; arguably the most successful and important vehicle in Cadillac’s 122-year history.

Infusing the Escalade’s essence into a vehicle in the higher-volume midsize SUV segment seems obvious in retrospect, but Cadillac never tried. It built smaller SUVs, some very good, but none approached the Escalade’s status and swagger.

Honestly, though, who cares? The Vistiq rolling into Cadillac dealers now is such a natural fit for the brand that asking what took so long is the cheapest Monday morning quarterbacking. If you didn’t have the idea, you don’t get to call other people slow for not thinking of it sooner.

What matters is that the Vistiq has arrived, with the bravado, power and sheer heft that make the Escalade ― and the new Escalade IQ EV ― impossible to ignore in a market crowded with luxury and electric SUVs.

Built in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the Vistiq is on sale now. Prices run from $77,395 to $96,495, excluding a $1,695 destination charge.

What makes the Vistiq special?

Cadillac has bet big on EVs. They account for 23% of sales so far this year, with a target of 35% by year end.

The Vistiq’s calling cards are:

Road presence

Advanced features

Comfort

Style

Room

Big battery, good range, poor charging transparency

A midsize three-row SUV with six or seven seats, the Vistiq plays in one of the most popular vehicle segments.

All-wheel drive from a pair of electric motors is standard. They produce 615 hp and 650 pound-feet of torque that blast the SUV to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds.

A 102 kWh battery provides up to 305 miles range.

Cadillac continues GM’s refusal to quantify DC charging speed by the commonly used and easily understood, “xx minutes from 10%-80%” of battery capacity, but the Vistiq’s battery can accept 190kW current, adding “up to 79 miles in about 10 minutes.”

On the possibly naive assumption that GM’s acting in good faith, simple math suggests 10%-80% could be achieved in less than 30 minutes ― fast enough there’s no reason not to announce it.

When reality just isn’t good enough

An advanced new augmented reality system projects navigation information ― including arrows floating in front of the Vistiq to indicate turns ― and alerts. New optics make the display, which appears to be projected in space 10 meters in front of the Vistiq, clearer and more effective than earlier AR systems.

The Vistiq is one of a handful of vehicles that uses active noise cancellation to reduce road noise from the tires and suspension. That’s particularly welcome given that its electric drivetrain eliminates many sounds and vibrations that mask those noises in internal combustion vehicles.

Driving impressions

The Vistiq drives like a smaller vehicle. That’s a very good thing, particularly for a vehicle that can haul six or seven adults in comfort. The optional four-wheel steering tightens its running radius and enables quick, stable maneuvers at highway speed. An air suspension that’s packaged with the 4WS (four-wheel steering) smooths rough surfaces and virtually eliminates body roll, squat and dive in enthusiastic driving.

And it’s hard not to drive enthusiastically in a vehicle that combines inherently quiet EV operation with active road-noise cancellation and plenty of acoustic insulation.

The Vistiq’s smooth, quiet progress makes it easy to underestimate your speed. GM’s advanced Super Cruise hands-free driving system becomes appealing not just for driver comfort, but also because it maintains the speed you choose ― regardless of how quiet and smooth the Vistiq is at high speeds

Elegant, advanced interior

The interior is roomy and comfortable, with materials including carbon fiber, open-pore wood. Highlights include metal inlays in wood trim, ambient lighting and woven accent fabric made from recycled feedstock. The 23-speaker audio system has jewel-pattern metal grilles.

The instrument panel has 33 inches of continuous screen for displays and controls ― and eventually to stream videos when parked and charging. A separate touch screen handles climate, infotainment and other features, including apps from the Google Play store.

There’s useful luggage and cargo room. The third row of seats provides adult legroom when the second row is moved forward.

What could be better?

The touch screen is not responsive enough for some functions, including adjusting lumber support and other seat features.

Polarized sunglasses significantly reduce the augmented reality display’s visibility.

While GM makes third-party apps available through its Google operating system and adopts other Android smart phone features, the automaker’s EVs don’t allow Apple CarPlay, complicating some drivers’ accustomed smart phone use.

Why buy a 2026 Cadillac Vistiq?

The Vistiq’s broad stance, vertical lights and illuminated badges stand out. Like the Escalade ― like all Cadillacs should ― the SUV announces your arrival. It’s responsive on the road and in parking lots, thanks to well-tuned steering and suspension. The interior is elegant, roomy and easy to use, with contemporary touches like metal-inlaid wood, fabric from recycled materials, large and legible displays.

Advanced technologies improve everything from driving to enjoying music and flowing navigation instructions.

It launched a battery module compatible with most electric trucks and is setting up a network of battery-swapping stations.

EVs made up 20.9% of all heavy-duty trucks sold in China in December 2024.

China has become a global leader in electric cars and car tech, with one of the highest personal EV adoption rates in the world. But it's also ahead of everyone else when it comes to electric heavy-duty truck sales.

Electric trucks accounted for 10% of all Chinese heavy-duty truck sales last year. Gasgoo quotes the boss of Chinese battery manufacturing juggernaut CATL, Zeng Yuqun, saying that this will keep rising and hit 50% by 2028. If this trend prediction proves accurate, then diesel will cease to be the most popular means of propulsion for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, since natural gas and fuel cell electric vehicles are also increasing in popularity in China.

This popularity is spurred by new policies that encourage businesses to choose EVs over combustion vehicles and machinery. China is looking at ways of cutting carbon emissions, 60% of which it estimates come from commercial vehicles hauling freight.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) says the percentage of new electric trucks bought last year was even higher, 13%, and it rose to 20.9% in December of last year, showing clear signs of growth. It also notes that diesel truck sales made up 57% in 2024, down from 70% in 2023. Some 581 fuel cell electric trucks were also purchased in China last year, gaining a 0.8% market share.

Thanks to recent advancements in charging speeds—there are chargers capable of delivering 1 megawatt of power, which is needed to replenish trucks’ vast batteries without too much downtime—the People’s Republic is in a great position to transition to heavy-duty EVs quicker than other countries.

CATL also wants to establish battery-swapping station networks specifically for electric trucks. It recently unveiled the 75# standardized battery module, which the company says will be compatible with around 95% of all electric trucks. One station will be able to handle 700,000 kWh of swaps in one day, with each battery swap taking around five minutes.

It plans to build 300 such stations by the end of the year, and this battery-swapping network is the key to pushing the market share of heavy-duty EVs to 50% and beyond. By 2030, CATL intends to expand this network to cover 93,000 miles (150,000 km) of roads between 16 major cities, which would be enough to meet 80% of the country’s road freight needs.

The incentive for truck operators to switch to electric trucks is not just to reduce emissions and improve air quality, which is a big issue around major urban centers in China. There’s also an economic incentive. CATL says that using its battery swapping stations will bring savings of $8,300 (60,000 yuan) for every 62,000 miles (100,000 km) traveled.

Manufacturers of heavy-duty EVs in China don’t just want to sell locally. Long-haul trucks like the Windrose E1400, which looks like a Tesla Semi copy complete with a central driving position, are expected to enter production soon, with its claimed range of 416 miles with a combined tractor and trailer weight of 98,000 pounds (49 tons).

That’s thanks to a massive 729 kilowatt-hour LFP battery pack that can be recharged at almost 1 megawatt if sufficiently powerful chargers are hooked up to both of its two charging ports. Its efficiency, going only on the manufacturer’s claimed figures, works out to around 1.75 kWh per mile, which makes it more frugal than the Tesla Semi, whose claimed consumption is 2 kWh per mile while fully loaded with a gross combined weight of 82,000 pounds (41 tons).

This is just one of the many heavy-duty EVs coming out of China. There are dozens of them. Some offer even bigger batteries, with one from Sany packing a 1,165 kWh battery. That gives it a claimed range of 497 miles (800 km).

It's not hard to see a future where one of these is a hit. And with the infrastructure to support a true long-haul battery swapping network, a future where 50% of trucks are electric seems within reach.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/qkqLlv/s1/catl-truck-battery-swap-station.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 22:07:05.072262

1, tier-one EV luxury brand.""","DETROIT — Cadillac's expanding all-electric vehicle lineup is attracting a notable number of new buyers to the American luxury brand, including an increase this year of Tesla owners trading in their EVs.

The General Motors brand reports nearly 8 out of every 10 customers purchasing a Cadillac EV are new to Cadillac, with around 10% of those customers trading in a Tesla. That includes roughly 25% of customers trading in a Tesla this year for a Cadillac Lyriq SUV, up from prior levels of about 10% to 15%.

""We see the opportunity to increase the conquest rate for Tesla, absolutely,"" Brad Franz, Cadillac director of global marketing, told CNBC during an event for the Vistiq three-row SUV — the brand's latest EV to hit U.S. showrooms.

That increase in customer conquesting, as the industry refers to it, comes as Cadillac offers a relatively full lineup of EVs and as Tesla faces declining sales and boycotts this year amid CEO Elon Musk's support of President Donald Trump and his actions as part of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Cadillac declined to speculate on if Musk's politics played into Tesla owners' thinking, saying the carmaker is ""building great Cadillacs that are conquesting customers from other brands on the merits of the products.""

Cadillac's current EV lineup includes an entry-level crossover called the Optiq, the midsize Lyriq SUV, the Vistiq, the Escalade IQ full-size SUV and soon a $300,000-plus bespoke Celestiq car. It also offers a performance variant of the Lyriq and a larger version of the Escalade IQ.

""The portfolio is the key,"" Franz said. ""We've always had good interaction with Tesla customers, but in the past, that's been in that 10% to 15% range [for Lyriq]. So, certainly, we're seeing a good jump in conquest rate.""

While Cadillac has had some luck luring Tesla owners, there's still room for improvement.

No Tesla vehicle is in the top 10 of any cross-shopped Cadillac EV over the past six months, according to Edmunds.com, meaning the majority of those customers aren't searching for Teslas against a Cadillac. The consumer vehicle research and data firm reports the top cross-shopped vehicles on its website for Cadillacs are largely other Cadillac EVs, as well as other domestic nameplates.

A potential reason for that could be that Tesla owners are not actually cross-shopping against their vehicle, just trying to find a new one, according to Joseph Yoon, Edmunds' consumer insights analyst.

""People leaving Tesla cars now, they're, in my opinion, making a very deliberate choice to get out of that car,"" he said. ""If your priority is to get out of the Tesla ASAP, then they're not, technically, cross-shopping Tesla for their next car.""

Yoon said it's common for vehicles from the same brands to be highly cross-shopped, adding the data is from its website and not representative of dealer trade-ins.

Edmunds reports the top cross-shopped vehicles for the Cadillac Lyriq — the brand's EV sales leader — are the Cadillac Optiq, Acura ZDX, Ford Mustang Mach-E and BMW 1X. They are followed by the Kia EV9 and the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox EVs.

For Tesla models, Edmunds reports other Tesla models top consumers' cross-shopping searches, as well as many Honda, Hyundai and Kia vehicles. The Chevrolet Equinox EV, GMC Hummer EV and Ford Mustang Mach-E are in the mix as well, depending on the model.

Yoon also noted that although Tesla and Cadillac may offer vehicles in similar price points, Tesla's top-selling models — the Model 3 and Model Y — are more mainstream cars than luxury.

Cadillac's target this year is to be the bestselling luxury EV brand, which does not include Tesla, although there is a valid argument that the more pricey Model S and Model X are luxury vehicles.

""Cadillac is leading the way with our EV lineup,"" Franz said during the Vistiq event. ""We're really poised for success. We're going to take this portfolio, now that Vistiq is rounding out the SUV portfolio, and become the No. 1, tier-one EV luxury brand.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107301197-16947288232023-09-14t213141z_126768134_rc2j83a61xi9_rtrmadp_0_autoshow-detroit.jpeg?v=1694728876&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-05-20 21:04:20.095617

Congress is set to claw back $6.5 billion in climate-related Inflation Reduction Act investments to help pay for the Trump administration's priorities, including tax cuts and mass deportations but critics said the move would cost jobs and blunt the administration's goal of energy dominance by reducing domestic energy sources.

Saul Levin, campaigns and political director for the Green New Deal Network, said if passed, $580 million in funding would disappear from Colorado's 4th district, represented by Representative Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.

""In the 3rd District, which is represented by (Republican) Jeff Hurd, there's an estimated $1 billion that has been invested through the IRA,"" Levin pointed out. ""Regardless of people's exact politics, most people don't want that money to be pulled out.""

The House Ways and Means panel plans to revoke tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and home energy efficiency improvements, according to Reuters. The House Energy panel's plan would cut funding for limiting methane emissions at oil and gas facilities, reporting greenhouse gas emissions, reducing air pollution near schools and expanding electric grids to bring wind and solar power to homes and businesses.

Philip Rossetti, senior energy fellow for the think tank R Street Institute, believes the subsidies for clean energy were too costly but did reduce climate pollution. He added the investments will need better transmission infrastructure to be effective.

It’s a full reinvention of the C-HR nameplate that Toyota first launched in 2018 and pulled from the U.S. in 2022.
Expect the 2026 C-HR BEV to arrive at Toyota dealerships nationwide next year.","After disappearing from U.S. showrooms in 2022, the Toyota C-HR is officially making a comeback, but not in the form you remember. The automaker has reintroduced the compact crossover as a fully electric SUV, and it’s making a bold entrance with coupe-inspired styling, all-wheel drive, and a manufacturer-estimated 290-mile range.

Unveiled on May 14, the all-new 2026 Toyota C-HR Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) trades in its gas-powered roots for a high-performance electric setup. It boasts 338 horsepower and can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in around five seconds. Standard AWD gives it road-gripping capability, while a new underfloor battery design lowers the center of gravity for a smoother, more agile ride.

Built on Toyota’s dedicated e-TNGA EV platform, the reinvented C-HR will come in SE and XSE trims, offering a range of premium features like a massive 14-inch touchscreen, customizable ambient lighting, and dual wireless phone chargers. Drivers also get Toyota’s Safety Sense 3.0 suite, complete with lane departure alerts, adaptive cruise control, and emergency braking.

The C-HR BEV will be capable of DC fast charging, going from 10% to 80% battery in about 30 minutes. Plug & Charge technology and a NACS charging port offer access to thousands of stations nationwide. Toyota says it will also include regenerative braking paddle shifters and remote climate control through the Toyota app.

This isn’t just a rebadge. It’s a full reinvention of the C-HR nameplate that Toyota first launched in 2018 and pulled from the U.S. in 2022. The new BEV version embraces a sleeker silhouette, smart tech, and electrifying performance, positioning it as a serious contender in the growing EV crossover market.

Bush under the authority of the Clean Air Act and expanded by subsequent administrations, the ENERGY STAR label is the mark of efficient appliances, electronics, new homes, and more.
By choosing ENERGY STAR products, a typical household can save approximately $450 on its energy bills each year, according to an estimate from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Many energy efficiency incentive programs—run by utilities, states, and others—use the ENERGY STAR certification to set which products are eligible for rebates.
Last month, nearly 1,100 companies and organizations urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels in the ENERGY STAR program.","When asked about the future of the ENERGY STAR program in a congressional hearing Tuesday, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin said that “this is not a statutory obligation set by Congress” and “this program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government.” In response, Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), said:

“Congress directed the government to run the ENERGY STAR program. Until now, the EPA has implemented that statutory obligation, and it’s been an enormous success. This program saves families and businesses more than $40 billion every year with a budget of less than $40 million. It’s an astonishingly good deal. Major industry associations have rightly rejected this notion that someone else could simply pick up this program and run it as EPA has, with the decades of trust it has built with manufacturers, builders, and consumers. Congress needs to step up now and ensure that the government keeps running this remarkably effective and popular program.""

Background:

In a hearing Tuesday in the Environment Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Representative Darren Soto discussed the benefits of ENERGY STAR and asked Zeldin if he intended to ask Congress to shut it down. In response, Zeldin incorrectly claimed that the program was not required by Congress and could simply be run by a private entity.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005—passed on a bipartisan basis and signed by President George W. Bush—included a specific legal requirement for federal agencies to run the ENERGY STAR program. The law says that “responsibilities under the program shall be divided between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the terms of applicable agreements between those agencies.” It directs the heads of those agencies to “regularly update Energy Star product criteria for product categories” and “work to enhance public awareness of the Energy Star label” and “preserve the integrity of the Energy Star label.”

The ENERGY STAR program helps consumers and businesses save energy. Created in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush under the authority of the Clean Air Act and expanded by subsequent administrations, the ENERGY STAR label is the mark of efficient appliances, electronics, new homes, and more. By choosing ENERGY STAR products, a typical household can save approximately $450 on its energy bills each year, according to an estimate from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Last year alone, more than 330,000 buildings—comprising nearly 25% of all commercial building floorspace in the United States—used EPA's ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager® tool to measure and track their energy use, water use, and waste and materials.

Many energy efficiency incentive programs—run by utilities, states, and others—use the ENERGY STAR certification to set which products are eligible for rebates. Manufacturers and retailers use it to market efficient products.

Last month, nearly 1,100 companies and organizations urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels in the ENERGY STAR program.

Speaking to the media at one of the most damaged sites in Johnsonville, Dr. Yarkpawolo expressed frustration that despite previous stop orders, developers blatantly violated Liberia’s environmental laws.
“When this backfilling started, I personally came here and instituted a halt order,” Dr. Yarkpawolo said.
“This is not just illegal — it’s dangerous,” Dr. Yarkpawolo stressed.","Johnsonville, Liberia – May 20, 2025_The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Liberia, led by Executive Director Dr. Emmanuel K. Urey Yarkpawolo, has intensified its fight against illegal construction in wetlands with a fresh round of demolitions in Johnsonville and Jacob Town.

Tuesday’s operation, carried out under the mandate of Executive Order 143, targeted structures unlawfully erected by Chinese developers who were warned but continued work under the cover of darkness. The Presidential Executive Order established a Taskforce Against the Encroachment on Beachfronts and Waterways, made up of key government institutions including the Ministry of Public Works, the Liberia Land Authority, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and local city corporations.

Speaking to the media at one of the most damaged sites in Johnsonville, Dr. Yarkpawolo expressed frustration that despite previous stop orders, developers blatantly violated Liberia’s environmental laws.

“When this backfilling started, I personally came here and instituted a halt order,” Dr. Yarkpawolo said. “But the Chinese continued to backfill at night. We’re here today to send a strong message: these actions will not go unchecked.”

The site is near several schools, including the Multee International School System, and residents have reported worsening flooding as a result of the altered landscape.

“This is not just illegal — it’s dangerous,” Dr. Yarkpawolo stressed. “We cannot allow individuals or companies, whether Liberian or foreign, to destroy our wetlands and put entire communities at risk.”

He clarified that land ownership does not give anyone the right to build without an environmental permit, which is required for any development project, including excavation and dirt transportation.

“Whether you’re building on dry land or swamp, you need a permit,” he said. “Section 75 of the Environmental Protection and Management Law strictly prohibits draining, blocking, or building in wetlands.”

Dr. Yarkpawolo confirmed that Ruixu Commercial Concrete, the Chinese company responsible for the damage, was never issued an environmental permit. As a result, their structures are being demolished in line with the law.

The EPA CEO also called on truck drivers to stop being accomplices in the illegal backfilling of wetlands. Dr. Yarkpawolo said any transportation of dirt for development purposes requires two permits — one for the site being excavated and another for where the dirt is being dumped.

He urged the Truck Drivers Union and the Ministry of Transport to enforce these rules more strictly.

The EPA issued a strong warning to both Liberians and foreigners:

Do not backfill or build in wetlands;

Always consult the EPA before altering natural environments;

Report any suspicious construction activity near water bodies.

“We are serious. We are not backing down,” Dr. Yarkpawolo added. “Liberia’s environment is not for sale. We are protecting it for our children and their children.”

The EPA reaffirmed its commitment to upholding Liberia’s environmental laws and protecting critical ecosystems for the future.

""This is the Congress and the United States Senate submitting to the body the question of whether or not the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, ought to be able to determine for us what it is and isn't a rule.""
The discrepancy has led Democrats to claim Republicans are attempting to upend the Senate filibuster, an important tool for the minority party to gain leverage in the legislative process.
""The only people that have attempted to get rid of a legislative filibuster, the Democrats, every single one of them up there that's popping off and spouting off, has voted, voted literally to get rid of the legislative filibuster,"" Thune said in response to a reporter's question about Democrats' criticism.","Senate Republicans indicated that they intend to vote this week on whether to nix California's emissions waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has allowed the blue state to adopt stricter vehicle emissions standards than those imposed at the federal level, including a mandate that all vehicles sold in the state must be electric by 2035.

The planned vote sets up a battle between Republicans and Democrats over whether the waiver is a government ""rule"" subject to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to get rid of regulations with just a simple majority, as opposed to the typical 60-votes required to pass a bill. Democrats have described the GOP maneuvering as a ""nuclear option"" aimed at upending formal Senate rules.

""The administration says it's a rule. The GAO has said it's not. The United States Senate is going to be heard from on this issue tomorrow and do something that will avoid, again, what I think and what a lot of people across this country think, would be a catastrophic outcome – and that is an EV mandate that would be imposed, across the United States,"" Senate Majority Leader Thune said during a press conference from the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon.

The waiver, which gives California officials latitude to make their vehicle emissions standards stricter than those at the federal level, also allows other states to choose whether they want to follow federal standards or California's stricter ones.

""Obviously, the Democrats are going to make a lot of noise,"" Thune added during the Tuesday afternoon press conference, referring to the party's criticism of Republicans' procedural maneuvering.

""But the truth of the matter is, this has nothing to do with the legislative filibuster,"" Thune continued. ""This is the Congress and the United States Senate submitting to the body the question of whether or not the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, ought to be able to determine for us what it is and isn't a rule.""

Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian who interprets and advises on the congressional rules officials must follow, agreed with the Government Accountability Office's determination that California's EPA waiver is not considered a ""rule."" The discrepancy has led Democrats to claim Republicans are attempting to upend the Senate filibuster, an important tool for the minority party to gain leverage in the legislative process.

However, during Tuesday's short press conference, Thune slammed Democrats for complaining about the GOP's maneuvering around the filibuster, pointing out they have tried to knock it down themselves in the past when convenient for their party's priorities.

""The only people that have attempted to get rid of a legislative filibuster, the Democrats, every single one of them up there that's popping off and spouting off, has voted, voted literally to get rid of the legislative filibuster,"" Thune said in response to a reporter's question about Democrats' criticism.

Concerns abound surrounding cost increases on imported parts, a depleted EV inventory, potential supply-chain disruptions, and uncertainty about future US tax credits for EVs.

Recent coverage of prominent EV manufacturer Tesla TSLA reflects such volatility. As Tesla stock jumped after temporary cuts to tariffs between the US and China on May 12, 2025, Morningstar equity strategist Seth Goldstein wrote, “Tariffs can cause inflation and result in consumers purchasing fewer items. In autos, Tesla’s primary business, this includes the risk that consumers will delay or forgo a purchase or trade down to a less expensive vehicle.”

Analog Devices

Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide

Price/Fair Value: 0.93

Morningstar Rating: 4 stars

Sector: Technology

Analog Devices is a leading global manufacturer of mixed-signal and analog chips. Analog chips function by translating environmental conditions like temperature and sound into viable digital signals. The company supplies chips to a diverse range of end markets, including automotive companies, as well as manufacturers of medical devices, robots, and industrial machinery. In both fiscal 2022 and 2023, the adjusted operating margin for the firm hit 49%, though it has since declined to 41% in fiscal 2024. Morningstar anticipates, however, that the adjusted operating margin for Analog Devices could reach 50% by fiscal 2028, bolstered by a projected 9% average annual growth in sales. Considering Morningstar’s current fair value estimate of $245 per share, projections for fiscal 2025 are in line with a 3% free cash flow yield.

In recent coverage of Analog Devices, Morningstar equity strategist Brian Colello wrote, “We believe ADI has a wide economic moat because of its proprietary analog designs and high customer switching costs; since analog chips are neither particularly expensive nor do they require cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, high-quality analog chipmakers tend to retain design wins as the end product is being built, all while maintaining healthy pricing and strong profitability over time. An especially promising end market for the firm is the automotive sector. Semis are required to enable the sensors, active safety systems, and advanced infotainment systems added to cars today. Electric vehicles have even more chip content per car, and ADI is well-positioned, with a market share lead in battery management systems for electric vehicles.”

At a recent $226.68 per share, Analog Devices was trading at a 7% discount to Morningstar’s fair value estimate.

NXP Semiconductors

Morningstar Economic Moat Rating: Wide

Price/Fair Value: 0.76

Morningstar Rating: 4 stars

Sector: Technology

NXP Semiconductors is a prominent player among automotive semiconductor manufacturers. Like Analog Devices, the firm’s expertise is not limited solely to automotive chipmaking, as it also sells to the mobile, communications infrastructure, and industrial markets. Moreover, through enabling near-field communication, or NFC, NXP Semiconductors powers the mobile wallet offerings of multiple high-profile clients, the likes of which include Google GOOGL and Apple AAPL. Although the firm lost 5.0% in revenue in 2024 and Morningstar models an 8.5% decrease in revenue this year amid tariff-related market challenges, Morningstar anticipates a recovery by 2026. Indeed, Morningstar models indicate that NXP Semiconductors’ revenue could increase 6% in 2026 as EV designs call for an increasing proportion of chips embedded into their systems. Morningstar’s fair value estimate for NXP Semiconductors currently sits at $280 per share, indicating a 6% free cash flow yield for 2025.

“We believe the company has a strong position in the automotive, industrial, mobile, and communications infrastructure markets through a combination of high customer switching costs and intangible assets,” Colello wrote. “Although the company sells into cyclical industries, the strength of these competitive advantages gives us confidence that it will generate excess returns over the cost of capital over the next decade and beyond. The merger of Freescale and the former NXP in 2015 led to a powerhouse in automotive semiconductors, which makes up more than half of the company’s total revenue. Like many of its chipmaking peers, NXP is well-positioned to benefit from safer, greener, smarter cars in the years ahead. It is among the market leaders in automotive semis, especially in microcontroller units, or MCUs, which serve as the brains of a variety of electronic functions in a car.”

While electric car sales are still low, the numbers are growing quickly thanks to local manufacturing and incentives.
Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, is beginning to scale up EV sales.","Electric vehicle (EV) sales around the world have grown fast in recent years. In 2024, global electric car sales topped 17 million, representing over 20% of all new cars sold worldwide. That’s more than triple the number sold just 4 years earlier, according to the latest report by the International Energy Agency.

The momentum continues into 2025, with EV sales expected to exceed 20 million, or more than one-quarter of all new vehicle sales globally. The year kicked off strong: in the first quarter alone, more than 4 million EVs were sold, marking a 35% increase compared to Q1 2024.

This explosive growth shows how quickly the global auto market is shifting toward electric mobility—driven by falling battery prices, better infrastructure, and strong policy support in key markets.

Countries like China, the United States, and several in Europe are leading the charge in this shift. Their efforts are helping to reduce emissions, cut oil use, and push new technologies into the spotlight.

Let’s take a deeper dive into the IEA’s Global EV Outlook 2025 Report to see who’s leading the electric car revolution and other key industry trends.

China’s EV Empire Expands

China has once again proven itself the global leader in electric car adoption. In 2024, electric vehicles made up almost 50% of all car sales in the country. China also accounted for nearly two-thirds (65%) of all electric cars sold worldwide that year.

What’s driving this boom? One reason is cost. Over half of all electric cars sold in China now cost less than similar gasoline-powered models.

RELATED: Experts Say China’s Emissions Peak Is Near: How EVs and Renewables Are Playing a Big Part

Government support has also played a big role. For example, in April 2024, China launched a trade-in program that encourages people to buy new electric or gasoline cars by giving them money to exchange old ones. While this scheme supports both types of vehicles, it has helped electric cars become even more attractive to buyers.

As seen below, the Chinese government has spent USD30 billion on EV production.

In addition, the Chinese government has extended EV tax exemptions through 2027 and trade-in grants through 2025. These policies give people more reasons to go electric. With all these efforts, under current policies, China is expected to hit an 80% EV sales share by 2030.

Europe Charges Ahead Despite Road Bumps

Europe continues to be a strong performer in the electric car space. Many European countries are seeing electric cars take up a larger share of new vehicle sales. In places like Norway, the share is already above 80%, while in others like Germany, France, and the Netherlands, the share is steadily rising.

The European Union supports this growth by setting strict emissions limits, offering purchase incentives, and investing in charging infrastructure.

In fact, some countries have already announced bans on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by the early 2030s. This sends a clear signal to both consumers and automakers to prepare for an all-electric future.

Even though sales dipped slightly in some parts of Europe during the first half of 2024 due to inflation and policy changes, demand bounced back in the second half of the year. Falling battery costs and a wide range of available models helped fuel this recovery. Europe remains a critical market, making up around 20% of global EV sales.

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) reports that new electric car registrations in Europe, including the UK, grew by 28% in the first quarter. This increase brought the total to 573,500 units, mainly driven by a strong rebound in Germany.

America Hits the Accelerator

The United States also saw strong growth in electric car sales in 2024 and early 2025. Sales rose about 20% compared to the previous year.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, played a big part in this rise. The IRA gives buyers tax credits for new and used electric vehicles and helps manufacturers build EVs and batteries in the U.S.

By the end of 2024, EVs made up about 10% of new car sales in the U.S. California leads all states, with EVs making up over 25% of new car sales. Other states, such as New York and Washington, are following closely behind.

New models from both U.S. and international carmakers are giving buyers more choices than ever. At the same time, the charging network is expanding, making it easier for people to switch to electric.

Other Countries Show Promise

While China, Europe, and the U.S. lead in total sales, several other countries are making big progress in 2025:

India is seeing fast growth, especially in two- and three-wheeled EVs. Affordable electric scooters and rickshaws are helping more people go electric. While electric car sales are still low, the numbers are growing quickly thanks to local manufacturing and incentives.

Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia, is beginning to scale up EV sales. Thailand aims to make 30% of its electric car production by 2030 and has started to attract foreign EV investment.

Latin America is still in the early stages, but countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Chile are rolling out policies to support EV growth. Charging networks are expanding slowly, and imports of electric vehicles are increasing.

Charging Infrastructure Supports Growth

One major reason behind the EV boom is the growing number of charging stations. In 2024 alone, the world added over 2 million public chargers, with most of them in China and Europe.

Fast chargers, which can charge a car in under 30 minutes, are becoming more common, making EVs practical even for long trips. Chinese carmaker BYD has announced its breakthrough in EV battery charging in just 5 minutes last month.

In the U.S., public charging infrastructure is also improving. The federal government has invested billions in new charging stations, with a goal of building a nationwide network that works for everyone. More reliable and widespread charging reduces “range anxiety,” the fear that an EV will run out of battery far from a charger.

However, a major news came out recently that the Trump administration froze the $5 billion funding intended to EV chargers. This led some US states to bring the matter to court. The final decision will greatly impact the industry.

Automakers Race to Meet Demand

Automakers worldwide are responding to this demand shift. Nearly every major car company now offers electric models, and many plan to go fully electric in the next 10 to 15 years. For example:

General Motors aims to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035.

Volkswagen plans to make EVs 70% of its European sales by 2030.

BYD has already stopped making gas-only cars and is expanding rapidly into global markets.

The competition helps lower costs and improve technology. Battery range is improving, and newer models are becoming more affordable. As EVs get better and cheaper, more people are choosing them over traditional cars.

The EV market shows no sign of slowing down. If battery prices continue to fall and policies stay strong, sales in 2025 may hit a new record. With continued global effort, EVs could become the norm by the end of the decade.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2464612645.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 22:07:20.894380

If we want to stay globally competitive, reduce grid strain, and keep energy costs down for households and businesses, we can't afford to lose Energy Star.","One of America's most effective public-private partnerships is under threat. Not from foreign adversaries, but from proposed budget cuts that would eliminate the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program.

At first glance, Energy Star might seem like just a government label slapped on refrigerators or laptops. But behind that small, bright blue star, recognized by 90 percent of American households, is the nation's most trusted and impactful energy efficiency program. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, eliminating Energy Star would create chaos for consumers and businesses alike, replacing a consistent, science-based standard with a confusing tangle of inconsistent, often pay-to-play private certifications.

Energy Star is more than a label. It's infrastructure. As of 2024, the EPA reports that the program saves American families an average of $450 per year on energy bills. It keeps mission-critical facilities—like hospitals, schools, and data centers—running efficiently and reliably. And it's a foundational tool for grid stability, helping utilities and building operators cut demand and emissions without sacrificing performance. By reducing overall energy consumption and improving the resilience of critical infrastructure, Energy Star also strengthens national security. Lower energy demand makes the grid less vulnerable to disruptions—whether from cyberattacks, natural disasters, or supply shortages—while energy-efficient buildings are better equipped to maintain operations during emergencies. In an era of growing threats to our energy infrastructure, programs like Energy Star are essential for safeguarding both our economy and our national security.

In an age of soaring energy demand, aging infrastructure, and rising utility costs, Americans need more tools to improve efficiency, not fewer. Gutting Energy Star would pull the rug out from under efforts to modernize our buildings, decarbonize our economy, and keep costs manageable for families and businesses alike.

I've spent over 30 years helping health systems, schools, and commercial real estate owners achieve Energy Star certification and realize measurable savings and resilience. In the early 1990s, I worked with the EPA to help design and scale the very tools that underpin the program's commercial building platform. Today, through my work with RE Tech Advisors and Legence, we've helped more than 25,000 buildings—totaling 5 billion square feet—track and improve performance using Energy Star tools.

This work has real, tangible impact. Take our recent partnership with Avanath Capital Management, a national affordable housing provider. Since 2021, Avanath has used Energy Star tools to analyze utility usage and create best-practice operating standards that ensure greater efficiencies and economies of scale. More than a quarter of its properties are now Energy Star certified, and they were recognized as an Energy Star Partner of the Year in 2024. These improvements helped the company reduce energy and water use by 10 percent—years ahead of schedule—freeing up capital for property repairs while keeping rents affordable for residents.

At Harvard Law School, our team developed a decarbonization roadmap across 22 buildings and 1.2 million square feet. Energy Star tools were critical to ensuring compliance with local building performance standards and benchmarking ordinances. But beyond compliance, the plan is delivering lower emissions, cleaner air, and improved energy performance.

This is why federal agencies, per the U.S. General Services Administration, require the office space they lease to meet Energy Star certification standards. It's not about politics. It's about performance. Energy Star-certified buildings use, on average, 35 percent less energy than non-certified ones. If the program disappears, those gains evaporate—and utilities, taxpayers, and the planet all pay the price.

Despite decades of bipartisan support, Energy Star now faces the chopping block. Yet no private organization has the impartiality, scientific rigor, or nationwide trust to replace it. The federal government has the data, lab research, and technical expertise needed to run Energy Star effectively and transparently. Eliminating it would be a reckless mistake—and a costly one.

Congress and the administration must recognize Energy Star for what it is: critical national infrastructure that has saved billions of dollars, reduced pollution, and strengthened our energy system for more than 30 years. It's a rare government success story—one where the public and private sectors work together to solve complex challenges and deliver real results.

If we want to stay globally competitive, reduce grid strain, and keep energy costs down for households and businesses, we can't afford to lose Energy Star. Contact your representatives. Tell them to protect a program that works—for all of us.

A new report released on May 20 found that the number of international investment projects for renewable energy in Asean has increased by an average of about 15 per cent per year since 2020, with investments reaching US$43 billion (S$55.8 billion) in 2022.

This growth rate is higher than the global average of 11 per cent , according to the report by climate and energy research group Zero Carbon Analytics.

In terms of public financing, China was the largest investor in Asean clean energy with over US$2.7 billion between 2013 and 2023, followed by Japan with US$2.45 billion.

Meanwhile, South Korea invested US$583 million and Australia put in US$51 million.

The four countries are some of Asean’s largest clean energy investors, according to the report, adding that they are the major external powers shaping South-east Asia’s energy transition.

The five Asean recipient countries in the report are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Asean’s electricity demand is expected to grow 41 per cent by the end of the decade , and renewable energy capacity is expected to increase by 300 to 500 per cent by 2035 , said the report.

However, the developing region – which is still heavily reliant on coal for its energy needs – needs foreign investment for the energy transition, with major financing gaps in renewables and grid development.

The report comes amid the scale-back in climate initiatives and spending by the US, such as laying out plans to phase out clean energy tax credits and slash spending on electric vehicles and renewable energy .

The US – one of the world’s largest emitters – also said in January that it would pull out of the Paris Agreement, a pact signed by nearly 200 countries in 2015 to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Ms Sharon Seah, coordinator at the Asean Studies Centre and Climate Change in South-east Asia Programme at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore and one of the experts speaking at a webinar for the report on May 20, said that the global climate vacuum is “very concerning”.

“There’s been a lack of leadership... and the concern within the region really is about the normative effect that this can have on the other countries,” she said.

But the report showed that some economies in Asia seem to be rising to the occasion.

For example, China leads in the investments for wind and hydropower among the four countries, and provided US$1.83 billion for clean energy financing in South-east Asia in 2024 under its Belt and Road Initiative.

It also led in clean energy trade with the five South-east Asian countries , driven by strong exports of electric vehicle batteries, solar modules and wind components.

Meanwhile, Japan is the region’s bigger investor in geothermal and solar energy, with investments of US$1.3 billion and US$142 million, respectively.

South Korea was the largest exporter of battery components to Indonesia and Malaysia between 2017 and 2024. It also has a hand in financing mechanisms to support climate projects in Asean, albeit on a smaller scale.

The report also found that intentional and transparent policy by Asean countries can increase investor confidence in the energy transition.

The Asean power grid, for instance, finally made headway after Singapore said in 2021 that it plans to import around 30 per cent of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as renewable energy plants, by 2035.

Power grid integration was first mooted in 1997 to enhance cross-border electricity trade in South-east Asia to ensure energy security.

However, it was the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore (LTMS) electricity import pilot launched in 2022 that finally saw the region’s first multilateral electricity trade take place.

That same year, Singapore started importing up to 100MW of hydropower from Laos via existing interconnectors – cross-border electricity transmission lines – between the four countries.

An Asean grid will allow the Republic, which lacks access to most renewable energy options other than solar, to tap sources such as wind energy and hydropower in other countries.

Such a grid also allows countries in South-east Asia, where renewable resources are unevenly distributed, to trade electricity freely to meet rising demand. It would hedge against the intermittency of renewables by distributing energy more efficiently.

Eighteen key interconnection projects have been identified under the Asean power grid, of which half have been completed.

Ms Seah noted: “What (other) countries are interested in right now is to just explore what opportunities there are in the Asean power grid ... and assess whether (Asean) countries are serious about completing those other nine interconnections.”

On the heels of the L T MS project, t he Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines power integration project was announced in August 2023 . It aims to create multiple interconnections across the grids of the four countries, drawing on key lessons from the LTMS project.

Feasibility studies on the interconnections must be done before financing support can be sought for the subsea cables, said Ms Seah, who added that she expects to see more progress on the project in 2025 with Malaysia chairing Asean.

Ms Dinita Setyawati, a senior energy analyst at energy think-tank Ember who also spoke at the webinar, said that while the Asean power grid has attracted “a lot of interest” from development partners who are interested in selling their technologies, the project has to first materialise before investors crowd in.

She added that energy transition is not only about replacing fossil fuels with renewables or financing renewable energy projects, but also about looking into investment in infrastructure like power grids and upskilling of workers in the industry.

The Asean power grid would have many benefits for countries in the region other than providing green electricity, including the creation of new jobs, reduced air pollution, and significant investments generated for the energy sector.

According to the first phase of the US-Singapore feasibility study on regional energy connectivity, the regional grid can generate US$2 billion annually in research and development, and create as many as 9,000 jobs a year.

Ms Seah said: “It’s a good thing that the region has actually decided that physical interconnectivity will be a manifestation of what they really want to do, which is to integrate economically.”

She added: “But the Asean power grid has been discussed for the last three decades, so it really needs a few countries to be a champion of the Asean power grid and to bring it to fruition.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1303f6a29d4c81f54f1e2b55b12569e8b4c359b1d83c89a1610294c8ebc18d45,N,,2025-05-20 22:07:25.093443

Watch the full hearing here.

Below are key excerpts from today’s hearing:

Congressman Bob Latta (OH-05): “For far too long, the EPA has ballooned well beyond its original scope. Over time, the agency has amassed sweeping regulatory powers that increasingly bypass legislative oversight. What does that leave us with? High costs for the taxpayer, burdensome, unworkable regulatory conditions for industry, stifled innovation and manufacturing, and energy insecurity with decreased domestic production, high costs, and federal overreach for our energy mix. We had heard extensive testimony from industrial leaders across the board that the Biden Administration’s EPA stands for is technologically unfeasible. President Trump proposed a discretionary budget that decreases the EPA budget by over half of last year's budget, making many commonsense reforms to spend American taxpayer dollars in thoughtful ways to effectively improve our environment. What are your thoughts, especially when we hear from the industry that the Biden-Harris Administration’s EPA would come up with some kind of a standard—that there was no existing technology to even meet—but they were demanding that it be done? In a lot of cases, it was just going to put businesses out of business, because they couldn't meet these standards. So, how do you see the EPA dealing in with issues like this in the future?” Administrator Zeldin: “We inherited a lot of regulations that were enacted in 2023, 2024 seeking to strangulate the economy, choosing to suffocate the economy as if it's a binary choice between protecting the environment and growing the economy. The Trump EPA chooses both.”

Congressman Jay Obernolte (CA-23): “I wanted to ask you specifically about a concern I have about some of the reductions in force that have been occurring at the EPA, and I understand this is out of desire to right size the agency – that’s something I certainly am very supportive of that. However, many agencies rely on the EPA to do things like issue permits or issue approvals or review plans, and there has been concern expressed that the reductions in force, even though we're transforming the EPA into a more streamlined organization, will result in delays in those approvals and permits getting issued. Can you give us some assurances that that is not the intention?” Administrator Zeldin: “Congressman, yes, we are going to fulfill all of our statutory obligations, and the way that the reorganization was proposed a couple of weeks ago allows us to better focus on those statutory obligations and reduce the backlogs. So, for example, as I referenced earlier with a couple of your colleagues, we inherited a massive backlog with the pesticide review, a massive backlog with chemical review with state implementation plans with small refinery exemptions, and much more. We are putting resources into getting through those backlogs we inherited as quickly as possible. And, with the pesticide review backlog as one of the examples, we have already worked through over 2,300 of those backlogged cases. We'll continue at that pace, and we're taking measures to increase the pace of working through the backlog we inherited.”

Congresswoman Julie Fedorchak (ND-AL): “One of the first actions I took in this role was to write to President Trump and Secretary Burgum to ask them to repeal 20 burdensome rules and regulations from the previous administration – and you're well on your way to doing that. You have outlined a number of grave abuses from the last administration, and I would say one of the gravest abuses was the impact the past administration had on our power sector. I come from the regulatory side of things. I was the most recently the president of the National Utility regulators Association, and in that role, I worked hard to get the last administration to be reasonable on their 111D rules. They completely ignored everything we said. They ignored the power grid operators, and that rule was completely disconnected from reality. Even though it's being pulled back, it had grave consequences on our power grid, and today we are short or dangerously short of having enough power to meet demand because of that agency's overreach in the last administration. So, thank you for your commitment to correcting that and getting us back on track.” Administrator Zeldin: “I often get asked what the biggest surprise or what was most shocking. Once I was confirmed as administrator, and I would say it was surprising how much we were able to do at once. We've heard your calls for action at the agency and we want to tackle it all at the same time. We don't want to pace ourselves.”

Majority Leader John Thune announced Tuesday morning that the Senate will take up the vote to overturn waivers the Environmental Protection Agency granted to California that allowed the state to phase out gas-powered cars. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the Congressional Review Act — the legislative vehicle Republicans plan to use to overturn the policy — does not apply to waivers.

Ignoring Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough could open the door to ignoring her decisions later this year, when she will decide which policies can be part of the reconciliation bill and which should be subject to a 60-vote threshold filibuster. Democrats have warned that overruling the parliamentarian foreshadows how Republicans approach Senate rules in the near future, particularly as it applies to the Byrd Rule, which restricts what can be part of a reconciliation bill.

Thune dismissed this possibility in this floor speech, saying that Democrats’ concerns “are entirely misplaced.”

Thune called concerns that overruling the parliamentarian on this waiver will eventually open the door to ending the filibuster “hysterical.”

“We are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate,” he said. “The EPA has submitted the waivers to Congress as rules, which is all that Congress has ever needed to decide something under the Congressional Review Act.”

Conservative and liberal legal experts are sharply divided about whether the Senate’s move can be subject to legal challenge, because the Senate is making a choice about its own procedures and has the authority to do so. The CRA has been used so rarely since its creation that its boundaries have not been thoroughly tested, and many gray areas remain, experts told NOTUS.

Many automakers and industry alliances lobbied for Congress to take up the repeal of California’s EV mandate, concerned more with the economic consequences of the EV mandate than any question of Senate procedure.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) criticized Senate Republicans’ decision to overrule the parliamentarian.

“The use of the Congressional Review Act resolution is inconsistent with past precedent and violates the plain language of the Congressional Review Act itself as recognized by both the nonpartisan and well-reasoned analyses of the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian,” a spokesperson with CARB told NOTUS. “The vote does not change CARB’s authority.

Impacts for Regulated Entities The ongoing evolution of the WOTUS definition creates continued uncertainty for landowners, developers, agricultural producers and other regulated entities.
Be aware that state regulations may still apply even if federal CWA jurisdiction is not asserted.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plan to again redefine ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS). This definition is critical. It determines the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the principal federal statute aimed at protecting the nation's waters from pollution.

This latest move follows years of fluctuating WOTUS interpretations across multiple administrations. It directly responds to the Supreme Court's pivotal 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which substantially narrowed federal jurisdiction, particularly over wetlands.

Sackett’s Effect and the 2023 Conforming Rule

The Sackett ruling established a more restrictive test for CWA jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that CWA jurisdiction extends only to wetlands that possess a ""continuous surface connection"" to waterbodies that are themselves WOTUS. This rejected the agencies' prior interpretations that could include wetlands separated by dry land. For other water bodies like streams and lakes, the Court limited CWA jurisdiction to those that are “relatively permanent, standing, or continuously flowing.”

While the Sackett decision clarified that temporary breaks in surface connection (e.g., due to low tides or drought) do not necessarily negate jurisdiction, it also affirmed that intermittent and ephemeral streams are generally outside CWA jurisdiction. Notably, the Court did not provide a definition for ""relatively permanent"" waters.

Historically, the treatment of ditches under the CWA has also been a point of contention. While agencies often considered ditches jurisdictional unless specifically exempted, the Supreme Court's earlier decision in United States v. Rapanos suggested most ditches are not jurisdictional. The Court classified them as point sources rather than navigable waters, noting their typically intermittent flow. The Sackett majority did not directly address jurisdiction over ditches, though Justice Thomas' concurrence observed that a roadside ditch in that case was not a jurisdictional tributary.

In response to Sackett, the Biden administration issued the “2023 Conforming Rule” to align the WOTUS definition with the Supreme Court’s directives. However, this rule, while removing language inconsistent with Sackett, did not define ""continuous surface connection"" or ""relatively permanent"" waters. Consequently, the WOTUS definition remains a subject of debate, with critics asserting the 2023 rule lacks necessary clarity.

The New WOTUS Initiative: Seeking Clarity and Consistency

The agencies' March 24 announcement signals an intent to further refine the WOTUS definition. The EPA reasoned that the 2023 Conforming Rule may not fully align with the Sackett decision and raised questions regarding its interpretation and practical application. In the announcement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stressed the importance of clear and consistent regulations for all stakeholders, including states, farmers and small businesses. He noted concerns that the previous definitions could impose undue burdens and increase business costs.

The new initiative will involve gathering public input on several key aspects of the WOTUS definition, specifically concerning:

The geographic scope of “relatively permanent” waters

The meaning of “continuous surface connection”

The jurisdictional status of ditches

The agencies emphasized a commitment to practical implementation and efficient regulatory processes, aligning with goals previously stated during the Trump administration. In the interim, the agencies issued a policy memorandum regarding “abutting” wetlands. This guidance aims to help distinguish non-jurisdictional wetlands near jurisdictional waters (but separated by features like uplands, berms or dikes) from those with a continuous surface connection.

Impacts for Regulated Entities

The ongoing evolution of the WOTUS definition creates continued uncertainty for landowners, developers, agricultural producers and other regulated entities. The scope of WOTUS directly impacts permitting requirements under the CWA, particularly for dredge and fill activities (Section 404) and pollutant discharges (Section 402). A narrower definition, as suggested by Sackett and potentially further refined by this new initiative, could reduce the number of projects requiring federal permits.

However, the current lack of definitive guidance on terms like ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection"" means that jurisdictional determinations may still be subject to interpretation and potential challenges. Businesses and individuals undertaking projects that could affect water bodies or wetlands should:

Stay informed about the progress of this new WOTUS rulemaking initiative.

Carefully evaluate potential CWA jurisdiction for their specific sites, considering the Sackett decision and any interim guidance from the agencies.

Be aware that state regulations may still apply even if federal CWA jurisdiction is not asserted.

The definition of WOTUS remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental law. Regulated entities must remain vigilant and stay on top of these developments to ensure compliance, avoid potential administrative scrutiny and navigate potential litigation.",https://www.phelps.com/a/web/2oUhWNnp4Sdj6cab4ZPwwc/9BQDh1/environmental-alert-banner.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:08:30.377491

Pine Bluff, Arkansas was awarded $500,000.00 that will be targeted for the Downtown Development District.

The federal government and many states (including Arkansas) have statutes, regulations, and policies that are intended to address “Brownfields”. Brownfields are often referred to as property (improved and unimproved) the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.

Incentive provisions, funding programs, liability exemptions, and action/cleanup standards have been utilized for a number of years to attempt to reduce the barriers for reuse or redevelopment of Brownfield properties. The goal of Brownfield programs is to encourage redevelopment and investment in such properties to increase the local tax base, facilitate job growth, and utilize existing infrastructure, encourage infield use, and take pressure off of greenspace.

The Pine Bluff Downtown Development District areas that will be targeted include:

Saenger Theatre.

Hotel Pines.

Pine Bluff Bus Terminal.

Many expressed concerns about where nuclear waste would end up and environmental concerns about uranium mining, especially on native land.
Across the river Cathy Sampson-Kruse, 71, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, grew up in Umatilla County and went to high school in Echo.","A bill that would exempt Umatilla County from the statewide ban on new nuclear energy facilities has drawn the opposition of environmentalists, tribes, doctors and northeast Oregon community groups who showed up Monday at the Capitol in Salem to rally against it.

If passed, House Bill 2410 would allow the state’s Energy Facility Siting Council to approve development of a modular nuclear reactor in northeast Oregon’s Umatilla County. Oregon voters in 1980 approved a statewide ban on new nuclear development, barring the federal government creates a national repository for nuclear waste or voters decide to appeal. Neither has happened.

The bill’s architects characterize it as allowing a “demonstration project” of modular nuclear that would operate on a microgrid and support “community energy resilience.” Small reactors have about one-third the generating capacity of a traditional reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and can power individual neighborhoods, factories and facilities such as data centers that consume large amounts of energy.

Bill sponsor state Rep. Bobby Levy, R-Echo, has touted it in hearings as a clean energy solution to growing power demand in the state. Levy declined an interview Monday, but she told the Capital Chronicle in an email that local residents and the state would benefit from “reliable, carbon-free baseload power, job creation, and potential economic growth through new infrastructure investments.”

“At the broader level, small-scale nuclear would also contribute to Oregon’s clean energy goals, supporting a resilient and diversified energy mix across the state,” she said.

Nuclear energy does not directly produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, and it can produce more energy with less fuel than any other individual source of existing power, according to MIT.

But protesters Monday said they suspect House Bill 2410 is less about “community energy resilience” than powering Umatilla County’s booming data centers. The protesters said eastern Oregon lawmakers continue to treat the state’s northeast corner like an “environmental sacrifice zone,” noting that there is nowhere to safely store nuclear waste.

The bill passed 8-4 with recommendation in April from the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment, of which Levy is a vice-chair, to the Joint Ways & Means Committee. Another nuclear bill currently in the Ways & Means Committee, House Bill 2038, is also co-sponsored by Levy, and has drawn concerns from environmental and community groups as well as tribes. It would create a committee to study the benefits and risks of developing nuclear energy facilities in Oregon.

“The Umatilla Basin is one of the most polluted places in Oregon, some of the worst groundwater pollution in the state, some of the worst industrial air pollution in the state, and it just keeps getting worse. Now we’re talking about adding radioactive waste on top of that?” said Kaleb Lay, policy director at Oregon Rural Action, at the rally.

Representatives from nonprofit environmental groups Columbia Riverkeeper and the Sierra Club of Oregon and Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility also attended.

Data demand

Demand for power from the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which supplies electricity to the region, has grown 556% in the last decade according to recent analysis by the nonprofit research organization Sightline Institute. Nearly all of that is from Amazon data centers in the county. Amazon and Microsoft are investing billions in small scale nuclear reactors to power their data centers, including those in eastern Oregon, and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates last year invested $1 billion into a nuclear power plant in Wyoming, operated by his new company TerraPower.

Levy said it is an “oversimplification” to suggest data centers are the only or primary beneficiaries of modular nuclear reactors.

“The reality is that all ratepayers benefit from a more stable, reliable, and carbon-free energy supply — especially as demand across sectors continues to rise,” she said.

The bill has so far drawn 168 letters of testimony, about 75% of them in opposition to the bill. Many expressed concerns about where nuclear waste would end up and environmental concerns about uranium mining, especially on native land.

The bill would bar “high-level radioactive waste” from being stored at the demonstration project site after the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminates the project’s operating license, but it does not include details about where waste would eventually end up.

It’s supported by members of the Morrow and Umatilla county commissions.

“I’m very excited that someone else is willing to take on the experiment risk, and they’re close enough that we can, hopefully if it goes well, benefit from it,” Morrow County Commissioner Jeff Wenholz recently told Elkhorn Media Group.

Across the river

Cathy Sampson-Kruse, 71, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, grew up in Umatilla County and went to high school in Echo. She said her family members that still live there do not support the bills.

“We have to ask ourselves, really, who is this supply for?” Sampson-Kruse said. “And what is it really taking away from generations of children that do not have a say in this — just like we’re going to have generations of children that are going to deal with the Hanford debacle.”

The problem with where to put nuclear waste continues to plague the Hanford Site across the Columbia River north of Richland, Washington, where the Washington Department of Ecology, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to figure out how to move 56 million gallons of radioactive sludge. The sludge is a byproduct of World War II-era plutonium production that still sits 80 years later in 177 underground tanks, some of which are leaking.

The agencies are hoping to move at least 2,000 gallons of that sludge via rail or truck through Oregon to facilities in Utah and Texas that can process it into a grout cement and dispose of it. The proposal doesn’t yet detail a route, but critics have said it would most likely end up on major interstate highways through Oregon, or on a rail line through central Oregon along the Deschutes River, passing near areas like Bend and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek is opposed to the plan as proposed by the agencies.

House Bill 2410 is not the first time state or federal governments have proposed sacrificing the health of the environment for industry when it comes to power in the Northwest, Sampson-Kruse said. She was a child when the Dalles Dam was constructed, flooding the Celilo Falls where Northwest tribes traditionally fished.

“Now, one of our most beloved natural foods, the salmon, is on the list for extinction. It constantly begs the question, how much more? Where do we draw the line?” Sampson-Kruse said.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC09305-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 18:09:50.200202

DENVER — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced on May 16, 2025, that seven recipients across Colorado have been selected to receive over $11.6 million in Brownfields Grants to assess, clean up and revitalize local lands.

“This Brownfields grant funding is a smart investment in Colorado's future - cleaning up historic contamination while laying the groundwork for economic growth,” said EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western. “By empowering communities to turn abandoned properties into productive assets, we're strengthening local economies and ensuring clean land for generations to come.”

“Contamination at sites in our communities threatens public health and inhibits the use of those sites for productive use,” said U.S. Senator Michael Bennet. “This funding will help Colorado communities safely clean up polluted properties, protect their health, and rebuild in a way that creates jobs and economic opportunity.”

“Cleaning up contaminated properties reduces the environmental and health risks for the community and opens the door for new economic development,” said U.S. Senator John Hickenlooper. “This funding will help us safely clean up these sites and recharge the surrounding communities.”

“Redevelopment of Brownfields properties is often an insurmountable challenge for many communities, which may lack the resources to assess and clean up these contaminated properties,” said Tracie White, CDPHE Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division Director. “For this reason, CDPHE is thrilled that so many Colorado communities are receiving support from the EPA to clean up and redevelop their Brownfields properties. The Brownfields grant support provided by the EPA is instrumental in supporting community revitalization efforts, not only in Colorado but across the country. The award of EPA Brownfields funds is an exciting opportunity for the recipient communities, allowing them to return blighted properties to productive use and provide community benefits. CDPHE is excited to continue our partnership with EPA Region 8 and Colorado communities to facilitate Brownfields redevelopment across Colorado.”

These grants are part of $267 million in Brownfields Grants nationally announced by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. This funding put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

The following recipients in Colorado were selected to receive grant funding for Brownfields cleanup projects:

City of Canon City - $1,533,000 Cleanup Grant: Funding will be used to clean up a property that used to be a dry-cleaning business and is contaminated with tetrachloroethylene. Grant funds will also clean up a previous steel manufacturing site that is contaminated with heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

City of Cortez - $500,000 Cleanup Grant: Funding will be used to clean up the Cortez Municipal Airport, where three unused buildings on the property are contaminated with asbestos, lead-based paint and petroleum.

City of Fountain - $1,924,580 Cleanup Grant: Funds will be used to complete asbestos abatement from a vacant property that will pave the way for safe demolition and redevelopment that meets community needs.

Jaffa Opera House Foundation - $1,897,300 Cleanup Grant: Grant funds will be used to remediate asbestos contamination from the historic Jaffa Opera House in Trinidad. The Jaffa Opera House Foundation plans to revitalize the building and offer a mixed-use space on what is currently a vacant site.

City of Lamar - $764,838 Cleanup Grant: Grant funding will be used to clean up asbestos contamination from a vacant commercial building in downtown Lamar, redeveloping the property into a mixed-use site. Funding will also be used to complete asbestos abatement at a historic warehouse property.

Volunteers of America National Services - $4,000,000 Cleanup Grant: Grant funds will be used to clean up asbestos contamination at the Sunset Park Apartments located in downtown Denver. The reuse strategy is to preserve and upgrade the apartment’s current units, enhancing safety and modernizing the building’s energy efficiency systems.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment - $1,000,000 Revolving Loan Fund (RLF): Funding will be used to provide up to three loans and one subgrant to support cleanup activities through CDPHE’s RLF program.

(The Sunset Park Apartments Brownfields site located in downtown Denver.)

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in Colorado have used previous EPA grants to assess, clean up and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfields Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, Brownfields investments leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

President Trump’s budget is a blueprint for disaster. Trump doesn’t believe in government, and his budget continues his relentless assault on the federal agencies whose mission it is to protect the health and well-being of the American people.

This budget would cut funding for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by 55 percent – the largest cut in EPA’s history. This proposed cut would seriously threaten public health and the environment. It also fails to deliver on many of the promises the Trump Administration has made on dangerous toxins like lead and PFAS and prioritizes polluters over public health and the environment. While we only have the skinny budget to review at this stage, it does not give me confidence that anything more comprehensive will tell a different story.

The budget calls categorical grants to states a “crutch,” flying in the face of the cooperative federalism that has made EPA so successful in cleaning up toxic pollution and providing healthier futures for Americans. EPA is deserting the states to deal with serious climate and pollution issues on their own, while EPA focuses on giving polluters free passes to poison our communities with reckless abandon.

The skinny budget outlines major cuts to historically bipartisan programs that provide a lifeline to communities across the nation. It cuts $250 million from the Superfund program – undermining our ability to clean up toxic waste sites throughout the nation. It also seeks to decimate the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds, which are the primary funding sources for water infrastructure projects. These state revolving funds are critical to ensuring communities have safe, reliable drinking water and wastewater services. This comes after EPA recently announced plans to rescind and delay the historic PFAS drinking water standard, raising serious questions about the Trump Administration’s commitment to safe, clean, and affordable water for all.

EPA is also walking away from its commitments by canceling competitively awarded grants where work is already underway in communities across the country with little or no explanation.

I remain outraged by Administrator Zeldin’s illegal freeze of obligated funds under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This fund is meant to make energy more affordable, foster economic development, boost supply chains, and create good-paying jobs – all the things that this Administration says it supports. Yet, the Administrator has engaged in a smear campaign where he is spreading false and misleading statements about the program in an attempt to undermine it and strip away these funds. I firmly believe the Administrator’s actions are a violation of the law, and I am hopeful that these funds will be released soon so that our communities can benefit from these investments.

It is clear to me that under Administrator Zeldin’s leadership, EPA is becoming an unreliable partner and illegally withholding congressionally directed funds.

I am also concerned about troubling activities that will endanger the health and safety of American families, children, and workers. The Trump Administration has made it clear that EPA cares more about polluters’ bottom line than the communities and American children who will bear the brunt of these fool hearty decisions. What is potentially most egregious is the attempt to roll back EPA’s landmark Endangerment Finding. It’s absolutely shocking that anyone in the year 2025 could look around and honestly say that climate change is not already harming Americans.

I’m also troubled by EPA’s recent reorganization plan. The effectiveness of the agency hinges on EPA having the career staff necessary to fulfill its mission. They are the backbone of the agency. Unfortunately, Administrator Zeldin’s actions to indiscriminately fire hundreds of employees with plans to relieve thousands more show a blatant disregard for the critical work career staff conduct on behalf of the American people every day. He continues to disingenuously claim to be fighting government waste, while simultaneously eviscerating EPA’s ability to appropriately manage programs and oversee issued grants.

Finally, Administrator Zeldin is thumbing his nose at Congress’ ability to conduct important oversight of this Administration. Committee Democrats have sent several letters to the Administrator demanding answers about certain actions he’s taken. We have received very few answers – some coming late yesterday. This is unacceptable. The Energy and Commerce Committee is your authorizer, and we are tasked with conducting oversight. As Administrator of EPA, you don’t just owe Congress an explanation, but also the American people.

And with that I yield back the balance of my time.

Alabama Power also relies on a faulty groundwater monitoring system that does not adequately measure how the coal ash is contaminating groundwater.
Catastrophic coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and on the Dan River in North Carolina and Virginia show that health, environmental, and economic impacts of an unthinkable coal ash tragedy take decades to recover from.
“Other utilities across the South are cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps and moving waste to safer storage away from our waterways.
In Virginia, Dominion Energy is excavating all its unlined coal ash impoundments, and Appalachian Power is excavating its sole open coal ash impoundment.","GADSDEN, Ala. — On behalf of Coosa Riverkeeper, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) put Alabama Power Company on notice that the Riverkeeper intends to sue the utility to stop ongoing groundwater pollution from Alabama Power’s failed closure of its leaking toxic coal ash lagoon at the former Gadsden Steam Plant. This ongoing pollution has continued for years after the lagoon was capped, in violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule, which regulate coal ash disposal.

Coal ash is the byproduct of burning coal for energy generation. Alabama Power chose to store nearly 1.5 million tons of toxic coal ash created at Plant Gadsden in an unlined pit, in the floodplain, on the banks of Neely Henry Lake and the Coosa River. Alabama Power “capped” the pond in an unlined leaking pit, but the company’s own reports show the ash underneath remains in contact with groundwater—in fact, nearly 40% of the ash remains saturated in water. As recently as October 2024, Alabama Power reported levels of arsenic forty times the legal standard in groundwater. This shows that Alabama Power’s preferred method of burying its toxic coal ash does not protect important groundwater resources. Alabama Power also relies on a faulty groundwater monitoring system that does not adequately measure how the coal ash is contaminating groundwater. These are clear violations of national coal ash disposal standards.

The notice was sent to Alabama Power, the Environmental Protection Agency, and Alabama state officials. Alabama Power has 60 days to correct its violations of coal ash storage standards. If the company does not eliminate those violations, SELC may file suit on behalf of Coosa Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court to require compliance with the rule.

“The stacks at Plant Gadsden may be gone, but Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution remains,” said Justinn Overton, Executive Director and Riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper. “Alabama Power cannot knowingly leave a leaking coal ash pond in place upstream from Gadsden’s drinking water intake and booming ecotourism developments and call themselves good neighbors. Coosa Riverkeeper has been saying this has been a problem for years, even before the pond was closed. It’s time for Alabama Power to do the right thing and move their ash.”

This is not just a threat to health and the environment, but to the local economy. The coal ash pond is less than a mile upstream from a drinking water intake for the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board that provides drinking water to over 14,000 customers. Neely Henry Lake’s estimated economic impact for the region was up to $570 million in 2017. Catastrophic coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and on the Dan River in North Carolina and Virginia show that health, environmental, and economic impacts of an unthinkable coal ash tragedy take decades to recover from.

“Alabama Power has zero excuses for leaving its leaking waste dump in the middle of the commercial riverfront area of Gadsden and exposing the community to this hazard,” said Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office. “Other utilities across the South are cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps and moving waste to safer storage away from our waterways. Alabama Power must do the same in Gadsden.”

Coal ash contains dangerous heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which are known to cause cancer and other serious illnesses, according to the EPA.

Utilities across the Southeast have moved more than a quarter of a billion tons of toxic coal ash to safe, dry, lined landfills, or they are recycling ash into cement and concrete. Every unlined pond in North and South Carolina has been excavated or is being excavated, including Duke Energy who is excavating more than 145 million tons. In Virginia, Dominion Energy is excavating all its unlined coal ash impoundments, and Appalachian Power is excavating its sole open coal ash impoundment. The Tennessee Valley Authority is excavating 12 million tons of coal ash. Alabama Power’s sister company, Georgia Power, is excavating half of the coal ash it has stored in unlined ponds, and in May 2024 submitted plans to excavate another 16 million tons.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SELC_Logo_Horizontal_Social.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:08:53.557851

Tonko, Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, today questioned Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin during an Environment Subcommittee hearing on the EPA’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget.

Listen to Rep. Tonko’s opening remarks HERE and see below as prepared for delivery.

President Trump’s Fiscal Year 2026 budget request for EPA has been called “problematic,” “an unserious proposal,” and “maybe a bridge too far to be achievable.”

These were the reactions of Republican Appropriators last week, and I expect you will hear even less charitable reviews from Democrats on this Subcommittee today.

This proposal includes a 55% reduction from FY25 levels, resulting in agency funding levels not seen since the mid-1980s.

If enacted, this would fundamentally dismantle the EPA as we know it and cripple the agency's ability to carry out its core mission of protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink.

The request includes devastating cuts that will undermine states’ efforts to protect public health and carry out their obligations, including a $2.46 billion reduction to the State Revolving Funds for water infrastructure and a $1 billion reduction for categorical grants, which are critical to supporting staffing of state environmental agencies.

I believe this is part of a disturbing trend we are seeing to force more costs onto state governments, as is being done with the proposed cuts to Medicaid in the majority’s reconciliation bill.

Similar to these funding cuts, earlier this year the Administration expressed a desire to reduce EPA staffing levels by 65%, which would return the agency to 1971 personnel levels — the agency’s second year in existence.

It is not credible to suggest that the agency can fulfill its statutory requirements — including all the major environmental laws and amendments to those laws that have been enacted since the 1970s — with these proposed staffing levels.

Cuts of this magnitude would not only hollow out the agency’s expertise and capacity, but they are insensitive to the public servants who have dedicated their lives to supporting the agency’s mission.

And it is worth reminding everyone of what that mission is: To protect human health and the environment.

In just a few short months, I believe the agency, under Administrator Zeldin’s leadership, has lost sight of this mission.

Mr. Zeldin launched the “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative focused on American energy, auto manufacturing, and artificial intelligence dominance.

And broadly speaking, I am not necessarily opposed to aspects of that agenda, but I also do not believe it is the appropriate role for our nation’s environmental regulator to be leading this effort.

Because EPA’s contributions to those goals more or less translate to how can we reduce environmental protections and enforcements of those protections for the benefit of energy producers, the auto industry, and Big Tech, even if ordinary Americans will pay the price by breathing harmful air pollution, drinking contaminated water, and being exposed to dangerous chemicals.

We have already seen a slew of agency actions that will result in greater pollution and reduce our scientific capacity to understand how that pollution will impact Americans’ health and well-being.

This includes reconsidering rules that protect Americans from pollution from power plants, vehicles, and industrial facilities, and weakening standards to keep PFAS out of our drinking water.

Each of these public health protections up for reconsideration went through robust rulemaking processes and economic analyses, which found that every one of these rules delivers greater benefits to the American people, in public health and economic benefits, than they cost.

I am also concerned by EPA’s efforts to terminate previously awarded grants without producing any evidence of fraud, waste, or abuse.

For each of those awards, the previous administration carried out competitive selection processes based upon requirements enacted by Congress.

Whether or not Administrator Zeldin personally believes Congress was wasting taxpayer dollars when it directed EPA to carry out those funding opportunities is irrelevant.

No Administrator should be the sole arbitrator of what is a good use of Congressionally-directed taxpayer dollars, and yet we have seen billions of dollars impounded without justification.

Finally, I am very concerned by reports that EPA is planning to eliminate the Energy Star program, which is a voluntary, non-regulatory labeling program with strong support from industry and consumers.

Energy Star has been incredibly effective at supporting American manufacturing, enabling people to lower energy bills, and reducing strain on our electricity system.

This seems obviously in line with the President’s energy and economic agenda, and yet, there may be an effort underway to terminate the program.

If we cannot even find common ground on a broadly popular, voluntary, low-cost program to benefit consumers, I have serious doubts that we will be able to find anything to agree upon this year.",https://tonko.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/HighResolution/b28a80e3-b4a9-45ee-9de0-b2c6a0f6396e.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:08:56.341733

(March 19, 2025) – The City of Rensselaer recently learned it is one of ten communities in New York State to receive a Brownfield Assessment and Clean Up Grant from the US Environmental Protection Agency. ""The brownfield grants are essential for New York, allowing us to transform neglected sites into thriving community assets that instill pride and drive economic growth,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By investing in these revitalization efforts, we not only protect our environment but also create job opportunities and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers.""

The City of Rensselaer, NY has been selected to receive $300,000 to conduct eight environmental site assessments to help prioritize polluted sites, develop four cleanup plans, and support reuse planning and community engagement. The target area includes the downtown and commercial corridor, waterfront areas, and properties near the Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak Station. This mixed-use redevelopment zone focuses on revitalizing underutilized properties for residential, commercial, and recreational uses. Located within the Hudson River floodplain, the area also presents unique flood risks and challenges that require robust planning to incorporate climate resilience into redevelopment initiatives.

The reuse strategy for priority sites supports the goals of the “Rensselaer Rising” initiative, which was developed through a Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) study that relied on significant public input and coordination between City Administration and the Common Council. “Rensselaer Rising” strives to create a livable, vibrant, and sustainable urban environment that capitalizes on Rensselaer’s assets. These assets include a vibrant waterfront with phenomenal views of the Albany Skyline; a rich history that begins in the colonial era, includes significant industrial activities, maritime trade and railroad travel; and an integrated multi-modal transportation infrastructure.

The planned redevelopment of priority sites follows the BOA study’s recommendations for public-private partnerships and environmentally sustainable land use, aligning closely with Rensselaer’s long-term vision for economic and community growth that capitalizes on its prominent location within the Capital Region and the 800,000+ travelers that come through Rensselaer each year via the Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak Train Station.

""The City of Rensselaer is grateful to the US EPA for providing us with this assistance. This initiative will provide new opportunities for residential, commercial, and recreational spaces by remediating brownfield sites, particularly in our downtown and waterfront areas,"" said Michael Stammel, Mayor of Rensselaer.

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments leveraged more than $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 220,500 jobs.

The reporting rule also applies to importers of articles containing PFAS, which could include many consumer, industrial, and commercial products.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced significant changes coming for two of its major rules that regulate per- and-polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). First, EPA announced on May 12, 2025, that it is delaying the reporting period for the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule and is also considering reopening the entire rule to make substantive revisions. Second, on May 14, 2025, EPA also announced that it plans to withdraw its drinking water standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) for four of the six PFAS that EPA sought to regulate.

These announcements are consistent with EPA’s strategic plan released on April 28 to address PFAS across all program offices (see a previous blog post). These actions signal that EPA is taking steps to provide regulated entities more flexibility and much needed relief from overly burdensome requirements pertaining to PFAS.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

EPA released an interim final rule that extends the reporting period for the TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule by nine months. The prior reporting period would have begun on July 11, 2025 and closed on January 11, 2026, with a longer deadline of July 11, 2026, for small article importers. The new reporting period will now run from April 13, 2026, to October 13, 2026, with a deadline of April 13, 2027, for small article importers. The interim rule became effective on May 13, 2025. EPA is accepting comments on the interim final rule until June 12, 2025, on the topic of the reporting period only. After receiving comments, EPA may decide to reopen the rule again and make changes to the reporting period.

The reason for the delay is that EPA needs more time to prepare and beta test the reporting software being developed to collect information that companies will be submitting in response to the reporting rule. EPA believes additional time will also be necessary to take advantage of recently appropriated funds from Congress ($17 million) to improve functionality of the reporting application.

Notably, EPA is also considering reopening certain yet unidentified aspects of the rule for public comment. Stakeholders have been calling for revisions to the PFAS Reporting Rule for years because the rule is one of the most expansive TSCA reporting rules promulgated by EPA. The rule imposes detailed reporting requirements on entities that have manufactured or imported PFAS at any time from January 1, 2011 until December 31, 2022. The reporting rule also applies to importers of articles containing PFAS, which could include many consumer, industrial, and commercial products. The rule does not have any traditional TSCA reporting exclusions such as PFAS that are impurities, byproducts, used in commercial research and development (R&D), or only produced or imported in low volumes (see the previous blog post about the rule for more details). EPA also imposes a complex and highly subjective standard of diligence that companies must consider when gathering PFAS data from their own records and from their supply chains.

While EPA did not indicate what changes it plans to make, its April 28 announcement about PFAS suggests that it may consider easing requirements for small businesses or companies that import articles.

SDWA Drinking Water Standards

EPA also announced that it plans to maintain the national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWRs) promulgated by the prior administration for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), two of the most well known PFAS. The maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) established for PFOA and PFOS, which are legally enforceable levels that are allowed in drinking water, will continue to be 4 parts per trillion (ppt). See our previous blog post for more information on the final rule.

Though it is maintaining the MCLs, EPA intends to propose a rule this fall to extend compliance deadlines for PFOA and PFOS to 2031, establish a federal exemption framework, and initiate outreach to water systems through its new PFAS OUTreach Initiative (PFAS OUT). EPA states that these steps will address the most significant compliance challenges EPA has heard from public water systems, members of Congress, and other stakeholders.

By contrast, EPA will rescind regulations setting MCLs and reconsider the regulatory determinations for four other PFAS that were included in the rulemaking: perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS). EPA seeks this rescission to “ensure that the determinations and any resulting drinking water regulations follow the legal process laid out in [SDWA].”

This announcement is in response to a court-ordered deadline for EPA to indicate its plans for the NPDWRs that are currently being challenged in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (American Water Works Association (AWWA), et al. v. EPA). EPA intends to support the US Department of Justice in defending any ongoing legal challenges to the NPDWRs for PFOA and PFOS.",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1747764306/201401.webp,N,,2025-05-20 14:10:04.868280

“After four years of economically disastrous, legally questionable, and expensive policies of the Biden-Harris Administration, it is a welcome sight to see President Trump and Administrator Zeldin focused on rebuilding the American economy and fixing the problems of the previous administration.

“I remember when Administrator Zeldin was in the House, representing the eastern part of Long Island, he was willing to work across the aisle in a pragmatic way to try and address environmental issues like protecting the Long Island sound or addressing emerging contaminants like PFAS.

“It is great to see him bringing these same problem-solving skills to EPA, and to be frank, there are a lot of problems there to solve.

“I’m pleased to see that the Administrator recognizes that there is a middle ground to tread, where environmental protection does not need to come at the expense of good jobs and a strong economy.

“I know that the Administrator is already working to closely examine the previous EPA’s spending spree on Green New Deal-style programs that provided unprecedented levels of taxpayer funds to environmental groups and consultants and to undo burdensome regulations that increased energy costs and made it more difficult to make things in America.

“The reconciliation bill passed out of this Committee last week is an important step in saving taxpayer money and redirecting EPA to focus on its core mission of cleaning up the environment and protecting human health.

“In February, Administrator Zeldin announced the broad pillars that the Agency will focus on under his “Powering the Great American Comeback” plan.

“In March, Administrator Zeldin announced 31 regulatory actions to support greater energy production, a more robust auto manufacturing sector, a more predictable permitting process, and a more state-based enforcement system.

“I’m glad to see that EPA is taking another look at a lot of the rulemakings from the last Administration, particularly those regarding air pollution.

“As many of those rulemakings didn’t take into account industry’s ability to meet compliance timelines or which pollution mitigation technologies were able to be installed.

“EPA has a duty to enforce the statutes that Congress passed, though I do believe encouraging co-operative compliance with industry will lead to better environmental outcomes and less economic disruption.

“In recent years, EPA’s budget has been about $10 billion per year.

“However, under the so-called Inflation Reduction Act EPA received an astounding $41.5 billion, or more than four times its historical budget, to spend on electric vehicles, environmental justice, and renewable energy programs.

“From its founding and up until the past few years, EPA mostly operated as a scientific investigator and regulatory agency, and with the exception of the water infrastructure and Superfund programs, it did not administer lots of large grants.

“President Trump’s proposed budget would reduce EPA spending to a more sustainable level after years of out-of-control spending on programs and rules that bore little relation to EPA’s traditional mission of regulating pollution, setting science-based standards for potentially hazardous substances, and cleaning up waste sites.

“It seems that the goals of EPA in the last few years were an attempt to force a change that Americans are not buying.

“I look forward to hearing more details from Administrator Zeldin about the reorganization and reform efforts he is making at EPA.

“The Environment Subcommittee stands ready to work with you, Administrator Zeldin, to help get EPA back on track.

“At this Subcommittee’s first hearing of the Congress, we examined the implementation of the 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act, often referred to as the TOS-CA law.

“We heard how the process for reviewing new and existing chemicals are in need of reform, particularly the ways in which EPA evaluates potential chemical risks.

“We also held a hearing in March on ways to maximize brownfield cleanups to support economic development.

“As we work on brownfield reauthorization, I hope to collaborate with EPA on ways to possibly setup some sort of pre-clearance permitting pilot program.

“Our national security, our economic competitiveness, the health of our families, and strength of our communities all depend on an EPA that is working hard and efficiently for the American people.

“Thank you again for appearing before us today, Administrator Zeldin, I look forward to your testimony.”

This funding, provided through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), will enhance Louisville’s ability to clean up contaminated properties and transform blighted sites into productive, sustainable spaces.

“We are excited to receive these federal grants, which will allow us to continue addressing environmental challenges and drive reinvestment in our communities,” said Mayor Greenberg. “By revitalizing brownfield sites, we are not only improving public health and environmental conditions but also paving the way for new economic opportunities.”

The first award, a $750,000 supplemental grant, will strengthen Louisville’s existing revolving loan fund. These funds can be used for programmatic expenses and to create additional and larger cleanup loans for eligible recipients. Louisville qualified for this funding due to its demonstrated success in managing a high-performing revolving loan program and maintaining a robust pipeline of potential projects.

Additionally, Louisville Metro Government was awarded an additional $2 million joint application Community-wide Coalition Assessment Grant with the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection and Russell: A Place of Promise. Funding from this grant will enable Louisville Metro Government to conduct environmental site assessments on properties within the Russell neighborhood, a priority focus area for concerted efforts to counter decades of disinvestment. The allocation of funds to Louisville Metro will be determined collaboratively with the State as the coalition develops a workplan, which must be approved by the EPA before any funds are expended.

Projected to contribute $86 billion to GDP annually and support over 575,000 jobs by 2030

Investments are concentrated in rural communities and 73% of active facilities are in Republican states

PHOENIX, AZ, May 20, 2025 – Today at CLEANPOWER 2025, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) released its State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report, showing a significant and sustainable ripple effect across states and economic sectors. The clean power manufacturing sector currently contributes $18 billion to U.S. GDP annually, spurs $33 billion in domestic spending annually, and supports 122,000 American jobs across the country.

If all announced manufacturing facilities become operational, clean power manufacturing is projected to support over 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to GDP by 2030.

“Surging clean energy deployment is creating new manufacturing facilities across the country. This success will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and revitalize American communities if policy leaders place economic progress over partisan division,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP. “Today’s report shows that the manufacturing activities across the clean energy sector drive a ripple effect of economic growth that extends far beyond factory walls, reaching every corner of the country. Reshoring this critical supply chain requires a shared commitment by both industry and policymakers to prioritize domestic economic growth and global competitiveness.”

Clean Power Manufacturing Driving U.S. Economic Boom

The report illustrates how the industry has laid the groundwork for a secure domestic supply chain, revitalizing manufacturing communities and driving American competition on the global stage.

Over 800 manufacturing plants currently contributing to the U.S. clean energy supply chain, with at least one in every state.

200 existing manufacturing facilities are actively building primary clean power components across 38 states to supply the booming demand for new energy in America.

Creating Generational Opportunities for Local Communities

New data highlights how clean power manufacturing is creating generational opportunities at the local level, providing opportunities across skillsets, industries, and generating wages well above the national average.

Clean energy manufacturing is booming in regions across the country, such as the Southeast, Midwest, and in states like Texas.

The clean energy manufacturing workforce made on average $42,000 more than the average worker in the U.S. economy in 2024.

These manufacturing jobs also generate additional employment across the economy: Upstream supply chain jobs paid an average of $75,000, while downstream jobs supported by household spending—such as those in retail, food service, and hospitality—averaged about $52,000.

Driving US Competitiveness and Global Leadership

The industry’s investments are critical to international competitiveness and innovation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader and strengthening our energy security.

America’s power needs are growing fast—projected to rise 35–50% by 2040—as data centers expand, domestic manufacturing rebounds, and our transportation and buildings electrify.

Energy manufacturing processes are considerably complex and capital intensive, often requiring multiple intricate steps, specialized equipment, and expertise. This intricacy often comes with trade exposure or a series of imports and exports before the final energy component is ready for installation.

A resilient, American-made supply chain for clean energy technologies makes the economy stronger, the country’s energy more secure, and serves as the foundation for innovation and growth.

The Path Forward

There are 200 manufacturing facilities in the pipeline representing over $150 billion of investment. If all announced facilities become operational by 2030, the impact could be transformative.

Clean power manufacturing could support over 575,000 jobs

Generate over $40 billion in earnings

Contribute $86 billion to the GDP

Add $164 billion in output to the economy annually

Employment from existing and planned facilities by 2030 by region is projected to be:

Northeast: 4,300+

Mid-Atlantic: 123,000+

South: 172,000+

Midwest: 86,000+

West: 173,000+

Policy and Business Certainty Critical to American Manufacturing Leadership

The report details how these economic and job benefits have largely been made possible because of federal clean energy tax credits enacted in 2022. The report calls on policymakers to build on this historic American manufacturing legacy with a suite of targeted policy tools to continue the momentum. They include:

Preserving energy tax credits (45X, 45Y, 48C, 48E)

Creating a stable and strategic trade environment

Facilitating a true all-of-the above energy strategy

Streamlining permitting to benefit American manufacturers and their customers

Ensuring critical minerals policy appropriately leverages demand from downstream domestic clean energy manufacturers.",https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-8.png,N,,2025-05-20 11:06:10.138663

WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, placed a hold on the four pending Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) nominees until Republicans stop their reckless attempts to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision regarding California’s clean air waivers that allow the state to implement more protective air quality standards.

The Trump-led EPA recently submitted three California waivers as “rules” to Congress — despite knowing full well that these waivers were not rules — in a cynical attempt to overturn the waivers with a 50-vote threshold under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The Senate Parliamentarian determined that any resolutions aimed at overturning California waivers would not be entitled to the CRA’s expedited procedures and would therefore require 60 votes to secure Senate passage. Reporting indicates that Senate Republicans may soon move forward to bypass the filibuster to rescind these waivers, which would require overruling the Parliamentarian.

Revoking California’s waivers would not only cause disastrous public health, environmental, and economic impacts, but would also mean Republicans took the “nuclear option,” undermining longstanding Senate procedures that could be applied to legislation far beyond the CRA and giving agencies significantly more control over the Senate floor.

“This objection is a direct result of the agency’s cynical attempt to weaponize the Congressional Review Act (CRA) by attempting to submit as ‘rules’ three waivers issued to the State of California under the Clean Air Act (CAA),” wrote Senator Padilla. “If this attempt is successful, the consequences will be far-reaching, not only for our clean energy economy, the air our children breathe, and for our climate, but for the future of the CRA and for the Senate as an institution.”

Padilla detailed the longstanding precedent making clear that EPA’s waivers are not rules subject to the Congressional Review Act. None of the more than 100 individual waivers or waiver-related decisions to California — under both Democratic and Republican Administrations — have ever been submitted as a rule since Congress granted the EPA this waiver authority in 1967 in bipartisan fashion. He also underscored the enormous stakes of overruling the Senate Parliamentarian, including for providing essential checks against executive branch agencies trying to exploit the CRA to enact their own agenda on matters that are not rules.

“Here, for the first time in the history of the CRA, an agency submitted matters that they knew were not rules. Some of my Republican colleagues are now arguing that the Parliamentarian should have no role to limit this partisan gamesmanship, and the Senate should throw out the rulebook and overturn the Parliamentarian,” continued Senator Padilla. “If the Trump EPA and Senate Republicans are successful at this ploy, the Senate will have no choice but to accept this as status quo in the future. This would grant agencies unchecked control over the Senate floor — an unprecedented encroachment by the executive branch into the Senate’s internal operations.”

Padilla laid out a list of potential actions that the Trump Administration could take to abuse the CRA, including revoking the broadcast licenses or other approvals for media outlets when they disagree with their news coverage; rescinding Food and Drug Administration approvals of vaccines, birth control, or mifepristone; or targeting the organizations of President Trump’s political opponents for retribution.

“None of these actions are rules, which is why they’ve never been submitted to Congress as rules. But if my Republican colleagues open this door and overturn the Parliamentarian’s wise safeguards on this type of abuse, there would be no practical limit, and the Senate could be forced to vote repeatedly on such matters that are clearly not ‘rules’ notwithstanding the plain language of the CRA,” added Senator Padilla.

By taking the nuclear option to overrule the Senate Parliamentarian, Padilla noted that a future Democratic Administration could target approvals for fossil fuel project leases, loan agreements, or permitting as well as for liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals. They could also use the CRA to try to reverse the Trump Administration’s actions on matters including immigration, foreign policy, and staffing cuts.

“Since this cynical attempt to weaponize the CRA was triggered by the administration’s political leadership at the EPA, at the urging of their Big Oil allies, I must object to proceeding to any nominations for the EPA pending on the Senate’s executive calendar,” concluded Senator Padilla. “I will continue to object until the agency withdraws its false submissions to Congress or the Majority Leader commits not to overturn the Parliamentarian’s determination on this matter.”

A Senate hold blocks unanimous consent to speed up consideration of a nomination and forces the body to spend time debating and voting on the nominee. The EPA nominees currently pending on the Senate floor include Deputy Administrator nominee David Fotouhi, Chief Financial Officer nominee Catherine Hanson, and Assistant Administrator nominees Jessica Kramer and Aaron Szabo.

Senator Padilla has been outspoken in pushing back against Republican attacks on California’s Clean Air Act waivers. Earlier this month, Senators Padilla, Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, took to the Senate floor to sound the alarm on Senate Republicans’ consideration of moving forward with their plan to revoke California’s Clean Air Act waivers. Padilla, Whitehouse, and U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also led Democratic Ranking Members in strongly warning Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) and Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) of the dangerous and irreparable consequences if Senate Republicans overrule the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision on California’s waivers.

Last month, Senators Padilla, Whitehouse, and Schiff welcomed the Senate Parliamentarian’s decision that the waivers are not subject to the CRA. Padilla also joined Whitehouse and Schiff in blasting Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s weaponization of the EPA after the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) similar finding.

There are over 800 manufacturing plants involved in the clean energy supply chain, with 200 facilities across 38 states producing primary components for wind, solar and storage technologies. Many of these jobs offer wages well above the national average. In 2024, clean energy manufacturing workers earned on average $42,000 more than the typical USA worker. Supply chain jobs averaged $75,000, and supporting service roles such as retail and hospitality paid around $52,000.

If all announced facilities in the pipeline become operational by 2030, clean power manufacturing could support over 575,000 jobs, generate $40 billion in earnings, contribute $86 billion to GDP, and add $164 billion in annual economic output. More than 200 new facilities are planned, representing $150 billion in future investment.

The clean power manufacturing sector currently contributes $18 billion to U.S. GDP annually, spurs $33 billion in domestic spending annually, and supports 122,000 American jobs across the country.

If all announced manufacturing facilities become operational, clean power manufacturing is projected to support over 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to GDP by 2030.

“Surging clean energy deployment is creating new manufacturing facilities across the country. This success will create hundreds of thousands of jobs and revitalize American communities if policy leaders place economic progress over partisan division,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP. “Today’s report shows that the manufacturing activities across the clean energy sector drive a ripple effect of economic growth that extends far beyond factory walls, reaching every corner of the country. Reshoring this critical supply chain requires a shared commitment by both industry and policymakers to prioritize domestic economic growth and global competitiveness.”

Clean Power Manufacturing Driving U.S. Economic Boom

The report illustrates how the industry has laid the groundwork for a secure domestic supply chain, revitalizing manufacturing communities and driving American competition on the global stage.

Over 800 manufacturing plants currently contributing to the U.S. clean energy supply chain, with at least one in every state.

200 existing manufacturing facilities are actively building primary clean power components across 38 states to supply the booming demand for new energy in America.

Creating Generational Opportunities for Local Communities

New data highlights how clean power manufacturing is creating generational opportunities at the local level, providing opportunities across skillsets, industries, and generating wages well above the national average.

Clean energy manufacturing is booming in regions across the country, such as the Southeast, Midwest, and in states like Texas.

The clean energy manufacturing workforce made on average $42,000 more than the average worker in the U.S. economy in 2024.

These manufacturing jobs also generate additional employment across the economy: Upstream supply chain jobs paid an average of $75,000, while downstream jobs supported by household spending—such as those in retail, food service, and hospitality—averaged about $52,000.

Driving US Competitiveness and Global Leadership

The industry’s investments are critical to international competitiveness and innovation, positioning the U.S. as a global leader and strengthening our energy security.

America’s power needs are growing fast—projected to rise 35–50% by 2040—as data centers expand, domestic manufacturing rebounds, and our transportation and buildings electrify.

Energy manufacturing processes are considerably complex and capital intensive, often requiring multiple intricate steps, specialized equipment, and expertise. This intricacy often comes with trade exposure or a series of imports and exports before the final energy component is ready for installation.

A resilient, American-made supply chain for clean energy technologies makes the economy stronger, the country’s energy more secure, and serves as the foundation for innovation and growth.

The Path Forward

There are 200 manufacturing facilities in the pipeline representing over $150 billion of investment. If all announced facilities become operational by 2030, the impact could be transformative.

Clean power manufacturing could support over 575,000 jobs

Generate over $40 billion in earnings

Contribute $86 billion to the GDP

Add $164 billion in output to the economy annually

Employment from existing and planned facilities by 2030 by region is projected to be:

Northeast: 4,300+

Mid-Atlantic: 123,000+

South: 172,000+

Midwest: 86,000+

West: 173,000+

Policy and Business Certainty Critical to American Manufacturing Leadership

The report details how these economic and job benefits have largely been made possible because of federal clean energy tax credits enacted in 2022. The report calls on policymakers to build on this historic American manufacturing legacy with a suite of targeted policy tools to continue the momentum. They include:

Preserving energy tax credits (45X, 45Y, 48C, 48E)

Solar, wind, and battery companies have announced plans to either create or expand 250 manufacturing facilities since August 2022. That’s when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), considered the biggest federal investment to date in climate and clean energy. If those projects are up and running by 2030, they would collectively create more than 575,000 jobs and contribute $86 billion annually to gross domestic product, according to a report published today by the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

Republican districts benefit the most from the IRA’s clean energy tax credits. But now, GOP lawmakers could take away those tax incentives if they follow through with President Donald Trump’s plan to pass a “big, beautiful” spending bill that would rollback what he calls a “green new scam.”

“Republican districts benefit the most from the IRA’s clean energy tax credits”

Red states are home to 73 percent of active facilities, according to the ACP. And already, solar, wind, and battery manufacturing supports 122,000 full-time jobs. Solar manufacturing employed the biggest share of Americans, some 75,400 people. Solar was the fastest-growing source of electricity in 2024, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration, accounting for 81 percent of added annual capacity. Costs for solar and wind have fallen dramatically for decades, with utility-scale solar now the cheapest source of electricity in most parts of the world.

Despite that growth, supply chains for solar energy have been concentrated in China and beset with concerns about forced labor and human rights violations, particularly in the Xinjiang region. The Inflation Reduction Act was meant to supercharge domestic manufacturing, largely through tax credits. And it was starting to pay off. Manufacturing capacity for solar modules grew 190 percent in the US last year, according to a separate report by the Solar Energy Industries Association and research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Those tax credits are now in the crosshairs of a Republican-controlled Congress trying to ram Trump’s agenda into a sweeping spending bill. A draft bill from the House Ways and Means committee last week proposes phasing out the advanced manufacturing tax credit (45x) and other tax incentives for renewables established in the IRA, and would add stipulations in the meantime that would make it difficult for projects to qualify for credits.

If those proposals are ultimately signed into law, the US clean energy industry will see job losses as factories shut down, MJ Shiao, ACP Vice President of Supply Chain and Manufacturing said during a press briefing last week.

“What we have seen from these texts from House Ways and Means, it basically goes too far, too fast,” Shiao said. “The manufacturers that were being supported by these incentives, and frankly, were trusting that the government was going to honor these incentives, you know, they’re getting the rug pulled out from under them.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/STK438_CLIMATE_CHANGE_I.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-05-20 10:08:06.693056

Abstract

In order to combat climate change many nations have committed to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions with the development of renewable energy key in meeting these objectives. At the same time these nations see the development of renewables as and opportunity to ‘reindustrialise for the 21st century’ with many placing emphasis on the reshoring of manufacturing via the onshoring of parts of the renewable energy supply chains, to increase economic benefits from green investment. While this is a goal for nations of all sizes, due to the specialities needed in the development technologies, in reality reshoring is much easier for larger nations. Smaller nations are limited by their economic structures and labour force. In this paper, using offshore wind in Northern Ireland as a case study, we investigate the issues around onshoring of renewables for small nations and regions. For this we use the particular case of Northern Ireland, a self-governing region of the UK; but the method we propose is general and could be carried out by decision makers in any small nation or region. We firstly carry out a structural analysis of the economy of Northern Ireland and identify synergies with the offshore wind supply chain, and then we model the economic impacts of onshoring key components of this supply chain. Overall, we find that there is the potential for sizeable economic benefits, in NI’s case mostly in the onshoring of foundations; but our results extend and in general many smaller regions will be able to identify their own specific opportunities in onshoring renewables manufacturing.

Last Updated on:

It’s been such a big part of the US Republican Party for so long that it’s hard to keep in mind how insane opposition to clean energy is. Solar and wind energy power millions of homes, and they provide hundreds of thousands of US jobs, and they don’t cause cancer, asthma, dementia, and a large variety of other health problems that coal and natural gas power plants cause. There’s real no good reason to oppose solar and wind energy. Yet, at the national level at least, Republicans have to — because fossil fuel companies pay too many of their bills and they’re not allowed to think for themselves.

Ironically, more and more, wind and solar power plants are being installed in “red states” — states where there are more Republican voters than Democratic voters. This makes it especially awkward and illogical to oppose renewable energy, and doing so can clearly hurt their states, and yet they continue to do so.

Now, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) shares the following via email: “Legislation passed last week by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee and advanced through the House Budget Committee could jeopardize nearly 300 American solar and storage factories and lead to the loss of 145,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of solar generation by 2030 — more than the annual electricity consumption of Pennsylvania.

“New analysis released today by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that the bill, if enacted without changes, could result in nearly 300,000 current and future American jobs to be lost, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing.

“Roughly 80% of all at-risk factories, jobs, and investments in the solar manufacturing sector are in states that voted for President Trump.”

Well, that’s making America great again, isn’t it?

It’s idiotic. It’s so full of idiocy that it makes my head burn. And it’s just a repeat of what we see time and time again — people voting for Republican politicians who get into office and then cause those same voters harm. They are talented at distracting and deflecting, getting people wound up about other matters that really don’t harm them, and somehow hiding the harmful work they do. And this is how we got here. Republican politicians, especially at the national level, have learned that they can pass laws that harm their constituents, but what they can’t do is upset their rich donors in the fossil fuel industry.

Naturally, SEIA is much more diplomatic about it all. “There is still time to improve this bill which, as written, represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “If this proposal becomes law, nearly 300 U.S. factories—mostly in red states—could close or never open, and we simply won’t have the energy we need to power American innovation in AI and data centers.” Ah, yes, common sense. If only we weren’t in dire deficiency of that. Better luck in four years.

SEIA notes that $220 billion in investments could be lost by 2030 of this bill becomes a law. But, hey, what’s $220 billion when you’re saving gazillions of imaginary dollars by firing the federal workers who keep our air and water clean, our airplane flights safe, and weather and climate data flowing?",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Capitol-Building-US-Congress-Zach-Shahan.jpeg,N,,2025-05-20 10:08:20.778060

The Reconciliation Bill presented by the US House Ways and Means Committee and advanced through the House Budget Committee could jeopardize nearly 300 US-based solar and energy storage factories and lead to the loss of 145,000 GWh of solar generation by 2030, according to the report.

Job creation has been strong since passage of the clean energy tax credits in 2022. By 2033, the SEIA expects the US solar manufacturing workforce to grow to 100,000, barring changes to tax credits. In the new report, the SEIA warns that if the bill is enacted as written, nearly 300,000 current and future jobs may be lost, including 86,000 in solar manufacturing.

Momentum

In 2017, at the start of President Trump’s first term in office, the United States ranked 14th in the world for solar manufacturing. Today it is the third largest solar manufacturing economy in the world. No longer reliant on solar modules from China and other nations, enough solar modules are now produced in the United States to serve the domestic market.

“There is still time to improve this bill which, as written, represents a crisis for America’s ability to build the energy infrastructure we need to meet surging demand,” said SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper. “If this proposal becomes law, nearly 300 US factories – mostly in red [Republican] states – could close or never open, and we simply won’t have the energy we need to power American innovation in AI [artificial intelligence] and data centers.”

The SEIA estimates that, if enacted, the bill could trigger an immediate decline in solar and energy storage investment that could amount to $220 billion in investment by 2030.

Load growth

A recent study conducted by PA Consulting, for the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), “A Reliable Grid for an Electric Future,” forecast a 300% rise in energy consumption by data centers alone.

An all-of-the above approach will be needed to add energy to the grid fast enough to meet demand. As shown in the chart below, solar and energy storage is the fastest energy to reach deployment.

If Congress cuts these incentives, the SEIA said energy production will fall 145 TWh and “America will not be able to meet demand, leading to blackouts and a surrender of the AI race.”

“Passing this bill would create a catastrophic energy shortfall, cede AI and tech leadership to China, and damage some of the most vital sectors of the US economy,” Hopper added. “But the story isn’t over. The Senate has the opportunity to put forward a more thoughtful and measured proposal that achieves President Trump’s American energy dominance vision.”

The SEIA is urging the industry to contact representatives to urge revisions to the legislation to protect jobs, keep manufacturing in America, and to promote the build out of solar and energy storage at a time when we need it most.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Solar-Bill-main.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 11:06:25.039173

2. DOE cancels $8 billion in loans, including transmission project, low-income rooftop solar program

The Department of Energy plans to cancel seven major loans and loan guarantees, including a New Jersey transmission project and a low-income rooftop solar program, Semafor reports, per a “former DOE official close to the process.” The programs had all been conditionally approved under Biden, and also included a low-carbon ammonia factory by Monolith Nebraska, as well as a battery factory, a plastics recycling facility, and two others that had already been canceled by their developers. In sum, the canceled financing amounts to nearly $8.5 billion — which admittedly isn’t much of the roughly $41 billion in Biden-era LPO agreements that were yet unfinalized when Trump took office. At the same time, “it’s revealing that the administration would let these projects — most of which are in sectors where the U.S. is already far behind China — fall by the wayside, rather than take steps to prop them up,” Semafor’s Tim McDonnell notes.

3. Reconciliation bill removes ‘pay-to-play’ for expedited pipeline permitting

A House Rules Committee document points to potential changes to the reconciliation bill as negotiations continue — including, perhaps, to permitting. The original bill stipulated that CO2, hydrogen, and petroleum pipelines could pay a $10 million fee to bypass the standard permitting process, a move that critics decried as a “pay-to-play privilege for gas pipelines.” Activists and Democrats had slammed the provision, with Evergreen Action arguing it “makes a farce of our permitting process and essentially legalizes corruption,” and that “Americans will be severely impacted by gas pipelines built through their communities.” But in the new version of the bill, the language describing the expedited pipeline permitting “is gone,” Notus writes.

There is still a long way to go in negotiations, as hardliners and moderates remain at odds. The Rules Committee’s vote on a final version of the reconciliation bill is scheduled for 1 a.m. Wednesday morning, in order to stay on track for a possible floor vote this week — although others are skeptical of the feasibility of that timeline.

4. Clean energy manufacturing could add 453,000 jobs by the end of the decade: report

Clean power manufacturing is expected to grow from supporting 122,000 American jobs today to more than 575,000 by 2030 if all announced manufacturing facilities become operational, a new report by the American Clean Power Association found. The report similarly expects the economic output generated by those facilities to grow from contributing $18 billion to the U.S. GDP today to $86 billion by the end of the decade. “Today’s report shows that the manufacturing activities across the clean energy sector drive a ripple effect of economic growth that extends far beyond factory walls, reaching every corner of the country,” Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP, said in a statement.

While clean energy manufacturing has taken a hit under the Trump administration, with more than $8 billion in projects canceled, closed, or downsized in the first quarter of 2025 due to concerns about access to Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and loan financing, as well as greater economic turbulence, ACP found that many investments are concentrated in rural areas and Republican states. With 200 manufacturing facilities in the pipeline, the report calls for preserving energy tax credits, “facilitating a true all-of-the-above energy strategy,” and creating “a stable and strategic trade environment,” among other policies.

5. Germany reverses position, will treat nuclear as on par with other renewables

Germany’s longtime opposition to treating nuclear power on par with renewables in EU energy policy appears to have ended. France, which gets about 70% of its power from atomic energy, had long pushed for broader adoption in Europe — and been stymied by Germany’s former chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who was skeptical of labeling atomic energy “green.” But the nation will pivot to join France under Germany’s new conservative chancellor, Friedrich Merz, leaving Austria as the last remaining holdout in the EU, Reuters reports. “When France and Germany agree, it is much easier for Europe to move forward,” Lars-Hendrik Röller, who served as chief economic adviser to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, told the Financial Times. The pivot is not just about meeting energy needs, however; as one German official also told FT, “We are now actually finally open to talk to France about nuclear deterrence for Europe. Better late than never.”

THE KICKER

“I only drained about 25 miles of range from the battery after powering my fridge and other devices for days.” —Scooter Doll, writing for Electrek about how he used his Rivian R1S as a backup energy source for three days after last week’s tornadoes knocked out his power.

Everything’s going to be okay, Crux’s co-founder CEO Alfred Johnson told me late last week. In fact, “the business is in great shape,” he said. I was a tad confused. But as Johnson reminded me, the company always planned on being more than a mere tax credit marketplace. The question is whether developers will buy into this vision of Crux as the everything store for project financing.

In March, right before the company announced its Series B, Crux launched a debt marketplace, where developers and manufacturers can access financial tools such as short-term bridge loans, construction financing, and flexible lines of credit to fund the buildout of renewables projects. “The market size for transferable credits is $30 billion per year, while the market size for project finance debt is more than seven-and-half times as big: $230 billion,” Johnson told me.

This new offering may have come just in the nick of time. It’s also likely just the first in a series of platform expansions, some of which are already in the works.

“There are many more multibillion-dollar markets among the thousands of developers, manufacturers, investors, and corporate buyers that make up the market for U.S. energy and manufacturing project finance,” Johnson told me. Playing in all those markets is a lofty goal for a company that was founded just two years ago, but so far Crux has been good at defying expectations. After all, it’s been profitable since its second year, Johnson told me, a rare and rapid rise for an early-stage startup.

Crux shared some exclusive numbers with me that illustrate some ways in which it’s starting to outgrow its roots. For one, Johnson told me that Crux’s revenue for the first one-and-a-half quarters of this year is nearly 10 times higher than for the same period last year. While he wouldn’t reveal what portion of that was comprised of tax credit deals versus debt financing deals, he did say that in the two months since the debt marketplace launched, “lenders have issued $1.3 billion of term sheets.” Those are nonbinding loan offers, $700 million of which have turned into actual deals so far. “It took more than a year for the tax credit market to reach similar throughput,"" Johnson said.

In the meantime, Crux is by no means giving up on the embattled transferable tax credit marketplace. The company sounded a relatively optimistic note last week as it published a list of takeaways from the Ways and Means Committee’s proposal, stating, “This is the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.” The company looks like it’s preparing to fight for that outcome, too, as a few months ago it hired new teams of tax lobbyists and brought on Hasan Nazar, former federal policy lead at Tesla, to direct these lobbying efforts.

Johnson said that the debut of Crux’s debt marketplace had developers, manufacturers, and investors rushing to its website in numbers not seen since the company launched. It logged more “inbound interest” on that one day in March than when it announced its Series A and its Series B — that is, more than on both of those days combined.

“We didn’t invest in Crux with the belief that this would be a transferable tax credit business forever,” David Haber, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, told me. The venture capital firm led the company’s $18.2 million Series A funding round. “We viewed that as a great wedge product to bootstrap a financial exchange that could help facilitate the types of financial products needed for this ecosystem,” he said. Clay Dumas of Lowercarbon Capital, which led Crux’s Series B, also saw the company as a so-called “wedge” into a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar opportunity to finance energy and advanced manufacturing through debt and a wide range of other products.”

Not all investors felt as confident that companies built around tax credit transferability could become a one-stop financing shop, however. As of now, most of Crux’s direct competitors — such as Basis Climate, Reunion Infrastructure, and Common Forge — haven’t expanded into other parts of the climate capital stack.

“We know the fundamental risk that a stroke of the pen can have in any of these sort of marketplaces,” Juan Muldoon, a partner at the climate software VC firm Energize Capital, told me. Thus far, Energize has not funded any tax credit-based marketplace, diligence platform, or underwriting tool. “We wanted to wait for signs of resilience and more complete platforms, more complete business models, versus solving for things that might be more transient in value,” Muldoon said. Last week’s committee proposals validate Energize’s core investment strategy, he added — supporting nimble software companies that can withstand political headwinds and change tacks quickly.

Crux certainly hopes that expanding into the debt market will put any fears of its potential transience to rest. After all, Johnson told me, “all parts of the capital stack are opaque, illiquid, bespoke and manual.” That includes not only transferable tax credits, but also debt and equity financing. “These are private transactions that require a ton of documentation, models, advisory lawyers. But it doesn't have to be as bad as it is,” he said.

But if the transferable tax credits do indeed disappear, many renewable energy developers may be forced to return to one of the most opaque funding mechanisms of all: tax equity financing, which Crux is not currently set up to facilitate. As my colleague Emily Pontecorvo recently explained, prior to the passage of the IRA, renewable energy developers who wanted to liquidate their tax credits had to partner with tax equity investors — usually banks — who would give them cash in exchange for an equity stake in their clean energy project and the benefits of their tax credits. But forming these types of partnerships is both legally complicated and costly, and thus not a viable option for many smaller developers.

Presumably, Crux could shake up and simplify this space, too. And while it’s made no official commitments to a tax equity product, the company’s website has been reconfigured to advertise it as the go-to platform to “source new opportunities for lending, equity, and tax credit transfers,” as it commits to “financing the future of energy.”

Crux has its work cut out for it, though, as often the more complex the financial transaction, the more customized it must be. “The competitors are offline advisors for the most part,” Haber told me. Thus, standardizing and digitizing as many esoteric and project specific elements of the capital stack as possible is going to be, as he put it, “their opportunity and their challenge.”

Johnson says Crux is up for it. “It’s never going to be, you know, one click buy it on Amazon. That’s a ridiculous and implausible concept for deals of this size and importance. But these negotiations and transactions can be so much better.” Efficiency, at the very least, seems to be something we can all get behind. So as the partisan fighting over tax credits and transferability commences and the clean energy incentives start to fall, maybe at least this one climate tech darling can weather the storm.

Earlier in the week, Climeworks, another major DAC hubs award winner, announced a reduction in force, due in part to “pending clarity for our next plant in the U.S.” Coupled with this news, a sensationalized exposé by Icelandic news outlet Heimildin detailed challenges with the first two Climeworks facilities, including commentary that called both the company and the technology a “scam” and the “Theranos of the energy industry.”

DAC has never been entirely welcome among climate advocates. To a certain extent, its critics are right: The process of pulling carbon directly out of the ambient air and storing it permanently underground is both energy- and capital-intensive, and it has obvious utility for the oil and gas industry, which has seized on DAC’s potential to erase past emissions as a way to argue that the transition away from fossil energy isn’t actually necessary.

But these critics start to lose the thread when they call the technology a “fig leaf” for oil and gas or an “expensive, dangerous distraction,” and most egregiously when they point to the lack of actual carbon dioxide removed using the technology as an argument against future deployments.

There is a scientific consensus behind the need for carbon dioxide removal that these critiques dance around. As the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lays out in its most recent scientific report, “CDR is required to limit warming to 1.5 [degrees Celsius],” and is “part of all modeled scenarios that limit warming to 2 [degrees] by 2100.” Even when critics recognize the need for permanent CDR, they frequently fail to provide any plausible pathway to gigaton scale. The fact is that DAC doesn’t have an established, liquid market, like electricity, steel, cement, or any other commodity. That any one DAC business is struggling as it attempts to scale is not an indictment of the company, but rather an illustration of the challenge it is taking on to commercialize a first-of-a-kind technologies that naturally has first-of-a-kind issues while also building a brand new market for the crucial climate service it provides. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.

The commercial model for the nascent CDR industry is largely the sale of carbon removal credits for delivery in future years. This isn’t unique to CDR — it’s even analogous to the power purchase agreements that scaled renewable energy. Futures contracts are standard practice, and certainly not indicative of a “scam.”

DAC’s high energy needs are frequently cited as a reason for concern among skeptics. As the Princeton Net Zero America study notes, however, the total energy needed to reduce emissions in a net-zero system without DAC increases because we would need more power to produce e-fuels. (Jesse Jenkins, one of the leaders of the Net Zero America study, is also a co-host of Heatmap’s Shift Key podcast.) This criticism also fails to take into account the reduction in energy intensity that companies are already achieving by various means. That group includes Climeworks, which has introduced more efficient sorbents; Heirloom, which is working on deploying passive mineralization; and Holocene, which was recently acquired by Oxy and employs the low regeneration temperature solvents.

The costs and efficiency of DAC today, just like the cost and efficiency of solar 20 years ago, are likely to improve significantly in the future as the technology and market become more efficient and reliable. Early DAC deployments may have a relatively high cost now, but even today, DAC is cost-competitive with emissions mitigation in aviation.

The industry currently stands at a precipice. Will DAC cross the chasm from pilot facilities to meaningful deployment? Or fall off the hype wagon into the dustbin of cool ideas that were always 10 years away? Beneath the innuendo and false claims, the reporting from Reykjavik shows what everyone in DAC knew — that it has a messy, non-linear path to scale. That does not disprove the argument that it is also a necessary technology that is not only valuable to remove emissions, but also is drawing billions in investment, and driving local economic development.

And there is plenty of good news. The XRG joint venture with Adnoc shows that a sophisticated strategic investor views American DAC as promising. (The local South Texas community is excited, too.) The Oxy Stratos facility in West Texas has already brought thousands of new construction jobs, and will bring hundreds of more permanent jobs to the heart of oil country — a new industry to make use of their unique and valuable skill sets. Project Bantam, a multi-modal operation that was the largest in the U.S. when it launched last summer, is operating in Oklahoma.

The Heimildin story was written to be a salacious takedown, and DAC opponents wasted no time in saying, “We told you so.” The issue with that reaction is the story isn’t unique to Climeworks, or even to DAC. The same story could have been written 20 years ago about solar and batteries. It could be written tomorrow about advanced geothermal or long-duration energy storage. It is the boring, mundane outcome of trying to build a difficult technology with the policy and business hand we are dealt.

The road to DAC at scale will be scattered with bumps, failed projects, and folded companies. We should be cheering these folks on, not taking shots from the cheap, increasingly warm seats.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81OTgwNjYwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQ3Mjc1Nn0.vfqr1uzX4ulM_uSBkkrgvJsN9jfuRvw0UzE29xz-H-s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:08.805416

The reason for the turnaround wasn’t immediately clear. In a statement, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal thanked President Donald Trump for “finding a solution that saves thousands of American jobs and provides for continued investments in energy infrastructure in the U.S.”

Empire Wind 1 is central to New York’s climate and energy plans. The $5 billion project would connect directly into New York City’s power grid, providing enough electricity to supply 500,000 homes. It has been the focus of an intense international lobbying effort in recent weeks. Opedal and Norwegian Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg met with White House officials to discuss the project last month.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement that “countess conversations with Equinor and White House officials” had yielded the deal.

“I want to thank President Trump for his willingness to work with me to save the 1,500 good paying union jobs that were on the line and helping get this essential project back on track,” Hochul said. “New York’s economic future is going to be powered by abundant, clean energy that helps our homes and businesses thrive. I fought to save clean energy jobs in New York — and we got it done.”

The move would amount to a stunning reversal for Trump, who has railed against offshore wind since returning to the White House. A White House spokesperson deferred comment to Interior, which could not immediately be reached for comment.

Hochul told Newsday that she held three conversations with Trump over the weekend, in which she pleaded with the president to save the project. The governor told the Long Island newspaper that she emphasized the 1,500 union laborers working on the project.

Trump has pushed for building new pipelines into New York. The governor did not mention pipelines directly in her statement but made an apparent reference to the issue, saying, “I also reaffirmed that New York will work with the Administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law. In order to ensure reliability and affordability for consumers, we will be working in earnest to deliver on these objectives.”

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum alluded to a pipeline deal in a post on X, which did not mention Empire Wind. “Energy Dominance is the foundation of America’s economic and national security,” he wrote. “I am encouraged by Governor Hochul’s comments about her willingness to move forward on critical pipeline capacity. Americans who live in New York and New England would see significant economic.”

Equinor secured a lease to build the wind farm south of Long Island in 2017. The Biden administration issued a final permit for the project in 2024. Equinor began work at a marine terminal in Brooklyn last summer. It had begun preparing to install the underwater foundations in March when, the following month, Burgum announced the stop work order. He cited a report from NOAA that he said showed Empire Wind 1’s approval had been rushed. He never released the report.

Equinor came close to walking away from the project, telling POLITICO’s E&E News on May 9 that it would be canceled if the stop work order was not lifted. Hochul told Newsday that she had pleaded with Equinor to give her a week to appeal to Trump directly to save the project. The Norwegian oil giant could yet walk away from the project. It said it would perform an updated assessment of the project’s economics in the second quarter.

“This project delivers on the energy ambitions shared by the United States and New York by providing a vital new source of power to the region,” said Molly Morris, president of Equinor Wind U.S. “Empire Wind brings supply chain investments in states across the nation including New York, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Texas and South Carolina.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/90/b5/94d62bdd431cb9b572f32427c473/trump-44163.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:43.742746

The company’s revenue declined 21% last year to $50 million, and it lost $138 million. LanzaTech is trying to cut expenses by $30 million a year, or about 20%.

Results continued to slide in the first quarter, with revenue declining in the mid-single digits, according to a securities filing in which LanzaTech said it would not file financial statements on time.

Company officials did not respond to a request for comment.

The 20-year-old company commercialized technology that uses bacteria to convert carbon-monoxide into ethanol and has been deployed around the globe with industrial companies that are seeking to reduce pollution.

Interest in climate-friendly technology soared during Joe Biden’s presidency and benefited from a massive boost in funding through the Inflation Reduction Act. But the Trump administration wants to undo those programs. Nearly $8 billion in clean-tech investment and 16 projects were canceled, closed or downsized in the first quarter, according to a report from E2.

Venture capital investment in the clean-tech sector worldwide dropped 45% during the past two years from a peak of $55.7 billion in 2022, according to Crunchbase data.

Despite these headwinds, LanzaTech said in a securities filing that it recently raised $40 million in a sale of preferred stock to an unnamed existing investor after LanzaTech’s largest shareholder, Carbon Direct Capital Management, made an unsolicited offer last month to take the company private for about $4 million. The company’s market capitalization is $59 million.

“Alongside the preferred stock issuance and related transactions, the company is continuing to implement strategic measures to scale its global business with greater cost efficiency to support its transition from a research and development-centric company to a commercially focused enterprise,” LanzaTech said in a securities filing May 7.

LanzaTech’s joint venture with clean-energy investor Brookfield Renewables, which has agreed to provide capital to projects that use the company’s technology, also should provide some breathing room.

“They have options,” says Thomas Meric, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. “The company is expecting to get through the challenges they have in front of them.”

LanzaTech, which trades at 26 cents per share, has proposed a reverse stock split to avoid being delisted from the Nasdaq.

The company went public two years ago in a SPAC, or a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company that raised money from investors for an unspecified transaction. Such blank-check offerings were hot a few years ago, but many have struggled to maintain their initial offering prices.

Dive Brief:

A group of Congressional Republicans are asking their party to further tweak proposed changes to clean energy tax credits that the House Ways and Means Committee included in its reconciliation bill text.

The proposed budget reconciliation bill would decrease the credits for a number of clean energy technologies after 2028 and phase them out entirely after 2031, as well as additional requirements to qualify for the credits and an early sunset for their transferability. Rep. Jen Kiggans, a Virginia Republican, led 13 other House members in a joint statement Wednesday seeking to extend the transferability mechanism through the phase-out period and make other changes.

The GOP tax bill, as currently constructed, passed the House Budget Committee late on Sunday, after the committee failed to clear the bill on Friday. However, as Kiggans and the other lawmakers seek changes to the bill to further protect the clean energy tax provisions, others in the party are looking to speed up the phaseout.

Dive Insight:

While the original Inflation Reduction Act had technology-neutral clean energy production and investment credits available until 2032, the House Ways and Means Committee’s bill text would move the sunset dates up and phase them out over a four-year period. Companies would be able to receive 80% of the credit values in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031, with the credits phasing out entirely in 2032. Another nuclear power production credit would be phased out on the same schedule.

Kiggans and her colleagues said they commended the committee “for including reasonable phase-out schedules” for the credits, but said in the May 14 joint statement that a few more changes are needed “to fully realize the intent of these phase-out schedules.”

“While many of these provisions reflect a commitment to American energy dominance through an all-of-the-above energy strategy, we must ensure certainty for current and future energy investments to meet the nation’s growing power demand and protect our constituents from higher energy costs,” the statement said.

Kiggins was joined on the statement by Reps. Andrew Garbarino, Mike Lawler and Nick LaLota of New York; Mark Amodei of Nevada; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania; Juan Ciscomani of Arizona; Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado; Dave Joyce of Ohio; Young Kim and David Valadao of California; and Dan Newhouse of Washington.

The members said retaining the transferability mechanism for the entirety of the credits’ lifecycle would provide companies “with the flexibility necessary to make long-term investments in American energy.”

In addition to extending the tax credit transferability mechanism through the entire phase-out period, the House lawmakers are also asking that adjustments be made to the “Foreign Entity of Concern provisions” and for a “placed in service” standard to be included in the proposed changes.

The foreign entity of concern provisions are “overly prescriptive,” according to the lawmakers, and “should be revised to allow companies additional time to reorganize their supply chains, ensuring a strategic and successful transition.” The “placed in service” provision, which adopts an Internal Revenue Service standard of preparedness for the credits, would require a project to be ready and available for use to qualify.

Kiggins and other moderate Republicans backing last week’s statement said the “placed in service” standard is misaligned with the phaseout schedule, and should be replaced in the text with a “start construction” standard. They said that adjustment “is essential to supporting the energy development needed to meet the growing power demand and protect thousands of high-quality American jobs in communities across the country.”

Clean energy developers and industry groups are “hoping that this draft isn’t the final text,” Robert Neifert, commercial and residential solar developer Solar Gain’s director for business development, said on a press call organized by Clean Energy for America last week.

“The way that the current rules are written with the placed in service rule … we're going to have to stop selling projects at the current tax rates in a year-and-a-half,” Neifert said.

Gilbert Campbell, founder and CEO of utility scale solar developer Volt Energy Utility, said on the May 13 call that the bill as written would lead to less private investment, increasing the price of building projects and leading to small businesses taking a “big hit.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mcX2Wcd05a1EileaQQSrCfEcbF8u4H7N39yugFqI2mg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODY1MjkwMTJfVFBrNm5uTy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-20 10:09:50.476433

According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.","Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates say a Republican plan in Congress to end or phase-out Biden-era clean energy tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs and force some companies to abandon projects.

The House Ways and Means Committee recently released an amendment to Congress’ budget reconciliation package that would rollback tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The move is part of a large package of tax cuts and program reductions promoted by the Trump administration.

Last week, labor groups and the liberal nonprofit Forward Together held an event to highlight the potential for job loss if the the funding is canceled, saying the cancellation of tax incentives would endanger ongoing projects in Wisconsin.

The IRA was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022. It included provisions to address climate change through incentives for the clean energy through extended and expanded tax credits.

Companies have announced plans to invest more than $840 billion in clean energy projects in the United States since the IRA was passed, but only $321 billion of that private investment had been spent through the first quarter of 2025. That’s according to a report released Tuesday from Clean Investment Monitor, a joint effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rhodium Group, a New York-based policy research company.

In Wisconsin, roughly $5.3 billion in total private investment had been announced with more than $2.9 billion spent since the IRA became law, according to a spreadsheet from Clean Investment Monitor.

There were 407 operational jobs and 4,109 construction jobs associated with completed facilities in Wisconsin, and another 175 operational and 2,511 construction jobs expected for announced facilities not yet online, according to the spreadsheet.

“Our members of Congress should be defending and fighting for these jobs and investments in their districts, not threatening them,” said Peter Drummond, executive director of Forward Together Wisconsin.

Electrical workers union leaders from Madison and Greenfield, as well as the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, said Wednesday the climate law led to a boom in clean energy deployment across the state.

They said the plan to gut the IRA’s incentives could result in job losses, creating economic instability for families across Wisconsin.

“This wouldn’t just be canceling clean energy projects,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council. “They’d be canceling opportunities for thousands of our members and undermining Wisconsin’s energy independence.”

But a March 2025 policy analysis from libertarian Cato Institute think tank estimates the energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act will cost between $936 billion and $2 trillion over the next decade, and between $2 trillion and $4.7 trillion by 2050.

“The IRA’s energy subsidies are multiple times larger than initial estimates, and they expose American taxpayers to potentially unlimited liability,” the report states.

The Republican proposal seeks to terminate or phase out a host of federal tax credits for things like electric vehicles, charging stations, residential clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades, utility-scale clean energy and renewable energy manufacturing, according to a preliminary analysis of the proposal by Rhodium Group.

“The impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022,” the analysis states.

The GOP budget reconciliation bill was blocked from advancing to the House floor Friday by hardline House Republicans on the House Budget Committee. According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.

One project in Wisconsin expected to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act is the construction of a new intermediate and middle school in Menasha, after the law allowed nonprofit and local governments to receive direct payments instead of tax credits.

Brian Adesso, director of Business Services for the Menasha Joint School District, said the district expects to receive a reimbursement of nearly $4 million for a rooftop solar, energy storage and geothermal system that are included in the project.

“Without the availability of these credits, we would not have had the certainty we needed to make these projects come to life,” he said. “That would be a huge loss for our district and our community.”

While advocates decry the effort to repeal some of the IRA’s incentives, federal Republicans have been critical of the law almost since its passage. Since 2023, they’ve argued that the law failed to reduce inflation.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, R-De Pere, defended the House GOP’s budget plan, saying it provides tax relief to working-class families.

“We’re committed to reversing the costly Green New Scam policies of the Biden Administration, which led to massive inflation and made life unaffordable for Wisconsinites,” he stated. “While Republicans are focused on lowering costs and supporting the working-class, Democrats continue to push for devastating tax hikes that will hurt everyday Wisconsin families.”

Ending the clean energy tax credits could face challenges in the U.S. Senate, where moderate Republicans have said the proposal needs changes to earn their support, according to Politico.

Eight government departments lacked a formal system for tracking Green Public Procurement (GPP) implementation.

20 May 2025: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has today published its fourth report on Green Public Procurement (GPP) adoption by government departments. GPP allows public authorities to source goods, services or works that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle while also achieving value for money.

A total spend of €1.24 billion across 18 government departments was reported. Of this, 82 per cent of contracts, valued at €1.02 billion, included green criteria (compared to 34 per cent in 2022).

GPP implementation varied widely across government departments, with the number of contracts incorporating GPP ranging from zero to 100%. There was an inconsistency in application of green criteria across product & services sectors, with high adoption reported for Food & Catering Services and Heating Equipment (100 per cent) but low adoption in contracts for ICT Products & Services (29 per cent).

Launching the report Laura Burke, Director General, said:

“This report shows a welcome increase in the use of green public procurement by central government. Full adoption across all government departments is a powerful lever to achieve better economic and environmental value as well as showing leadership in a transition to a greener, more circular economy. The EPA has developed practical guidance to support Government Departments and other public bodies to accelerate green purchasing.”

Tracking of GPP remains an issue to be addressed with eight of the 18 Government Departments lacking a formal system for tracking GPP implementation.

Mr David Flynn, Director, EPA Office of Environmental Sustainability added:

“Government, local authorities and other public sector organisations collectively procure over €18 billion worth of goods, services and works. Whilst it is important that GPP is used by government departments, a broader adoption across the entire public sector will ensure that public funds are used effectively and responsibly while reducing the environmental impact of our public services.”

Notes to Editor

The EPA reports annually on the implementation of Green Public Procurement by government departments. This is the fourth report in the series and relates to reference year 2023.

The EPA supports GPP implementation including providing national guidance and national criteria for priority sectors; monitoring and reporting on GPP implementation in government departments annually, publishing case studies and hosting ‘GPP in Practice’ events to showcase examples of GPP across the public sector.

There are national GPP criteria published for eleven priority sectors: ICT Products & Services, Food & Catering Services, Indoor Cleaning Services, Indoor and Outdoor Lighting, Heating Equipment, Energy-related Products, Paper Products & Printing Services, Textile Products & Services, Furniture & Related Services, Office Building Design, Construction & Management, Road Transport Vehicles & Services.

All 18 government departments provided returns for 2023 reference year, which requested data on GPP implementation at contract level (number and value of contracts), where the contract value was greater than €50,000 and the contract was signed in calendar year 2023. A summary of the data reported to the EPA is tabulated below. Note the reporting relates to Government Department contracts and does not include procurement by agencies affiliated to those Departments.

Buying Greener: Green Public Procurement Strategy and Action Plan 2024-2027 is the government’s policy on green public procurement, which sets out actions and sectoral targets to support implementation of green and circular procurement practices across the public sector.

Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin and Rep. Jason Morgan, of Ann Arbor, said they intend to rework bills that ensure companies and utilities pay for cleanups and open their records for public review. The legislation, which they plan to reintroduce in June, would also allow legal recourse for residents who suspect they have been harmed by the pollution.

The measure passed the state Senate last year but was lost amid a tumultuous and early end to the Michigan legislature’s lame duck session in December.

“We’ve migrated from ‘Let’s make this law that holds polluters to account,’ to ‘How can we focus on the most egregious cases,’” Irwin said. “How can we work around the edges of the law so as not to fundamentally change its approach, but nonetheless get better results?

“The idea is to require better cleanups of contaminated land and discourage companies from leaving a mess in the first place. I still expect universal opposition from polluters. Industry isn’t going to support more stringent standards no matter how reasonable, because it costs them money.”

The lawmakers are part of a working group that includes the Michigan Manufacturing Association, the Michigan Chemistry Council and some manufacturers. They said they want industries and state regulators to collaborate in the pollution assessment process, and they envision a negotiation process with some tough compromises.

It is likely that some sites will never meet residential standards, Irwin said.

“That gives us more flexibility to address those standards where they make sense,” Irwin said. “Some properties might continue to be designated for industrial use. Auto plants and other large industrial sites are the ones that may not be fully cleaned up (to residential standards).”

First introduced in 2023, Michigan Senate bills 605–611 are far different from laws recently passed in Vermont and New York, which are also often described as “polluter pays” measures. The Vermont and New York bills are modeled after the federal Superfund law, and would essentially tax big oil companies for their historic greenhouse gas emissions.

In Michigan, lawmakers are seeking accountability from businesses and industries that for years have left toxins in the ground or in the water.

Testing Toxic Sites

Michigan has tens of thousands of toxic sites, including many one-time commercial enterprises, that will likely fall within the proposal’s reach. The former Gelman Sciences Inc. site in Ann Arbor, which manufactured medical filters and related products for the pharmaceutical and microelectronic industries, is a prime example.

The chemical solvent known as 1,4-dioxane, a potential carcinogen, was used in production and has been found in local groundwater and nearby wells. The state and Washtenaw County has been overseeing remediation activities at the site for over 30 years. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the site to the National Superfund Priorities List.

Irwin said troubled sites will be evaluated and tested, with soil and water samples, for a range of toxins. “Is the site near a residential area, or is it located downtown?” Irwin said. “The goal is to take this case by case, and allow flexibility for sites that are in different locations.”

Progress Michigan, an advocacy organization, said its polls show over 90 percent of the public support laws that could save taxpayers from huge remediation costs. Dave Dempsey, senior advisor at For Love of Water, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the Great Lakes Basin, said the proposed legislation is an attempt at fairness.

The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy “estimates it will cost $13 billion for all these cleanups,” Dempsey said. “It could take two generations to do this, or until the end of the century. Now we just have these old sites discharging pollution into rivers and lakes.” Dempsey’s organization also wants to prevent an increase in abandoned toxic sites.

Taxpayers are currently footing the bill for so-called “orphan sites,” locations where owners are unclear or unidentified. Under current law, developers who clean up unclaimed brownfields receive tax increment financing, Irwin said.

The Biggest Culprits

Sean McBrearty, director of the nonprofit Michigan Clean Water Action, said he wonders if any polluter pay effort can succeed when corporations are often the biggest culprits. McBrearty pointed to DTE Energy, which has faced legal action over its coal-fired power plants and other facilities.

“There are industrial accidents that haven’t been cleaned up because it’s cheaper to lobby the legislature than clean up contaminated sites,” said McBrearty, whose organization has worked with Irwin’s latest version of legislation.

Irwin acknowledged that his bill will again face tough political realities. “We worry about a ‘pay-to-play’ environment where companies will use payments to stop an investigation,” Irwin said. “Now that the Michigan House is Republican, that adds more of a challenge.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1094585680-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 10:10:13.068877

San Juan, P.R. - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that three recipients across Puerto Rico have been selected to receive $1.5 million in Brownfields rants to assess, clean up, and revitalize local lands. These investments support locally driven redevelopment, unlocking economic opportunity, creating jobs, and improving public health outcomes in communities in Puerto Rico. These will keep critical momentum going in communities already benefiting from Brownfields investments, ensuring continued progress toward safe and reusable land.

""The brownfield grants are a vital tool for Puerto Rico, enabling us to revitalize our neighborhoods and restore community pride,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By cleaning up polluted sites, we are not only protecting public health but also stimulating economic opportunities that benefit all residents.""

“I thank Regional Administrator Martucci and the EPA for their continued support in advancing Puerto Rico’s priorities and economic development,” said Governor of Puerto Rico Jenniffer González-Colón. “These Brownfield grants represent an opportunity to allow the municipalities of Orocovis, Toa Alta and local organizations to clean up contaminated sites and transform them into spaces that uplift communities and generate economic activity. This investment from EPA is yet another example of what strong federal partnerships can achieve for the island.”

“These grants are smart investments for revitalizing communities across Puerto Rico,” said Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico Pablo José Hernández Rivera. “I’m pleased to announce this $1.5 million in funding for Orocovis, Toa Alta, and the Center for Habitat Construction that will help clean up contamination, attract new development, and improve public health. I look forward to continuing to support our municipalities and organizations, so they remain well-positioned to compete for federal resources.”

EPA has made these selections based on a competitive process. Selectees in Puerto Rico are:

The Center for Habitat Reconstruction in Puerto Rico has been selected to receive $500,000 to conduct up to nine environmental site assessments. The funding will also support reuse planning and community engagement activities, including nine community meetings. The target area for this grant includes the Municipalities of Vega Baja, Toa Baja, and Hormigueros. Priority sites for assessment include a former uniform factory in Hormigueros, a former school in Toa Baja, and a former industrial park in Vega Baja.

The Municipality of Orocovis, Puerto Rico has been selected to receive $500,000 to inventory and prioritize brownfield sites, as well as conduct ten environmental site assessments. The funding will also support the development of up to ten cleanup plans and community engagement activities.

The target area for this grant is the Municipality’s Northern District. Priority sites include a 3.3-acre former clothing factory, a 16.9-acre former vocational center, and four former schools ranging from 1.6 to 35.3 acres.

The Municipality of Toa Alta, Puerto Rico has been selected to receive $500,000 to inventory and prioritize sites, as well as conduct 23 environmental site assessments. The funding will also support the development of up to ten cleanup plans and community engagement activities.

The target area for this grant is the Municipality’s Former Industrial Zone. Priority sites include a 1.3-acre former coffin factory, a 75.3-acre former industrial park, a 2-acre former carton factory, and a 2.2-acre former trucking depot.

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in Puerto Rico have used previous EPA grants to assess, cleanup, and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results:

13.9 jobs per $100,000 of EPA Brownfield Grant funds spent

$20.45 for each $1 of EPA Brownfields funding expended on assessment, cleanup, and revolving loan fund grants.

Property values near cleaned-up sites increase by 5-15.2% with an estimated gain of $500,000 to $1.5 million in total property values

Increase of $29-97 million in local tax revenue in just the first year post-cleanup, per a study done in 2017.

EPA’s Brownfields Program helps transform underutilized and blighted properties into community assets – empowering neighborhoods, protecting health, and sparking lasting economic change.

Background

EPA’s Brownfields Program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.6 billion in Brownfield Grants to assess and clean up contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments leveraged more than $34 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage, from both public and private sources, more than 175,500 jobs.

Dive Brief:

A federal judgeon Thursday granted a preliminary injunction blockingthe U.S. Department of Energyfrom instituting a 15% cap on reimbursement for colleges’ indirect research costs.

A group of universities and higher education associations sued the department in April, alleging it had overstepped its authority in implementing the policy and applying the change retroactively by terminating grants with reimbursement rates above the cap.

In her ruling last week, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with the plaintiffs' arguments and said they are likely to succeed in proving the Energy Department's funding cap is ""arbitrary and capricious” and violates federal law.

Dive Insight:

Burroughs had temporarily blocked the Energy Department's policy days after the plaintiffs filed suit. Thursday’s ruling extends that freeze, banning the agency from applying its rate cap policy to any colleges until she orders otherwise.

Despite the government's mounting legal losses, the Trump administration is not letting up on efforts to limit research-related funding to colleges.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced Wednesday it would enact its own 15% indirect research cap.The agency estimated that the change will reduce outgoing funding by $900 million annually.

""We will not stop at new grants,""U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said in the memo. ""Meaningful savings can also be achieved by revisiting the terms of existing awards to institutions of higher education.""

Hegseth directed agency officials to terminate and reissue previously -awarded grants under the new terms if colleges do not agree to them.

COGR, an association for research universities and institutes and medical centers,criticized the Defense Department proposal as a cut to national security.

""Under the Trump Administration, DOD is the fourth federal agency to impose a 15% cap on research indirect cost reimbursement rates. The courts continue to halt implementation of these harmful policies,"" Matt Owens, president of COGR, said in a statement Friday. ""It’s time the Administration stop issuing misguided policies and start working in good faith with the academic research community.""

The Energy Department announced its ceiling on indirect research costs on April 11, following in the footsteps of the National Institutes of Health, which had announced a similar one in February. A federal judge in early April struck down the NIH cap.

In announcing the Energy Department's version, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the change would ensure federal funding efficiently supported research versus “administrative costs and facility upgrades.”

The department, which awards about $2.5 billion annually to over 300 colleges, estimated the cuts would halt $405 million in indirect cost funding annually.

The plaintiffs — including groups like the American Council on Education and the Association of American Universities and colleges like Princeton and Cornell universities — sued three days after the Energy Department's announcement.

In addition to alleging that the policy is unlawful, the lawsuit argues the funding change threatens the country's scientific and medical research advancement. Prior to the cap, many of the college plaintiffs had indirect research reimbursement caps north of 50%, according to court documents. Princeton, for example, negotiated an indirect cost rate of 62% for fiscal year 2024.

In her ruling, Burroughs said the agency needed to have a strong underlying rationale to change its negotiated rates with colleges.

But the department's 15% cap policy, ""even read generously, offers very little by way of explanation or justification for the decision to so suddenly and drastically limit reimbursement for indirect costs,"" she wrote.

The judge acknowledged that the Energy Department might have information that could support the new cap.

""If such data exists, however, it was not made public or otherwise articulated,"" she wrote.

The plaintiffs' lawsuit called the Energy Department's policy a ""virtual carbon copy” of the NIH's. In permanently blocking that cap, U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley ruled that NIH enacted it without following proper procedures and violated prohibitions against applying new policies retroactively.

“DOE’s action is unlawful for most of the same reasons and, indeed, it is especially egregious because DOE has not even attempted to address many of the flaws the district court found with NIH’s unlawful policy,” the plaintiffs in the Energy Department lawsuit said.

Burroughs last week agreed with Kelley's decision, calling it ""a well-reasoned opinion.""NIH has appealed that ruling.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/C68f5loqmG3G7M1emnw_xbOcZOAeo7EJQiheALGihyw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ET0VfZmFjYWRlXy1fV2FzaGluZ3Rvbl9EQy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:07.900680

House energy proposals also reduce royalty rates to 12.5% for onshore and offshore drilling, down from 16.67% and 18.75%, respectively, and put processes in place to increase permitting approvals for energy projects.","Energy policies included in the U.S. House budget reconciliation package represent a “significant shift in U.S. energy policy,” those in the Texas energy sector argue.

This is after the industry has expressed trepidation over Trump energy and tariff policies that created uncertainty in the market by driving up costs, reducing domestic output and dissuading domestic producers from investing in exploration and expanded production, The Center Square reported.

While the Texas oil and natural gas industry reported job gains in January and February, it reported losses in March for the first time in months as rig counts dropped, The Center Square reported. The industry slightly rebounded in April, according to the latest employment data, The Center Square reported.

Uncertainty in the industry remains due to federal energy policies and “numerous economic and geopolitical factors” that continue to impact domestic production and related investment decisions, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO) said. This includes Trump administration tariffs on steel and aluminum and encouraging OPEC+ countries to increase production, driving down domestic production and profits, The Center Square reported.

However, a positive development is a commitment to reversing Biden administration-era policies, TIPRO notes. This includes Congress prioritizing pro-energy policies in its budget reconciliation bill, referred to by President Donald Trump as one “big, beautiful bill.” The policies include expanding federal fossil fuel leasing, reducing royalty rates, streamlining the permitting process, repealing so-called clean energy incentives, refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP).

The proposals were included in the energy sections of the House Ways and Means Committee and House Natural Resources Committee packages, including prioritizing expanding fossil fuel production, TIPRO notes. The sections were included in the package before the House Budget Committee, which failed to advance it on Friday.

TIPRO and others have called for prioritizing domestic energy production, expanding critical infrastructure, including LNG ports and pipelines, protecting key tax provisions essential to the industry, among other priorities.

Included in the House package is a requirement for at least 30 oil and natural gas lease sales to be made on federal land and in the Gulf of America over the next 15 years. In Alaska, it requires six lease sales for Cook Inlet and authorizes leasing to begin in the National Petroleum Reserve and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also reinstates quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales, generating an estimated $12 billion in revenue, TIPRO notes.

House energy proposals also reduce royalty rates to 12.5% for onshore and offshore drilling, down from 16.67% and 18.75%, respectively, and put processes in place to increase permitting approvals for energy projects.

House Republicans also repealed provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, including clean energy incentives that provided tax credits for electric vehicles and renewable energy projects. They also curtailed the hydrogen production credit and expired “technology neutral” clean energy credits by 2031, TIPRO notes.

The House proposal also allocated $1.5 billion to replenish the SPR and delayed MERP by 10 years.

“With the exponential growth in energy demand forecasted in the coming years, oil and natural gas will continue to play a dominant role, but we must have the right strategy in place to provide regulatory and economic certainty to our members for the benefit of our country and allies,” TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said.

With Texas continuing to lead the U.S. in oil and natural gas production, emissions reductions and job growth, “sound policies that support fair business practices and laws that keep our state competitive are necessary if Texas is going to continue to benefit from oil and natural gas activity,” Texas Oil & Gas Association President Todd Staples said.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/05/19021720/AP25062706781334-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:11.717015

Under Clean Air Act (CAA) regulations, EPA allows certain classes of stationary internal combustion engines to operate without an hourly limit for emergency situations but with a 100-hour annual limit for nonemergency situations.

A nonemergency situation includes demand response as part of a financial agreement with a third party. These agreements enable operators to seek reimbursement for financial costs associated with nonemergency demand response uses.

Under EPA regulations, backup engines may be operated pursuant to these agreements for up to 50 hours a year, which counts toward the broader 100-hour nonemergency limit, provided that five conditions are met:

• The engine is dispatched by the local balancing authority or local transmission and distribution system operator.

• The dispatch is intended to mitigate local transmission and/or distribution limitations to avoid the interruption of local power supply.

• The dispatch follows reliability and safety protocols that adhere to specific standards or guidelines.

• The power is provided only to the facility itself or to support the local transmission and distribution system.

• The owner or operator keeps adequate records.

• The regulations do not provide a definition for the term “local balancing authority” or “local transmission and distribution system operator,” nor do they define “emergency” with particularity.

EPA's new guidance addresses how businesses with energy-intensive operations can participate in demand response programs without violating CAA regulations.

EPA’s recent guidance refers to a letter EPA sent to Duke Energy clarifying two key points:

• Enhanced Local Authority: Grid operators and local balancing authorities can now require customers to activate backup generators during demand response events, helping prevent widespread outages by reducing grid load.

• Broader Emergency Definition: An Energy Emergency Alert Level 1 now qualifies for emergency demand response if escalation to Level 2 appears imminent without intervention, effectively lowering the threshold for what constitutes a grid emergency.

EPA is currently ""evaluating more substantive changes"" to the underlying regulations, though specifics on timing and scope remain undefined.

APPA said that there may be a new rulemaking that could expand permissible generator activities under the various stationary engine Clean Air Act rules.

These clarifications provide more flexibility for facilities to support grid reliability while maintaining regulatory compliance, APPA said.

The guidance seems to recognize the need to balance air quality with grid stability amid the demands of artificial intelligence and data centers, according to APPA.

Notably, EPA’s Fact Sheet and FAQ cite the Trump administration’s goal to “ensure [that the] U.S. is the AI capital of the world” as well as Executive Order 14156 (“Declaring a National Energy Emergency”), underscoring the national significance of these changes.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-20 04:01:57.432399

Emerging technologies: hydrogen hit hard, CCUS unscathed The Ways and Means Committee proposes to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit.","“When it rains, it pours” is a popular expression around the world. It reflects a series of events that cascade in quick succession and can have big implications. And it defined US energy and economic policy last week.

Detailed answers have emerged to an important question facing the US energy sector: how will the Republican party change Biden-era policies?

There is a clear agenda from the Republican-led Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees: bolstering traditional energy sectors and reducing low-carbon energy incentives. Leasing activity for the Gulf of America (Gulf of Mexico) and geothermal acreage are set for a major expansion under proposed legislation. While nuclear power investment incentives have a faster sunset, other federal policies provide momentum for the sector. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) was a surprise winner, with incentives largely unchanged.

Zero-carbon energy policy could change radically, should House Republicans have their way. A phased reduction of tax incentives for renewable projects, the termination of both the electric vehicle tax credits and clean hydrogen production credits are possible. These modifications could dramatically delay the transition to low-carbon technologies in the United States.

It is important to note that Congress is still debating the future of US energy policy. As the budget reconciliation process progresses, further legislative changes are highly likely. Senate Republicans are advocating for more moderate changes to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 to ensure reliable power supply, maintain foreign investment in US energy and preserve economic growth.

Zero-carbon power: investment incentives are shorter and harder to claim

Beyond the phase-out of production tax credits (PTC) and investment tax credits (ITC) for wind, solar storage, and nuclear, other provisions in the proposed legislation could slow down investment. In the proposed bill, projects are eligible for tax credits once they are placed in service, rather than from the start of construction. Transferability of credits would also end, eliminating a key option for financing projects. Stringent new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions for some of the tax credits would further restrict investment.

Companies using components with material assistance or licensing agreements from prohibited foreign entities, known as FEOC would be disqualified from receiving the credits.

For wind, the most significant aspect of the proposals may be section 112014, which outlines a halt on the advanced manufacturing tax credits for all wind locally produced components starting from 2027. Significant investments have been made in recent years to strengthen the US wind supply chain, particularly in nacelle assembly and tower manufacturing.

Sylvia Leyva Martinez, Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analyst for utility-scale solar, says the US solar manufacturing sector could be negatively affected. The 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit would remain at full value starting in 2029, then decrease to 75% in 2030, 50% in 2031 and 0% in 2032. But although the slower phase-out is positive for manufacturers, US companies licensing Chinese technology or engaging in joint ventures with Chinese entities would lose access to the 45X credits under the FEOC exclusions. This could disrupt solar component supply for US solar manufacturing.

For storage, the impact would be exacerbated by increased tariffs because of the US market’s reliance on batteries from China, says Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s Global Head of Energy Storage.

Even with proposals from House Republicans, there is still momentum for new nuclear power. According to Gerardo Bocard of Wood Mackenzie’s Scenarios and Emerging Technologies team, there are three areas to watch. The US Department of Energy recently reissued a US$900 million SMR funding program. Licensing improvements are taking place following the ADVANCED Act, which should lower project development costs. New project learning rates from Canada's nuclear investment program can be applied to new nuclear projects in the US.

For geothermal, the Ways and Means bill accelerates the phase-out of the ITC. While this is a challenge, the Energy and Commerce Committee is proposing to increase geothermal lease sales on federal lands. Richard Hood of Wood Mackenzie’s Geothermal team, notes that several states including New Mexico, North Dakota, and Colorado are enacting legislation to expand geothermal investment. In addition, lease sales were announced in Alaska and Utah.

Despite conflicting signals, the investment tailwind for geothermal remains: the DoE announced over a billion dollars’ worth of funding for geothermal related projects, the House of Representatives passed significant bills supporting the exploration and development of resources and, tech giant Apple expanded its data center capacity and increased support for US manufacturing.

Transport: electric vehicle incentives are phased out; support for biofuels expands

For electric vehicles, the House Ways and Means proposal eliminates the new clean vehicle credit for any vehicle placed in service after 31 December 2026, effectively phasing out the tax credit. For electric vehicles, the House Ways and Means proposal restricts the clean vehicle credit (CVC) to 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer in 2026, eliminates the CVC from 2027 and the commercial clean vehicle credit, including leasing, from 2026.

Prateek Biswas and Andrew Brown, Wood Mackenzie’s lead analysts covering the transport sector, expected these changes. The proposals are consistent with our worst-case scenario forecast, which projected EV penetration in 2030 to drop to 23% from around 32% in Wood Mackenzie’s base case. More steps to change EV incentives are likely, according to Biswas and Brown.

Key developments to watch: Lee Zeldin’s Environmental Protection Agency is likely to lower federal greenhouse gas emission standards for the 2027 to 2032 timeframe. Sean Duffy’s Transportation Department will revise Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÉ) standards. The Trump administration is also likely to challenge California’s zero emission vehicle wavier.

Policy support for biofuels expands with amendments to the Clean Fuel Production Credit under 45Z. The credit would be extended to 2031, increasing investor certainty. The proposed legislation excludes emissions from indirect land use change in carbon intensity calculations, increasing credit values for domestic food-crop based biofuels. While the legislation also limits credit eligibility to feedstocks sourced outside of North America and could reduce the US market’s appeal, imports are still likely due to state level clean fuel credits from the low carbon fuel standards and the federal renewable fuel standard.

Emerging technologies: hydrogen hit hard, CCUS unscathed

The Ways and Means Committee proposes to terminate the clean hydrogen production tax credit. This would apply to facilities beginning construction after 31 December 2025. This change exacerbates market uncertainty since the credit was introduced in 2022 as part of the IRA.

Wood Mackenzie's analysis shows that 95% of the 3.4 million tonnes per annum of announced green hydrogen capacity is at risk. According to Wood Mackenzie’s Principal Analysts for low-carbon hydrogen Hector Arreola and Bridget van Dorsten, this policy change could significantly impact the US clean hydrogen industry's growth and competitiveness in the global clean energy market.

CCUS incentives emerge largely unharmed from the Ways and Means Committee. The 45Q tax credit remains unchanged in quantity and duration, but the Committee's proposal includes two modifications: a restriction barring entities from ""covered nations"" (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) from claiming 45Q credits and an elimination of the transferability of the 45Q credit.

Even with these minor modifications, Rohan Dighe, US CCUS lead for Wood Mackenzie, notes that CCUS projects currently in development in the US should not see major impacts if this proposal is enacted.

Upstream: lease sales will jumpstart Gulf of America (GoA) exploration

The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to expand offshore oil and gas leasing. Draft legislation requires 30 total lease sales between 2025 and 2040, beginning in August 2025. This would replace the Biden administration’s leasing goals, which led to only three lease sales in the GoA since 2021, well below the historical average.

More frequent leases will unlock more GoA production through exploration, according to Miles Sasser Senior Analyst of Wood Mackenzie’s L48 upstream team. Right now, the GoA is around 20% of global deepwater production. But with its current project profile, the GoA peaks by 2027. With exploration, we think it is possible to maintain about 2 million boe/d of GoA production beyond 2030. Key companies to watch include Chevron, Shell and BP, all of which have the technological capabilities to open up new GoA resources.

Minerals: more domestic supply won’t offset China’s dominance

The House Energy and Commerce Committee also aims to expand production for copper, nickel and lithium. Each are key minerals for zero-carbon energy technologies. According to the committee, more US mineral production could come from renewing mineral leases, expanding mineral exploration and improving project permitting.

But expanding US mineral supply does not address the core issue facing the US minerals sector. Any expansion to US mineral production will be dependent on China’s supply chains for battery components, cells and recycling, according to Wood Mackenzie’s Adrian Gardner, Principal Analyst. Trade tariffs could be a catalyst for investments in copper smelters in the US, although investors would need to be confident in a multi-decade tariff program to advantage US production over imports.

Other key stories

Trade tariff pressure eases – for now

The temporary reduction in tariffs between the US and China marks a significant de-escalation in the trade war, averting a complete decoupling of the world's two largest economies. The current tariff levels align closely with our Q2 2025 base case assumptions. We projected US tariffs on Chinese imports would settle at 34% by the end of 2026.

According to Wood Mackenzie’s Head of Economics, Peter Martin, should these temporary tariffs become permanent, both nations would be ahead of our projected timeline for trade negotiations. This could lead to slightly lower trade barriers than initially anticipated. However, the temporary tariffs represent a material increase in trade barriers between the US and China compared to 2024 levels.

The US-China agreement presents potential upside risks to our GDP forecasts for both countries. Our current outlook forecasts 1.5% and 4.3% growth in 2025 for the US and China, respectively. This tariff reduction could soften the disruption to global supply chains and investment patterns.

While offering temporary relief on higher tariffs, the reversal in policy adds to volatility and uncertainty. We caution that trade relations remain changeable, and ongoing monitoring is crucial to assess the long-term impact on investment and economic performance.

Canada goes all in on nuclear power

Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has taken a final investment decision (FID) decision to build Canada’s first SMR. This is the first SMR FID in North America and is part of a wider strategy within OPG to build four SMRs by 2050. Funding commitments from OPG, Canada's net zero target and the renewed focus on energy security under Prime Minister Mark Carney underpin the country’s investment in nuclear power.

OPG's SMR plan will be expensive. The company expects total construction costs for all four SMRs to be US$15.7 billion, including control systems. We estimate that capital costs for the first 300-MW SMR will be around US$14,250/kW, based on disclosed OPG estimates. By the fourth project, our cost projections fall to US$10,113/kW – a 30% reduction compared to the first SMR.

The new landscape for gas-fired power

Expectations of higher load growth globally led to a surge in gas turbine orders last year – up 32% globally year-on-year. A “gold rush” is how one of the leading gas turbine manufacturers characterised demand for turbines recently. In our latest analysis of gas-fired power, Wood Mackenzie said that the gas turbine market could face multiple headwinds.

According to Ben Boucher in Wood Mackenzie’s supply chain team, global gas turbine manufacturing capacity of 60 to 70 GW is maxed out through 2030. There are market-specific challenges for natural gas into power. In the US, hurdles include rising capital costs for gas turbines, tariffs and low power prices. In Asia, high fuel prices and renewables limit gas to peaking. Decarbonisation in Europe results in a long-term decline of natural gas into power.

The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely.
Without the tax credits, solar systems might still make financial sense in places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow.
Some Republicans have acknowledged the role that energy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts.
“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits.","“This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.”

For the last two decades, homeowners have been able to claim thousands of dollars in federal tax credits to help offset the high upfront costs of going solar. Things were supposed to stay that way through 2034. But, this week, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed abruptly ending the incentives at the end of the year. If this idea survives the House and passes the Senate, it could upend the economic calculus of powering your home with the sun.

“It would put solar out of reach for millions of people,” said Glen Brand, director of policy and advocacy at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that encourages adoption of the technology. “What the House has done is to put ordinary Americans in a really hard place. They are basically saying they aren’t going to help people with rising energy costs.”

The country’s first solar tax credits took effect in 1978, but were allowed to lapse in 1985, when President Ronald Regan was in office. In 2005, however, another Republican — President George W. Bush — revived them. Lawmakers have extended and tweaked the incentives ever since, most recently with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, which set the credit at 30 percent of the cost of a system until 2032, before a two-year phase out.

The average cost of a solar system in the U.S. right now is just north of $28,000, according to Zoë Gaston, a principal analyst for residential solar at the energy consultant Wood MacKenzie. That means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500.

On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee released an initial budget reconciliation proposal that would roll back large swaths of the IRA, including support for residential solar. The so-called 25D tax credit would still apply for systems that are installed this year, and then it would go away completely.

Without the tax credits, solar systems might still make financial sense in places that get a lot of sun or have high electricity prices, or both, but the payback period will likely grow. For other people, the math may no longer work at all.

“We would expect sales and installation to surge this year, followed by a market contraction,” said Gaston. “If a homeowner is thinking about solar and can afford it,” now would be the time.”

The 25D credit isn’t the only relevant tax break under threat. Another credit, 48E, is available to businesses that install solar on homes where the resident then either leases the equipment or enters into a power purchase agreement. This allows companies to reduce what they charge customers. According to Gaston, more than half of residential installations now follow this third-party ownership model.

Instead of eliminating 48E, the House favors applying limits on where the material in photovoltaic panels comes from. While experts are still sorting out exactly what the proposed language means, it generally aims to bar participation of “foreign entities of concern” — including those in China, where the vast majority of solar components are made.

“It puts the obligation on the installer or the developer to trace back the supply chain in a way that’s completely impossible,” said Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. This, he said, could effectively make the 48E credit effectively impossible to access starting in 2026.

The current House language could at least temporarily push folks toward the third-party ownership options, said Gaston. But when Wood MacKenzie did an analysis, before the House draft, that assumed a phase out of credits by 2028, it still projected a 30 percent drop in installed residential capacity by the end of the decade.

“It’s going to be devastating for companies, their employees, and their customers,” said Gallagher. “It’ll kill an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of workers and tens of billions of dollars in investment every year.”

The House move isn’t the only headwind the solar industry is facing. Some states, most notably California, for example, have lowered the amount the homeowners can earn selling power to the grid, making solar less lucrative. Even before Republicans took control of Congress and the White House, companies were starting to let employees go. More layoffs have ensued.

Some Republicans have acknowledged the role that energy tax credits play in the economy, and their districts. Twenty-one House members of the party signed a letter to Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith expressing concern about “disruptive changes to our nation’s energy tax structure.” Four Republican Senators also wrote to Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, urging “a targeted, pragmatic approach” to any changes.

“This is going to turn on what the Senate does,” said Brand, about the future of the solar credits. He believes it’s unlikely that the House proposal will become law in its current form and is optimistic that the rollbacks will be rectified. “This is a piece the Senate can get right.”

But the harm to the solar industry is already being done, said Jacquelyn Pless, a professor who researches energy and environmental economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management. The constant back and forth over policy, she said, makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan ahead.

“Policy volatility is really my bigger concern,” Pless said. “Policy uncertainty alone can start to freeze investment, raise costs, and damage market confidence.”

The coordinated push reveals how states are becoming a more important battleground than ever for the fight against corporate power and deregulation.
“At the state level, things are changing all the time.” But recently, Walters has seen an accelerated trend of legislation on a state level.
He pointed in particular to Missouri, where lawmakers are advancing an ALEC-authored judicial deference bill to weaken the power of regulators in the state.","As Elon Musk and his DOGE cronies take a sledgehammer to federal agencies, corporate interests are mounting a coordinated effort to dismantle state rules and regulations — backing legislative efforts to kneecap state watchdogs’ ability to enforce everything from environmental protections to worker safeguards.

This means that as guardrails for consumers and workers are dismantled on a federal level, states are in danger of losing their ability to pick up the slack.

In fifteen states this year, according to a review by the Lever, lawmakers have introduced “judicial deference” laws, which would stack the deck against state regulators and allow corporate America to swiftly challenge and strip away state protections ranging from restrictions on pollution to consumer safeguards.

The legislation mimics the Supreme Court’s 2024 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo decision that defanged federal regulators, with widespread consequences.

Ten of the bills include language that is nearly identical to model legislation authored by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a right-wing policy incubator that, with the assistance of private interests, is pushing to gut state regulators’ power around the country. In Missouri and Nevada, the bills have made it through one chamber; in Oklahoma, the legislation now awaits the governor’s signature.

The language, experts told the Lever, in some cases goes beyond the ruling of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority to even further constrain state regulators.

The coordinated push reveals how states are becoming a more important battleground than ever for the fight against corporate power and deregulation. If, for example, the embattled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can’t protect you from junk fees, your state attorney general could be the next best option.

But if ALEC and its corporate backers succeed in pushing these bills through state legislatures, the end result is deregulation that extends far beyond Washington, consumer advocates warn.

“This is giving massive handouts to corporate interests who don’t want to be regulated and who are maximizing profit over the well-being of the community that they’re in,” said Devon Ombres, senior director for courts and legal policy at the Center for American Progress, a progressive policy think tank.

Between the Loper Bright case and state-level efforts, Ombres said, lawmakers were “giving these already super-powerful entities leeway to attack regulations in entirely new ways.”

“A Very Well-Funded Campaign”

Back in 2014, when a power plant challenged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s air pollution regulations, a more liberal Supreme Court sided with environmental regulators. The Clean Air Act, the court reasoned, might not spell out exactly how the EPA should enforce Congress’ antipollution law, but environmental regulators had the authority to interpret ambiguous provisions according to their expertise.

The doctrine backing this decision was called Chevron deference, a precedent established by the high court in a 1984 ruling over the oil giant’s challenge to antipollution laws.

For decades, the Chevron doctrine directed federal judges to defer to regulators’ judgment on questions of law, so long as their judgment was reasonable. The state of affairs greatly expanded the scope and power of regulatory agencies.

Once embraced by the conservative establishment, the Chevron doctrine was a prime target of corporate interests by the 2010s. Corporate America had come to believe the precedent handed too much authority to regulators trying to rein in corporate power — like when the EPA successfully won over polluters.

Particularly emblematic of the corporate turn against Chevron is the evolving position of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas once supported the doctrine, upholding it in an opinion he authored in 2005. But he flip-flopped on the issue after years of undisclosed gifts and luxury travel from corporate billionaire Harlan Crow, as well as endless lobbying by right-wing legal organizations such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, which are increasingly backed by dark money.

Thomas’s about-face was just one step in the conservative legal movement’s long game to overturn Chevron and usher in a new deregulatory age. Another was the Loper Bright case, a challenge to federal marine authorities brought on behalf of commercial fisheries in New England. The case was backed by a laundry list of corporate interests, and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled 6–2 in their favor last year, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recusing herself, and Thomas joining with the majority to vote to sunset Chevron.

Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion in Loper Bright, held that courts must now “exercise their independent judgment” when deciding whether federal authorities have exceeded their authority — dealing a serious blow to regulators’ power. The ruling has had wide-ranging consequences: courts cited the death of Chevron to strike down firearm background-check requirements, airline fee restrictions, and environmental protections, as ProPublica reported last fall.

Now state courts, which have their own standards for evaluating state rules and regulations, are being forced to ask the same questions. For decades, there has been a piecemeal system in the states of “judicial deference” — how much judges defer to regulators’ judgment. In the years after Chevron, many states adopted similar legal regimes, but not all: the notoriously corporate-friendly Delaware, for instance, has long had a far less deferential standard.

State standards on this issue are a “moving target,” said Daniel Walters, a Texas A&M University School of Law professor. “At the state level, things are changing all the time.”

But recently, Walters has seen an accelerated trend of legislation on a state level.

A “very well-funded campaign,” he said, has begun “advocating for changes at the state level, to try to eliminate deference there.”

This campaign is being driven in part by ALEC.

“A Thumb on the Scale”

In a recent April webinar, ALEC staffers and conservative lawmakers around the country gathered on Zoom to discuss their deregulation battle across the states.

“So many states are moving in the right direction to adopt ALEC model policy,” Jonathan Williams, ALEC’s president and chief economist, said on the call.

He pointed in particular to Missouri, where lawmakers are advancing an ALEC-authored judicial deference bill to weaken the power of regulators in the state. The legislation passed in the Missouri Senate in February by a wide margin (25–7) after ALEC sent a representative to the state house to testify in its favor and is now being deliberated on in the House.

For years, ALEC has been a secretive hotbed for conservative policy, working closely with lawmakers across the country to pass model legislation drafted by the group. Its backers include the shadowy political network funded by conservative petrochemical tycoon Charles Koch of Koch Industries, among hundreds of other corporate interests, many of which were also involved in the fight against Chevron deference.

Many states with conservative leadership, hopping in on the DOGE zeitgeist, have been attempting to copy the Trump administration’s extreme agency-gutting playbook. State-level Department of Government Efficiency–inspired entities have cropped up in twenty-six states, according to an April report from the Economic Policy Institute.

They are being egged on by ALEC’s “government efficiency coalition,” a working group that coordinates these efforts nationwide. The Lever attended multiple coalition webinars this year, in which ALEC representatives and state lawmakers discussed their strategy — as well as the group’s attempts to pass judicial deference legislation.

“Every good idea that comes out of the states should be funneled up to the federal government, and vice versa,” ALEC’s CEO, Lisa Nelson, said on a January call.

ALEC isn’t the only corporate interest group lobbying for the Missouri deregulation bill. Legislative records indicate that the Associated Industries of Missouri, an industry group whose members include Boeing, Ford, and Mastercard, has been pushing for the legislation. So has the Pacific Legal Foundation and Americans for Prosperity, a dark money group backed by the Koch network.

The Missouri bill, like nine other bills introduced in different states this year, draws almost word for word from model legislation on judicial deference drafted by ALEC, which the organization claims will “restore judicial autonomy” by seizing power from state regulators and returning it to the courts.

What’s particularly noteworthy about this language, noted Walters at Texas A&M, is that it appears to expand upon the Supreme Court’s stance on judicial deference in its Loper Bright decision. Not only does the ALEC legislation direct that courts not give any deference to agency judgment at all, but it also directs judges to “exercise remaining doubt in favor of a reasonable interpretation that limits the scope of agency power and maximizes individual liberty.”

This, Walters said, goes “well beyond” what the Supreme Court decided in Loper Bright, amounting to a “thumb on the scale against agency action.”

Yet despite how apparently extreme the language is, state lawmakers are taking it up. Last year, Idaho codified the language into law. This legislative session, the Nebraska and Oklahoma legislatures have, like Missouri, both pushed bills containing the ALEC language through at least one chamber.

According to Walters, the impact of such a drastic policy — which directs judges to oppose agency action whenever possible — could be “chilling” in states, where regulators are in charge of critical environmental protections, antitrust enforcement, worker safeguards, and many other policies.

“It just seems like stacking the deck in many ways against agency action, and I think it would have profound implications for the ability of regulators to do their job,” he said.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19104232/GettyImages-2206691913.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 04:02:05.425532

By Eric Starkman

Let’s hope U.S. auto writers don’t fatally choke on the free-range egg splattered across their collective faces.

For more than three years, mainstream and trade auto journalists have promoted the false narrative that GM CEO Mary Barra is a “transformative” environmental leader boldly disrupting a complacent auto industry and championing the adoption of electric vehicles. Fortune last year named Barra America’s most powerful female business leader, citing her EV credentials, and the year before, ranked her alongside Elon Musk as one of the auto industry’s top disruptors.

InsideEVs even named Barra its 2024 Person of the Year.

“Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday,” gushed editor Patrick George. “That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs Breakthrough Awards’ Person of the Year for 2024.”

Barra’s leadership may indeed be studied in business schools—but likely as a cautionary tale. Her story is one of chasing prevailing political winds and making strategic pivots based on short-term optics, all while relying on the expectation that U.S. taxpayers will endlessly subsidize GM’s operations, including its faltering EV ambitions.

After Joe Biden—whom Politico reported had a close relationship with Barra—was elected, Barra styled herself as an EV evangelist. She pledged to make GM an all-electric manufacturer by 2035 and embraced Biden’s climate agenda.

“As Chairman and CEO of General Motors, I now have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to use my engineering mindset to help make the world a better place on a much larger scale,” she said. “At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do.”

Falling Short

Barra’s results have so far fallen far short of her stated goals and objectives.

Barra famously predicted GM would outsell Tesla in EVs by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla sold 336,681 EVs, while GM moved just 31,886. Even though GM’s EV sales nearly doubled, they still made up just 5% of the company’s total U.S. volume—well below the national average of 7% for EVs overall.

In California, the most EV-friendly state in the country, GM’s performance has been especially dismal. Even the Tesla Cybertruck—dismissed by the media as a commercial failure—outsold most of GM’s electric offerings in Q1. The one exception: the Equinox EV, which qualifies for generous U.S. tax credits despite being manufactured in Mexico, and beginning in 2025, with key parts sourced from Mexico and South Korea.

Now, in what amounts to a tacit admission of failure, Barra appears to have shifted course again—this time siding with the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken California’s aggressive EV mandates.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GM urged thousands of its white-collar employees in Michigan to contact U.S. senators in support of legislation that would overturn California’s landmark rule banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035—a mandate since adopted by 11 other states.

“We need your help!” read the GM email. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

A GM spokeswoman, who the Journal unfortunately didn’t identify, said GM wants to protect “consumer choice.” That’s comical, given that five years ago, Barra pledged to eliminate gas-powered options entirely by 2035.

This isn’t Barra’s first alignment with a Trump-era environmental rollback.

In 2019, the Trump administration moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own stricter emissions standards—a power the state had exercised for decades to accelerate clean vehicle adoption. Rather than standing with California and other environmentally forward states, GM backed the Trump administration, joining a coalition supporting efforts to weaken federal fuel economy rules and undercut California’s regulatory independence.

By contrast, Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen signed a voluntary agreement with California to meet tougher emissions targets. GM’s position sparked swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, who rightly accused Barra of hypocrisy.

When President Biden took office, Barra reversed course again—rebranding herself as a climate ally. Just months after Biden assumed command, Barra announced a $1 billion investment to convert GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico for electric vehicle production. The move infuriated the United Auto Workers, who saw it as a betrayal of American labor.

“At a time when General Motors is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,” former UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in response. “GM automobiles made in Mexico are sold in the United States and should be made right here, employing American workers. That is why our nation is investing in these companies. Taxpayer money should not go to companies that utilize labor outside the U.S. while benefiting from American government subsidies. This is not the America any of us signed on for. Frankly, it is unseemly.”

Trump's Tariffs

Even more unseemly: Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended generous tax breaks to EVs built in Mexico—including the Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Optiq. If not for Trump-era tariffs, Barra likely would have shifted even more EV production to Mexico, where GM is the country’s largest automaker.

Barra’s latest pivot is no surprise. GM last fall abandoned its self-imposed goal of building 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and has twice delayed the reopening of its Lake Orion plant, which was slated to produce the electric Silverado. The company also pushed back the launch of a new Buick plug-in hybrid.

Notably, nearly half of GM’s Buick dealers took buyouts in 2023 rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to sell and service EVs—suggesting they may have had a better read on consumer demand than Barra herself.

Still, GM’s latest retreat from its electrification targets hasn’t sparked any humility within its leadership ranks.

Last week, Dave Richardson, a former Apple executive who now oversees software at GM, told reporters the company is working on a breakthrough called “mechatronics”—a system that integrates mechanical, electrical, and computing systems in vehicles. Tesla has been deploying this type of technology for more than a decade.

Given Richardson’s background, one might assume that integrating GM’s vehicle apps with the Apple Watch would be an easy win. Yet the project has been suspended because of glitches -- while Tesla rolled out seamless Apple Watch integration last December.

Meanwhile, GM claims to have made a significant advancement in battery technology with its lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which reportedly offers 30% greater energy density at the same production cost and helps reduce reliance on Chinese intellectual property.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. He added that the new chemistry would “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

Silicon Valley Hotshots

Kelty, formerly of Tesla and Panasonic, and Richardson are among several Silicon Valley hotshots recruited by Barra to help recast GM as a tech-forward company. Yet while GM’s top tech leadership is based in California, Barra insists the company’s headquarters remains in Detroit—even though CNBC recently reported that President Mark Reuss’s office is located at the Warren Tech Center.

Every media interview I’ve read with Barra the reporter noted that it was conducted at GM’s Tech Center.

Richardson and Kelty have been with GM for less than two years. Time will tell whether they stick around. Notably, Barra last year trumpeted the hiring of JP Clausen, another ex-Tesla executive, to lead GM’s global manufacturing.

“JP’s unique expertise in global manufacturing innovation, engineering, and operations will accelerate our ability to deliver on our vision for GM with the highest quality vehicles for our customers,” Barra said in a press release.

Clausen recently disclosed on LinkedIn that he had left GM, citing that the decision “makes sense for me and my family right now.”",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_7_58037.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:02:53.999000

The case centers on $20 billion in clean-energy funding, frozen in mid-February amid EPA questions about oversight and potential fraud, per prior Tribal Business News reporting. The agency later escalated on March 18 by terminating the grants entirely, prompting a flurry of lawsuits from affected grantees. District courts quickly enjoined the EPA from clawing back the funding, including $1.5 billion committed to Indian Country projects.

To quickly facilitate access to the funding under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the Biden administration placed the money in accounts at Citibank, N.A. With the injunction in place, the money sits frozen in those accounts, untouchable by the grantees or the EPA.

Climate United lawyer Adam Unikowksy said the situation was growing dire for Climate United and other nonprofit green banks established under the GGRF, but maintaining the status quo was better than shunting the matter to federal claims court, which could take years to litigate.

“I think if the issue is still percolating in this court, potentially, this court could leave the stay in place,” Unikowsky said. “I think a stay would be appropriate.”

EPA claims contractual dispute

However, EPA lawyer David Roth argued that the issue was a contractual dispute, not a statutory dispute. As such, the matter should be decided in federal claims court, not the Court of Appeals or other traditional avenues.

“There’s all sorts of provisions in the contract about who can do what with the money and when,” Roth told the three-judge panel. “I think that the nature of the dispute is over the contractual provisions and the EPA’s ability to terminate under those contractual provisions.”

Climate United is one of three grantees under the National Clean Investment Fund, a $14 billion program under the GGRF

The small number of grantees, as well as their arrangement with Citibank, raised alarms at the EPA once President Donald Trump took office. The arrangement did not provide sufficient oversight over the funds, the EPA argued.

Judges question EPA’s concerns

Court of Appeals judges seemed to take issue with the EPA’s reasoning.

“What's missing?” asked Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard, an Obama appointee. “What is the concern, given that these grantees are subject to very strict guardrails, and if the money's misused they're subject to criminal penalty?”

Roth said the agency did not believe it had sufficient oversight over subgrantees down the line, regardless of their access to information about primary grantees.

“The EPA has the ability to see the money flowing out of the accounts, but they don’t have, other than in particular circumstances, a way to see how subgrantees are spending it,” Roth said. “The further removed it is, the harder it is to understand what’s going on.”

Unikowsky argued that the injunction fell under the Court of Appeals as a statutory issue. He stated that Climate United had title over the funding as programmatic income, since it had been released to Citibank already and was not being pulled from the US Treasury. In addition, the EPA’s termination violated statutory obligations under the Inflation Reduction Act, which established the GGRF in 2022, Unikowsky said.

During the hearing, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, repeatedly noted that Unikowsky conceded the EPA’s authority to terminate the grants, which favored Roth’s contractual argument.

Potential permanent impact

The judges asked what would happen if the injunction were lifted. When JUDGE suggested green banks might reorganize years later if they won in federal claims court, Unikowsky dismissed the possibility.

“We're just going to leave and aren't going to come back. Realistically, it's just not an option for these entities to shut down, fire or lay off their employees,” Unikowsky said. “They're probably not going to come back.”

Climate United CEO Beth Bafford told Tribal Business News the organization would continue to fight to resume funding their work.

“Today, the EPA should be celebrating new investments that create jobs, generate affordable domestic energy, and save hardworking Americans money. Instead, they are taking up a frivolous battle in court,” Bafford said in a statement. “This is bigger than our contract with the federal government. It’s about EPA’s lawless and indiscriminate subversion of Congress and due process to freeze our funds and terminate our grant agreement. We will continue to push forward so we can get back to doing this critical work.”

A ruling on the injunction has not yet been issued, and is expected in the next two weeks.

That push threatens to alienate moderate Republicans whose communities stand to gain from factories and other projects enabled by the tax breaks — and green-tech advocates who had hoped they could sway Trump by framing the incentives as the key to edging out China.

The message they’ve gotten instead: When it comes to winning on clean energy, Trump just isn’t interested.

“The second administration is really not about taking half-measures,” said Daniel Simmons, who ran the Energy Department’s energy efficiency and renewable energy office in Trump’s first term. “To all appearances, it is not a battlefield that they care about.”

Trump’s Energy Department confirmed as much in a statement to POLITICO that focused largely on oil — an energy source that the U.S. produces more of than any other country.

“Thanks to President Trump, America is leading the way in lowering costs by removing red tape and unleashing affordable, abundant, and reliable American energy,” the department said Friday, adding: “As the world’s largest oil producer, the United States welcomes a secure and stable global supply of oil that promotes economic prosperity at home and promotes peace and stability around the world.”

The White House referred questions about its clean-energy worldview to the Energy Department.

Trump officials have argued that putting money into green technology boosts China, which dominates major slices of the global battery, electric vehicle, solar and wind energy supply chains.

Trump’s zero-sum assessment of the clean energy market has forged an energy strategy even more reliant on fossil fuels than he pursued in his first term. Following this approach would jeopardize a U.S. clean energy manufacturing industry that is just beginning to sprout — and, green tech advocates say, all but ensure that China will command the global sector.

That vision is coming to a head in Congress, where Republicans are working to slash the clean energy incentives created by President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. While not proposing to erase the tax breaks altogether, GOP lawmakers in the House have floated tight restrictions outlawing Chinese sourcing in energy projects’ supply chains. Those limits would render most of the tax credits unusable for projects that have not yet been built, effectively squelching the nascent U.S. clean manufacturing sector.

The changes remain in limbo as part of the broader budget reconciliation bill, the legislative vehicle for greenlighting Republicans’ and Trump’s policy agenda that can pass with a simple majority vote in Congress. House Republicans are trying to forge a compromise among fiscal conservatives and blocs of GOP lawmakers that want to preserve clean energy credits and raise tax deductions caps for state and local taxes.

Trump’s presence looms over the negotiations. He has repeatedly vowed to end Biden’s programs — the nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy and fighting climate change — while labeling them the “green new scam.” Cutting many of those policies, such as consumer credits to purchase electric vehicles, would fund a small portion of his administration’s other priorities, including trillions of dollars in tax breaks.

“They don’t see climate change as a problem,” George David Banks, who ran Trump’s first-term climate portfolio, said of the current team’s outlook. He added, “They don’t want to essentially create a jobs program for China.”

Defenders of the IRA tax credits say killing them would wipe out an American jobs program, one whose benefits would flow to heavily Republican communities as well as Democratic strongholds. Private-sector manufacturing projects seizing on Biden’s incentives had been projected to create roughly 160,000 jobs, according to analyses published last year.

Overturning the subsidies would eliminate a potential U.S. export market for solar modules and batteries that could be worth as much as $50 billion by 2030, according to another analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Other countries would fill an $80 billion investment gap left by shuttered U.S. solar facilities, electric vehicle shops and battery gigafactories.

Many countries stand to benefit from the U.S. vacating the space, the Johns Hopkins researchers wrote. But governments outside the U.S. would face risks as well: Those that fail to encourage clean tech investments at home could fall even further behind China, which would likely benefit in every industrial category.

The researchers also raised the prospect of a transition of intellectual property to China: As U.S. business shuttered, they said, foreign companies could purchase their technical knowledge at fire-sale prices.

Trump’s barrage of tariffs against nations worldwide would limit some of the advantage countries could gain by selling clean technology to the U.S., said Tim Sahay, one of the authors of the study. Still, he said, the upshot from Trump’s policies was clear — including for European allies that had erupted in fury over Biden’s use of protectionist tax breaks to move clean energy manufacturing to the United States.

“China would be the biggest winner but not the only winner. … The rest of the world wins,” Sahay said. It’s “basically the IRA in reverse. When the IRA passed, foreigners were like, ‘Oh my God, Americans are stealing our jobs and investments because of their superior fiscal space.’ Well, now the IRA is gone, then foreigners are like, ‘Well, more for us.’”

Some conservative clean energy supporters still hope they can persuade Trump to back tax credits that have sprung solar manufacturing and battery-making plants across Republican strongholds in the Sun Belt and Rust Belt.

Those advocates criticized the IRA for being too lenient on allowing Chinese content into the supply chains of products receiving the tax incentives. But they believe Trump would bless tweaks that tighten foreign content requirements to retain incentives that support blue-collar jobs in the U.S.

“There’s an enormous and rapidly growing market for low-carbon technologies around the world, and right now the U.S. is a secondary player,” said Greg Bertelsen, CEO of the Cleaner Economy Coalition, a business advocacy organization that promotes low-carbon manufacturing at the state and federal level. “There’s a recognition within the Trump administration that we need to be competing in these markets for these technologies.”

Trump officials have been making a very different case.

Last month, Energy Secretary Chris Wright flew to Eastern Europe to propose that ministers from Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and other regional governments join “Team Energy Freedom,” urging them to embrace oil, gas and nuclear energy and reject what he framed as climate dogma.

“Climate alarmism has reduced freedom, prosperity and national security,” he said, adding — in language that carried a particular charge addressed to former communist bloc countries — that it may be a Trojan horse to “grow centralization and re-establish top-down control.”

Wright’s subordinate Tommy Joyce was even more blunt when he told a gathering of 60 governments last month in London that the pursuit of climate policy was a gift to Beijing.

“There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

People outside MAGA world also acknowledge the dominance China has built over decades of developing its clean energy supply chains.

In solar, batteries, electric vehicles and to some extent wind power, “China started early. China is the biggest,” said Li Shuo, director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

These are the core clean technologies the world is going to need en masse in the coming decades as it shifts towards a cleaner energy system. And in all of these fields, Li said, “the Chinese lead is significant and irreversible.”

In the past months, for example, two rival Chinese companies — BYD and CATL — made potentially game-changing claims when they announced they had developed electric vehicle batteries that could get 400 or even 500 kilometers (roughly 250 to 310 miles) from just a five-minute charge. Tesla boasts that its “superchargers” can give drivers around 320 kilometers in about 15 minutes.

Republican proposals would also hamstring some clean energy technologies that the Trump administration has touted, such as next-generation nuclear, fusion and geothermal, according to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group. The proposed tweaks to subsidies would essentially eliminate the long-term price signals that early-stage technologies covet, eroding their business case. Beyond that, the administration’s massive spending and job cuts across federal agencies and science research threaten to constrain U.S. innovation.

Rather than focusing on clean energy technologies such as batteries and EVs, the Trump administration has so far made critical minerals the forefront of its strategy to combat China, said a State Department official who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Those efforts focus on extracting and processing raw materials rather than supporting the value-added industries like battery-making or electric vehicles.

The official said the administration’s opposition to subsidies for green technology doesn’t mean it opposes the technologies writ large — apart from wind energy, which Trump has made clear for years that he despises.

Apart from the current U.S. government, no other major power has determined that China’s dominance means that action to fight climate change needs to take a backseat. The Biden administration’s argument, one still being pursued in Europe, was that a targeted industrial strategy could claw back some share of those industries.

Those strategies have often come cloaked in pledges to make this country or that country a “clean energy superpower.” But Li said there was a danger of “making too big of a promise. A promise that cannot be entirely fulfilled.”

Li said he had long feared that someday a U.S. president would ask: If China’s lead is so big, “then why do we play the game?”

That is the conclusion being drawn in the White House during Trump’s second term. And it helps explain why the administration has gone beyond shutting down government funding for future projects and kneecapping agencies that deal with clean energy while reversing regulations.

Not even energy projects that have drawn big-time investment and are already under construction are safe. Last month, the federal government ordered work to stop on a massive offshore wind project that would have powered half a million homes in New York.

“What has surprised me is the extent to which the administration hasn’t just pursued an agenda but has thrown sand in the gears of the parts of agenda that they don’t agree with,” said Thom Woodroofe, a former Australian diplomat in Washington who now works at the Smart Energy Council. “Even when it costs American jobs.”",https://static.politico.com/e9/09/7dfe533a42899ca659859f8e3116/china-us-sanctions-66195.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:02:57.675014

Solar Shares Fall as GOP Targets Earlier End to Tax Credits Back to video

Sunrun Inc. fell as much as 8% Monday, and Enphase Energy Inc. was down as much as 5.3%. First Solar Inc. declined as much as 6.8%.

Article content

Despite surging clean-energy installations in recent years, the drop shows that the industry still relies heavily on favorable policy support from Washington.

Article content

South Carolina Representative Ralph Norman, one of four ultraconservatives negotiating the package, said House leadership had agreed to a proposal to end Inflation Reduction Act tax credits earlier than Republicans’ original proposal. As initially unveiled, many energy credits, including a tax incentive for clean energy production, would begin to phase out in 2029, ending in 2032. Norman didn’t provide a new time frame.

Article content

House Republican leadership staff told reporters Monday that a phase-out date hadn’t been decided, and it remained to be seen if it would cover shovel-ready projects.

Article content

The incentives, which include credits for electric vehicles, wind and solar power, nuclear power and other sources of clean energy, have been ripe targets for lawmakers looking for hundreds of billions of dollars to help pay for extending Trump’s tax cuts.

Article content

But there is no guarantee the deep cuts being proposed will become law. Moderate Republicans in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson can only afford to lose a handful of votes, have called for him to make the cuts less onerous. Some Republican senators have said they don’t support the changes as is in the current House tax proposal.

Article content

Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and budget hawk who has previously said his support is contingent on the “full eradication of Green New Deal IRA subsidies,” said in a post on X Sunday that he still wasn’t satisfied.

Article content

“Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies,” Roy said. “But, the bill does not yet meet the moment – leaving almost half of the green new scam subsidies continuing.”

Importantly, this kind of state-driven coordination reflects a broader truth: preparing the EV workforce of the future requires more than funding alone.
What’s Next: Telling a Stronger Story Participants agreed that storytelling matters, and expressed frustration with an emphasis on negative narratives in the EV sector.
“Persistent misconceptions and mischaracterizations cloud the EV sector.” “Firefighters respond to 400 vehicle fires a day.
With all these trends moving in the right direction, the EV sector presents a real opportunity to build family-sustaining careers in communities across the country.","States remain on the front lines of developing the skilled workforce needed to support the electric vehicle (EV) sector’s continued evolution and expansion — with career opportunities spanning vehicle and battery manufacturing and maintenance to the installation and upkeep of EV charging infrastructure. That theme was central at the recent convening of the State and Local EV Workforce Collaborative, co-led by the National Governors Association (NGA) and the National League of Cities (NLC), with support from the Siemens Foundation.

State and local leaders, industry partners, and workforce experts gathered in Detroit in mid-April to celebrate the Collaborative’s progress and chart the path ahead. As federal priorities continue to evolve, the convening underscored a central point: the urgency of building accessible, durable education and career pathways in the EV sector remains — and states have a critical responsibility to advance the work.

“Labor market data will tell you there are around 300,000 EV-related roles in the future, but we also need to look deeper into what types of roles the area you live in will actually need.”

“We need the right training, in the right regions. What works in one state or region won’t always work in another.”

This was a common thread throughout the convening: one-size-fits-all strategies won’t cut it. EV workforce needs vary across geographies, and state governments are uniquely positioned to align training investments, employer partnerships, and education systems to meet local demand.

Continued Alignment Around Shared Goals

Despite ongoing headwinds in the sector, including funding shifts and the uncertainty of EV-related policy, participants reaffirmed their support for the Collaborative’s original objectives. Those goals include aligning education and workforce systems, supporting data-informed decision-making, investing in pathways accessible to individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, and scaling partnerships with industry.

Attendees emphasized that these goals are essential to navigating the current landscape. Aligning systems and investments across state agencies, education providers, and employers remains one of the most powerful levers states have to ensure long-term workforce readiness. Whether preparing workers for electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) installation or advanced manufacturing, the Collaborative agreed that consistent cross-sector collaboration and workforce alignment are critical to keep pace with both industry demand and community needs.

Organizations like ChargerHelp and Women Who Charge exemplify what’s possible when workforce development aligns with real-time industry needs. Both organizations are forging cross-sector partnerships to recruit and train underrepresented talent for high-growth roles in EV maintenance and charging infrastructure. Their work underscores the importance of designing programs that engage employers directly, target recruitment, and provide wraparound support that make it possible for more people to participate and grow their career in this sector.

State Leadership in Action: A North Carolina Example

One example of state-level leadership is the North Carolina Business Committee for Education (NCBCE). As an inaugural partner of the Siemens Foundation’s EVeryone Charging Forward initiative, NCBCE works to ensure the state’s workforce is prepared to meet the rising demand for EV infrastructure installation, maintenance, and support services. Their team developed a strategy to map EVSE training needs across regions, identify critical skill gaps, and partner with community colleges and industry stakeholders to co-create scalable workforce programs that prepare people for these jobs.

This model underscores the power of state agencies working hand-in-hand with local providers. By convening public and private partners, including K–12 systems, community colleges, utility companies, and employers, NCBCE delivers on-the-ground solutions, and also builds a replicable blueprint that other states can adapt to their regional labor market needs. With a focus on developing training that aligns with industry needs, ensuring credentials are valued by employers, and helping a wide range of individuals access these opportunities, the initiative is grounded in both equity and economic opportunity.

Importantly, this kind of state-driven coordination reflects a broader truth: preparing the EV workforce of the future requires more than funding alone. It demands long-range planning, cross-sector partnerships, and responsive programming that can grow and evolve alongside industry demand. As other states look to build or expand their own EV workforce strategies, North Carolina’s approach offers a powerful example of what’s possible when state leadership brings systems together with clear purpose and shared urgency.

What’s Next: Telling a Stronger Story

Participants agreed that storytelling matters, and expressed frustration with an emphasis on negative narratives in the EV sector.

“Persistent misconceptions and mischaracterizations cloud the EV sector.”

“Firefighters respond to 400 vehicle fires a day. You don’t hear about it unless it’s an EV.”

To combat these narratives, consistent and fact-based messaging that is grounded in opportunity, safety, and economic mobility is essential to gaining broader buy-in and building the inclusive EV workforce of the future.

In 2024, the EV market reached 1.56 million in sales. The reality is that EV-related jobs are growing, EV adoption continues to trend upwards, and charging infrastructure is expanding. With all these trends moving in the right direction, the EV sector presents a real opportunity to build family-sustaining careers in communities across the country.

Now more than ever, clear messaging is needed to cut through confusion and partisanship. Framing this work around shared values like innovation, infrastructure, opportunity, and local impact will help bring new voices to the table and expand support for workforce development efforts.

Charging Forward, Together

Mayor Stephanie Piko, Mayor of Centennial, Colorado, and co-chair of the Collaborative, emphasized the power of local resilience, collaboration, and “borrowing from others’ playbooks” rather than building in isolation. “Let’s learn from each other, adapt what works, and move faster together,” she said.

Ultimately, the message was clear: state leadership matters, and the Collaborative is a powerful vehicle to support this work. “We don’t have to reinvent the wheel,” Johnson noted. “But we do need to roll it faster, together.”",https://www.nga.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P4183317-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:03:05.270534

If it’s wrong, it may need to be corrected by the DMV before you file your EV credit paperwork.
What You Can Do If This Happens to You Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re applying for the Colorado EV tax credit: Double-check your registration.
Let’s Hear From You Have you tried applying for the Colorado EV tax credit for your Rivian?","You’d think that buying a fully electric SUV in a state like Colorado would come with a smooth path to incentives. After all, we’re constantly told that going electric is the future, and the tax breaks are part of the reward. But for some Rivian owners, that promise is turning into a paperwork nightmare that feels like it shouldn’t be this difficult.

This week, I came across a Facebook post from a Rivian owner named Mara, who shared her frustrating experience applying for the 2024 Colorado EV tax credit after purchasing a 2025 Rivian R1S. Despite submitting all the documents and proving that the R1S meets the weight requirement, she was still denied, with no real explanation from the state.

Here’s Mara’s post in her own words: “Hi, has anyone received a 2024 tax year credit for a 2025 R1S in Colorado? We were disallowed the credit because it didn't meet the GVWR for the light-duty passenger vehicle (it does, 8,532 lbs). When we provided the supporting documentation for GVWR, we were denied again without further explanation. We are appealing that decision, but wanted to see if there is some experience out there that perhaps we should be checking the box for 'light-duty electric truck' on our form instead of 'light-duty passenger motor vehicle.' We have looked through forums and see others have wrestled with the definitions and obtaining the credit, but didn't find any conclusive results. Curious if anyone has had success in claiming the credit and can explain their experience. Thank you!”

When the Right Specs Still Lead to a Denial

Let’s be clear: the Rivian R1S has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 8,532 pounds, plenty to qualify under Colorado’s light-duty vehicle incentive guidelines. So what went wrong?

The most likely culprit is the classification box that applicants have to check when applying. Mara suspects that selecting “light-duty passenger motor vehicle” instead of “light-duty electric truck” might have caused the rejection. And the scary part is, she’s not alone in thinking this small detail could derail the entire process.

In the comments under Mara’s post, another owner named Eddie shared this: “I also applied for the credit and I’m waiting on a decision. The registration has the wrong GVWR, so I’m assuming the Colorado DMV would need to correct it as well.”

That’s another twist, if your vehicle registration lists an incorrect GVWR, even when the manufacturer rating says otherwise, it could get flagged by the system. It’s entirely possible that the database the state uses doesn’t match up with Rivian’s specs, and that mismatch becomes your problem to fix.

The Fine Print That Trips You Up

There’s no public step-by-step for this kind of issue, which makes it all the more confusing. Mara submitted documentation showing the correct GVWR, but her appeal was denied again. No reasoning. No helpful feedback. Just a vague rejection that leaves her wondering if she misunderstood the form, or if the system just isn’t built for vehicles like hers.

And when you step back, it’s not hard to see how a new kind of SUV like the Rivian R1S doesn’t fit neatly into the old categories. It has the ride comfort of a luxury vehicle but the size and hauling power of a truck. As seen in this long-distance towing story where an R1S pulled a trailer 1,200 miles, it’s fully capable of truck-like work. So calling it a passenger vehicle or a light-duty truck both seem equally valid, and that gray area is exactly where issues like this start.

Paperwork Shouldn’t Be This Hard

If you’re in Colorado and recently bought an R1S, now’s a good time to check what GVWR is listed on your registration. If it’s wrong, it may need to be corrected by the DMV before you file your EV credit paperwork. Because as Eddie’s comment shows, the software Colorado uses to review applications may auto-reject anything that doesn’t align exactly with its own internal records.

Even though this feels like a minor technicality, the implications are huge. A state EV credit can be worth thousands of dollars, and for many owners, that money is factored into their budget and even their decision to buy electric in the first place. Being denied that credit can feel like a punch in the gut, especially when you’ve done nothing wrong.

And it’s not the only time R1S owners in Colorado have faced confusing or frustrating issues with their new vehicles. One owner shared how their 2025 R1S completely shut down while trying to precondition the battery, leaving them stranded in the dark with no warning.

Does the System Understand These Vehicles Yet?

There’s a broader conversation happening here, one that goes beyond just tax credits. EVs like the R1S are cutting-edge machines, and in many ways, the state systems we rely on haven’t caught up. Everything from DMV classifications to emissions exemptions to title paperwork can feel like it was written for a totally different generation of vehicles.

Just ask the owner whose R1S broke down suddenly after 2,000 flawless miles. Their story is another reminder that no matter how advanced these EVs are, the policies and processes built around them are often still stuck in the past.

A System That Needs an Update

When government paperwork becomes a barrier to clean vehicle adoption, something’s gone wrong. And unfortunately, that’s what seems to be happening here. Owners are left to sort out unclear classifications and file appeals without real guidance, all because a checkbox might be mislabeled or a database hasn’t been updated.

And it’s not just tax credits, another R1S owner recently reported a strange popping noise from their SUV after taking sharp turns, a mystery that even service centers were struggling to diagnose. While not directly related to tax forms, it’s all part of a bigger issue: Rivian owners are often blazing the trail in more ways than one.

What You Can Do If This Happens to You

Here’s what I’d recommend if you’re applying for the Colorado EV tax credit:

Double-check your registration. Make sure the GVWR listed is accurate. If it’s wrong, contact the DMV to get it fixed before you file anything.

Ask for clarification before submitting. If you’re unsure about which classification to check on the form, reach out to the Colorado Department of Revenue and ask which box applies to the R1S.

Talk to other owners. Forums and Facebook groups can be surprisingly helpful. As seen in this story about an RV trip that revealed a great fast charging station, Rivian owners often rely on one another to fill in the gaps.

Don’t be afraid to appeal. Just like Mara, you have the right to challenge a rejection, but keep copies of every document you submit and follow up consistently.

What This Says About EV Adoption in 2025

As someone who covers EVs every day, I’ve learned that the biggest barriers to adoption often aren’t about the cars themselves, they’re about the systems around them. The R1S is an impressive, capable, and forward-thinking vehicle. Even after being rear-ended, one owner found the repair process more complex than expected, revealing just how many cracks there still are in the infrastructure surrounding electric vehicles.

That’s why stories like Mara’s matter. Because they show that owning a Rivian, or any EV, isn’t just about embracing new technology. It’s about navigating outdated systems that weren’t designed with these cars in mind. And until those systems are updated, owners will keep running into obstacles that shouldn't exist.

Key Takeaways

Vehicle classification matters: If you're applying for the Colorado EV credit, double-check whether “light-duty passenger vehicle” or “electric truck” is the right choice for your R1S.

Check your registration for GVWR accuracy: A mismatch between what Rivian publishes and what the DMV lists can quietly cause your application to fail.

The appeal process lacks transparency: Even with the right documents, applicants like Mara are being denied without a clear reason, so persistence is key.

This isn’t an isolated issue: From charging mishaps to mechanical quirks, Rivian owners across the country are realizing that support systems still need serious modernization.

All of this raises the question: can the EV industry stand on its own without massive subsidies from taxpayers?
Meanwhile, even after the subsidies, Ford lost US$64,700 per EV in 2023 and US$32,700 in 2024.
(It’s also worth noting that Ford, with the second-highest EV production in the U.S., produced a mere 72,000 vehicles in 2023.)
Between 2014 and 2023, automotive production fell from 2.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles while automobile imports increased from $57 billion to $82 billion.","While Trump’s trade war continues to grab all the headlines, Canada’s electric vehicle (EV) industry may be steaming toward an iceberg, due mainly to shifts in policy south of the border.

Specifically, the Trump administration has withdrew from the Paris Agreement (and its net-zero 2050 framework) and eliminated the U.S. EV mandate, which required upwards of 56 per cent of new vehicles sold in the United States. to be EV and 13 per cent be plug-in hybrids by 2032. These moves represent an existential threat to Canada’s EV investments and the viability of the large EV battery plants under various stages of planning and construction in Ontario and Quebec.

Indeed, the Trudeau government, along with the Ontario and Quebec governments, negotiated several significant battery manufacturing deals, which included subsidies and construction funding totalling $4.6 billion for the Northvolt AB plant near Montreal, $13.2 billion for the Volkswagen plant in Saint Thomas, Ontario, $15 billion for the Stellantis plant in Windsor, Ontario and $1.6 billion for the Japanese battery company Asahi Kasei plant in Port Colborne, Ontario. (Although both Northvolt AB and Stellantis are reconsidering their EV battery investments in Canada—Northvolt AB is approaching bankruptcy and Stellantis thinks that current federal subsidies are insufficient to justify its investment.)

According to the Parliamentary Budget Officer, taxpayer subsidies (a.k.a. corporate welfare) for these deals will cost Canadians up to $44 billion between 2022/23 and 2032/33. In the U.S., EV sales in 2024 were 1.2 million (7 per cent of auto total sales) buoyed by an EV tax credit of US$7,500 per new vehicle, which translates into US$9 billion in EV consumer subsidies that year alone.

All of this raises the question: can the EV industry stand on its own without massive subsidies from taxpayers?

In 2023, of the two largest EV producers (Tesla and Ford), only Tesla would break even without the EV tax credit subsidies. According to Reuters, Tesla earned approximately US$8,300 in profit per EV in 2023, and of the 1.8 million Tesla vehicles produced globally, only 400,000 were produced in the U.S. Meanwhile, even after the subsidies, Ford lost US$64,700 per EV in 2023 and US$32,700 in 2024. (It’s also worth noting that Ford, with the second-highest EV production in the U.S., produced a mere 72,000 vehicles in 2023.)

While Ford still plans to make EVs, it recently announced plans to shift production at its Oakville, Ontario factory from electric sports vehicles to gas-powered pickup trucks. The news came shortly after General Motors announced it would trim its forecast of EVs produced in 2024 by 50,000.

Clearly, U.S. legacy automakers are worried about overproducing against sluggish consumer demand, knowing that their profitability and fiscal viability resides in their internal combustion engine vehicle production lines. Numerous large European automotive manufacturers also saw a decline in EV sales in 2024 and are re-investing in their combustion engine production lines to protect profits.

Finally, beyond only EVs, Canada’s automotive manufacturing sector is in decline. Between 2014 and 2023, automotive production fell from 2.4 million to 1.5 million vehicles while automobile imports increased from $57 billion to $82 billion. Of the 1.5 million vehicles produced in Canada in 2023, 88 per cent were exported to the U.S., leaving the industry highly vulnerable to shifts in American policy (which currently include President Trump’s threat of a 100 per cent tariff on automobile exports).

The iceberg is in view. The new Carney government and our provincial governments must take stock of the decline in the automotive manufacturing sector, its near total dependence on U.S. exports, and uncertain government-driven EV investments. And they should ask if the push to electrify the automotive manufacturing base is in the long-term best interests of Canadians.",https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/ev-production-line-1440.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 23:03:22.790672

The statement comes in response to a 2024 draft study published at the very end of the Biden administration detailing the environmental, economic and other impacts of gas exports.

The Biden administration’s study comes after it paused approvals on new gas export projects, saying it needed to reevaluate the broad implications of shipping more U.S. gas abroad. The administration included a 60-day comment period along with the draft study.

On Monday, the Trump administration published a response to those comments — giving some clues as to how it would assess gas export projects going forward.

The Trump commentary did not deny the environmental impacts found by its predecessor, including impacts to air pollution stemming from nearby communities.

But unlike the Biden administration, it said that these impacts are outside of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) jurisdiction, and therefore should not be considered in its approvals of gas export projects.

“Natural gas production, processing, and transportation have environmental effects. Federal, state, and local regulatory requirements that are outside DOE’s authority over LNG [liquefied natural gas] exports include measures to reduce or mitigate any potential related impacts,” the Trump commentary states.

It also said that “the denial of LNG export authorizations would be too blunt an instrument to address the concerns raised.”

This stands in contrast with the Biden administration, which said that “Understanding the many environmental and societal effects of natural gas production and export …is part of DOE’s consideration of the public interest in reviewing applications to export natural gas.”

In addition, the Trump-era commentary also downplays the Biden administration’s findings about the increases in price that would come with exporting natural gas.

The Biden administration found that “higher U.S. LNG export levels in 2050 are associated with higher U.S. residential natural gas prices.”

However, the Trump administration described any price increases as “relatively modest.”

Overall, Trump administration official Tala Goudarzi said in a written statement that the response to the study “will allow DOE to close out this chapter and fully return to regular order on LNG exports.”

“The 2024 Study confirms what our nation always knew — LNG supports our economy, strengthens our allies, and enhances national security. Biden’s opposition defied reason and reality and hurt American progress,” said Goudarzi, principal deputy assistant secretary of the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, in a written statement.

Environmental activists, meanwhile, described the Trump administration’s commentary as ignoring the costs of gas exports.

“No matter how hard they try to hide it, Trump’s DOE can not bury the truth that increased LNG exports are simply not in the public interest. The facts are clear, LNG exports raise costs to Americans’ energy bills, are disastrous for frontline communities, increase public health harms, and perpetuate the climate crisis. Big Oil and Gas CEOs are the only beneficiaries of a rubberstamp for LNG projects,” said Sierra Club beyond fossil fuels policy director Mahyar Sorour in a written statement.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/LNG_china_tariffs_02102025_GettyImages-2198779777.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:26.438457

That’s what renewable energy is all about: homegrown American energy, powering not just our homes, but our economy.
Thanks to renewable energy projects, local Texas communities have seen nearly $585 million in property, state and local tax revenues.
But America's energy future is being built on innovation, investment and independence — things renewable energy sources are delivering every day.","Opponents of renewable energy rely on fear and misinformation to attack wind and solar projects that are delivering real economic benefits to communities across Michigan. Though entertaining, the hit show Landman fits in this column, and misrepresents the renewable energy industry to paint it in a negative light. This hostile rhetoric is hurting American farmers who are benefiting greatly from these projects. Negative rhetoric may be loud, but the facts tell an entirely different story.

The truth is that renewable energy is a powerhouse for job creation, economic growth and helping our country achieve energy independence. Why shouldn’t we create energy in Michigan to be consumed by Michiganians? That’s what renewable energy is all about: homegrown American energy, powering not just our homes, but our economy.

In states across the country, renewable energy projects in the wind and solar sectors are generating millions in local tax revenue, helping to prevent future tax hikes, supporting American farmers with reliable land-lease payments and reducing energy costs for consumers. The show Landman misses the mark by pitting renewables against oil and gas in a world where the two can coexist as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy – very much like what President Donald Trump seeks. Our country stands to benefit from the good-paying jobs this America First energy strategy would bring. Michigan, for example, is home to more than 11,000 clean energy jobs, and the industry brings billions of dollars in new investments thanks to projects coming into the state.

Large-scale solar projects provide stable, long-term revenue for rural communities and landowners, helping farmers diversify income and keeping family farms operational into the foreseeable future — especially amid high inflation and intense competition on the global stage. These same solar projects are low maintenance, provide a stable source of energy to a rapidly aging grid known for its flaws, and, most importantly, can be made right here in Michigan.

Critics claim renewables are unreliable, but modern grid technology and battery storage advancements prove otherwise. Texas, for example — a state known for oil and gas and where the Landman show is set — ranks number one in generating power from solar and is among the top in generating power from wind. Together, renewables have the capacity to power 13.8 million homes. Thanks to renewable energy projects, local Texas communities have seen nearly $585 million in property, state and local tax revenues. Imagine these same benefits in other states. This is what putting America first means, not whatever Hollywood or the Paramount Network is telling you. Imagine what this could mean for Michigan. We could finally have our roads fixed!

The show’s opposition isn't about facts; it's about clinging to the past. But America's energy future is being built on innovation, investment and independence — things renewable energy sources are delivering every day. It's time to move past fearmongering and embrace the opportunities that clean energy provides. Our economy and our local communities depend on it — it's time we put America and Michigan first when it comes to energy.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the bill remained under negotiation.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans narrowly advanced President Donald Trump’s big tax cuts package out of a key committee during a rare Sunday night vote, but just barely, as conservative holdouts are demanding quicker cuts to Medicaid and green energy programs before giving their full support.

WATCH: What’s in the first draft of the GOP’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ cutting taxes and spending

Speaker Mike Johnson met with Republican lawmakers shortly before the meeting and acknowledged to reporters that there are still details to “iron out.” He said some changes were being made, but declined to provide details.

It’s all setting up a difficult week ahead for the GOP leadership racing toward a Memorial Day deadline, a week away, to pass the package from the House. The Budget Committee, which just days ago failed to advance the package when four conservative Republicans objected, was able to do so Sunday on a vote of 17-16, with the four hold-outs voting “present” to allow it to move ahead, as talks continue.

“The bill does not yet meet the moment,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, in a social media post immediately after the late-night session. “We can and must do better before we pass the final product.”

The path ahead for Johnson is unclear as he tries to hold his narrow House majority together to pass the president’s top domestic priority of extending the tax breaks while pumping in money for border security and deportations — all while cutting spending.

Republicans criticizing the measure argued that the bill’s new spending and the tax cuts are front-loaded in the bill, while the measures to offset the cost are back-loaded. In particular, they are looking to speed up the new work requirements that Republicans want to enact for able-bodied participants in Medicaid.

Johnson indicated he wants to impose the the work requirements “as soon as possible” but acknowledged it may take states longer to change their systems. Those requirements would not kick in until 2029 under the current bill.

“There will be more details to iron out and several more to take care of,” Johnson, R-La., said outside the hearing room.

“But I’m looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions over the next few days, and I’m absolutely convinced we’re going to get this in final form and pass it.”

More talks are ahead, but Johnson is looking to put the bill on the House floor before the end of the week.

Democrats have decried the cuts Republicans are proposing to Medicaid and food stamps to offset the costs of the tax breaks.

“This spending bill is terrible, and I think the American people know that,” Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “There is nothing wrong with us bringing the government in balance. But there is a problem when that balance comes on the back of working men and women. And that’s what is happening here.”

The first time that Republicans tried advancing the bill out of the House Budget Committee last week, the deficit hawks joined with Democratic lawmakers in voting against reporting the measure to the full House.

Those same four Republicans — Roy and Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia — cast their “present” votes Sunday.

Norman pointed to a recent downgrade of the nation’s credit rating in making his arguments for steeper reductions.

“We’ve got a lot more work to do,” Norman said. “We’re excited about what we did. We want to move the bill forward.”

At its core, the sprawling legislative package permanently extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump’s first term in 2017 and adds temporary new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and auto loan interest payments. The measure also proposes big spending increases for border security and defense.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, estimates that the House bill is shaping up to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the debt over the next decade.

Johnson is not just having to address the concerns of the deficit hawks in his party. He’s also facing pressure from centrists who will be warily eyeing the proposed changes to Medicaid, food assistance programs and the rolling back of clean energy tax credits. Republican lawmakers from New York and elsewhere are also demanding a much larger state and local tax deduction.

As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what’s currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.

Rep. Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the effort to lift the cap, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.

Rep. Jodey Arrington, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the bill remained under negotiation.

“Deliberations continue at this very moment,” Arrington said. “They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.”

If the bill passes the House this week, it would then move to the Senate, where Republican lawmakers are also eyeing changes that could make final passage in the House more difficult.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/2025-05-19T041515Z_1358030204_RC2QKEAWCCJY_RTRMADP_3_USA-CONGRESS-TAX-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 21:04:18.019159

The House Budget Committee advanced the package late Sunday after GOP leaders granted a group of conservative holdouts a number of concessions, but they did not say what those deals entail.

But Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said on social media, “Importantly the bill now will move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam.”

Four hard-line Republicans who opposed the bill Friday voted “present” Sunday to advance the package to the Rules Committee before hitting the floor.

And Rules says it will take up the measure at 1 a.m. Wednesday. That’s the earliest the panel can set floor debate parameters under certain procedural requirements.

Still, the far-right House Freedom Caucus posted on X that the legislation — as is — “does not yet meet the moment.” Roy said that’s partly because it leaves “almost half of the green new scam subsidies continuing.”

Leaders also have to contend with a group of blue-state Republicans who are similarly holding the line on state and local tax deductions. Another faction wants to see softer language on the restrictions and phase down of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits. And across the Capitol, Senate Republicans are watching closely, vowing to pursue additional changes to the bill’s tax and energy proposals.

“I couldn’t tell you what is in flux, what is fixed, what might change or not change,” said Budget Chair Jodey Arrington (R-Texas). “As you all well know, this process is fluid.”

He said conversations with members and leadership would happen through the week but rejected the claim by Democrats there were “side deals” happening in backrooms.

“I don’t know anything about side deals or any deals, I just know we are at a place where we can take a vote today,” Arrington said, noting formal changes would be in a manager’s amendment at Rules.

Before the committee vote Sunday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) expressed tepid confidence, adding, “We never stop working on these things.” He told reporters “minor modifications” were made over the weekend. “Not a huge thing,” he said. “Wait and see.”

On Friday after the first failed vote, Budget Vice Chair Lloyd Smucker (R-Pa.), who supports the package, argued the hard-liners who voted “no” actually support “most of what came out of the committee here. There’s just a few remaining issues. But yes, we want to get there as quickly as we possibly can.”

The budget reconciliation package, which Republicans are looking to approve by simple majority, also contains public land sales, changes to federal rulemaking and deep cuts to climate-related grants.

Clash over IRA credits

For months, warring factions in the GOP have fought over how to handle the Democrats’ 2022 climate law, with moderates pitted against hard-liners. While dozens of House Republicans have signaled an interest in protecting parts of the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, few have made clear they would tank the whole package over parochial energy interests.

Still, House Republican leaders have already told hard-liners a full repeal of the IRA’s clean energy subsidies would cost the bill crucial support, POLITICO reported.

Last week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.), who represents a toss-up district that also is host to a massive offshore wind project, approached Johnson on the House floor to request a meeting seeking changes that would ease the blow to renewable industry tax credits. There’s no indication the meeting has happened; Johnson’s office did not return requests for comment.

In particular, Kiggans and 13 others, have suggested a provision intended to disqualify Chinese companies from accessing the credits as too cumbersome. That’s a concern shared by many in the renewables industry.

“In general, we see where the Committee was trying to go,” said Yogin Kothari, chief strategy officer for the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition.

“That said, the language is complex and will take some time to unpack and there could be some implementation challenges that would result in unintended consequences in our efforts to reshore critical supply chains,” Kothari said.

As evidence of the division among Republicans on the IRA, the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs will hold a hearing Tuesday on the law’s negative effects to the energy industry.

One Democrat said the party failed to get through to voters — particularly Republicans in rural areas — about the benefits of the IRA programs across red states.

“There’s an intellectual inconsistency here: The people who are benefiting most from those provisions are the voters and the Republican colleagues who will continue to go after all the work that happened on climate,” said Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.).

“So what’s so hard in this moment is how do we as Democrats punch through to do a better job of shining a light on all that … because there seems to be a disconnection in the public,” Balint said.

Senators eye more changes

As House members spar over portions of the reconciliation bill, a number of senators have been mulling tweaks of their own.

Some want more aggressive spending reductions; others prefer a softer touch and could add new wrinkles to the process in the coming weeks.

Some senators could try to put new pressure on leadership to delay some of the tax credit phaseouts and other changes the House is pursuing.

Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of four Republican senators who last month signed onto a letter calling for a “targeted, pragmatic approach” to the tax credits, suggested she has qualms with the current package.

Asked last week whether she would vote for the “big, beautiful bill” as is, she quipped, “As far as I know, it’s not beautiful yet!”

From the other side of the spectrum, Energy and Natural Resources Chair Mike Lee (R-Utah), who like House conservatives is seeking more savings, was more blunt. “There is still time to fix it,” he said in a social media post last week.

“We MUST deliver on President Trump’s promises to the American people, enact real, immediate, and lasting spending cuts, and eliminate the Green New Scam,” he said on X.

Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former luxury car dealer, said he prefers an outright repeal of the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles extending to all manufacturers, not just ones that have sold more than 200,000 cars, as the House bill proposes.

“Certainly, my inclination is when that bill gets to the Senate, that the EV subsidies need to go away immediately — not phased out and not [with] any kind of artificial limitation in terms of volume,” he said.

Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a Budget Committee member and the chair of the Senate Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, said he was pleased with some of the House’s proposals on energy and climate programs, including rescinding unobligated IRA funding for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office.

“We need to take all that money back and start over,” Kennedy said. However, he added he still wants to “change a lot of it.”

Wind and solar power reduce our dependence on polluting fossil fuels, with big benefits for our environment and health. That’s why it’s welcome news that Massachusetts ranked 5th in the nation for electric vehicle charging ports and 11th for solar generation at the end of 2024. Here in the Bay State, and in fact, across the country, renewable energy technologies have grown rapidly over the past decade.

Anyone who’s gone to the Mullins Center at UMass has likely parked their car under a solar canopy. It’s become commonplace to find yourself behind an electric vehicle at a Rt. 9 stoplight, and the costs of solar panels have come down to the point where local property developers are proposing to use solar panels to screen equipment on the roof of a proposed new building, instead of relying on other materials to get the job done.

Every year more Americans have gone solar or taken advantage of energy-efficient technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles that can run on renewable energy. Some do it for the environment, some do it because it makes financial sense. After all, many of these technologies pay for themselves over time through utility bill savings, but upfront costs can remain a barrier to wider adoption. That’s where tax credits come in.

Tax credits make it possible for more Americans to choose to power their lives with clean energy by lowering the costs of going solar, buying or leasing an electric vehicle, installing charging or making a home or business more energy-efficient. The incentives cover up to 30% of the cost of many clean energy upgrades. In 2023, 3.4 million Americans used these tax credits for clean energy or energy efficiency home improvements, saving more than $8 billion, and helping spur adoption.

These clean energy tax credits are popular, but despite public support behind the policy, some in Congress continue efforts to dismantle tax credits, with a ramp up in intensity when the House Ways and Means Committee began debate Tuesday on a budget proposal last week that would take away tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels or energy-efficient heat pumps at the end of 2025.

Some leaders are speaking out. In addition to widespread support among Democratic members of Congress, 21 House Republicans have written to the Speaker of the House and 4 Republican senators wrote to the Senate Majority Leader cautioning against a wholesale repeal of clean energy tax credits.

Clean energy advocates, myself included, have been working to show how America benefits when we get more of our power from renewable sources. From Cedar Rapids, Iowa to Anchorage, Alaska and Bakersfield, California to Omaha, Nebraska supporters of renewable energy are making the case. In recent months, the solar-powered headquarters of Crayola and Frank Lloyd Wright’s architectural masterpiece Falling Water have hosted solar tours to tell the story of how renewable energy is helping them. Churches and schools, as well as breweries, nature centers and hog farms are sharing their stories too.

We all benefit when we get more of our energy from renewables. The solar and wind power we’ve already installed in the U.S. have already cut health-threatening sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution from power plants by nearly 1 million metric tons between 2019 and 2022 – enough to prevent an estimated 1,400 premature deaths in 2022. These renewable energy sources have also cut global warming pollution by 900 million metric tons between 2019 and 2022 — an amount of pollution greater than the state of Texas emits in a year. Not to mention the reduced threats to our waterways such as coal ash spills and leaks of fracking wastewater.

A rapid shift to clean, renewable energy will give us healthier, more vibrant communities today, and a more livable future for our kids and grandkids. And we all have a role to play. It will take individuals, businesses, houses of worship, and others to help make the switch to renewable energy for a cleaner, healthier world; both through their own behavior and through their advocacy.

If you’ve already taken steps to power more of your life with renewable energy, I urge you to join the Voices for Clean Energy organizing project, which highlights the stories of folks from across the country who are choosing to take steps to reduce energy waste and power their lives with clean energy.

And if you don’t yet have your own clean energy story to tell, but hope to at some point, you can email your member of Congress and urge them to oppose efforts to take away tax credits for energy efficiency and renewable energy, so that it’s easier for more people to choose clean energy.

“Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, J.D.
“To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable.
Sales Satisfaction Index Study, which found EV buyers shopped three dealer brands compared to 2.5 for gas-powered vehicle shoppers.
Power concludes that the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues.","Despite uncertainty around future EV interest and potential economic headwinds hanging over the automotive industry, consumer demand has remained stable, according to J.D. Power’s 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study.

Twenty-four percent of vehicle shoppers surveyed said they would “very likely” consider purchasing an EV, and 35% said they would “somewhat likely” consider the purchase, both of which remain unchanged from a year ago, according to the study.

“Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, J.D. Power’s executive director of EV practice, in a press release. “To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns — many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

Of those who said they would “very likely” consider buying an EV, cross-shopped an average of 2.9 brands, while those who say they are “somewhat likely” shop an average of 2.8 brands. J.D. Power found the same to be true in its 2024 U.S. Sales Satisfaction Index Study, which found EV buyers shopped three dealer brands compared to 2.5 for gas-powered vehicle shoppers.

“As more EV options come to market, this should serve as an encouraging sign for automakers because it’s an opportunity for them to gain a foothold and pull shoppers from outside their brands,” Gruber said, in the release. “This year’s study results also show that EV shoppers consider products from mass market and premium brands alike, highlighting the opportunity to capture consumer interest with brands or products that shoppers may not have otherwise considered.”

Charging station availability remains shoppers’ top concern, with 52% citing it as a reason for not purchasing an EV.

J.D. Power concludes that the continuing concern with charging, coupled with flattening overall EV interest, points to a lack of progress in consumer education on these issues. However, while consumer rejection due to purchase price has dropped 4 percentage points year-over-year to 43%, concern with cost of ownership has dropped 2 percentage points to 33%.

The study also found that 17% of consumers in the 25-49 age range have an annual income of over $100,000.

“It’s an interesting dichotomy because younger consumers are the most receptive to EVs, but also the least likely to be able to afford them, while older consumers have the financial means but show less interest,” Gruber said, in the release. “Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products.”

Midwest states are least enthusiastic about EVs, with the lowest shares of consumers who say they are “very likely” to consider purchasing an EV living in Wisconsin and Kentucky (18% each), Minnesota (17%), and Ohio (16%).

J.D. Power says this is influenced by several factors, including concerns about EV performance in cold climates and the stronger loyalty of consumers in these regions to traditional automakers.

This year’s study is based on responses from 8,164 consumers who said they intend to buy or lease a new vehicle in the next year, and was fielded from January through April 2025.

Recently, some state governors have paused EV sales incentives and/or requirements, including Delaware and Vermont.

On May 13, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott issued an executive order directing the Agency of Natural Resources to pause enforcement of a multi-state plan requiring vehicle manufacturers to meet certain EV sales targets for passenger cars and medium- and heavy-trucks.

“I continue to believe we should be incentivizing Vermonters to transition to cleaner energy options like electric vehicles,” he said, in a press release. “However, we have to be realistic about a pace that’s achievable. It’s clear we don’t have anywhere near enough charging infrastructure and insufficient technological advances in heavy-duty vehicles to meet current goals. We have much more work to do, in order to make it more convenient, faster, and more affordable to buy, maintain, and charge EVs. When we do, it’s more likely everyday Vermonters will make the switch.”

Scott said he remains committed to addressing climate change, including advocating for more charging infrastructure, but emphasized that when it comes to transitioning to a low-carbon future, mandates are not going to be the total answer. Instead, using common sense and incentivizing technological advancements are necessary to overall success, and the new compliance flexibility is intended to reflect that reality, he said in the release.

At the federal level, EV tax credits remain in limbo, according to a May 6 Bloomberg article in which U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said House Republicans might end the credit.

President Donald Trump has made EVs a policy focus, including proposing to cut $15 billion in clean energy projects and subsidies as part of his recently released budget outline.

However, some automakers continue to move forward with expanded EV plans.

Last week, at the Financial Times Future of the Car Summit in London, Kia announced it would carry out the world’s first trial of a Battery Passport vehicle — a digital-first solution that tracks and analyzes EV batteries at the cellular level.

“The trial vehicle is capable of monitoring live data for each battery cell and uploading it to a digital passport,” said Jens Brech, Kia’s director of ownership experience. “This close analysis will help extend battery life, reduce long-term costs, and build greater customer trust in EV batteries.”

Kia also unveiled its PV5, the automaker’s first Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), and its collaboration with Motability Operations to develop a wheelchair-accessible variant (WAV) of the PV5. The PV5 caters to ride-hailing, last-mile delivery, trades, families, and camper vans.

The House Ways and Means Committee also proposed phasing out various tax incentives, aiming to fuel the expansion of wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other transition technologies.
Meta is also in the nuclear game, seeking up to 4 GW in nuclear capacity for its data centers.
North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, for instance, has an idea of removing only the subsidies for wind and solar but not for nuclear.
The nuclear industry, hopefully, has a better memory about that.","Last week, Republican legislators caused an uproar in wind and solar circles by proposing what amounts to a decimation of subsidies for these industries—and EVs as well. But the lawmakers did not stop with wind and solar. They are cutting incentives for nuclear as well. The nuclear industry is up in arms. It has AI movers and shakers on its side.

Last Monday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce proposed phasing out tax credits linked to climate policies stipulated in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. This, per the Committee, will raise some $6.5 billion. The House Ways and Means Committee also proposed phasing out various tax incentives, aiming to fuel the expansion of wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other transition technologies.

Naturally, wind and solar companies were less than happy to hear this, especially since they’d been lobbying legislators hard in the months since President Trump took office. The lobbying effort has focused on legislators representing districts that have been on the receiving end of IRA subsidies and on scare tactics about job losses and a worsened outlook for “American families”.

Nuclear has also joined the push against subsidy phaseout with its own lobbying effort. According to a Financial Times report from Sunday, the industry has been lobbying Congress to stop short of removing subsidies for new nuclear facilities, and it has been lobbying it hard. One nuclear tech firm, Oklo, linked financially to OpenAI’s Sam Altman, for instance, upped its spending on lobbying by 500% on the year to 424,000. Constellation Energy, Microsoft’s partner in Three Mile Island, spent more than $1.7 million on lobbying in the first quarter, a 17% annual increase, per the FT.

That Three Mile Island reopening deal that Microsoft struck with Constellation Energy last year was one of the signs that nuclear is making a comeback—and a major one. Google’s partnership with modular reactor developer Kairos for 500 MW of capacity was another sign. Amazon was not far behind, buying a stake in another modular reactor company, X-energy. Meta is also in the nuclear game, seeking up to 4 GW in nuclear capacity for its data centers.

Data centers and artificial intelligence—this is what is driving the nuclear rush that has benefited from the IRA incentives that GOP legislators now want to remove, along with wind, solar, and EV subsidies. Artificial intelligence is pushing electricity demand higher, and the outlook for this demand is so unanimously bullish that the need for more generating capacity is taken for granted. The thing about nuclear is that it costs a pretty penny upfront, and it’s nice to have a part of that financial burden shouldered by a cooperative federal government.

“It’s hard to overstate the value of the tax credits on helping to de-risk early-stage capital and project developments . . . if the idea is to lead and dominate in this space, we need to use all the tools in the tool belt,” the chief executive of that Sam Altman-supported nuclear company, Oklo, told the FT.

The tools in this case are the investment tax credit and the production tax credit, among half a dozen others. They are essential, the industry argues, for advancing new nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors, which have enjoyed a lot of hype but have struggled to really take off. Yet the tax credits are also essential for large-scale new nuclear because of the price tag it tends to come with—and Republicans in the Senate know it.

This is the good news for the nuclear industry: Senate legislators who don’t mind slashing subsidies for wind and solar do mind slashing them for nuclear and some have already indicated the authors of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” would have to make some changes if they want it to pass the upper house of Congress.

North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer, for instance, has an idea of removing only the subsidies for wind and solar but not for nuclear. “I don’t think it’s fair to treat an emerging technology the same as a 30-year-old technology,” Cramer said, per Politico, referring to wind and solar, on the one hand, and small modular reactors, on the other.

But here’s a twist: some nuclear companies actually welcome the threat of subsidy removal. “Industries that rely on federal subsidies tend to get stuck in ruts and less favourable towards innovation,” Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, told the FT. “I like the direction that the administration is taking on this, in allowing it to be private and faster.”

Indeed, businesses relying on federal subsidies tend to get stuck in ruts. Look no further than wind and solar for evidence of this. These industries are a lot more active in the lobbying push right now because they know they will not survive for long without subsidies—and they have long forgotten how to compete on the free market. The nuclear industry, hopefully, has a better memory about that.

The company expects to move to mass production in the near term through its global manufacturing partners.

The compact, lightweight SiCore cell delivers up to 80% more energy than conventional lithium-ion cells using graphite anodes, according to Amprius. This translates to extended flight time, greater range and improved system-level performance, as well as lower system cost.

SiCore meets the demands of High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS), Medium-Altitude Platform Stations (MAPS), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where energy density, weight and endurance have a direct impact on mission success. Operators can fly longer missions, minimizing the need for additional batteries, fuel, or equipment.

The cell is being evaluated and Amprius plans to move into qualification with leading aviation and defense customers to prepare for commercial deployment. The company expects to receive UN38.3 certification, which is required for the safe air transport of lithium-ion batteries, during the current quarter. This will allow Amprius to begin volume shipments shortly afterward and support broader commercial deployment worldwide. The company says it has built a global contract manufacturing network with gigawatt-hour-scale production capacity to meet demand.

The chemicals, collectively called PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), are linked to a variety of serious health risks. Over the past several years, they have increasingly been found in farm soils due to the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, causing devastation for farmers. They are also now widely found in drinking water, in the foods Americans eat, and in pesticides, and experts say more research is needed to understand their impacts and find effective ways to eliminate contamination.

According to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) website, the EPA canceled a $1.6 million grant to Texas A&M University for researchers to analyze how plants take up and store the chemicals, and to develop monitoring tools for PFAS in fertilizer, soils, and irrigation water. It canceled another $1.6 million grant to Michigan State University to study how the chemicals accumulate in both crops and livestock. “The expected outcome is to improve the knowledge of the PFAS life cycle in a farm setting,” the researchers wrote in the MSU grant description. “Direct beneficiaries include farmers, agricultural advisors, human health and the environment.”

Additional canceled grants include a University of Florida study looking at how flooding might exacerbate PFAS contamination in water and soil and an Oregon State project to increase understanding of PFAS toxicity. EPA also cut funding to a study on common pesticides called neonicotinoids, which are linked to pollinator declines, in rural drinking water.

The grant cancellations, posted to DOGE’s website between May 6 and May 8, were in line with reporting The New York Times published last month that found the EPA was planning on cutting grants in the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program. Some cancellations were also linked to the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, where the agency is planning to cut staff by up to 75 percent.",https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/250519-epa-pfas-research-grants-cut-1-top-credit-getty-images.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 19:06:07.552580

“Terminating PFAS grants would be an extremely damaging development.” Regardless of the reason, Pingree said she considers the termination to be illegal and unconstitutional.
Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination.
The research The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil.
UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure.","With the brief window for fiddlehead foraging nearing its close, citizens of the Mi’kmaq Nation hope to collect the traditional food source this week from the Aroostook River flood plain to test as part of their research into understanding, and in turn reducing, forever chemicals in the food supply.

However, they may no longer be able to afford to do the testing they’d planned.

Following months of preparation after securing federal funding in September, the team received an email from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Mission Support on May 13 stating that their four-year grant had been terminated, effective immediately.

“The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” the email read.

The EPA terminated all of the ten grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in plants and animals, including two others to Maine-based teams led by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood.

The termination of these grants, each for roughly $1.6 million, are some of the latest examples of the billions of federal dollars the Trump administration has blocked despite already being appropriated by U.S. Congress.

“It’s complete overreach,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “We’re going to appeal. We’re also seeking legal aid.”

Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, UMaine awarded federal grants for forever chemical research

The Passamaquoddy Tribe also plans to appeal the termination of its grant, said Marvin Cling, environmental director for the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point. UMaine did not provide comment regarding whether they intend to dispute the decision by the time of publication.

The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. But crafting that argument is complicated by the fact that the EPA has given contradictory statements regarding why the grants were terminated and whether or not they are in line with the agency’s priorities.

Conflicting agency response

In a statement provided to Maine Morning Star in response to a request as to why the research no longer aligns with priorities, the EPA equated the grants with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures.

“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”

There is no mention of DEI or environmental justice in the Maine teams’ research plans or overall objectives of the grant program.

“This is a matter of public health,” said Frey Corey, information technology director for the Mi’kmaq Nation who is a researcher for the Tribes’ grant. Corey has worked with the EPA since 1996 when he started managing natural resources for the Tribe.

“There’s been funding challenges over the years — there’s no doubt about that,” Corey said. “But in terms of how they’re operating, this is really unusual.”

Democratic U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree of Maine, who helped secure that funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star this response from the EPA was “not only incredibly disappointing, it’s absurd.”

“To suggest that supporting tribal health and environmental safety — in this case, by studying PFAS contamination in their ancestral waters — is some kind of ‘radical agenda’ is both offensive and deeply ignorant,” Pingree said. “How many times do we have to make clear to this administration that tribes are not ‘DEI’?”

The response the EPA provided to Maine Morning Star runs counter to the agency’s press releases in recent weeks, which highlight a focus on combating PFAS contamination, including through partnerships with tribes. It is also directly at odds with the response EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Thursday.

After Zeldin outlined that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?”

Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward.”

In early May, the agency announced a significant reorganization with major cuts to staffing, especially to its Office of Research and Development, the part of the agency that provides scientific analysis on environmental hazards. Pingree has called those changes a blatant abuse of public health and the agency’s core mission.

Pingree told Maine Morning Star that she felt Zeldin’s response on Thursday was a non-answer.

“The only good thing was he did emphasize that he understood it was appropriated funds,” Pingree said.

But in light of the EPA’s response to Maine Morning Star, Pingree added, “Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, also told Maine Morning Star she reached out to the agency last week about the grant terminations and is continuing to press leadership to get a clear answer about their status.

“Research into PFAS mitigation is critically important for our farmers and rural communities, work I am urging the EPA to continue without delay,” Collins said in a statement. “Terminating PFAS grants would be an extremely damaging development.”

Regardless of the reason, Pingree said she considers the termination to be illegal and unconstitutional.

She is encouraging the grantees to go through the appeals process but said she will continue to question EPA leadership on the terminations, including during hearings for the proposed budget, which outlines a 55% funding cut to the EPA that would directly impact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection.

Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination. It was the first state to require manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in their products and has established a host of assistance programs to help farms continue to operate while also protecting public health.

“It’s just doubly cruel of the EPA to take that money back from Maine when we’ve been such a leader in dealing with this critical toxin in our environment that we have so much more work to do on,” Pingree said.

The research

The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil. It also represents a new model that centers Indigenous communities who have deep knowledge of the land on which this work is being conducted.

The collaboration between the Mi’kmaq Nation, University of Virginia, Upland Grassroots and Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station dates back to 2019, when they came together to test ways to clean toxins from the former Loring Airforce Base in Aroostook County, which now belongs to the Mi’kmaq Nation.

The team has seen early success with using hemp plants to remove PFAS from soil — a process called phytoremediation. These are the findings that led the group to apply for the EPA grant to further study how this method and others can help reduce contamination from irrigation on farms, a well-known reality for Aroostook County.

After receiving the grant in September, the team began the initial phase of the research, which has three overarching focuses.

Randy Martin, executive director of the Central Aroostook County Soil and Water Conservation District, planned to study how irrigation from the Aroostook River causes PFAS build up in soil and then ultimately in crops. Martin started this winter monitoring contamination levels, watering plants using the Aroostook River and harvesting them for testing.

The Mi’kmaq Nation is focused on how widespread PFAS contamination is in the ecosystem, including medicinal and culturally relevant plants, such as fiddleheads as well as ash wood, which the Tribe has long used for basketweaving.

With the grant now in limbo, the team is planning to freeze these samples with the hope that they can still be studied in the future, as testing makes up the bulk of the cost.

Researchers at the University of Virginia created biosensors to detect PFAS, a twist on the idea of sentinel plants, which are alternative species that display visible symptoms of infection to provide warning signs. Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at UVA, said the grant was going to help expand testing to the field.

“Our work is directly focused on delivering solutions to farmers and communities affected, which we did and continue to do now,” Berger said. “It also provides crucial data for regulatory decisions, and offers industries a cost-effective compliance tool — ultimately safeguarding public health while reducing environmental remediation costs across all sectors.”

Before the EPA terminated the grant, the team published a paper demonstrating how one application of this technology could be used in monitoring environmental water quality and a report for growers that shows how PFAS accumulates in potatoes grown in northern Maine.

“We’re proud of how much we accomplished in a short time, and frustrated we weren’t given the chance to complete our work,” Berger said.

Berger, Stanley and Corey said the team is committed to continuing its research despite the grant termination. If it is not eventually reinstated, they plan to explore private funds.

The other two Maine-based projects had similar but distinct aims.

UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure. The EPA terminated UMaine’s grant on May 10, according to its website.

The Passamaquoddy Tribe, specifically the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point, planned to assess PFAS in water and fish from watersheds in Tribal and disadvantaged regions of Northeastern Maine to inform the health of those in the area who depend on recreational fisheries as food sources. The Tribe had been in the process of hiring someone to do the research when it received notice of its grant termination on May 12, Cling said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/planting-2.jpg.webp,N,,2025-05-19 18:09:09.763387

The decision by Judge Richard Gergel, a U.S. District Court judge for the District of South Carolina, represents one of the first final judgments in a case challenging the Trump administration, as it has fired employees, frozen funding and dismantled agencies, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center. The organization, along with the Public Rights Project, filed the case on behalf of the nonprofits and municipalities from Baltimore to San Diego. The affected groups received funding for climate and environmental work through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act during the Biden administration, as well as through separate federal programs.

“This is a huge victory for us today,” said Kym Meyer, litigation director at the Southern Environmental Law Center and lead attorney on the case. She said the order would set an important precedent and characterized the decision as “a ruling that reaffirms that the executive branch doesn’t have the authority to disregard Congress.”

Gergel announced his decision during a hearing in Charleston that came after the Trump administration, in a filing Friday, said it would concede to the plaintiffs’ claims on 32 of the 38 grants. The judge said he would enter a final judgment calling on the administration to restore the funding immediately. The order was expected within a few days. Despite the administration’s concessions, its attorneys indicated they planned to appeal over jurisdictional concerns.

In their initial complaint, the plaintiffs had claimed that the executive orders freezing the grant funding represented an “unlawful interference by the executive branch” and also violated the First Amendment, which protects free speech. Two additional groups later were added as plaintiffs to the litigation. The plaintiffs said they were forced to furlough employees and pause programs supporting farmers, communities and public health.

Among the executive orders the litigation cited was “Unleashing American Energy,” intended to stop money designated under the IIJA and IRA, which provided historic funding for climate change and clean energy initiatives. The other orders were “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” and “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative.”

The 32 grants affected by the judge’s decision Monday were awarded under the IIJA and IRA. The other grants were provided under a Department of Agriculture program called Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, which was cancelled in April over concerns about inefficient spending and alignment with Trump administration priorities.

Following his confirmation, Zeldin indicated on Feb. 12 that the EPA would not rest until the grant funds had been recovered.
They continued requesting access to funds until Citibank informed them on March 3 that it had forwarded the request to the EPA for further guidance.
On March 11, the EPA sent three termination letters to the green energy groups.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A D.C. Circuit panel appeared doubtful Monday that the Environmental Protection Agency followed the law when it suddenly terminated nearly $14 billion in clean energy grants, citing potential fraud concerns.

The Justice Department asked the appellate court to overturn a preliminary injunction blocking the EPA and the Treasury Department from clawing back the funds currently held in the grantees’ accounts at Citibank.

The grants, part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program authorized under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, were awarded to fund efforts for clean energy projects across the country. Climate United received $6.97 billion, Coalition for Green Capital $5 billion and Power Forward $2 billion.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin issued three termination letters to the grantees, effective immediately, “based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste and abuse and misalignment with the agency’s priorities.”

Zeldin specifically highlighted an “absence of adequate oversight controls,” “improper or speculative allocation of funds” and “circumvention and defeat of key oversight mechanisms in the disbursement of federal funds.”

Adam Unikowsky, of Jenner Block and representing the grantees, argued Monday that the EPA’s justification was not factual because any grant recipient, including sub-grantees that receive funds to construct the projects, has monitored bank accounts.

“The question in this case is whether the EPA has the authority to just terminate the whole program and re-obligate the funds just because it disagrees with the decision of the prior administration,” Unikowsky said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard, a Barack Obama appointee, pressed Justice Department attorney Jacob Roth over separation of powers concerns sparked by the EPA's canceling of congressionally appropriated funds.

“EPA has been really clear on this, from in the termination letters and in every statement it's made, that this is not some sort of frontal assault on the appropriation or Congress’s objective,” Roth said. “There’s a whole series of grants, like the solar grants, that were not touched because they don’t implicate the structural problems with these particular grant agreements.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee, expressed concern that finding any separation of powers issue would set a precedent for a slew of constitutional claims anytime the executive fails to terminate a contract as specified by statute.

Unikowsky pushed back, arguing that Climate United and the fellow grantees’ claims were a special case because the EPA violated the appropriations clause rather than a usual statute.

“Suppose EPA simply announced that it doesn’t care about what the act of Congress says, it’s the executive branch, it has the unilateral authority to terminate contracts at will,” Unikowsky said. “I think that would raise some separation of powers and constitutional issues.”

Pillard noted that the facts of the case seem to undermine the Justice Department’s case, pointing both to Zeldin’s public comments and the EPA’s actions at the outset of the case.

Following his confirmation, Zeldin indicated on Feb. 12 that the EPA would not rest until the grant funds had been recovered.

During a Feb. 23 Fox News interview, Zeldin made clear what he thought about the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, stating “the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.”

According to the grantees, they first learned their funds had been frozen in mid-February when they placed their regular request to Citibank to release the funds but received no response.

They continued requesting access to funds until Citibank informed them on March 3 that it had forwarded the request to the EPA for further guidance. During this time, the EPA did not respond to similar requests from the plaintiffs.

The agency offered to meet with Climate United around Feb. 24, then rescheduled the meeting three times before ultimately canceling without explanation.

On March 4, the Treasury instructed Citibank not to disburse the funds through March 9, after which the EPA ordered the freeze to be continued indefinitely.

Climate United sued, seeking a temporary restraining order on March 8, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan scheduled a hearing for March 12. On March 11, the EPA sent three termination letters to the green energy groups.

Chutkan, an Obama appointee, granted the temporary restraining order on March 18, then granted a preliminary injunction on April 15, finding that the EPA had never explained its freeze of the funds or why the programs’ wholesale cancellation was necessary.

U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, rounded out the panel.

The administration also will rescind planned regulations for other PFAS chemicals found in water systems.
What are PFAS chemicals?
PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally in the environment or in the human body.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost everyone in the U.S. has at least some PFAS chemicals in their blood.","The Trump administration announced on May 14 it will keep the first-ever regulations on two of the most widely-known “forever chemicals” found in public water systems, including here in Indianapolis.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would keep the Biden administration’s 2024 regulations for PFOA and PFOS, but would extend the period for public water systems to come into compliance to 2031, two years later than originally planned.

The administration also will rescind planned regulations for other PFAS chemicals found in water systems.

Here’s what you need to know.

What are PFAS chemicals?

PFAS are a group of thousands of chemicals, such as PFOA and PFOS, that were made to manufacture products that are resistant to heat, water, grease and stains. Products include Teflon nonstick pans, clothing and other products sold and manufactured in the state.

They are also used to produce items like microchips and medical devices.

PFAS chemicals are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally in the environment or in the human body. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost everyone in the U.S. has at least some PFAS chemicals in their blood. Some PFAS chemicals can stay in the human body for years.

Until 2024, there were no enforceable limits on how much of any PFAS chemical was allowed in drinking water.

Which PFAS are now regulated?

The EPA will keep a 4 nanograms per liter limit on PFOA and PFOS, some of the oldest and most studied PFAS chemicals.

They were created in the late 1940s by Minnesota-based manufacturing company 3M and have been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, liver damage, lower antibody response to some vaccines and other adverse health effects.

State public water system testing found PFOS in Speedway’s drinking water at 2.3 nanograms per liter, a level below the national limit. PFOA and PFOS were also found in water wells used by the town of Speedway and Citizens Energy Group for drinking water.

Public water systems will have until 2031 to meet the new standards.

Which PFAS regulations will be dropped?

The Trump administration said it would eliminate limits for PFHxS, PFNA and HFPO-DA — the latter of which is a chemical more commonly known as GenX. All three are PFAS chemicals that served as replacements for PFOA and PFOS. If allowed to take effect, the regulation would have limited each chemical to 10 nanograms per liter.

It also plans to drop the Hazard Index, a formula that would assess how the combined levels of those three chemicals, plus another called PFBS, affect drinking water systems and require further action to limit their levels at water systems.

PFBS was found in treated drinking water supplied by Citizens Energy Group, and both PFBS and PFHxS were found in Speedway’s treated water.

PFHxS has been found in untreated water used by Speedway and Citizens Energy Group, PFNA has been found in Speedway’s water wells and GenX in Citizens Energy Group water wells.

The EPA has not announced when it would submit a proposed rule to eliminate these regulations.

EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize the rule in early 2026.
2 MCLGs are the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health.
3 Under the MCL Rule, the MCL for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water supplies is 4 parts per trillion and the MCLG is zero.
§ 300g-1(b)(9) (1996) See the Safe Drinking Water Act here.","On May 14, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it plans to retain the current drinking water standards for two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), i.e., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), but delay related compliance deadlines from 2029 to 2031. Notably, EPA now intends to rescind regulations for four other PFAS covered in the Biden-era PFAS drinking water rule. EPA plans to issue a proposed rule this fall and finalize the rule in early 2026.

On April 10, 2024, the EPA under President Biden established Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)1 and Maximum Concentration Level Goals (MCLGs)2 for six PFAS (the MCL Rule), including PFOA and PFOS, which gave public water systems until 2029 to complete water treatment system adjustments and infrastructure upgrades, as may be necessary, to comply with the MCLs.3 EPA now plans to develop a rulemaking to extend the compliance date to 2031 and rescind the regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX), and the Hazard Index mixture of these three plus PFBS. EPA also stated that it will support the defense of the MCL Rule with respect to PFOA and PFOS in the ongoing legal challenges to the rule.4 In its May 14, 2025 announcement, the agency hinted at “holding polluters accountable”, stating that “the need for a polluter pays model has guided a lot of the work to be done at EPA in the future.”

Environmental groups criticized the announcement, expressing concerns about the impact on public health and stating that the plans are in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “anti-backsliding provision.”5 Industry groups applauded the EPA’s stance as necessary and pragmatic. The Association of State Drinking Water Administrators responded that with the current 2029 deadline under the Biden-era MCL Rule, “states and water systems are struggling with the timeframes to complete the pilot testing, development of construction plans, and building the necessary treatment improvements.”

The EPA’s May 14, 2025 announcement can be found here.

1 MCLs are the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCGLs as feasible using the best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration. MCLs are enforceable standards.

2 MCLGs are the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. MCLGs allow for a margin of safety and are non-enforceable public health goals.

3 Under the MCL Rule, the MCL for PFOA and PFOS in drinking water supplies is 4 parts per trillion and the MCLG is zero. For the four other chemicals, EPA had set the MCLs and MCLGs at 10 parts per trillion.

4 The MCL Rule is currently being challenged in the D.C. Circuit court by industry groups and utilities. See American Water Works Association, et al v. EPA, et al (24-1088) (D.C. Court of Appeals)

5 Section 1412(b)(9) of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended in 1996 requires that: ""The Administrator (of EPA) shall, not less often than every 6 years, review and revise, as appropriate, each national primary drinking water regulation promulgated under this title. Any revision of a national primary drinking water regulation shall be promulgated in accordance with this section, except that each revision shall maintain, or provide for greater, protection of the health of persons."" 42 U.S.C. § 300g-1(b)(9) (1996) See the Safe Drinking Water Act here.

Clean air protections don’t hold us back, they help communities thrive.
It also limits the EPA’s ability to enforce clean air and water protections or hold corporations accountable when they pollute.
These moves don’t make us safer—they endanger lives and threaten decades of hard-won gains on public health.","As Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin prepares to testify before Congress this Wednesday—where he’s expected to downplay the real-world harm caused by his actions—his recent op-ed in the New York Post and public announcements offer a preview of the misinformation to come. Zeldin claims the Trump administration is cracking down on so-called “environmental justice scams” and refocusing on “real threats to water and air,” all under the banner of fiscal responsibility. But the reality looks very different. Under his leadership, EPA is systematically dismantling nearly core clean air and water protections, giving polluters a free pass while communities are left to bear the consequences. Here’s what Zeldin says—and what the facts actually show.

Zeldin’s Claim: Public Health Will Be Fine Without Health Protections

Zeldin confidently asserts that the Trump administration’s plan to gut 31 public health safeguards have “absolutely” no adverse health effects on people.

The Truth: Just 12 of the 31 environmental rollbacks proposed by the Trump administration could cause nearly 200,000 premature deaths in the next 25 years and trigger more than 10,000 asthma attacks every single day. These rollbacks include weakening mercury and air toxics limits for coal plants, limits for chemical air pollution from factories, and gutting wastewater protections for oil and gas operations. The estimates come from the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA officials sounding the alarm on the deadly consequences of dismantling basic public health safeguards.

Zeldin’s Claim: Eliminating ‘Environmental Justice’ Grants Is Justified

Zeldin criticized environmental justice initiatives, labeling them as “scams” and accusing them of misusing taxpayer money. He points to grants awarded to organizations like the Climate United Fund, which received nearly $7 billion despite being newly established.

The Truth: Getting rid of environmental justice programs takes away one of the few tools people have to stand up to pollution in their neighborhoods. (Even House Speaker Mike Johnson sought an environmental justice grant for his Louisiana district). Research shows that low-income communities and communities of color are much more likely to breathe toxic air, live near factories, highways, and waste sites—places where the air is harder to breathe and the water isn’t always safe to drink. These programs have long helped remedy those unfair conditions by reducing disparities between who has access to clean air, clean water, and a safe place to live, across the nation.

Zeldin’s Claim: Cutting Health Protections Will Drive Economic Growth

Zeldin and the Trump administration claim that stripping away environmental safeguards will jumpstart economic growth, especially in industries like energy and manufacturing. They argue that removing so-called “regulatory burdens” will lead to job creation and more investment—even if it means loosening protections that keep air and water clean.

The Truth: Pollution doesn’t just harm our health—it drives up healthcare costs, leads to missed work, and leaves taxpayers with the cleanup bill. And despite what some claim, it’s not necessarily good for the economy. An Earthjustice review of federal data shows that 14 major metro areas grew their economies while cutting pollution—including Dallas, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Detroit, to name just four. Clean air protections don’t hold us back, they help communities thrive. And in places already struggling financially, more pollution only makes people sicker and harder for them to get ahead.

Zeldin’s Claim: Firing Staff and Reorganizing the EPA Will Improve Efficiency

While Zeldin was firing hundreds of EPA employees, he also announced a major reorganization of the agency—including the creation of new offices focused on air partnerships, clean air programs, and applied science. He claims these changes will enhance transparency and efficiency

The Truth: Restructuring the EPA while slashing its workforce and budget undermines the very efficiency Zeldin claims to promote. Pushing out experienced staff and cutting funding weakens the agency’s ability to protect public health and the environment. It also limits the EPA’s ability to enforce clean air and water protections or hold corporations accountable when they pollute. At a time when pollution, chemical exposure, and climate threats are growing, hollowing out the EPA makes it less effective—not more.

Administrator Zeldin’s claims about the benefits of gutting protections and scrapping community-focused programs fall apart under even the briefest scrutiny. These moves don’t make us safer—they endanger lives and threaten decades of hard-won gains on public health. But Earthjustice isn’t standing by. We’re fighting alongside communities across the country to protect clean air, safe water, and a healthy future from Zeldin, the Trump administration, and corporate polluters.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/lee_zeldin_2k.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 18:09:17.170905

Going after clean vehicles undermines a transition to electric vehicles (EVs) that is crucial to America’s economic success and global competitiveness.
The incentives ensure that the vehicles are affordable, and the standards ensure that automakers deliver on their promises on EVs.
Add to the mix already soaring vehicle prices thanks to recently introduced tariffs, and clean vehicles would be unfairly penalized and would become unaffordable for a large proportion of the U.S. population.
These proposed new taxes on clean vehicles are supposedly meant to shore up Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues, but they won’t make a dent in projected revenue shortfalls.","Clean vehicles are facing a triple threat from the House of Representatives, one that would harm consumers, autoworkers, and all of us who rely on cleaner air and a safer climate. The majority’s bill that would slash taxes for billionaires would eliminate clean vehicle tax credits that have allowed tens of thousands of Americans afford a new car; gut clean vehicle standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and impose a new and unprecedented fee on owners of electric vehicles.

Going after clean vehicles undermines a transition to electric vehicles (EVs) that is crucial to America’s economic success and global competitiveness. The United States is the global leader for attracting EV investments, with more than $300 billion in investments in new domestic factories to date. These investments are creating good jobs in states from Georgia to Michigan.

The combination of tax incentives and EPA standards is driving this transition. The incentives ensure that the vehicles are affordable, and the standards ensure that automakers deliver on their promises on EVs. In fact, this powerful combination of policies will save drivers $6,000 on the cost of owning a new vehicle while also helping spur EV sales and saving the country $13 billion a year from fewer asthma attacks and lung and heart disease.

Despite the benefits of these measures, the legislation passed by party-line vote in committees last week would gut both of these measures. The House Ways and Means committee measure would eliminate the $7,500 credit when buying a new electric vehicle and, in a totally unprecedented maneuver, the Energy and Commerce bill would overturn the commonsense and beneficial EPA standards.

Given the broad benefits to consumers and industry, the Senate should jettison both of these provisions as they make no sense.

In addition to the attack on incentives and EPA standards, the House proposal also includes a more novel attack on clean vehicles: a substantial annual tax of $250 for EV owners and $100 for hybrid vehicle owners. Additional taxes for EVs, combined with a repeal of clean vehicle tax credits that make it more expensive to buy a clean vehicle, would significantly erode—or in states that already have other punitive fees on EVs in place, erase—the fuel cost savings that driving on electricity should provide.

Add to the mix already soaring vehicle prices thanks to recently introduced tariffs, and clean vehicles would be unfairly penalized and would become unaffordable for a large proportion of the U.S. population. State EV fees and taxes already overburden EV drivers compared to their gasoline counterparts. Thirty-nine states collect EV-specific registration fees on top of conventional vehicle registration fees ranging from $50 to $250, often far exceeding what drivers of conventional vehicles pay in state gas taxes. Some states also subject EV owners to additional charging fees and electricity taxes.

All these state and proposed federal charges lumped together mean that, on average, EV drivers pay more than double what gasoline vehicles pay. All vehicles on the road contribute to the maintenance of America’s transportation infrastructure in some way and people who drive the cleanest vehicles should not pay more than those driving gasoline and diesel vehicles.

These proposed new taxes on clean vehicles are supposedly meant to shore up Highway Trust Fund (HTF) revenues, but they won’t make a dent in projected revenue shortfalls. EVs account for less than 2 percent of vehicles currently operating on American roads. If Congress is serious about returning the HTF to solvency, it needs to address the real problem: the fact that gas tax revenues have been shrinking as a result of inflation.

While the need remains to identify a long-term solution to generating revenue for the HTF, discussions about clean vehicles should be part of a holistic approach to funding transportation in the long term and should be included as part of the surface transportation reauthorization process, which dictates the level of money allocated to transportation programs and determines the sources of funding.

In April 2025, 34 environmental, health, and industry organizations signed a letter calling for Congress to oppose proposals to include new taxes for clean vehicles in the budget reconciliation process and to develop a fair and transparent approach to transportation funding through bipartisan surface transportation negotiations.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-05/woman-charging-electric-car-curbside-station-DSC00793.jpg?h=790be497&itok=g-PoSFJl,N,,2025-05-19 17:08:33.959969

By Eric Starkman

Let’s hope U.S. auto writers don’t fatally choke on the free-range egg splattered across their collective faces.

For more than three years, mainstream and trade auto journalists have promoted the false narrative that GM CEO Mary Barra is a “transformative” environmental leader boldly disrupting a complacent auto industry and championing the adoption of electric vehicles. Fortune last year named Barra America’s most powerful female business leader, citing her EV credentials, and the year before, ranked her alongside Elon Musk as one of the auto industry’s top disruptors.

InsideEVs even named Barra its 2024 Person of the Year.

“Under Barra’s leadership, GM executed an electric turnaround that may be taught in business schools someday,” gushed editor Patrick George. “That took some doing, and it’s why she is the InsideEVs Breakthrough Awards’ Person of the Year for 2024.”

Barra’s leadership may indeed be studied in business schools—but likely as a cautionary tale. Her story is one of chasing prevailing political winds and making strategic pivots based on short-term optics, all while relying on the expectation that U.S. taxpayers will endlessly subsidize GM’s operations, including its faltering EV ambitions.

After Joe Biden—whom Politico reported had a close relationship with Barra—was elected, Barra styled herself as an EV evangelist. She pledged to make GM an all-electric manufacturer by 2035 and embraced Biden’s climate agenda.

“As Chairman and CEO of General Motors, I now have a unique opportunity—and responsibility—to use my engineering mindset to help make the world a better place on a much larger scale,” she said. “At General Motors, we have a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It is our north star that guides everything we do.”

Falling Short

Barra’s results have so far fallen far short of her stated goals and objectives.

Barra famously predicted GM would outsell Tesla in EVs by the end of 2025. In the first quarter of this year, Tesla sold 336,681 EVs, while GM moved just 31,886. Even though GM’s EV sales nearly doubled, they still made up just 5% of the company’s total U.S. volume—well below the national average of 7% for EVs overall.

In California, the most EV-friendly state in the country, GM’s performance has been especially dismal. Even the Tesla Cybertruck—dismissed by the media as a commercial failure—outsold most of GM’s electric offerings in Q1. The one exception: the Equinox EV, which qualifies for generous U.S. tax credits despite being manufactured in Mexico, and beginning in 2025, with key parts sourced from Mexico and South Korea.

Now, in what amounts to a tacit admission of failure, Barra appears to have shifted course again—this time siding with the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken California’s aggressive EV mandates.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GM urged thousands of its white-collar employees in Michigan to contact U.S. senators in support of legislation that would overturn California’s landmark rule banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035—a mandate since adopted by 11 other states.

“We need your help!” read the GM email. “Emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

A GM spokeswoman, who the Journal unfortunately didn’t identify, said GM wants to protect “consumer choice.” That’s comical, given that five years ago, Barra pledged to eliminate gas-powered options entirely by 2035.

This isn’t Barra’s first alignment with a Trump-era environmental rollback.

In 2019, the Trump administration moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own stricter emissions standards—a power the state had exercised for decades to accelerate clean vehicle adoption. Rather than standing with California and other environmentally forward states, GM backed the Trump administration, joining a coalition supporting efforts to weaken federal fuel economy rules and undercut California’s regulatory independence.

By contrast, Ford, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen signed a voluntary agreement with California to meet tougher emissions targets. GM’s position sparked swift backlash from Democratic lawmakers and environmental advocates, who rightly accused Barra of hypocrisy.

When President Biden took office, Barra reversed course again—rebranding herself as a climate ally. Just months after Biden assumed command, Barra announced a $1 billion investment to convert GM’s Ramos Arizpe plant in Mexico for electric vehicle production. The move infuriated the United Auto Workers, who saw it as a betrayal of American labor.

“At a time when General Motors is asking for a significant investment by the U.S. government in subsidizing electric vehicles, this is a slap in the face for not only UAW members and their families but also for U.S. taxpayers and the American workforce,” former UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in response. “GM automobiles made in Mexico are sold in the United States and should be made right here, employing American workers. That is why our nation is investing in these companies. Taxpayer money should not go to companies that utilize labor outside the U.S. while benefiting from American government subsidies. This is not the America any of us signed on for. Frankly, it is unseemly.”

Trump's Tariffs

Even more unseemly: Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which extended generous tax breaks to EVs built in Mexico—including the Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Optiq. If not for Trump-era tariffs, Barra likely would have shifted even more EV production to Mexico, where GM is the country’s largest automaker.

Barra’s latest pivot is no surprise. GM last fall abandoned its self-imposed goal of building 400,000 EVs by mid-2024 and has twice delayed the reopening of its Lake Orion plant, which was slated to produce the electric Silverado. The company also pushed back the launch of a new Buick plug-in hybrid.

Notably, nearly half of GM’s Buick dealers took buyouts in 2023 rather than invest in the infrastructure needed to sell and service EVs—suggesting they may have had a better read on consumer demand than Barra herself.

Still, GM’s latest retreat from its electrification targets hasn’t sparked any humility within its leadership ranks.

Last week, Dave Richardson, a former Apple executive who now oversees software at GM, told reporters the company is working on a breakthrough called “mechatronics”—a system that integrates mechanical, electrical, and computing systems in vehicles. Tesla has been deploying this type of technology for more than a decade.

Given Richardson’s background, one might assume that integrating GM’s vehicle apps with the Apple Watch would be an easy win. Yet the project has been suspended because of glitches -- while Tesla rolled out seamless Apple Watch integration last December.

Meanwhile, GM claims to have made a significant advancement in battery technology with its lithium manganese-rich (LMR) chemistry, which reportedly offers 30% greater energy density at the same production cost and helps reduce reliance on Chinese intellectual property.

“LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets,” said Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability. He added that the new chemistry would “advance American battery innovation and create jobs well into the future.”

Silicon Valley Hotshots

Kelty, formerly of Tesla and Panasonic, and Richardson are among several Silicon Valley hotshots recruited by Barra to help recast GM as a tech-forward company. Yet while GM’s top tech leadership is based in California, Barra insists the company’s headquarters remains in Detroit—even though CNBC recently reported that President Mark Reuss’s office is located at the Warren Tech Center.

Every media interview I’ve read with Barra the reporter noted that it was conducted at GM’s Tech Center.

Richardson and Kelty have been with GM for less than two years. Time will tell whether they stick around. Notably, Barra last year trumpeted the hiring of JP Clausen, another ex-Tesla executive, to lead GM’s global manufacturing.

“JP’s unique expertise in global manufacturing innovation, engineering, and operations will accelerate our ability to deliver on our vision for GM with the highest quality vehicles for our customers,” Barra said in a press release.

Clausen recently disclosed on LinkedIn that he had left GM, citing that the decision “makes sense for me and my family right now.”",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_mary_7_58037.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 21:04:31.297585

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China.

But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.
While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them.","On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives proposed lowering emissions requirements while also ending federal tax incentives pertaining to all-electric vehicles. This initiative is being led by House Republicans and would be executed under more comprehensive tax reform legislation.

The proposal is being reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee at the time of this writing and seeks to end the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and up to $4,000 credit for used models by the end of this year. However, the plan will allow a grace period (ending in 2027) that would permit automakers who had not yet reached 200,000 EV sales to continue taking advantage of the program.

Absent from the plan are any provisions to end federal subsidies of battery production, provided the work is being done without help from China. EV batteries produced within the United States would be fine. But any units manufactured under Chinese licenses or using components made by select Chinese companies will be deemed ineligible.

According to Reuters, this still sent some groups into a tizzy. While environmental organizations have become less enamored with EVs due to the ecological concerns surrounding the manufacturing and disposal of batteries, some of the largest entities still support them unconditionally. But it was the industry groups that had the most to say about the proposal thus far.

From Reuters:

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans “to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.”

The proposal, she said, would deliver “an enormous market advantage” to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

There is certainly a case to be made that the U.S. would be foolish to totally abandon embracing new technologies. But it could just as easily be argued that China still has the most to gain from global electrification, regardless of where the manufacturing takes place, due to how much of raw materials required for battery production pass through its borders. China presently holds a staggering 70 percent of the world lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity. That effectively means Central Asia controls the global supply chain.

Ergo, China likewise benefited from the manufacturing incentives initiated under Joe Biden. But many of those joint ventures fell through as additional scrutiny was given to industry partnerships and those efforts have only ramped up under Trump. Still, billions upon billions in government subsidies have likewise gone to South Korean companies as part of subsequent joint ventures with U.S. brands to build batteries domestically. A significant amount of money is still technically being sent offshore to swiftly increase U.S. battery production and determining how much of that is necessary will be tricky for legislators who want to see more electric vehicles produced as soon as possible.

As part of the House proposal designed to curtain emissions and end EV tax credits, there are likewise provisions to eliminate some of the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Programs, including those pertaining to battery production.

Working against the House Republicans’ efforts is the fact that the automotive-related inclusions only represent a fraction of what’s in the larger bill. It’s not inconceivable that other components could serve to undermine its passing. This is ultimately a budget reconciliation bill and includes items pertaining to cutting back Medicaid, numerous welfare programs, and loads of environmental spending. Bipartisan support likewise seems to be lacking and isn’t anticipated to come up due to how much the proposal targets climate and “environmental justice” initiatives.

However, both the House of Representatives and Senate presently have Republican majorities. The likelihood of President Trump signing off on the legislation, should Congress pass it, is strong as well. He attempted to reduce U.S. fuel economy standards during his first term on the premise that it would allow manufacturers to build less complicated and more traditional vehicles boasting lower price tags. He contended that this would simultaneously boost American manufacturing, due to the fact that those products could be less reliant on foreign-made electronics.

Trump has tacitly supported ending EV tax credits in the past. But the assumption at the time was that they would eventually exhaust themselves as part of the vehicle quotas they were attached to. However, the 200,000 car limit was done away with during the Biden administration (which made pivoting America to EVs a major platform) and EV subsidies effectively became indefinite, if manufacturers could adhere to the content requirements. That latter aspect is likely something Team Trump would have probably supported. But the current administration seems more committed to ending the EV subsidies than ever.

While one might assume that Tesla CEO Elon Musk endorsing Trump during the 2024 campaign might discourage the president from wanting to end the EV tax credits, Musk has repeatedly come out against them. The assumed reasoning is that Tesla was the first automaker to manufacture enough electric vehicles to exhaust the quota and has little to gain by allowing legacy brands to continue benefiting from government subsidies.

The final angle to this ludicrously complicated issue pertains to how the automotive lobby ultimately responds. The industry is incredibly influential in terms of setting policy and has some deep pockets. Whether we’re discussing restrictions on imported trucks via the “Chicken Tax,” creating emissions loopholes via the “Footprint Rule,” extending EV subsidies, or securing billions of dollars in bailouts after going bankrupt in 2008, the automotive sector has a tendency of getting its way.

However, the industry cannot control everything and even the best-laid plans can sometimes backfire. For example, the response to aggressive emission mandates from Western governments was to have the auto lobby help carve out special exemptions for larger vehicles and subsidize electrification indefinitely. While this temporarily boosted profit margins on just about every vehicle sold, automakers are now confronting a situation where a large amount of new product is out of reach for the average customer.

Small, affordable vehicles boasting superior reliability have effectively evaporated from the North American market. Tiny, increasingly complex powertrains are simultaneously becoming the norm and mandated technologies help balloon MSRPs. The push toward EVs has likewise failed to progress at a pace industry leadership assumed would be financially viable. While nothing can be truly assured, much of the public has signaled they’re not altogether pleased with the direction the industry has been heading and we’re starting to see vehicle sales reflect that.

It’s plausible that the industry would absolutely embrace a reduction in emission requirements at this juncture. But there is still a lot of free money (for lack of a better term) from the taxpayers being left on the table if the subsidies are done away with. Meanwhile, the fact that this is all part of an expansive budget reconciliation bill means it’ll undoubtedly go through numerous changes before the matter is settled",https://i0.wp.com/automotiveamerican.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-10.png?fit=720%2C480&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-19 22:02:23.613614

And by growing role, we mean there’s plenty to talk about on Toyota’s hydrogen horizon.

And it’s not just in cars.

Stacked in the beds of Toyota Tundra pickup trucks, these mobile power generators can be taken across the country, from California to as far east as Florida providing cleaner power for a variety of events.*

“You’re using hydrogen, so you’ll have energy with the only byproducts at point of use being power and water,” said Craig Cauthen, who manages Emerging Technologies at Toyota Racing Development (TRD).

Generating a Speedy Process

In 2021, Cauthen and a handful of engineers on the TRD engineering team in Costa Mesa, California, were asked to develop a fuel cell generator system based on technology from the first-generation Toyota Mirai.*

“Once we figured it was possible, we said, Let’s make it portable. Let’s make it lightweight. Let’s make it easier to move around,” Cauthen said.

Powerful Events

The team recognized that the fuel cell generators could be used at local and Toyota-sponsored events around the U.S. that needed off-grid power.*

From live performances to racing events, these fuel cell generators have powered outdoor events nearly silently and with zero emissions at the point of use. Not only can they provide cleaner energy, but they’re also sensory positive.

“If you’ve ever been to an event, concert, or anyplace like that, there are always generators running,” Cauthen says. “These fuel cell generators are relatively quiet. You can have a conversation next to them while they’re running. You can power just about anything if you have a tank of hydrogen.”*

Spreading the Word While Moving in Silence

It can be an eye-opening experience to learn that a fuel cell generator can power so much while remaining virtually noise-free.

“From an R&D standpoint, we heard that TRD had this fuel cell generator in the Tundra and wanted to give it more face time with the general public,” says Debby Byrne, an executive program manager at Toyota. “So, I think from the advanced product planning office [APPO], we wanted to get more information about hydrogen and hydrogen technology, fuel cell technology, out into the public.”

Byrne adds, “I think a lot of people are familiar with EVs (electric vehicles) but not fuel cells. So, it was an opportunity to kind of take what TRD had done and then showcase it in different demonstration events.”

For example, the fuel cell generators had been used to power three food trucks in Detroit during a community event, delivering 10 kilowatts of power.

“Normally when you have a food truck rally, every single one has that diesel generator,” she says. “It’s loud and you smell those fumes rather than the food that you’re trying to eat. So, it was a good opportunity to partner with the City of Detroit to showcase this technology.”

Fueling the Future

Byrne also believes the future looks bright for fuel cell generator opportunities and more.

“From a global standpoint, Toyota has pushed fuel cell technology as something that is scalable,” says Byrne. “So, we really want to showcase how fuel cell technology has the capability to work in many different applications almost seamlessly.”

Added Cauthen: “Hydrogen fuel cells are a technology that can be used now. It’s not a far-off dream or a concept technology. Fuel cells can be done today. They are here.”

Last year, town officials applied for a grant to clean up the site. First opened in the 1900s, the three acre site has sat abandoned for decades. Studies revealed the soil is still caked with asbestos, lead, and other toxic chemicals. The property was going through foreclosure when the town bought it last year, according to the Wilkes Journal-Patriot.

On May 12, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an interim final rule significantly extending the reporting deadlines for PFAS reporting under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The extension postpones the start of the reporting period by nine months—from July 11, 2025, to April 13, 2026—and sets a new submission deadline of October 13, 2026, for most manufacturers. Small manufacturers who import PFAS-containing articles will now have until April 13, 2027, to comply.

This extension responds to feedback from stakeholders and is designed to give EPA additional time to finalize and test the electronic reporting system. Significantly, EPA’s delay also provides industry more time to prepare for what many have described as a complex and demanding reporting obligation. According to its May 12, 2025 update, “EPA is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment,” and the “delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.” That statement, coupled with EPA’s April 28 announcement that it would minimize the burden on article importers and small businesses, may mean that EPA is already considering future rule changes.

Scope and Purpose of the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting Rule

The 2023 final rule marked a significant expansion of EPA’s data-gathering authority over PFAS. Issued pursuant to the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which amended TSCA to mandate reporting on PFAS, the rule requires any entity that manufactured or imported PFAS, including as components of articles, between 2011 and 2022, to report a broad range of information. This includes data on chemical identity, production volumes, uses, byproducts, disposal practices, worker exposure and known environmental or health effects.

EPA’s stated objective is to build a comprehensive inventory of historical PFAS manufacturing and importation in the US to support future regulatory action, risk evaluation, and risk management efforts. Given the growing regulatory and public health focus on PFAS as a class of persistent and potentially harmful chemicals, the reporting rule represents a critical step in the federal government’s effort to close longstanding data gaps.

Implementation Challenges and the Basis for Extension

In issuing the interim final rule, EPA cited the need for additional time to develop and test the electronic reporting platform that will be used to receive the required information. The agency emphasized that the extended timeline will not only allow for technical improvements but also enable regulated entities to provide feedback on the tool’s usability and to request clarifying guidance on reporting expectations.

Stakeholders across multiple industries have raised concerns about the complexity of the reporting requirements and the burden associated with reconstructing over a decade of historical data. In particular, trade associations such as the RV Industry Association (RIVA) have highlighted the difficulty for article importers—especially small businesses—with limited access to upstream supplier information. These concerns appear to have factored heavily into EPA’s decision to issue the interim final rule, as the agency acknowledged the need to provide reasonable timeframes for compliance and reduce the likelihood of widespread reporting errors.

Implications for Manufacturers, Importers and Article Handlers

The extended deadlines offer short-term regulatory relief but underscore the need for companies to begin preparing now. Manufacturers and importers must identify all PFAS that they handled from 2011 to 2022. Importantly, the reporting obligation applies even if the PFAS was imported unintentionally or as part of a complex product. The scope of required data, such as information related to environmental and health effects, will necessitate significant internal coordination and engagement with suppliers.

While EPA has not yet modified the substance of the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements, companies should not postpone their due diligence efforts to determine whether any such changes may impact their reporting obligations, as the delay is an acknowledgment that compliance will require substantial, time-consuming effort and that additional guidance and outreach will be critical. The final version of the reporting tool, once released, may also influence how companies structure their data collection efforts in the coming year.

Conclusion

By balancing regulatory objectives with industry feedback and technological readiness, EPA aims to facilitate more accurate and complete PFAS reporting submissions. The regulated community should view this extension not as a reason to delay preparation, but as an opportunity to carefully align compliance strategies with EPA’s guidance and technological updates. As EPA advances its broader PFAS agenda, including potential future restrictions and risk management rules, early and thorough compliance with the reporting rule will be essential.",https://www.mgmlaw.com/assets/images/mgm-og-social.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 17:08:37.290321

“For more than three decades,” Kelly said, “the Energy Star program has helped American families shop for reliably energy-efficient home appliances that would save them money.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) launched the Energy Star program in 1992 as part of the Clean Air Act. The program was passed with strong bipartisan support under the President George H. W. Bush administration. It’s used to designate and promote energy-efficient appliances and architecture. Energy Star’s 33-year run may soon end, however.

Since 1992, Energy Star has helped U.S. families and businesses save $500 billion in energy costs, and has staved off approximately 4 billion metric tons of climate pollution in the form of greenhouse gases. Energy Star Buildings meet stringent performance metrics established by the EPA, based on a 1 to 100 scale—buildings must achieve a 75 for Energy Star rating.

A recent Office of Air and Pollution (OAP) meeting alerted reporters to the Trump administration’s plan to terminate the program. EPA director Lee Zeldin, on May 2, announced plans to scale down the EPA more broadly, albeit without explicitly mentioning the Energy Star program.

AN emailed EPA in regard to Energy Star’s pending termination. “In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” EPA told AN.

Zeldin said the White House’s proposed changes to the EPA could save taxpayers $300 billion, but didn’t give details as to how. Zeldin also said, “EPA expects to have employment levels near those seen when President Ronald Reagan occupied the White House.”

Jeanne Shaheen, Democratic Senator of New Hampshire, called the decision to terminate Energy Star a win for billionaires.

“Let’s be clear: Cutting the popular Energy Star program—which helps everyday households and businesses save on their energy bills—would mark another rash attempt by this administration to line the pockets of billionaires and utility companies at the expense of hardworking Americans,” Shaheen said in a statement.

Ted Kelly, U.S. Clean Energy, Environmental Defense Fund director, was also quick to respond.

“For more than three decades,” Kelly said, “the Energy Star program has helped American families shop for reliably energy-efficient home appliances that would save them money. Generations have looked for the blue Energy Star label in stores when they were buying a refrigerator or dishwasher and wanted something they could trust.”

Kelly continued: “Companies chose to participate in the voluntary program because they knew their customers liked it.”

After the decision was made public, over 1,000 companies wrote letters to the EPA in support of the Energy Star program. Vivian Loftness, an architecture professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said: “This takes us out of a position of leadership.”

In an op-ed published in The Washington Post, William K. Reilly, former EPA administrator, called it “a case of mistaken identity.” Adding that, “In its antipathy to climate activism, the EPA has taken an ax to that rare government program embraced by both seller and buyer, builder and environmentalist, because everyone comes out ahead.”

The announcement comes not long after other defunding efforts—Medicaid, for instance. The proposed 2026 federal budget deprives architecture schools and nonprofits of vital resources, as part of National Endowment for the Arts cuts.

Zeldin previously slashed EPA spending, taking aim at $2 billion in grants that would have supported sustainability initiatives, DEI, natural disaster relief, and environmental justice work.

The first is a revamp of Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards for certain PFAS in drinking water. The second is an update to Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) timelines for reporting PFAS use. As we previewed in our April 30 note, these actions are part of a multifaceted effort by the Trump EPA to update the agency's approach to PFAS issues, with likely more to come. This note provides a summary of the changes and how their implementation may proceed in light of certain congressional and judicial scrutiny.

PFAS in Drinking Water

On May 14, the EPA announced its intention to make changes to national drinking water standards regulating certain PFAS. In a press release, the EPA described plans to extend the compliance dates for two PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) but rescind regulations for four other substances pending further EPA consideration.

By way of background, in April 2024, the Biden EPA issued a rule to limit levels of certain PFAS compounds in drinking water. That rule established enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for six PFAS compounds: 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA and 10 ppt for four other compounds: PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA (a.k.a. GenX). Compliance with the MCLs was to occur no later than 2029.

In its recent announcement, the EPA said it will extend the compliance date for PFOA and PFOS by two years to 2031. The EPA also announced that it intends to rescind regulations for the other four PFAS compounds and will reconsider how they should be addressed. EPA states that this action is ""designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these."" The Agency plans to issue a proposed new rule for public comment in fall of 2025 and a final rule in the spring of 2026.

Reaction has been varied—drinking water utilities have been generally positive, as they will benefit from additional time to meet the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, while environmental and some health groups have raised concerns. The move drew immediate attention from Congress, where EPA Administrator Zeldin faced senators on May 14 who questioned the agency's plans to address PFAS. Zeldin defended the actions as appropriate and reaffirmed his commitment to ""fulfill all statutory obligations."" We anticipate legal challenges to the new rule, as well as continued attention from Congress in the months ahead.

TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting

On May 13, the EPA published an interim final rule to amend the data submission period for the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS reporting rule. Under that rule, manufacturers (including importers) are to electronically report information regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, disposal, exposure, and hazards for activity beginning in 2011. Reporting was originally to occur over a six-month window beginning in November 2024 but was delayed to July 2025 and is now being reset to April through October 2026. Small manufacturers have until April 2027 to file their reports. EPA states this latest adjustment is to allow for sufficient time to develop and validate the software needed to receive the required data.

Of note, the Federal Register notice states that at this time the only change to the Section 8(a)(7) rule is the data submission dates. However, the notice also states the EPA ""intends to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future that will, among other things, allow for further comment on the appropriate reporting period."" Just as importantly, the EPA indicated that more substantive changes to TSCA reporting could occur: ""the Agency may, in a future separate action, reopen other aspects of this rule for public comment in light of Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulations (90 FR 9065, January 31, 2025).""

When Congress created TSCA 8(a)(7) in 2019 by statute, it specified that reporting was to cover actions since January 2011. Any change to the covered reporting period sought by EPA would likely need action by Congress. The Agency has signaled interest in actions to reduce the regulatory burden, particularly on small businesses, including in its April 28 press release: ""Implement section 8(a)(7) … without overburdening small businesses and article importers,"" a possible reference to a de minimis exemption or other modification to the reporting requirement.

What Happens Next?

Stakeholders should remain focused on how the EPA moves forward on PFAS matters. The Agency, as it laid out in its April 28 announcement, will continue to evaluate the suite of PFAS rules and regulations as it looks to create its own path forward. In addition to the expected drinking water rules previewed above, announcements are also expected regarding the 2024 hazardous substance designation of PFOA and PFAS under CERCLA and other measures under consideration. Congress continues to discuss PFAS matters, including how best to handle CERCLA liability for ""passive receivers,"" and will most certainly remain actively engaged with the EPA.

All of these regulatory actions, of course, are being litigated by affected parties and the Agency, even as the EPA alters the rules at issue.[1] Those actions (and perhaps new ones) are likely to continue, albeit with new underlying legal and substantive disputes. We anticipate that litigation will continue for the foreseeable future.

It has helped families save money, cut climate pollution, improve air quality, and made appliances more efficient – simply by helping people make smarter choices about the products they use every day. Utility companies, manufacturers and retailers have used the Energy Star program to market efficient products and set energy efficiency incentive programs.

However, this critical program is on the chopping block.

Current administration officials recently announced to their staff that Energy Star would be eliminated. This move would gut one of the most effective and bipartisan tools for fighting climate change, improving public health and lowering household energy bills. This isn’t just bad policy – it’s a direct assault on public health, consumer choice, and environmental progress.

We cannot afford to let this happen.

What is Energy Star?

The roots of Energy Star go back to the early 1990s with the EPA’s Green Lights Program. The idea was forward-thinking for the time: encourage organizations such as businesses, governments and schools to voluntarily upgrade their lighting systems to more energy-efficient options. Participants were asked to install efficient lighting in at least 90% of their spaces over five years—but only if it made financial sense and didn’t compromise lighting quality.

This initiative laid the groundwork for something bigger. In 1992, the program evolved into what we now know as Energy Star and has since grown to cover more than 60 product categories, becoming the gold standard for energy-saving products and practices. Supported by businesses, utility companies and millions of households, Energy Star and the now-iconic blue label is a key pillar of U.S. energy policy.

The Benefits: Real Savings, Cleaner Air and a Healthier Climate

Energy Star isn’t just a label—it’s a powerful tool for saving money, cutting pollution and protecting public health. Since its launch, the program has helped American families and businesses save over $500 billion on energy bills, thanks to products that use less energy than standard models. These savings are especially meaningful for low- and moderate-income households, who often spend a higher portion of their income on utilities. But the benefits don’t stop at cost savings.

By reducing energy consumption, Energy Star also slashes greenhouse gas emissions—preventing more than 400 million metric tons of carbon pollution in 2022 alone, which is on par with taking 100 coal-fired power plants offline for a year. These reductions are critical for slowing the pace of climate change and protecting communities from extreme weather and health-harming pollution that’s made worse by warmer temperatures.

At the same time, using less energy means generating less pollution from fossil fuel–based power, resulting in cleaner air and fewer harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. That’s a win for public health, leading to fewer asthma attacks, respiratory illnesses and heart disease—especially in communities located near power plants or busy roads.

A Program We Can Trust – And One We’re About to Lose

Manufacturers, homebuilders, building owners, small businesses and consumers across the country recognize and trust the Energy Star label. The trust isn’t arbitrary – it’s earned through science-backed standards, independent verification, and administration by the Environmental Protection Agency. Over the years, this trust has created a powerful market signal, encouraging manufacturers to compete by designing better, more efficient products.

But now, this trusted program is under threat, so much so that nearly 1,100 companies and organizations last month urged the EPA to maintain full funding and staffing levels in the Energy Star program. If Energy Star funding is eliminated, we won’t just lose a familiar label – we’ll lose a national system of accountability that has shaped energy policy not only in the U.S., but globally. Without it, we risk opening the floodgates to cheap, inefficient products that undercut quality and reverse decades of environmental and consumer protection progress.

At a moment when climate impacts are intensifying and the need for smarter energy use has never been more urgent, eliminating energy efficiency programs is a dangerous step backwards. We’re beginning to see the damage regulatory rollbacks can cause, with proposed weakened standards for appliances like dishwashers, furnaces, and tankless water heaters. Eliminating Energy Star would make those losses permanent and erase one of our most effective tools for reducing emissions, lowering utility bills, and safeguarding public health.

However, it’s not too late – we have a choice. If enough of us speak out, we can stop this short-sighted move. Here’s how you can help advocate to protect and fully fund the Energy Star program:

Contact your members of Congress and urge them to protect and fully fund Energy Star

Choose Energy Star-certified products when replacing appliances, renovating, or building new homes

Share this message and help others understand the real-world benefits of energy efficiency

The stakes are simply too high to stay silent. Eliminating Energy Star would be a needless, harmful setback – and one we can prevent.

How we did this

Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to find out how Americans’ views of environmental regulations vary by state – including in states with strong economic ties to fossil fuel production, since discussions about these laws often focus on their application in the energy industry.

The most recent data in this analysis is from the 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study (RLS), a survey of 36,908 U.S. adults conducted from July 17, 2023, to March 4, 2024. To recruit people to take the survey, we used a method known as address-based sampling (ABS). This involved mailing invitation letters to randomly sampled addresses from the United States Postal Service’s Computerized Delivery Sequence File. This approach gave nearly all U.S. adults a chance of being selected to participate in the survey. People who received our invitation had the option of completing the survey online, on paper, or by calling a toll-free number and completing the survey by telephone with an interviewer. In total, 25,250 respondents participated online, 10,733 completed the survey on paper, and 925 participated by phone.

The survey is designed to be representative of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as 34 large metro areas. The data is weighted (using benchmarks from the U.S. Census Bureau and other sources) to be representative of the adult population of each state (and D.C.) and of the overall U.S. adult population by gender, age, race, ethnicity, education and other categories. The survey’s margin of error for results based on the full sample is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points. The response rate is 20%. For more details, refer to the survey methodology.

Here are the English and Spanish paper questionnaires (and the combined English/Spanish questionnaire for web/phone administration) used in this analysis, along with responses.

Sample sizes and margins of error vary a lot from state to state. Some differences between states may not be statistically meaningful due to sampling variability and other sources of error that are inherent in all survey data. Refer to this table for state-level responses to the survey question and margins of error.

Nationally, six-in-ten Americans say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost, while 38% say they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy, according to a 2023-24 Pew Research Center survey of 36,908 U.S. adults.

As with many climate and energy issues, opinions vary sharply by party. Most Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think these laws are worth the cost (82%), while Republicans and GOP leaners tend to say they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy (59%).

Opinions also vary widely by state.

Views by state

In 29 states and the District of Columbia, majorities of adults say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost. Views are more split in 20 other states, while in Wyoming, a majority of adults say these laws cost too many jobs and hurt the economy.

D.C. and Minnesota have some of the broadest support for tougher environmental regulations: 71% of adults in each place say these are worth the cost. And around two-thirds of adults in Oregon (68%) and Washington (67%) see these laws as worthwhile.

About six-in-ten in Florida and Pennsylvania (61% each) say the same, while majority support in Missouri sits at the lower end of the spectrum (56%).

Opinions in many other states are more divided – especially in those that tend to lean Republican overall. For example, in Alabama, 52% see stricter environmental laws as worth the cost, while 45% say they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy. In Mississippi, 50% see these regulations as worthwhile and 46% do not. Still, differences across most states persist even after controlling for party.

Views in states with more fossil fuel-reliant economies

Since environmental laws related to the energy industry are highly debated, we also looked at attitudes about environmental regulations in states whose economies rely the most on fossil fuel production.

The extractive industry – which includes coal mining as well as oil and natural gas drilling – makes up 5% or more of the state gross domestic product (GDP) in seven states, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. These states are North Dakota (extractives account for 16% of GDP), West Virginia (15%), Wyoming (14%), Alaska (13%), New Mexico (10%), Oklahoma (8%) and Texas (7%).

Residents of states where the extractive industry makes up a larger share of their state GDP are generally less likely to say that stricter environmental laws are worth the cost than are adults in states with economies that don’t rely as heavily on fossil fuel production.

For example, 48% of North Dakotans and 39% of Wyomingites see these laws as worth the cost. This compares with about seven-in-ten in Vermont (70%) and New Jersey (68%) – which both derive less than 1% of their GDP from the extractive industry.

Americans’ views on federal environmental protection efforts

In addition to their generally favorable views of stricter environmental laws and regulations, Americans see room for improvement in certain areas of environmental protection.

Roughly six-in-ten Americans say the federal government is doing too little to protect the quality of lakes, rivers and streams (63%) and air quality (58%), according to a summer 2023 Center survey.

Majorities also think the federal government should do more to reduce the effects of global climate change (56%) and protect animals and their habitats (55%). Still, 20% say the government is doing too much to curb global climate change.

Americans are split on the potential economic impact of climate policies, according to an October 2024 Center survey. They are just as likely to say policies aimed at reducing the effects of global climate change usually help the economy as they are to say these policies usually hurt it (34% each). Another 30% say these policies make no difference for the U.S. economy.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced earlier this month a significant restructuring of the agency, including cutting staff to Reagan-era levels to save about $300 million in the next fiscal year.

“With these organizational improvements, we recommit to fulfilling all of our statutory obligations and exceptionally delivering on EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment,” Zeldin said in a news release. “This reorganization will bring much needed efficiencies to incorporate science into our rulemakings and sharply focus our work on providing the cleanest air, land, and water for our communities.”

Cuts have reached Region 3, which oversees a host of environmental work in Virginia, according to Adam Ortiz, who served as EPA’s administrator of the Mid-Atlantic office under the Biden administration.

Ortiz, who now works for Maryland’s Department of the Environment, recently spoke with WHRO and said he’s concerned about potential impacts of ongoing cuts to public health and the massive effort to restore the Chesapeake Bay.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

WHRO: Tell me about your former role with the EPA and what you did there.

Adam Ortiz: I'm the former regional administrator for the Mid-Atlantic region at EPA, including Virginia, and oversaw the execution of federal laws and grants and cleanup projects.

Environmental challenges are all around us, and what we face in this country is not just dealing with stuff in the present moment, but we're also cleaning up 100 years worth of pollution, especially in industrial and naval areas like Hampton Roads and the Norfolk area, and also trying to prepare for the future by having clean energy and reduce the impacts of climate change. So that's a big agenda. In recent years, we did a lot of catching up in those areas. (There’s) still a staggering amount of work to do. But the recent actions by the Trump administration have hobbled or hindered or prevented that progress from moving forward. And places that are low lying, older cities that have more environmental liabilities, are the most at risk.

WHRO: What do you see or hear currently happening at the Mid-Atlantic office that concerns you?

AO: We really accelerated our cleanups of Superfund and Brownfield sites. In coastal Virginia, there's hundreds and hundreds of them, and we made a lot of progress but there’s still a lot to do, because they're very expensive and very complicated. Many of those projects have been placed on hold and also a lot of the staff have been prevented from engaging with the public in the way that we used to.

Basic questions about public health are being hampered. Recent actions have laid off the staff that were working on those projects. And then further cuts are being made into the funding of those projects themselves.

Often that funding is passed on from the EPA to local communities like Portsmouth (and) Norfolk, to do the cleanups themselves. That is coming to a standstill as well.

WHRO: Are there some specific projects in Hampton Roads that you’re worried about?

AO: Because of the military history and the naval history, there's a lot of chemicals, a lot of unexploded ordnance, a lot of health hazards that are beneath the surface of the land that get into people's bodies, either through the land, through air or through water. So we stepped up our cleanups of many Brownfield sites and Superfund sites, including Peck Iron and Metal (in Portsmouth). That's a facility that's been shut down for more than 20 years. What's been found on that site in particular, which is characteristic of other sites in the region, are PCBs, battery acid, arsenic, lead and even radioactive material that the public needs to hear about and get educated. But the health experts have been gagged. Many of them have been fired or laid off.

And like all coastal places, sea level rise is a real thing. It’s a big deal. Flooding is becoming more and more common, and critical infrastructure is all along the shoreline of Virginia's coast. Preventing the sources of climate change, as well as dealing with flooding when it happens, have also been under attack.

These are really big impacts that we're beginning to feel. But as time goes on and there's not experts, staff or the funding to fix problems, it's going to become more and more of a problem for everyday people.

WHRO: You focused a lot on environmental justice, including a task force that was just getting off the ground in Norfolk. What’s happening with that now?

AO: Well, environmental justice was a priority because it needs to be. It’s central to the mission of EPA to protect public health and the environment. And some of these communities, especially around Portsmouth, Norfolk area, communities that are overwhelmed with pollution, where health outcomes are very poor, some of the worst in the country, we spent a lot of time and provided a lot of technical assistance to communities to help reduce risks. To help clean things up and get grant money into local governments and non-governmental organizations to do cleanups and solve those problems.

That was called the engagement communities initiative. The whole premise was that we have to engage and work closely because there's an awful lot of pollution, a complex series of sources that have real impacts on the health of people and especially our youngest and our oldest. There was a team of experts that were going in. But unfortunately — on Earth Day — 20 people in the Mid-Atlantic office received their pink slips. They received a notice saying that their work was not consistent with the mission of the agency. And furthermore, the staff have been prevented from even using the term environmental justice. So places that are most at risk are going to suffer even more.

WHRO: One big issue for the Mid-Atlantic is the Chesapeake Bay restoration. What did you learn about that effort during your time at Region 3, and how could it be impacted by all this?

AO: For many years, there was uneven support of the Chesapeake Bay effort. It consists of many states all the way up to New York, as well as the federal government, working with farmers and with private industry, and it'd been uneven. Four years ago, there was a lawsuit against EPA that it wasn't doing enough and in the Biden administration, we settled that lawsuit. We brought everybody together, regardless of political party, and stepped up our efforts. We stepped up our enforcement, we stepped up our funding, we stepped up the application of science.

After a few short years, we saw the results in 2023: the Chesapeake Bay received its highest health grade in more than 22 years, and that's because we were working together. But that requires a strong federal government in that captain's chair. And what we see in this administration is that they cut the program. They undermined it. They said it wasn't important. They weren't enforcing or holding the states accountable. A shared resource like the Chesapeake Bay, which spans so many states and has thousands of streams feeding into it, requires an all hands on deck approach. I think it's going to be tough for us to maintain the recent successes that we've had with an ambivalent or a disinterested federal government.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c580776/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2F50%2F39542ddb435a83d8f613d21bbf25%2Fimg-3463.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 13:13:34.697986

“The Brownfields program exemplifies Administrator Lee Zeldin’s goal of Powering the Great American Comeback while cleaning up contamination and supporting local economies,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “During the Trump Administration’s first 100 Days, we listed 27 Brownfield sites as Ready for Anticipated Reuse which allows businesses to invest in properties without the fear of potential contamination from hazardous chemicals. With these grants, we will see even more properties transform into thriving economic centers while providing a safe environment for all Americans.”

The city of Pine Bluff will recieve a $500,000 Brownfields Assessment Grant to inventory and prioritize brownfield sites, prepare four cleanup plans and one Brownfields Revitalization Plan, and conduct community engagement activities.

Superfund site on the west side of Indianapolis.

Groundwater monitors detected benzene underground along South Tibbs Avenue near the 120-acre site at 1500 S. Tibbs Ave. The EPA said its plan seeks to clean up the chemical there within the next two decades.

EPA remedial project manager Dion Novak approved plans for contractors hired by site owner 1500 S Tibbs LLC to install 73 wells to inject compressed air underground to grow bacteria that will eat up the benzene. The process, called air sparging, is expected to clean up the benzene in eight to nearly 20 years.

The plan also calls for the installation of 43 new groundwater monitoring points and 24 soil gas monitoring points at the site and 12 new monitoring wells in properties near the site.

The well and monitor installations are expected to begin in late summer or early fall and will take about three months to complete. Crews will spend the next year ensuring that the wells are operating as planned and will monitor the groundwater until the contamination is cleaned up.

Novak said monitoring wells will help detect whether benzene trapped in the groundwater leaks into homes, a process known as vapor intrusion. If the chemical is detected, the agency may install a mitigation system or other method to address the vapor intrusion.

Site history

The Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. Superfund site has been on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1984. Site owner 1500 S Tibbs LLC is a subsidiary of Indianapolis-based chemical manufacturing company Aurorium.

The site was used until 1972 to treat telephone poles with creosote, a substance that helps preserve and protect the wood but also is considered a likely contributor to cancer. Chemicals were manufactured at a plant there from the mid-1940s until the plant closed last April.

Griffo said.
“This meeting was an important opportunity for area business owners, trucking associations and local officials to discuss concerns with this problematic regulation directly with the EPA.
While I understand the need to embrace clean energy, the CLCPA has resulted in unfordable mandates, including this electric truck regulation, that will have major impacts on numerous communities, businesses and industries in New York.

New York State Senator Joe Griffo image.","ALBANY, NY- While both chambers of the legislature were still negotiating a state budget deal late last month, one North Country lawmaker convened a meeting in Albany between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and business owners, local officials, statewide association representatives and others who have been or may be negatively affected by New York's Advanced Clean Truck (ACT) Rule.

“I appreciate the willingness of EPA Regional Administrator Martucci and his staff to meet with some of those affected by the ACT Rule,” Sen. Griffo said.

“This meeting was an important opportunity for area business owners, trucking associations and local officials to discuss concerns with this problematic regulation directly with the EPA. While I understand the need to embrace clean energy, the CLCPA has resulted in unfordable mandates, including this electric truck regulation, that will have major impacts on numerous communities, businesses and industries in New York. I will continue to advocate reasonable and realistic deadlines and expectations to reach the state’s energy goals.”

Be sure to listen to our latest on-air segment with the Senator for more of his insight:

The meeting was part of Griffo’s ongoing efforts to help truck dealerships, individual truck owners, commercial trucking companies, municipal highway departments and local governments deal with this regulation, which has received loyal support Democratic leaders, according to a statement from his office.

To clarify, Senator Griffo has stated numerous times in the past that he is certainly not opposed to cleaner energy goals, but rather he questions some of the approaches to zero emission energy and whether or not these goals are feasible.

In late 2021, Griffo says the governor announced that the ACT Rule had been adopted as part of the state’s efforts to meet the targets of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which he did not support.

The regulation would require that medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including municipal plows, be manufactured as zero emission starting in 2025, with the goal of 100% of trucks over 8,500 pounds to be zero emission by 2045.

However, groups like the New York State Automobile Dealers Association, Trucking Association of New York, New York State County Highway Association and local highway superintendents and departments and Utica Mack, Inc. have pushed back against this regulation because it would be detrimental to businesses and communities.

They have urged that the state slow down implementation because of a lack of needed equipment and that the required infrastructure is not yet ready for this significant shift to zero emission vehicles.

Sen. Griffo has introduced legislation (S.1749) that would delay the implementation of the ACT regulation to provide more time to fully understand the effect that this rule would have on industries and municipalities in the state.

Assemblywoman Buttenschon has sponsored a companion bill (A.1073) in the Assembly.

Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.
While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General.
Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters.
Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.","In Washington, D.C., House Republicans plan to gather Tuesday to vote on whether to shred the Inflation Reduction Act, the landmark law that has issued hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy incentives since 2022, as part of President Donald Trump’s new budget proposal.

Meanwhile, in Vermont on Tuesday morning, a state program funded by that very law announced more than $22 million of the state’s total grant of $62.5 million would go to help install solar power on low-income housing in the state.

“Currently towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar,” Kerrick Johnson, commissioner for the Department of Public Service, which controls the state’s grant, said in a statement. “That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

The funding is part of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion national initiative to lower the cost of electricity by installing solar on buildings and developing solar arrays in communities. Across the country, the program could pass on solar benefits to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office that administered the grant to 49 states and six tribes, among others.

Vermont’s congressional delegation championed the initiative, including U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who introduced Solar for All into the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

But funding for the solar program has been under threat before by the Trump administration, and it could be under threat again as the Republican-dominated Congress moves to axe programs from the IRA to achieve the multi-trillion-dollar budget President Trump is calling “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.”

On Sunday, the U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee proposed to meet the budget goals by repealing grants from a $27 billion IRA program called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aims to lower carbon emissions. One of the three programs in that fund is the Solar for All program.

“Donald Trump campaigned on lowering electric bills for working Americans. As president, he’s doing exactly the opposite,” Sanders said in an email Tuesday. “The disastrous reconciliation bill being pushed by Trump and Congressional Republicans would not only make electric bills more expensive for Vermonters, it would make the climate crisis worse.”

Sanders said the good news was that the budget bill couldn’t legally rescind Vermont’s $62.5 million grant that was allocated to the Vermont Department of Public Service.

“The bad news is that Trump does not respect the Constitution or rule of law,” Sanders said. “I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Solar for All funding is deployed to lower electric bills, slash carbon emissions, and create thousands of good jobs.”

The road to how the federal government got to this massive repeal process began in January, when Trump took office and issued a flurry of executive orders. Those included Unleashing American Energy, which called for a 90-day freeze on IRA funds. A letter sent a week later by the EPA notified Solar for All recipients that the hundred of millions of dollars they’d received so far was paused until further notice. Programs across the country, including New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin, were suddenly unable to access their grant funding and proceed with solar projects that require significant upfront investment.

“While the federal funding landscape is dynamic, we have a binding agreement with EPA and the funding is obligated,” said Randy Brittingham, grant program manager at the state energy office for the Vermont Department of Public Service, in an email. After a pause in communication and access to funds this winter, Brittingham said the state is back in regular contact with the EPA. “We’ve successfully drawn funding for this program since that February pause,” he said.

But Lee Zeldin, the new EPA administrator, has gone further since February, claiming in March that President Joe Biden’s administration had doled out billions of dollars that were vulnerable to “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Zeldin tried to claw back $20 billion from the two other programs in the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and while caught up in court battles, those funds largely remain frozen. While Zeldin’s ire wasn’t aimed at Solar for All, his attack launched an audit into the program by the EPA Office of Inspector General. The audit is ongoing, according to Kim Wheeler, director of strategic communications for that office.

“Solar for All was selected because it is a $7 billion program with a financing structure that is new and different for the EPA, with $25 million already spent,” Wheeler said in an email on Tuesday. She did not respond by the time of publication to a question about whether the EPA considers only $25 million of the program obligated.

While Wheeler said her office doesn’t have the authority to make or revoke funding decisions, if her office found an issue with an award during an investigation, it could make recommendations to the EPA.

“If we identified an issue during an audit (such as the project you are asking about), we could recommend that the Agency evaluate whether to suspend payment or terminate the award,” Wheeler said of the Solar for All program.

Until the investigation is concluded, Solar for All funding will continue to trickle down to Vermonters. More than a third of the $62.5 million grant was awarded this week to the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, a quasi-public entity that acts like a bank for affordable housing, to make solar more accessible for low-income households.

These funds – called Multi Family Affordable Housing – will be awarded to new developers for affordable housing projects like multi-family apartment buildings, largely benefitting renters. Separate programs that fall under the state’s Solar for All program push benefits toward single-family homeowners and community solar projects.

“We know that renters have been very underserved by solar resources in the past, so it’s exciting for us as a housing funder to help developers successfully electrify their buildings and rely less on fossil fuels,” said Mia Watson, special programs manager for the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, who is supporting the Solar for All award.

Tenants who have an electric bill could see at least 20% in bill savings and tenants without an electric bill would receive an equivalent benefit, Brittingham said. He added that all residents would benefit from the climate impacts of growing Vermont’s solar generation.

Residents and developers can attend public outreach sessions hosted by the finance agency in the coming months. The finance agency in partnership with the state will submit a work plan for EPA approval by December. They expect to award funds to developers early next year.

“We’re still cautious about what may happen at the federal level, but so far the indications we have are good that this program is going to happen,” Watson said. “We’ve had strong support from the state and our congressional delegation, especially Sen. Sanders, but I think everyone involved is a little concerned that things could change unexpectedly.”

The decision by global automotive giant Stellantis to close its Luton van factory, with the loss of over 1000 workers’ jobs, has laid bare the grave situation facing workers in the UK’s automotive industry. A storm of corporate profiteering, automation, and the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs), has meant the threat of factory closures and job losses, for both workers producing vehicles and workers across the UK’s automotive supply chain.

Yet the corporate-led automotive transition is also driving injustices for workers and mine affected communities across the supply chain globally. The production of EVs requires lithium-ion batteries, which are produced in gigafactories – large, high volume battery manufacturing facilities. The UK Government states that to provide the battery capacity needed to maintain existing levels of automotive production, but shift entirely to EVs, the UK would need 200 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity by 2040, approximately 10 gigafactories.

Lithium-ion batteries require huge quantities of minerals including lithium, cobalt, nickel and copper. According to the latest statistics none of these minerals are mined in the UK, meaning despite some plans for domestic mining UK manufacturers are overwhelmingly dependent on imports from other countries. 10 lithium-ion battery gigafactories would vastly increase the UK’s demand for these minerals, and mean the UK would be consuming a disproportionate and inequitable share of the world’s resources. This would lead to severe impacts for mine affected communities and workers globally.

The UK would, by 2040, every year require nearly a fifth of the world’s mined lithium, 6% of the world’s nickel, and 15% of the world’s cobalt.

The huge expansions of mining that would be needed to meet skyrocketing UK mineral demands would be felt overwhelmingly by workers and communities in the Global South. Many of the world’s biggest mining companies are British, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in London, and are at the heart of driving these injustices.

A just, worker-led transition

There is another way to deliver the decarbonisation of the transport sector that is so urgently needed. By investing rapidly in scaling up public transport and active forms of travel, the UK can create a diversified transportation system which reduces reliance on private vehicles. While electrified public transport still requires batteries and minerals, public transport EVs are much more efficient and require far lower quantities of minerals per rider.

By investing in battery recycling, and car remanufacturing infrastructure, the UK can also reduce the need for new mining to create lithium-ion batteries and electric vehicles, moving towards a circular economy model. Not only would this reduce the need for new mining, but it would create thousands of manufacturing jobs.

Research from the United States shows that, by investing in public transport, reducing the size of vehicles that are produced, and scaling up battery recycling infrastructure, potential increases in lithium demand can be reduced by 92%. Similar reductions could be expected in the UK. The research also demonstrates that a diversified transport system, with less private vehicles but an expansion of mobility options – including public transport and safe streets – would produce a net increase of 2.4 million jobs.

A transition in the interests of people not profit can only come from, and be designed by, workers themselves. Worker-led transition plans outline how production could be transitioned, and the training and reskilling necessary for workers to ensure they are able to maintain jobs on equal terms and conditions. From grassroots automotive workers in the UAW trade union in the United States organising for supply chain justice, to GKN workers in Italy who fought for plans to transition from producing luxury cars to solar panels and cargo bikes, we know this is possible.

As workers in the UK resist corporate attacks and job losses, it is crucial that the climate movement stands with them in solidarity. We cannot accept the loss of secure, decently paid jobs under the guise of decarbonisation. At the same time, it is crucial that trade unions in the UK and across the Global North build solidarity with workers and communities on the frontlines of resistance to the expansion of mining for battery minerals globally. Transition plans must minimise mineral demands, through prioritising public transit over EV production and scaling up recycling infrastructure, and deliver supply chain justice.

Read more about the EPA PFAS rollback.","The EPA rescinded and is reconsidering the regulations for PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA, four of the six PFAS types previously limited by regulations.

In April 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard to protect communities from exposure to harmful per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as ‘forever chemicals.’ Exposure to PFAS has been linked to deadly cancers, impacts to the liver and heart, and immune and developmental damage to infants and children.

Last week, the EPA announced that some of those regulations, specifically those that limited levels of PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA, would be rescinded and reconsidered. Regulations limiting PFOA and PFOS will still remain in place. Additionally, EPA plans to develop a rulemaking to provide additional time for compliance, including a proposal to extend the compliance date to 2031.

PFAS OUT

To enhance engagement on addressing PFAS, EPA will launch PFAS OUT to connect with every public water utility known to need capital improvements to address PFAS in their systems, including those EPA has identified as having PFOA and PFOS levels above EPA’s MCL. EPA will share resources, tools, funding, and technical assistance to help utilities meet the federal drinking water standards. PFAS OUT will ensure that no community is left behind as we work to protect public health and bring utilities into compliance with federal drinking water standards. PFAS OUT will engage utilities, technical assistance providers and local, State, Tribal, and Territorial leaders to develop effective, practical solutions where they are needed most.

EPA will continue to offer free water technical assistance (WaterTA) that provides services to water systems to improve their drinking water and help communities access available funding. EPA’s WaterTA initiatives work with water systems nationwide to identify affordable solutions to assess and address PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS. Services offered to utilities include water quality testing, development of technical plans, operator training support, designing public engagement and outreach strategies, and support for accessing federal funding opportunities.

What This Means in Maryland

While the federal government may be easing its initial push to remove PFAS from drinking water, the General Assembly and the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) have shown active interest in responding more aggressively to this growing issue. SB732/HB909 garnered significant attention as it aimed to limit PFAS concentrations in sewage sludge, and while the legislation did not pass, there are already conversations about an even more ambitious package of PFAS bills for the 2026 legislative session. For its part, MDE is also exploring what regulatory tools it has at its disposal to limit PFAS in areas under its jurisdiction.

At least 19 people were killed in Kentucky and five more in St. Louis after a powerful tornado tore through homes and tossed vehicles like toys. Thousands of homes were damaged, with officials warning the death toll may rise.

Survivors in places like London, Kentucky, are racing to salvage belongings before the next storm hits. Governor Andy Beshear said survey teams are preparing disaster aid applications as many roads remain closed.

With more tornadoes expected in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, plus triple-digit heat in the South and snow in the Rockies, the central U.S. is facing a week of extreme, conflicting weather threats.

Key quote:

“It was dark and still raining but every lightning flash, it was lighting up your nightmares: Everything was gone.”

— Zach Wilson, Kentucky resident

Why this matters:

As the climate crisis intensifies storm patterns, protecting public health and infrastructure — especially in rural and southern regions — becomes increasingly urgent. Yet federal support for forecasting is eroding: The Trump administration has made massive cuts to National Weather Service offices. Another AP story reported that the Jackson, Kentucky, weather office, which was responsible for the hard-hit area around London, Kentucky, had a March 2025 vacancy rate of 25%. Meanwhile, the Louisville, Kentucky, weather service staff was down 29%, and the St. Louis office was down 16%. The staff reductions raise serious concerns about the agency's ability to provide timely forecasting and emergency alerts in advance of life-threatening storms.

In short:

Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson told staff the agency will prioritize state-led disaster response, with the federal government stepping in “when deemed necessary.”

President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have signaled interest in scaling back or eliminating FEMA entirely, with Richardson ordered to align the agency with this vision.

States like Texas and Florida are seen as ready to handle more disaster responsibilities, while others may lose the typical 75% federal cost-share for recovery, forcing them to rely more heavily on state funds.

Key quote:

“It’s unclear what they mean when they say returning primacy to the states. What does that mean when certain states don’t have the resources in their own budgets to respond to and recover from catastrophic events?”

— Jeremy Edwards, FEMA deputy director of public affairs during the Biden administration

Why this matters:

As climate-fueled disasters increase in size and frequency, FEMA’s decision to reduce its role could leave many states unprepared and underfunded during emergencies. In 2024, the U.S. saw 90 major disaster declarations and 27 billion-dollar climate disasters. If states must now finance more of their disaster recovery alone, disparities in outcomes may widen. Critics argue this shift could result in a patchwork of responses across the country, with some regions better protected than others. With hurricane season just weeks away, the consequences of this policy change could become evident very soon.

In short:

A new analysis by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (Ceba) found that repealing clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act would raise household utility bills and lower incomes, with at least 19 states affected.

The proposed rollback, introduced by House Republicans, targets credits 48E and 45Y, which support clean energy investments and production; the plan would phase them out after 2031 and impose new restrictions in the meantime.

In New Jersey alone, the repeal could cause utility bills to rise by over 13%, eliminate more than 22,000 jobs, and reduce the state GDP by $3.24 billion.

The stakes are high: Without continued federal support for clean energy, states may be forced to lean more heavily on older, dirtier power sources, putting climate goals further out of reach and increasing air pollution, which harms both human health and the environment. The research suggests that even conservative-leaning states would feel the pinch, challenging the partisan framing of climate investments and shifting the debate toward the tangible pocketbook effects of energy policy decisions.

In short:

Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.) represents a swing district transformed by clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act, including a rapidly growing Lucid Motors plant and a major solar expansion.

Ciscomani has urged party leaders to preserve key tax credits but voted for a budget resolution enabling their potential repeal, as GOP leaders move to eliminate most clean energy incentives to fund a sweeping megabill.

His political future hangs in the balance as Democrats mobilize to hold him accountable, while local officials warn that ending the credits would stall economic growth and job creation.

Key quote:

“As much as there are other aspects of the IRA we [Republicans] can disagree with, these tax credits have had an impact in my district — and on job creation, on investment, also national security, because of energy production and having wanted to bring that more domestically.”

— Juan Ciscomani, U.S. representative from Arizona

Why this matters:

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022, has funneled billions into clean energy development, especially in economically struggling areas. In Arizona’s 6th District, those investments are reshaping the region. Across rural areas, solar projects are helping control rising utility costs and stabilizing grids amid extreme heat. Many of these projects hinge on tax credits the House GOP now aims to repeal, threatening jobs, local tax bases, and energy resilience. Constituents, many of them veterans or working-class residents, risk losing new opportunities if clean energy incentives vanish. While some Republican lawmakers recognize the benefits and seek a middle ground, party pressure to dismantle the IRA — branded a “Green New Scam” by Trump — puts them in a bind.

In short:

Four draft executive orders under review by the Trump administration would shift nuclear safety oversight from the NRC to the Department of Energy, placing final authority over advanced reactors under the president.

The proposed overhaul would subject NRC rules to case-by-case review by the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, potentially slowing licensing decisions and undermining regulatory transparency.

Critics from across the political spectrum argue the move could compromise safety, delay reactor deployment, and violate legal frameworks like the Atomic Energy Act and the Sunshine Act.

Key quote:

“NRC’s reputation as a trusted regulator is important to the public, to industry, and to potential customers of U.S. nuclear technology both here and abroad. We don’t want changing political winds in either direction to undermine NRC’s credibility.”

— Judi Greenwald, executive director of the Nuclear Innovation Alliance

Why this matters:

Nuclear energy provides roughly one-fifth of U.S. electricity and serves as a key player in decarbonization strategies. But the technology’s inherent risks demand vigilant, science-based oversight. Weakening the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s independence could politicize safety decisions and sideline technical expertise, increasing the chance of errors with lasting environmental and health consequences. Low-level radiation exposure, for instance, has been linked to cardiovascular damage and other long-term effects — risks that may not fully emerge until years after exposure. At a time when public trust in science and government is already strained, any move that makes safety oversight appear less impartial could erode confidence in the country’s energy infrastructure.

In short:

Chubb, a major global insurer, is no longer providing property insurance to Venture Global’s Calcasieu Pass LNG terminal, a move revealed through public records and confirmed by the company, though the specific reason remains unclear.

Residents of Cameron Parish, Louisiana, have long opposed the facility, citing thousands of permit violations and a growing body of evidence linking pollution from LNG operations to serious health risks including asthma and cancer.

Chubb’s decision follows years of activist pressure and coincides with broader shifts in the insurance industry, which is beginning to distance itself from high-emissions fossil fuel projects amid worsening climate-related disasters.

Key quote:

“We have been pressuring Chubb for several years now to not insure these dangerous, polluting projects, because insuring those projects is ensuring environmental racism in communities that are overburdened by pollution.”

— Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project of Louisiana

Why this matters:

Liquefied natural gas, often marketed as a “cleaner” fossil fuel, emits significant amounts of methane — a potent greenhouse gas — throughout its production and export cycle. Along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, a rapid buildout of LNG terminals is transforming low-income communities, many of them majority Black, into industrial hubs. These areas already suffer from some of the nation’s worst toxic emissions and are highly vulnerable to climate disasters like hurricanes and floods, which are intensifying with rising global temperatures. Insurance companies, facing ballooning costs from extreme weather, are increasingly exiting high-risk regions while continuing to support the very projects contributing to those risks.

In short:

More than 56,000 people across 50+ First Nations depend on winter ice roads, but warming temperatures have shortened the window for travel and transport, forcing expensive alternatives like air freight.

As communities push for permanent all-season roads, government funding often comes with an implicit expectation of mining approvals, raising tensions over Indigenous sovereignty and environmental protections.

Some First Nations, like Cat Lake, are trying to build permanent roads without backing mining projects, but face steep costs and limited support from provincial and federal authorities.

Key quote:

“We said no to the mine, and we said yes to the road.”

— Rachel Wesley, economic development officer, Cat Lake First Nation

Why this matters:

For remote First Nations, these seasonal roads are more than infrastructure — they are lifelines, enabling access to medicine, fuel, food, and connection to the outside world. Their disappearance means communities face higher living costs, deeper isolation, and harder choices. Many now face pressure to approve mining projects in exchange for permanent roads, risking their lands, water, and cultural survival. The minerals in these regions — vital to the green energy transition — lie beneath wetlands that store immense amounts of carbon. Mining them would release greenhouse gases on a scale comparable to the Amazon. As governments and corporations angle to tap this potential, Indigenous peoples must navigate coercive funding dynamics and colonial legacies.

Fast-Tracked Permitting for Critical Energy Projects Following the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, the BLM announced plans to expedite permitting for key projects.","The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has announced a series of major policy shifts that will impact the future of energy development on public lands, including the rescission of key renewable energy incentives, streamlined oil and gas leasing, and expedited permitting for critical projects. These decisions reflect a renewed emphasis on energy independence and economic growth, but they have also sparked sharp debate among industry leaders, environmental advocates, and policymakers.

From the rollback of intermittent energy regulations to accelerated approvals for fossil fuel projects, the agency’s latest actions signal a transformational shift in federal land management. While supporters see these changes as essential to reducing regulatory roadblocks and boosting U.S. energy production, critics warn that they could slow clean energy progress and weaken environmental protections.

Rescission of Intermittent Energy Rule

On May 14, 2025, the Department of the Interior announced its intent to rescind the Bureau of Land Management’s intermittent energy rule, which governed solar and wind energy development on public lands. Originally implemented under the Biden administration, the rule lowered rental rates and capacity fees for renewable energy projects, incentivizing solar and wind expansion.

Interior officials argue that the rollback will restore balance by eliminating preferential treatment for intermittent energy sources and unlock America’s full energy potential. Proponents within the fossil fuel industry see this as an opportunity to level the playing field, ensuring that all energy sectors are regulated under the same framework. However, environmental groups strongly oppose the measure, arguing that the rescission disincentivizes renewable energy development and may slow the transition toward clean energy. Some organizations are considering legal challenges to prevent the policy change from taking effect.

Streamlining Oil and Gas Leasing Process

On May 13, 2025, the BLM announced major reforms to oil and gas leasing, pledging to complete lease parcel reviews within six months, nearly cutting previous review times in half. The agency aims to increase the availability of federal lands for leasing, reduce bureaucratic delays, and enhance public engagement.

Energy industry leaders and economic analysts have welcomed the move, noting that simplified regulations could boost domestic energy production, create jobs, and strengthen U.S. energy independence. They argue that accelerating lease approvals will help meet growing energy demands while ensuring continued investment in U.S. resources.

However, environmental groups and some local communities have raised concerns about potential ecological damage from increased fossil fuel leasing. Critics worry that expediting approvals could reduce oversight and lead to long-term environmental consequences such as habitat degradation and water contamination. Some advocacy groups have called for stricter environmental assessments before leases are finalized.

Fast-Tracked Permitting for Critical Energy Projects

Following the national energy emergency declared by President Donald J. Trump on January 20, 2025, the BLM announced plans to expedite permitting for key projects. One of the first initiatives to receive accelerated approval is the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah, a site known for its uranium and vanadium production, critical materials for nuclear energy and high-strength steel manufacturing.

The BLM has committed to completing environmental reviews within 14 days, significantly reducing traditional permitting timelines. Federal officials argue that these changes will increase domestic production of essential energy resources, reinforcing national security.

The decision has sparked debate, with supporters emphasizing the strategic importance of uranium production in ensuring energy resilience. Opponents, however, fear that rapid approvals may undermine environmental safety protocols, leading to potential long-term consequences for local ecosystems.

Public Input for 2026 Oil and Gas Lease Sale

On May 12, 2025, the BLM New Mexico State Office opened a 30-day public scoping period to receive input on 20,479 acres of oil and gas parcels that may be included in the January 2026 lease sale in New Mexico and Oklahoma.

BLM officials have encouraged stakeholder participation, allowing communities, businesses, and advocacy groups to weigh in on potential environmental impacts and economic opportunities. Public reactions have been divided—some local business owners see the lease sale as an opportunity for economic growth and job creation, while environmental advocates warn that expanded drilling in sensitive areas could harm ecosystems and water supplies.

Looking Ahead

As the BLM implements these policies, the broader energy landscape continues to evolve. The debate surrounding renewables vs. fossil fuels, regulatory efficiency, and environmental conservation will likely shape further decisions. With stakeholder input, legal challenges, and legislative responses on the horizon, the implications of these moves will extend beyond immediate policy changes.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20241106-152434-899-og-eel.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:20.786763

Moreover, it has also reduced its production forecast from 3.4GW to 2.6-3GW in 2025, despite an annual nameplate production capacity of 5GW once its first factory is fully operational. The company’s guidance reduction also reflects the change of technology from passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) in three production lines with a US$500,000 investment and a potential 800MW inventory build.

The module assembly plant – dubbed G1 Dallas – in Dallas, Texas, which was acquired last year from Chinese solar manufacturer TrinaSolar, continues to ramp up production and sales, of which it recently signed a 253MW supply agreement with an undisclosed US utility-scale developer. This sales agreement brings the company’s total modules sold in 2025 to 1.75GW.

The module assembly plant has produced 690MW, as of 11 May 2025, according to the company, while module shipments to the US arm of German utility RWE began during the second quarter.

Daniel Barcelo, T1’s CEO and chairman of the Board, said: “Although potential changes to trade policy are creating near-term uncertainties in the merchant sales market for T1 and our developer customers, we are well positioned to manage this sales environment with 1.7 GW of 2025 contracted module offtake coverage, a robust cash and liquidity position, and the continued production and sales ramp up at G1 Dallas.”

Regarding last week’s US House Ways and Means Committee’s Reconciliation Bill, T1 said that certain elements of the bill potentially “undermine growth, competition, and job creation in the US solar industry”, while adding that the preservation of 45X advanced manufacturing production tax credits (PTCs) “demonstrates support for US solar manufacturing”.

Revenues generated from the module assembly plant during the first quarter of 2025 were US$64.6 million, with sales exclusively tied to offtake agreements under TrinaSolar. In Q1 2025, the company decreased its net loss on a yearly basis from US$28.7 million to US$16.2 million.

T1 Energy started out as Freyr Battery, a Norway-headquartered startup focused on lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery production, aiming to make products in Europe and the US, before pivoting into the solar PV space, completing its official rebranding under the new name in February.

Potential Saudi investment for solar cell plant

A few months after T1 unveiled the location for the construction of its solar cell plant – dubbed G2 Austin – which will also be located in Texas, more specifically Milam County in Austin, the company entered into a non-bidding agreement with an undisclosed Saudi company – aligned with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – to pursue an investment in T1’s solar cell processing plant.

Other than the Saudi agreement, the company initiated several other capital formation initiatives to secure funding for the solar cell plant.

“[T1] is currently advancing a project financing with its consortium of commercial lenders, the monetisation of Section 45X PTCs, and possible mezzanine financing options to complement expected customer offtake deposits to reserve G2 capacity,” said the company.

The monetisation of Section 45X PTCs are expected to begin in Q2/Q3 2025, according to the company.

The timeline for the construction of the Austin solar cell plant still remains unchanged, according to the company with a forecast to begin production by Q4 2026. Construction will be carried out in two phases with each phase adding 4 lines and an annual nameplate capacity of 4.8-5.1GW once fully operational.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/freyr-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:27.938563

The bill would sharply curtail most big tax credits for clean energy, but it did not eliminate all of the provisions in the law.
There are still other outstanding issues that must be resolved in order for the legislation to pass on the House floor.","The House Budget Committee late Sunday night revived President Trump’s stalled bill to cut taxes and spending, after a handful of fiscally conservative Republicans relented and allowed it to advance even as they continued to press for deeper reductions to health and environmental programs.

The vote signaled a temporary resolution to a remarkable revolt from a group of hard-liners on the panel, who on Friday joined Democrats in opposing the bill in committee, tanking it over concerns that it did not do enough to rein in the nation’s ballooning debt.

On Sunday, after a weekend of intensive negotiations with House Republican leaders and White House officials, they switched their votes to “present,” allowing the measure to move forward without lending their support. It sent the bill past a crucial procedural hurdle but indicated that there was still major trouble ahead for the package, which Speaker Mike Johnson has said he wants the full House to consider before Memorial Day.

“Deliberations continue to this very moment,” Representative Jodey C. Arrington of Texas, the chairman of the panel, said as he opened the session late Sunday night. “They will continue on into the week and, I suspect, right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House.”

The vote was 17 to 16, with all four Republicans who initially voted to defeat the legislation — Representatives Chip Roy of Texas, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Andrew Clyde of Georgia — voting “present.”

In a lengthy statement on social media minutes after the vote, Mr. Roy said he and the three other conservatives had secured commitments for changes to the bill that include speeding implementation of new work requirements for Medicaid and further curtailing clean energy tax credits created by the Inflation Reduction Act. He did not offer more details about either proposal, and Republican leaders provided no information on what concessions they had promised.

But Mr. Roy did say that “the bill does not yet meet the moment,” and alluded to wanting far deeper cuts to Medicaid, in a sign of the difficult path ahead. The bill goes next to the Rules Committee, which controls whether and how it will be debated on the House floor, including which changes can be made before it comes to a final vote. Two of the holdouts, Mr. Roy and Mr. Norman, are members with the power to block it from advancing from that panel as well.

Democrats on the Budget Committee expressed outrage at being asked to vote on legislation that was still in flux. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the panel, asked Mr. Arrington if lawmakers would be able to view “what side agreements have been reached” before casting their vote.

“Making sure all the members know transparently just what the heck is in this thing,” Mr. Boyle said, “because obviously it’s changing back in that back room by the minute.” That was an allusion to the negotiations Mr. Johnson had continued with the holdouts in an anteroom off the hearing room minutes before the panel met.

Mr. Arrington replied: “I don’t know anything about side deals or any deals. I just know we’re at a place where we can take a vote today.”

The legislation would make President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, fulfilling the president’s campaign promise. It also would raise spending on the military and immigration enforcement. Cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, education and subsidies for clean energy would offset part of the price of the bill, though they would not cover the entire cost of $3.8 trillion over 10 years.

The four Republicans on the panel voted against the legislation the first time the budget panel met, protesting the timeline for the work requirements for Medicaid recipients — which the bill would not impose until 2029, after the next presidential election — and the provisions targeting the clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, which the measure would partially but not completely repeal.

Work requirements are broadly popular among congressional Republicans, and even those who have balked at other cuts to Medicaid have said they could support such requirements.

Mr. Johnson told reporters outside the hearing room minutes before the vote on Sunday night that he had agreed to move up work requirements for Medicaid recipients “as soon as possible.”

“I think the desire of every Republican always has been to make work requirements real and actionable as soon as possible,” he said. “We learned in the process that some of the states would needed a longer lag time to add in the implementation of the new policy. So we’re going to push it as far as we can.”

Mr. Roy in his statement also suggested he wanted Republicans to reconsider proposals to cut Medicaid spending that party leaders had previously ruled out at the behest of more moderate members.

One would limit the way states use a tax loophole to increase federal spending on Medicaid. Big chunks of those savings would come from reducing Medicaid spending in poorer, Southern states.

The other would change the way Medicaid is financed. The federal government currently gives less money to richer states that can better support Medicaid with their own tax dollars. And it gives all states an exceptionally generous matching rate for anyone who signs up through the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.

Mr. Roy called that a “perverse funding structure” that ultimately “increases the likelihood of continuing deficits,” and of states that have yet to expand Medicaid, like Texas, doing so in the future.

House conservatives have also taken aim at the clean energy tax credits created under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the Inflation Reduction Act.

The bill would sharply curtail most big tax credits for clean energy, but it did not eliminate all of the provisions in the law. That was a key demand of the ultraconservatives, who said their party should have no problem repealing a statute that Democrats passed on their own through reconciliation, over unified Republican opposition.

But at least three dozen Republicans in the House, many who represent districts that have benefited from the clean energy tax credits, have called for preserving at least some of the incentives, such as for nuclear power or domestic manufacturing, to protect jobs and bolster U.S. energy security.

There are still other outstanding issues that must be resolved in order for the legislation to pass on the House floor.

When feedstock availability is limited, it hampers renewable diesel production and RIN generation.
Economic Factors – The volatility in traditional diesel prices can influence the financial incentives for producing renewable diesel.
Adjusts to blending requirements or new incentives to stimulate renewable diesel production may be necessary.
For fleet and equipment operators looking to make a change, the path forward with renewable diesel is clear and promising.","Every gallon of renewable fuel produced in the U.S. carries a unique code – a Renewable Identification Number (RIN). These codes are essential to the success of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a key initiative from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and boost the use of renewable fuels in transportation.

Each RIN represents a specific volume of renewable fuel and acts as a key tool to track and enforce compliance with the RFS mandate, ensuring producers meet the required blending targets set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Early 2025 Production

The EPA reported that about 1.5 billion RINs were generated in February 2025, a decrease of more than 25% compared to 2 billion RINs generated in February 2024. This decline continued into March, when 63 million renewable diesel RINs were generated. Domestic producers contributed 36 million of those RINs, with the remainder coming from imports and foreign sources.

In contrast, April saw a remarkable increase in RIN generation. 243 million RD RINs were generated, with 214 million from domestic producers. This increase suggests that production picked up significantly during this month, which might indicate an uptick in demand or production capacity for renewable diesel.

Why Are the RINs Decreasing?

Several factors can contribute to the decrease, including:

Feedstock Availability – Renewable diesel relies on feedstocks like used cooking oils, animal fats, and plant oils, which can be subject to supply fluctuations. When feedstock availability is limited, it hampers renewable diesel production and RIN generation.

Economic Factors – The volatility in traditional diesel prices can influence the financial incentives for producing renewable diesel. When diesel prices drop, the economic justification for producing renewable diesel weakens, leading to fewer RINs being generated.

Policy Adjustments – Changes in renewable fuel mandates and blending requirements can also impact the number of RINs generated. The EPA’s adjustments to the Renewable Fuel Standard can influence production levels and, consequently, RIN generation.

Market Competition – Renewable fuel market is becoming increasingly competitive, with other biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel vying for production capacity. This competition can limit the growth of renewable diesel production, leading to fewer RINs being issued.

What Does This Mean for Renewable Diesel?

With fewer RINs being generated, producers face reduced financial incentives, which could make renewable diesel production less attractive. This reduction in incentives may slow down the industry’s growth and hinder investment in production capacity. At the same time, the decline in RIN generation creates compliance challenges for obligated parties like refineries, which must meet renewable fuel blending quotas. The resulting scarcity of RINs could lead to higher prices, creating market instability and making it more difficult for companies to meet their obligations.

Additionally, the decrease introduces a level of uncertainty in the renewable diesel market. Producers, investors, and stakeholders may hesitate to make long-term investments in renewable diesel production, which could slow the sector’s ability to scale effectively. This uncertainty complicates the industry’s future prospects, as fluctuations in RIN generation and prices make it harder to predict trends and plan for growth.

Given these challenges, there may be a need for a policy response. Adjusts to blending requirements or new incentives to stimulate renewable diesel production may be necessary. These adjustments could help ensure that RD remains a viable and growing segment of the renewable fuel market, providing the stability needed for long-term success.

The landfill produced the third-highest levels of particulate matter and the most carbon monoxide emissions in Tarrant County in 2023.
These measures demonstrate a commitment to minimizing particulate matter emissions as proven by significantly exceeding regulatory requirements, said Ross.
The Report asked Ross to provide more details about Lockheed’s Fort Worth emissions data, but he did not respond before publication.","City-operated landfills, oil and gas facilities, and defense companies led Tarrant County businesses in producing the most carbon monoxide emissions and fine particulate matter in 2023, according to the most recent data collected by the state.

Every year, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality releases data that reflects major air pollution sources across the state. Data lists the amount of harmful chemicals — such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter — generated by industrial facilities, including power plants, oil refineries and those that produce cement, chemicals and metals.

A gas-fueled electric station operated by Constellation Energy in Fort Worth produced the most particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, generating 73 tons per year, according to the data.

Particulate matter is made up of small solid particles or liquid droplets — most often in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke — that can be inhaled and cause serious health problems such as increased respiratory symptoms, asthma, decreased lung function and premature death in people with heart or lung disease, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Following the energy company as top polluters are two landfills, one in Arlington and the other in southeast Fort Worth, each of which produced high levels of particulate matter in Tarrant County in 2023.

As for carbon monoxide, the same Fort Worth landfill produced 103 tons per year, the most out of any other company or entity in 2023, with a Waste Management landfill in Fort Worth coming in just behind.

Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. At very high levels, often indoors or in an enclosed space, carbon monoxide exposure can lead to death.

Although very high levels of carbon monoxide are typically not found outdoors, those with heart disease are especially sensitive to elevated levels of outdoor emissions.

Federal changes could reduce air pollution data collection

Some of the data collected by state environmental regulators supplements the EPA in its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The program was launched 15 years ago to help the federal agency and businesses identify major sources of pollution, devise strategies to cut emissions and develop climate-focused policies.

But the data from 2023 may be the last year polluters are required to report greenhouse emissions as the EPA cuts programs and long-standing regulations.

In an April agency meeting, political appointees announced their plans to disband the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for most industrial facilities, including power plants, oil refineries and those that produce cement, chemicals and metals, according to ProPublica.

The greenhouse gas reporting initiative is modeled after the EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory, created in 1986, said Columbia Law School professor Michael Gerrard, which made it crucial for companies not only to monitor emissions but to discover other pollutants they were previously unaware of generating.

Eliminating the emissions inventory would make it very hard for companies to keep pollutants down, added Gerrard.

“It’s very important that companies understand what their own emissions are so that they can better manage them. It’s important for governments to know who is emitting what, so they can better regulate them,” said Gerrard. “There are many uses for this.”

But regulators say the change at the federal level would not affect the state commission’s regional air monitoring, as statewide pollution data is aimed to comply with other federal air monitoring requirements like the Clean Air Act.

Constellation Energy declined a request to comment on its 2023 particulate matter emissions.

With the Arlington landfill coming in second as a particulate matter polluter while also leading in the top 10 generators of carbon monoxide emissions, city officials said they aim to meet or exceed all state and federal regulations.

“We regularly monitor and report our activities to the TCEQ,” said Arlington asset management director Nora Coronado. “The landfill has been engineered to protect the environment.”

Fort Worth’s landfill has a network of pipes, pumps and wells to capture naturally occuring biogas and safely flare those gases, said city spokesperson Lola McCartney. The landfill produced the third-highest levels of particulate matter and the most carbon monoxide emissions in Tarrant County in 2023.

“The landfill has extensive environmental systems in place to ensure all equipment is working as it should,” said McCartney.

In 2023, aerospace defense company Lockheed Martin produced the fourth-highest levels of particulate matter in Tarrant County at its F-35 jet production facility, data shows.

Although the company produced 10.80 tons per year of the fine particulate matter, which is over the maximum of 10 tons per year allowed according to the EPA, Lockheed Martin spokesperson Kenneth Ross said in a statement the company reported less than half of the limits outlined by the site’s permit granted by the state environmental commission. In accordance with federal law, state environmental permits cap particulate matter 2.5 emissions at 9 micrograms per cubic meter.

Lockheed’s “advanced emission control technologies” allows the company to keep particulate matter emissions from exceeding federal limits, said Ross in the statement.

These measures demonstrate a commitment to minimizing particulate matter emissions as proven by significantly exceeding regulatory requirements, said Ross.

The company has also reduced water usage by 29% and energy usage by 23% since 2010, while growing its employee base from 12,000 to 18,000 in that same timeframe, added Ross.

“Our environmental efforts extend to all aspects of operations,” said Ross.

The Report asked Ross to provide more details about Lockheed’s Fort Worth emissions data, but he did not respond before publication.

Midstream oil and gas operator Oneok, who operated as EnLink Midstream in 2023, produced the seventh-highest levels of carbon monoxide emissions that year.

Safety and the environment are core values at the company, said Oneok spokesperson Brad Borror.

“We commit to a zero-incident culture for the well-being of our employees, contractors and communities and to operating in an environmentally responsible manner,” said Borror.

Regardless of changes at the EPA, the company will continue to comply with the state environmental commission each year, said Borror.

Chemical company Nouryon, General Motors, Waste Management, Bell Textron, Energy Transfer Fuel LP, which all ranked in either the top 10 generators of particulate matter or carbon monoxide emissions respectively, did not respond to the Report’s requests for comment.

Karr Ingham, president of the industry group Texas Alliance of Energy Producers, assures that companies, particularly oil and gas, mitigate emissions as it not only negatively impacts the environment but could backfire economically.

“Losing methane into the atmosphere means that you’re also losing potential revenue from that gas that can be sold. … There is some economic incentive,” said Ingham.

As a result, companies invest in leak detection equipment and technologies to maintain efficiency and environmental safety throughout operations. Additionally, energy companies continue to work with federal officials to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, said Ingham.

“We’ve been engaged with the process in (Washington D.C.) about where the EPA is headed,” said Ingham.

The application for South Kyle 2 follows on from the delivery of the first South Kyle wind farm (pictured), which supported 270 jobs in south-west Scotland.
The South Kyle 2 wind farm project was first proposed in early 2022 and has undergone an extensive design review process, with the original 17-turbine scheme scaled back to 11.
Lead project development manager Simon Lejeune said: “The land at South Kyle forest is well suited for onshore wind deployment.","Vattenfall has submitted a planning application for its South Kyle 2 wind farm in Scotland.

The 92.4MW array would provide renewable energy for more than 80,000 homes.

Located between Dalmellington and New Cumnock, South Kyle 2 would comprise 11 wind turbines and a battery storage system.

Vattenfall said the use of next-generation wind turbines with a tip height of up to 200 metres will enable the project to maximise its contribution to national energy security while minimising the total number of turbines required.

The project will generate approximately £460,000 per year over 40 years to benefit local communities.

The scheme will also include biodiversity enhancements such as tree replanting, peat restoration and habitat creation.

The application for South Kyle 2 follows on from the delivery of the first South Kyle wind farm (pictured), which supported 270 jobs in south-west Scotland.

The new wind farm will also focus on delivering local jobs, hiring local contractors and creating apprenticeships.

The South Kyle 2 wind farm project was first proposed in early 2022 and has undergone an extensive design review process, with the original 17-turbine scheme scaled back to 11.

Vattenfall said the plans were shaped by local feedback, stakeholder input, environmental data and discussions with neighbouring residents.

Lead project development manager Simon Lejeune said: “The land at South Kyle forest is well suited for onshore wind deployment.

“Our proposal for South Kyle 2 has been three years in the making, and we are confident it strikes the right balance between addressing the urgent need for renewable energy generation with what local people told us was important – supporting jobs, communities and nature – whilst minimising impacts on those living closest to the site.”

Due to the nature and scale of the proposal, it will be determined by the Scottish Government.

A statutory consultation period will be advertised shortly by the Scottish Government to enable the public, as well as statutory consultees, to consider the proposal.",https://renews.biz/media/34166/south-kyle-wind-farm-1_credit-vattenfall.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:38.521404

It included provisions to address climate change through incentives for the clean energy through extended and expanded tax credits.
“This wouldn’t just be canceling clean energy projects,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council.
“The impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022,” the analysis states.
According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.","Wisconsin labor and clean energy advocates say a Republican plan in Congress to end or phase-out Biden-era clean energy tax credits could jeopardize thousands of jobs and force some companies to abandon projects.

The House Ways and Means Committee recently released an amendment to Congress’ budget reconciliation package that would rollback tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act. The move is part of a large package of tax cuts and program reductions promoted by the Trump administration.

Last week, labor groups and the liberal nonprofit Forward Together held an event to highlight the potential for job loss if the the funding is canceled, saying the cancellation of tax incentives would endanger ongoing projects in Wisconsin.

The IRA was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022. It included provisions to address climate change through incentives for the clean energy through extended and expanded tax credits.

Companies have announced plans to invest more than $840 billion in clean energy projects in the United States since the IRA was passed, but only $321 billion of that private investment had been spent through the first quarter of 2025. That’s according to a report released Tuesday from Clean Investment Monitor, a joint effort between Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rhodium Group, a New York-based policy research company.

In Wisconsin, roughly $5.3 billion in total private investment had been announced with more than $2.9 billion spent since the IRA became law, according to a spreadsheet from Clean Investment Monitor.

There were 407 operational jobs and 4,109 construction jobs associated with completed facilities in Wisconsin, and another 175 operational and 2,511 construction jobs expected for announced facilities not yet online, according to the spreadsheet.

“Our members of Congress should be defending and fighting for these jobs and investments in their districts, not threatening them,” said Peter Drummond, executive director of Forward Together Wisconsin.

Electrical workers union leaders from Madison and Greenfield, as well as the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, said Wednesday the climate law led to a boom in clean energy deployment across the state.

They said the plan to gut the IRA’s incentives could result in job losses, creating economic instability for families across Wisconsin.

“This wouldn’t just be canceling clean energy projects,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council. “They’d be canceling opportunities for thousands of our members and undermining Wisconsin’s energy independence.”

But a March 2025 policy analysis from libertarian Cato Institute think tank estimates the energy subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act will cost between $936 billion and $2 trillion over the next decade, and between $2 trillion and $4.7 trillion by 2050.

“The IRA’s energy subsidies are multiple times larger than initial estimates, and they expose American taxpayers to potentially unlimited liability,” the report states.

The Republican proposal seeks to terminate or phase out a host of federal tax credits for things like electric vehicles, charging stations, residential clean energy or energy efficiency upgrades, utility-scale clean energy and renewable energy manufacturing, according to a preliminary analysis of the proposal by Rhodium Group.

“The impact of the proposal is likely to be similar to the impact of a full repeal of the energy tax credits initially extended and expanded in 2022,” the analysis states.

The GOP budget reconciliation bill was blocked from advancing to the House floor Friday by hardline House Republicans on the House Budget Committee. According to the New York Times, conservatives wanted deeper spending cuts and were unhappy the legislation did not immediately eliminate clean energy tax credits.

One project in Wisconsin expected to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act is the construction of a new intermediate and middle school in Menasha, after the law allowed nonprofit and local governments to receive direct payments instead of tax credits.

Brian Adesso, director of Business Services for the Menasha Joint School District, said the district expects to receive a reimbursement of nearly $4 million for a rooftop solar, energy storage and geothermal system that are included in the project.

“Without the availability of these credits, we would not have had the certainty we needed to make these projects come to life,” he said. “That would be a huge loss for our district and our community.”

While advocates decry the effort to repeal some of the IRA’s incentives, federal Republicans have been critical of the law almost since its passage. Since 2023, they’ve argued that the law failed to reduce inflation.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, R-De Pere, defended the House GOP’s budget plan, saying it provides tax relief to working-class families.

“We’re committed to reversing the costly Green New Scam policies of the Biden Administration, which led to massive inflation and made life unaffordable for Wisconsinites,” he stated. “While Republicans are focused on lowering costs and supporting the working-class, Democrats continue to push for devastating tax hikes that will hurt everyday Wisconsin families.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24080497315828-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:16:45.599184

What caused the ozone hole?
What is the current status of the ozone hole?
A large and deep ozone hole still forms every Antarctic spring, being deepest and largest towards the end of September, Shanklin told USA TODAY in a May 15 e-mail.
Indeed, though the Antarctic ozone hole shows signs of recovery, the healing process is very slow.","It's been 40 years since groundbreaking research announced the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer, a revelation that launched a rapid and successful effort to ban chemicals in hairspray, deodorant cans and refrigerators that were imperiling the planet.

The 1985 discovery by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey identified a dramatic thinning of the ozone layer over our southernmost continent, triggering immediate global concern about potential harm to human health and ecosystems worldwide.

Located in the stratosphere, the ozone layer acts like sunscreen, blocking potentially harmful ultraviolet energy from reaching our planet's surface. Without it, humans and animals could experience increased rates of skin cancer, DNA damage, cataracts and other ailments. It also affects the physiological and developmental processes of plants.

""The discovery of the ozone hole stands as one of the most important environmental discoveries of the 20th century and demonstrates how robust science, clear communication and international cooperation can address planetary-scale threats,"" said Dominic Hodgson, interim director of science at the British Antarctic Survey, in a statement released May 13.

Jon Shanklin, now an emeritus fellow at the BAS, added that ""publishing our findings in Nature 40 years ago, we couldn’t have anticipated the global response that would follow.""

What caused the ozone hole?

Scientists determined the production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were widely used in refrigeration, aerosols, solvents, and fire extinguishers caused the problem.

When chlorine and bromine atoms from CFCs rise and come into contact with ozone in the stratosphere, they destroy ozone molecules, the Environmental Protection Agency says in an online report. Ozone can be destroyed more quickly than it is naturally created, the EPA said.

What is the current status of the ozone hole? Is it recovering?

A large and deep ozone hole still forms every Antarctic spring, being deepest and largest towards the end of September, Shanklin told USA TODAY in a May 15 e-mail. ""There is a very slow recovery, but we’ll still have ozone holes for another 50 years or more.""

Indeed, though the Antarctic ozone hole shows signs of recovery, the healing process is very slow. CFCs have atmospheric lifetimes of more than 50 years, so even without further emissions, a full recovery might not occur until after 2070, the BAS said.

""The current rate of recovery is a bit slower than might be expected, so there could be feedbacks with climate change taking place,"" Shanklin told USA TODAY.

What is the Montreal Protocol?

The discovery of the ozone hole led directly to the Montreal Protocol just two years later – an agreement that froze the production and use of ozone-depleting substances at 1986 levels and set the groundwork for phasing them out entirely.

Today, the protocol stands as one of the most successful international environmental treaties ever implemented. By preventing harmful UV radiation from reaching the Earth’s surface, the agreement has saved thousands of lives, the BAS said.

""The Montreal Protocol is a very successful treaty that all the world’s governments have signed. It is working, with the amount of ozone depleting chemicals in the atmosphere declining as expected,"" Shanklin said in an e-mail to USA TODAY.

What about climate change?

USA TODAY asked Shanklin if there is a regret that we haven’t made similar progress in reducing the human-caused greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.

""Very much so,"" Shanklin answered. ""The Montreal Protocol shows what can be done, but with most other environmental issues (climate, biodiversity loss, sewage pollution, soil degradation etc.) there is mostly talk and small-scale action.""

""It is largely because the economic model is flawed and perverse – it assumes that resources are infinite and that there is no cost in using them,"" Shanklin said. ""This perversely then creates all the crises that we could be avoiding.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/15/USAT/83645900007-20000908-t-120000-z-952356006-pbeahulhxeo-rtrmadp-3-earth.JPG?crop=2047,1152,x0,y191&width=2047&height=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-19 11:18:23.279350

The Clear Horizons Act can be our next step forward.","New Mexico just accelerated our path forward to build a cleaner, more sustainable future for everyone. With the passage of the Community Benefit Fund (Senate Bill 48) and the Innovation in State Government Fund (Senate Bill 83), the state is proving that smart, community-driven climate action isn’t just possible—it’s already happening.

These wins are the result of years of hard work by advocates, lawmakers, and New Mexicans from across the state who believe in a future where clean energy, good jobs, and resilient communities go hand in hand. The Community Benefit Fund is a groundbreaking initiative that puts real money into local projects that create jobs, expand clean energy, and equip communities to build resilience in the face of climate challenges and adapt to climate changes. Whether it’s building energy-efficient homes, strengthening disaster response centers, or bringing reliable solar and wind power to rural areas, this fund will make a tangible difference in people’s lives.

The Innovation in Government Act will help state agencies tackle climate change head-on by giving them the tools and resources they need to plan for the future. Having strong policies is one thing—but making sure agencies have the funding and capacity to enforce them is just as important. Together, these two bills move New Mexico closer to a future where climate action is proactive rather than reactive.

As exciting as these wins are, New Mexicans know the fight isn’t over. The next big challenge is getting enforceable comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets ready to pass next session—and that work is underway. Recent polling shows that 77% of New Mexicans support the government taking action to reduce carbon and methane pollution that contribute to climate change. The need for action is increasingly urgent as the second Trump administration continues to prioritize corporate profits over the health and wellbeing of us all.

The Clear Horizons Act is the next major step. This bill establishes statewide limits on greenhouse gas emissions, holding polluters accountable and pushing New Mexico toward a carbon-free future.

While the Clear Horizons Act didn’t make it through the legislature this time, momentum is growing. Alongside the Clear Horizons Coalition, we will roll up our sleeves over the next year to make sure comprehensive climate pollution reduction targets cross the finish line next session.

Over the coming months, we’ll bring together businesses, labor groups, Tribal and Navajo leaders, and local communities to make the case that clean energy means good jobs, long-term savings, and a safer future. We’re committed to working together to refine the Clear Horizons Act to make sure it’s ambitious, effective, achievable, and focused on large source emitters —not every day New Mexicans who rely on propane, wood burning stoves, or make their living by ranching.

New Mexico has already shown what’s possible with bold climate action—from the Energy Transition Act to the Community Benefit Fund. The Clear Horizons Act can be our next step forward. The path to clean air, climate justice, and economic opportunity is within reach. Now, we have to work together to make it real.

The Trump administration may not be on board with climate action, but US states and cities are advancing with measures to reduce emissions

With the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and reduced federal climate priorities, we are entering a new era of political uncertainty regarding the way forward in addressing climate change.

The US faces significant climate policy gridlocks marked by executive orders, clawbacks of major climate laws and agency reorganisations. Yet, businesses still face growing climate disclosure requirements through frameworks such as the Science Based Targets initiative guidelines, state regulations and international mandates.

Despite this federal retreat, the reality of the situation for business leaders is clear: meaningful climate action cannot wait for perfect federal alignment. The time for action is now.

While federal leadership has wavered, some state governments have continued to advance climate action. A localised approach, combined with market-driven forces, allows businesses to take meaningful action, even when federal leadership is inconsistent. States are continuing to advance renewable portfolio standards, emissions targets and forward-thinking building codes.

California, leading the world as the fifth-largest economy, has established comprehensive environmental, social and governance regulations that serve as a benchmark for the rest of the nation. In Colorado, Governor Jared Polis has reaffirmed his commitment to emissions reductions. Michigan has experienced an influx of clean energy jobs, while California and Washington have implemented ambitious standards that businesses must navigate regardless of federal direction.

Whether it is making renewable home improvements more affordable or streamlining permits for clean energy technologies, it is possible to be resilient despite a challenging administration.

City action

On a more local level, cities have become powerful climate actors. Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of nearly 350 mayors representing 60mn Americans, and C40, a global coalition of 100 major cities, have made substantial progress. Through community actions, building performance standards and commitments to net zero, climate leadership is happening.

Boston has implemented carbon zoning requirements, Chicago has transitioned city buildings to 100 per cent clean power, and Austin remains steadfast in adopting its climate equity plan. Cities and businesses working together can achieve greater results in mitigating emissions and climate risk than they could individually.

Whether it is making renewable home improvements more affordable or streamlining permits for clean energy technologies, it is possible to be resilient despite a challenging administration

Waiting for political solutions is not always the best approach, especially with an issue as dire as a warming planet. When I worked on Capitol Hill fresh out of college, tracking climate legislation in 2010, I saw first hand how few bills related to energy and the environment passed both chambers. This led me to the green building industry, where tangible greenhouse gas reductions were made possible regardless of political headwinds. Every green building has a direct impact on reducing emissions.

Forward-thinking companies know there are impactful and compelling reasons for maintaining climate commitments. Managing risks to operations and supply chains, uncovering cost-saving opportunities through efficiency, meeting investor demands for climate transparency, and attracting talent through demonstrated initiatives are just some of them.

There is a clear business case for climate action that extends far beyond mere compliance. Private capital continues to flow towards climate solutions, as seen in initiatives such as Bloomberg’s funding following the Paris Agreement withdrawal. Companies and leaders who embrace proactive climate leadership now position themselves for a competitive advantage in the low-carbon economy of the future.

Market pressure

Market pressures are increasingly reshaping business priorities, regardless of political dynamics. Investors are demanding greater climate risk transparency, while shifting consumer preferences and growing employee activism are pushing companies to take action. Together, these market forces are creating powerful accountability mechanisms that extend beyond government regulation.

Luckily, many in the private sector recognise this. While some companies have scaled back on formal and public net zero work because of the current political narrative, research reveals the majority of businesses remain deeply invested in sustainability.

Recognising that climate action aligns with long-term profitability and risk management, a recent survey by Economist Impact finds 89 per cent of corporate leaders expect sustainability to become a more central focus in the future.

A letter from Ceres shows 71 per cent of companies voluntarily report climate-related disclosures. These statistics demonstrate that leaders see long-term value in climate commitments, regardless of whether they are mandated by federal law.

The climate crisis cannot wait for total political alignment or rely solely on government solutions. Through my work in the built environment, I have witnessed how practical approaches deliver real progress. Science-based target-setting remains crucial, with companies actively seeking standardised frameworks. Investment in decarbonisation strategies, including Scope 3 emissions accounting, continues to drive innovation across sectors.

The time for waiting is over. In the current environment, businesses that demonstrate climate leadership will thrive. The question is no longer whether to act, but how quickly we can implement solutions at hand.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/bf4c778d-7e4b-4c64-a64e-3e136f548848.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:17:09.251807

“Being a part of something here in Decatur that’s really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,” Bennick said.","Powering Rural Futures: Clean energy is creating new jobs in rural America, generating opportunities for people who install solar panels, build wind turbines, weatherize homes, and more. This five-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments, and education systems are training this growing workforce.

DECATUR, ILLINOIS — A fistfight at a high school football game nearly defined Shawn Honorable’s life.

It was 1999 when he and a group of teen boys were expelled and faced criminal charges over the incident. The story of the ​“Decatur Seven” drew national headlines and protests led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who framed their harsh treatment as blatant racism. The governor eventually intervened, and the students were allowed to attend alternative schools.

Honorable, now 41, was encouraged by support ​“from around the world,” but he said the incident was traumatizing and he continued to struggle academically and socially. Over the years, he dabbled in illegal activity and was incarcerated, most recently after a 2017 conviction for accepting a large amount of marijuana sent through the mail.

Today, Honorable is ready to start a new chapter, having graduated with honors last week from a clean energy workforce training program at Richland Community College, located in the Central Illinois city of Decatur. He would eventually like to own or manage a solar company, but he has more immediate plans to start a solar-powered mobile hot dog stand. He’s already chosen the name: Buns on the Run.

“By me going back to school and doing this, it shows my nephews and my little cousins and nieces that it is good to have education,” Honorable said. ​“I know this is going to be the new way of life with solar panels. So I’ll have a step up on everyone. When it comes, I will already be aware of what’s going on with this clean energy thing.”

After decades of layoffs and factory closings, the community of Decatur is also looking to clean energy as a potential springboard.

Located amid soybean fields a three-hour drive from Chicago, the city was long known for its Caterpillar, Firestone Tire, and massive corn-syrup factories. Industrial jobs have been in decline for decades, though, and high rates of gun violence, child poverty, unemployment, and incarceration were among the reasons the city was named a clean energy workforce hub funded under Illinois’ 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA).

Decatur’s hub, based at Richland Community College, is arguably the most developed and successful of the dozen or so established statewide. That’s thanks in part to TCCI Manufacturing, a local, family-owned factory that makes electric vehicle compressors. TCCI is expanding its operations with a state-of-the-art testing facility and an on-site campus where Richland students will take classes adjacent to the manufacturing floor. The electric truck company Rivian also has a factory 50 miles away.

“The pieces are all coming together,” Kara Demirjian, senior vice president of TCCI Manufacturing, said by email. ​“What makes this region unique is that it’s not just about one company or one product line. It’s about building an entire clean energy ecosystem. The future of EV manufacturing leadership won’t just be on the coasts — it’s being built right here in the Midwest.”

The Decatur CEJA program has also flourished because it was grafted onto a preexisting initiative, EnRich, that helps formerly incarcerated or otherwise disenfranchised people gain new skills and employment. The program is overseen by the Rev. Courtney Carson, a childhood friend of Honorable and another member of the Decatur Seven.

“So many of us suffer significantly from our unmet needs, our unhealed traumas,” said Carson, who was jailed as a young man for gun possession and later drag racing. With the help of mentors including Rev. Jackson and a college basketball coach, he parlayed his past into leadership, becoming associate pastor at a renowned church, leading a highway construction class at Richland, and in 2017 being elected to the same school board that had expelled him.

Carson, now vice president of external relations at the community college, tapped his own experience to shape EnRich as a trauma-informed approach, with wraparound services to help students overcome barriers — from lack of childcare to PTSD to a criminal record. Carson has faith that students can overcome such challenges to build more promising futures, like Decatur itself has done.

“We have all these new opportunities coming in, and there’s a lot of excitement in the city,” Carson said. ​“That’s magnificent. So what has to happen is these individuals who suffered from closures, they have to be reminded that there is hope.”

Getting students ready for the clean energy workforce

Richland Community College’s clean energy jobs training starts with an eight-week life skills course that has long been central to the larger EnRich program. The course uses a Circle of Courage practice inspired by Indigenous communities and helps students prepare to handle stressful workplace situations like being disrespected or even called a racial slur.

“Being called the N-word, couldn’t that make you want to fight somebody? But now you lose your job,” said Carson. ​“We really dive deep into what’s motivating their attitude and those traumas that have significantly impacted their body to make them respond to situations either the right way or the wrong way.”

The training addresses other dynamics that might be unfamiliar to some students — for example, some male students might not be prepared to be supervised by a woman, Carson noted, or others might not be comfortable with LGBTQ+ coworkers.

Life skills are followed by a construction math course crucial to many clean energy and other trades jobs. During a recent class, 24-year-old Brylan Hodges joked with the teacher while converting fractions to decimals and percentages on the whiteboard. He explained that he moved from St. Louis to Decatur in search of opportunity, and he hopes to become a property manager overseeing solar panel installation and energy-efficiency upgrades on buildings.

Students take an eight-hour primer in clean energy fields including electric vehicles, solar, HVAC, and home energy auditing. Then they choose a clean energy track to pursue, leading to professional certifications as well as a chance to continue at Richland for an associate degree. Under the state-funded program, students are paid for their time attending classes.

Marcus James was part of the first cohort to start the program last October, just days after his release from prison.

He was an 18-year-old living in Memphis, Tennessee, when someone shot at him, as he describes it, and he fired back, with fatal consequences. He was convicted of murder and spent 12 years behind bars. After his release he made his way to Decatur, looking for a safer place to raise his kids. Adjusting to life on the outside wasn’t easy, and he ended up back in prison for a year and a half on DUI and drug possession charges.

Following his release, he was determined to turn his life around.

“After I brought my kids up here, I end up going back to prison. But at that moment, I realized, man, I had to change,” James told a crowd at an event celebrating the clean jobs program in March.

James said that at first, he showed up late to every class. But soon the lessons sank in, and he was never late again. He always paid attention when people talked, and he gained new confidence.

“As long as I put my mind to it, I can do it,” said James, who would like to work as a home energy auditor. Richland partners with the energy utility Ameren to place trainees in such positions.

“I like being out in the field, learning new stuff, dealing with homes, helping people,” James said, noting he made energy-efficiency improvements to his own home after the course.

How Illinois’ energy policy prioritizes equity

Illinois’ 2017 Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) launched the state’s clean energy transition, baking in equity goals that prioritize opportunities for people who benefited least and were harmed most by the fossil fuel economy. It created programs to deploy solar arrays and provide job training in marginalized and environmental justice communities.

FEJA’s rollout was rocky. Funding for equity-focused solar installations went unspent while workforce programs struggled to recruit trainees and connect them with jobs. The pandemic didn’t help. The follow-up legislation, CEJA, expanded workforce training programs and remedied snafus in the original law.

Melissa Gombar is principal director of workforce development programs for Elevate, a Chicago-based national nonprofit organization that oversaw FEJA job training and subcontracts for a Chicago-area CEJA hub. Gombar said many community organizations tasked with running FEJA training programs were relatively small and grassroots, so they had to scramble to build new financial and human resources infrastructure.

“They have to have certain policies in place for hiring and procurement. The influx of grant money might have doubled their budget,” Gombar said. Meanwhile, the state employees tasked with helping the groups ​“are really talented and skilled, trying their best, but they’re overburdened because of the large lift.”

CEJA, by contrast, tapped community colleges like Richland, which already had robust infrastructure and staffing. CEJA also funds community organizations to serve as ​“navigators,” using the trust and credibility they’ve developed in communities to recruit trainees.

Richland Community College received $2.6 million from April 2024 through June 2025, and the Community Foundation of Macon County, the hub’s navigator, received $440,000 for the same time period. The other hubs similarly received between $1 million and $3.3 million for the past year, and state officials have said the same level of funding will be allocated for each of the next two years, according to the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CEJA hubs also include social service providers that connect trainees with wraparound support; businesses like TCCI that offer jobs; and affiliated entrepreneur incubators that help people start their own clean energy businesses. CEJA also funded apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs with labor unions, which are often a prerequisite for employment in utility-scale solar and wind.

“The sum of the parts is greater than the whole,” said Drew Keiser, TCCI vice president of global human resources. ​“The navigator is saying, ​‘Hey, I’ve connected with this portion of the population that’s been overlooked or underserved.’ OK, once you get them trained, send their resumes to me, and I’ll get them interviewed. We’re seeing a real pipeline into careers.”

The hub partners go to great lengths to aid students — for example, coordinating and often paying for transportation, childcare, or even car repairs.

“If you need some help, they always there for you,” James said.

What’s next for Decatur and its clean energy trainees?

In 1984, TCCI began making vehicle compressors in a Decatur plant formerly used to build Sherman tanks during World War II. A few decades later, the company began producing compressors for electric vehicles, which are much more elaborate and sensitive than those for internal combustion engines.

In August 2023, Gov. JB Pritzker joined TCCI President Richard Demirjian, the Decatur mayor, and college officials for the groundbreaking of an Electric Vehicle Innovation Hub, which will include a climatic research facility — basically a high-tech wind tunnel where companies and researchers from across the world can send EV chargers, batteries, compressors, and other components for testing in extreme temperatures, rain, and wind.

A $21.3 million capital grant and a $2.2 million electric vehicle incentive from the state are funding the wind tunnel and the new facilities where Richland classes will be held. In 2022, Pritzker announced these investments as furthering the state goal of 1 million EVs on the road by 2030.

“Being a part of something here in Decatur that’s really leading the nation in this clean energy initiative is exciting,” Bennick said. ​“It can be done here in the middle of the cornfields. We want to show people a framework that they can take and scale in other places.”

With graduation behind him, Honorable is planning the types of hot dogs and sausages he’ll sell at Buns on the Run. He said Tamika Thomas, director of the CEJA program at Richland, has also encouraged him to consider teaching so he can share the clean energy skills he’s learned with others. The world seems wide open with possibilities.

“A little at a time — I’m going to focus on the tasks in front of me that I’m passionate about, and then see what’s next,” Honorable said. He invoked a favorite scene from the cartoon TV series ​“The Flintstones,” in which the characters’ leg power, rather than wheels and batteries, propelled vehicles: ​“Like Fred and Barney, I’ll be up and running.”

Community solar is a powerful movement that is quietly reshaping the renewable power landscape in the United States. Across the country, local projects are giving businesses and households an opportunity to tap into solar energy, even if they cannot install panels on their rooftops themselves.

The shift toward community solar is not just about advancing technology or cost savings — it is about building stronger communities by broadening access and accelerating the transition to clean energy.

What Is Community Solar?

Community solar refers to local solar power installations shared by multiple subscribers who receive electricity bill credits for their share of the power produced. In most cases, subscribers save on their electricity expenses, depending on the program design and prevailing rates.

The model is especially beneficial for renters and those with shaded roofs because it eliminates the need to install solar panels individually. Community solar stands out as a scalable and flexible renewable energy model because it circumvents traditional solar power adoption by addressing high energy costs and overcoming limitations due to space and home ownership.

Benefits of Community Solar Adoption

Beyond lowering utility bills, community solar plays a major role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, decarbonizing the grid, and reducing fossil fuel reliance. It also helps create a variety of local jobs, keeping more energy dollars circulating within the community. Because some programs prioritize low-income households, clean energy also becomes more accessible and equitable.

Sustainability and longevity are also key reasons why this program is advantageous. Rigid solar panels — commonly used in high-output solar farms because of their durability and heat resistance — maintain high efficiency even in extreme or fluctuating heat conditions.

Local Initiatives Leading the Way

Community solar adoption is already happening in towns, neighborhoods and cities across the U.S., powered by partnerships between developers, utilities, corporations and local governments. There is at least one community solar project in 44 areas in the country. Notable collaborations include: Microsoft and Nexamp

In May 2025, clean energy firm Nexamp announced that it signed a deal with Microsoft to support around 100 new community solar projects — totaling 300 megawatts — across five independent system operator regions in the U.S. The project prioritizes areas that have not experienced the environmental and economic benefits of solar energy yet. It is set to roll out in the next four years, aligning with Microsoft's goal to become carbon-negative by 2030.

Shared Solar Program in Virginia

Virginia passed laws in 2020 to create the Shared Solar Program, which provides Dominion Energy Virginia customers the chance to subscribe and get credits on their monthly electricity bill. The initiative prioritizes renters, building occupants, those with shaded or poor roofing conditions, and homeowners who cannot buy their own solar panels. Customers pay a minimum amount to the utility provider to cover distribution and infrastructure maintenance work.

As evidence of the push toward clean energy use, the Community Solar Consumer Choice Act of 2023 aims to broaden access to solar programs by instructing the Department of Energy to support initiatives for its growth. The bill also seeks to extend the length of contracts between public utilities and the federal government, thus encouraging investment and greater stability.

Cost of Community Solar Programs

The benefits of community solar are clear, but it is equally important to understand the financial considerations.

On the upside, most solar programs have no upfront costs, eliminating one of the largest roadblocks to adoption. Subscribers can sign up and start receiving credits on their electric bills. This model helps underserved households get on board with the transition to clean energy.

On the downside, actual cost savings are unpredictable. When contract terms are unclear or market conditions shift, some customers may even receive higher rates compared to their standard utility expenses. Regulatory hurdles can also slow down project rollouts and increase administrative and operating costs, which may be passed on to consumers later.

Building a Clean Future Through Community Solar

The need for resilient energy resources increases as climate change intensifies. Community solar programs have the ability to distribute power across many sites, making it accessible to more people across different economic backgrounds. From small towns in Maine to corporate locations in the Midwest, the community solar movement is laying the foundation for a cleaner, more sustainable, and more equitable energy future.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/051925EPsolarpanels.jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 11:17:22.182755

The United Kingdom has adopted numerous policy instruments to scale back the domestic fossil fuel industry while propping up clean energy generation.
And the pressure on the oil and gas industry seems to be working – perhaps a little too well.
Projects that could offer jobs to laid-off fossil fuel workers are facing “repeated delays” and potentially untenable financial circumstances.
The BBC notes that the slew of canceled and delayed clean energy projects could be driven by a number of causes, many of which have little to do with the invisible hand.","The United Kingdom’s green energy transition is facing a dangerous slowdown at a critical moment for the economy and the environment. The Labour Party has ambitiously planned for British energy output to be 95% clean by 2030, but many stalled renewable energy projects show that the sector may be contracting just when the government is pushing for expansion.

The United Kingdom has adopted numerous policy instruments to scale back the domestic fossil fuel industry while propping up clean energy generation. And the pressure on the oil and gas industry seems to be working – perhaps a little too well. Just last month, oil and gas firm Harbour Energy announced that it would axe hundreds of jobs in the North Sea, and thousands more positions are at risk, with little to no contingency plan for those workers. And while the government has agreed to issue a limited number of new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea, these licenses are currently being challenged in court. What’s more, oil and gas reserves in the North Sea are dwindling.

But while oil and gas are indeed on the decline, clean energy projects are not stepping in to take their place at nearly the desired rate. Projects that could offer jobs to laid-off fossil fuel workers are facing “repeated delays” and potentially untenable financial circumstances. “And the gap between one industry declining and the other rising is growing wider,” according to the BBC. This could spell major trouble not only for British laborers but also for the nation’s energy security.

The BBC notes that the slew of canceled and delayed clean energy projects could be driven by a number of causes, many of which have little to do with the invisible hand. “Because the UK government has set such an ambitious and high-profile target for clean, green power, it may be that [clean energy sector] developers are using the leverage of a halted project to get a more attractive set of price guarantees,” the BBC speculates. “It may also be that Harbour Energy is backing up the wider oil and gas industry in putting pressure on the UK government to give it a less hostile business environment,” the report goes on to note. “It took only a few minutes from the announcement of Harbour's job losses to Prime Minister's Questions, with both the Conservatives and SNP piling on the pressure.”

Clearly, creating a smooth and just clean energy transition is far from easy. Research from campaign group Oil Change International has estimated that transitioning to a renewable-powered grid without leaving oil and gas workers in the dust will cost the United Kingdom about £1.9 billion per year. “Of this, about £1.1bn would be needed to help develop the wind industry and create new green jobs; about £440m would be needed to invest in ports to make them capable of constructing and maintaining offshore wind turbines; and £355m would cover a training fund for oil and gas workers,” the Guardian reports.

Not only is the power struggle over the terms and conditions of the United Kingdom’s clean energy transition leaving many Brits in the lurch, it’s also creating a major threat to the nation’s energy security and climate goals. Without a strong renewables sector to take the place of the flagging fossil fuels industry, Great Britain will remain dangerously dependent on imported natural gas in an era of extreme political and geopolitical tensions, and all of the price volatility that comes with it.

This is bad news for British consumers, who have been battered by high energy prices over the past few years thanks to the energy crisis brought on by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and retaliatory tariffs placed on the Kremlin, one of the world’s key suppliers of oil and gas. Recent estimates suggest that approximately 11% of households in England are classed as fuel poor, 34% in Scotland, 14% in Wales, and 24% in Northern Ireland. This means that these households must spend a high proportion of their income to keep their home at a reasonable temperature.

A new call seeking proposals which could help accelerate Ireland’s clean energy transition has been launched by the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI).

With support from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, SEAI will invest around €19m in a pipeline of energy research, development and demonstration (RD&D) projects over a number of years.

The 2025 call includes two strands, a themed one and an open one. The thematic strand includes research topics co-developed by SEAI in consultation with Government departments and agencies. These themes include heat, electricity, grid flexibility, electric vehicle grants, energy modelling, maritime transport and energy poverty, among others.

While the open strand is available to any research that contributes to Ireland’s clean energy transition.

This year, the call includes co-funding partnerships with Met Éireann, the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The deadline to apply for the funding programme is on 1 July 2025.

The call is a part of SEAI’s National Energy RD&D programme, which has funded more than 240 projects upwards of €100m over the past six years.

These projects bring solutions to a wide array of energy solutions, including wind, bioenergy, energy markets, smart grids, transportation and energy policy, among others.

In addition to launching the funding call today (19 May), SEAI has also released the first impact report for the National Energy RD&D programme.

The report states that more than 100 projects – resulting in more than 60 software tools, platforms and models – came out of the programme between 2018 and 2019.

In that time period, the programme spent more than €3.2m in co-funding, supporting dozens of researchers and students along the way.

“Research and innovation are vital enablers for delivery of Ireland’s energy and climate ambitions,” said Minister for Climate, Environment and Energy Darragh O’Brien, TD.

The director of research and policy insight at SEAI, Margie McCarthy, said that fostering an environment of advanced research is a pivotal step to address the pressing challenges of energy sustainability and efficiency.

“SEAI supports for research, development and demonstration aim to drive advancements that will benefit our communities and contribute significantly to Ireland’s national strategy for a sustainable future.”

Last week, Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science James Lawless, TD, told third-level institutions in the country that his department intends to place “particular emphasis” on strengthening Ireland’s research performance.

What it means for Michigan | The Manchester Mirror,Not Available,,,,,https://themanchestermirror.com/2025/05/19/epa-weakens-pfas-drinking-water-limits-what-it-means-for-michigan/,"Biden’s EPA created the nation’s first enforceable drinking water limits on PFAS in 2024, responding to mounting evidence that has linked various PFAS compounds to cancer and other health risks.
All have a significant presence in Michigan, which is home to 347 known or suspected sites of PFAS contamination.
Leaders of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the National Rural Water Association, which represent drinking water providers, lauded Wednesday’s announcement of a deadline extension.
Several groups representing drinking water providers had sued the federal government over the Biden-era PFAS standards, arguing that the cost of filtering PFAS out of drinking water will be too high.
Representatives of Michigan’s drinking water sector had a more muted reaction.","The Trump administration has announced plans to rescind drinking-water limits on four PFAS “forever chemical” compounds while extending the compliance deadline for two others, in a move that outraged victims of Michigan’s widespread PFAS contamination.

Nationwide regulations limiting allowable levels of PFOA and PFOS — two of the most common among thousands of PFAS compounds — now won’t take effect until 2031, which is two years later than previously scheduled. There will no longer be a federal limit on PFHxS, PFNA, GenX or PFBS, four other compounds that the Biden administration had moved to regulate last year.

Michigan’s state-level drinking water standards will continue to limit the compounds that the federal government no longer wants to regulate. However, several of those state-level standards are weaker than the federal ones the EPA is rescinding.

Biden’s EPA created the nation’s first enforceable drinking water limits on PFAS in 2024, responding to mounting evidence that has linked various PFAS compounds to cancer and other health risks. Water systems were given until 2029 to comply.

In a statement Wednesday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin called that deadline too aggressive and said the Trump administration’s planned extension would offer “common-sense flexibility” while drinking water providers take measures to stay beneath the limits.

“This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants,” he added.

The announcement drew cheers from national groups representing water utilities, which have raised concerns about high costs to install PFAS filtration systems, and outrage from PFAS activists who called the rollbacks a victory for chemical companies at the expense of Americans’ health.

“These actions will undoubtedly make the drinking water of millions of people across the country less safe,” said Tony Spaniola, co-chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network.

If the EPA follows through on its plans, he said, lawsuits are likely to follow.

“We haven’t heard the last of this by any stretch of the imagination,” he said, “but man, I would much rather be in the position we were in a year ago, when these things were moving forward and we had a Justice Department and an EPA that was going to vigorously defend them.”

Known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily in the environment, PFAS — short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — have been heavily used by industry and present in common household products for decades. While some PFAS manufacturers knew long ago that their products were toxic, the chemicals went largely unregulated until recently, when a widening contamination crisis began to make headlines in Michigan and around the globe.

The most heavily polluted sites are associated with the military and industry, including paper mills, metal plating operations, textile manufacturers and airports. All have a significant presence in Michigan, which is home to 347 known or suspected sites of PFAS contamination.

If the EPA follows through with its planned rollbacks, Michigan’s drinking water will remain better protected against PFAS than the water in most other states, because state officials took the unusual step in 2020 of enacting their own drinking water standards for seven compounds.

However, some of those state-level limits are weaker than the limits enacted by Biden’s EPA, and their future hangs in the balance after chemical company 3-M sued the state in hopes of voiding them.

‘Years of progress’

In Oscoda, where PFAS used on a now-defunct Air Force base has caused widespread groundwater and surface water contamination, one of the main sources of pollution would now be left unregulated at the federal level. Michigan’s limit for that compound, known as PFHxS, is far less stringent.

Spaniola, who owns a cabin in Oscoda, said the plan to lift limits on several PFAS chemicals “undoes years of progress” to protect the health of residents in Oscoda and other communities.

Leaders of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators and the National Rural Water Association, which represent drinking water providers, lauded Wednesday’s announcement of a deadline extension.

Several groups representing drinking water providers had sued the federal government over the Biden-era PFAS standards, arguing that the cost of filtering PFAS out of drinking water will be too high. It’s not clear whether those lawsuits will continue in light of Wednesday’s announcement.

Representatives of Michigan’s drinking water sector had a more muted reaction.

However, Congress is considering a budget reconciliation bill that could cut funding and put a damper on union jobs and private investment.

Dana Kuhnline, program director for the coalition ReImagine Appalachia, said funds included in the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act could be lost.

""One of the reasons that's so harmful for our region is that a huge percentage of the Inflation Reduction Act was targeted with special provisions for communities that had seen a downturn from manufacturing and other industry loss, to try and build those industries back up,"" Kuhnline explained.

According to data from the Center for American Progress, Ohio has seen a record $11 billion in investments and created more than 4,700 jobs since the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2021.

Rike Rothenstein, senior research associate for ReImagine Appalachia, said Ohio leads four Appalachian states with a total of $40 billion in public and private investments. She noted federal money helped spur economic growth and drove companies to the region.

""It is really the private investment that was significantly responsible for that renaissance,"" Rothenstein emphasized. ""For that push and strengthening of U.S. manufacturing in the region.""

The report shows federal investments in clean energy manufacturing and transportation technologies totaled about $128 billion between 2022 and 2024.

As the Appalachian Trail turns 100, conservation groups are sounding alarms over federal funding freezes and staff cuts.

The trail runs through the broader Appalachian region, including parts of southern Ohio and is a popular destination for thousands of Ohio hikers. Conservation groups warned recent layoffs at the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service could slow maintenance and repair work on the 2,200-mile trail.

Hawk Metheny, vice president of trail management for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, said Federal funds remain tied up in Congress, leaving local volunteers to carry the weight.

""We're carrying on. We've been here 100 years and we'll endure through this,"" Metheny emphasized. ""It is the people's trail, the citizens' trail, so it's an all-hands effort.""

More than 3 million people visit the Appalachian Trail each year. In Ohio, the outdoor recreation economy supports more than 125,000 jobs and brings in $11.8 billion annually, according to the Outdoor Industry Association.

Metheny noted recent extreme weather, such as flooding from Hurricane Helene, has damaged hundreds of trail miles. Volunteers have stepped in to relocate or reinforce affected areas but long-term stability requires federal support for land conservation and public access.

""It's an important resource for scenic values, recreational values, wildlife habitat, biodiversity protection,"" Metheny outlined. ""The AT provides all those values across the entirety of the Appalachians from Georgia to Maine.""

Several Ohio-based groups, including the Buckeye Trail Association, said public lands and trail systems provide vital health and tourism benefits. Events along the Appalachian Trail this summer aim to raise awareness and celebrate a century of stewardship and public access.

The dismantling of the 30-year-old AmeriCorps national service program by the Department of Government Efficiency will have significant effects in New Mexico.

Last year, AmeriCorps recruited more than 4,500 participants in the state to help meet local needs and strengthen communities. Program grants are administered by the Serve New Mexico Commission, working under the Department of Workforce Solutions.

Kristin Hsueh, executive director of the commission, said funding was eliminated for a planning grant and six of 10 operational programs, leaving only four still functioning.

""These program were offering services to the communities, everything from tutoring to after-school programming, mentorship, trail restoration,"" Hsueh outlined. ""It's a significant cut, it's almost about two-thirds of our programs.""

New Mexico has joined 24 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit suing over the Trump administration's cuts. The state's Attorney General said the action will hurt students, families and underserved communities. In New Mexico, a fourth of all AmeriCorps workers identify as Hispanic or Latino, the highest percentage in the nation.

Hsueh pointed out at least 84 AmeriCorps members in New Mexico were affected immediately, and 100 who were expected to participate this summer have been notified their positions have been defunded. She noted members and senior volunteers have previously served at more than 300 locations across the state.

""They are gaining a lot of experience,"" Hsueh observed. ""They are serving something that's greater than themselves, which is really what AmeriCorps is all about, dedicating a portion of your life to make sure that you are improving the lives of others.""

Initially known as Volunteers in Service to America or VISTA, AmeriCorps was created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 and renamed under President Bill Clinton. Nationwide, more than 75,000 people work in service each year, with land trusts, schools, public agencies and community and faith-based groups. Funding made up less than 1% of the federal budget.

Results of a new survey of nearly 900 small business owners across the country show they are concerned about an uncertain economy, including the owners of small mom and pop operations in Nebraska.

The survey, conducted by Small Business for America's Future, shows that nearly 70% of small business owners think the Trump administration fell short on economic leadership during its first 100 days.

They cited tariffs as a key factor in creating instability.

Gladys Harrison, owner of Big Mama's Kitchen and Catering in Omaha, said the tariffs will affect the cost of the imported seasonings she uses for her family's oven-fried chicken recipe.

""They're telling me,"" said Harrison, ""that they could see a 25% to 145% increase with these tariffs in what they're going to charge me for my seasonings.""

The Trump administration has said it is imposing tariffs in an effort to create more U.S.-based jobs and improve the domestic economy.

Harrison said she is thinking of ways to avoid closing her doors or passing the price increases on to her loyal customers, many of whom have been eating Big Mama's fried chicken for generations.

""And we don't want to have our food so expensive,"" said Harrison, ""that the people who live and work in our community can't come and spend their money with us.""

Harrison said higher costs will also hinder her ability to be involved in the community, a tradition she said her mother and grandmother taught her was critical to any small, family-owned business.

Brian Bienkowski reports for The New Lede.

In short:

The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers issued a memo in March narrowing the Clean Water Act’s scope following the Supreme Court’s Sackett v. EPA decision, removing protections for wetlands connected by ditches or culverts.

Industry groups such as homebuilders and agricultural associations support the change, citing long-standing confusion and regulatory burden, while tribes and environmental advocates warn it weakens water safeguards and threatens treaty rights.

Over half of Iowa’s rivers and streams and two-thirds of its lakes are already impaired, largely due to agricultural runoff, with many affected waterways serving as sources of public drinking water.

Key quote:

“Removing a large number of both wetlands and streams from those basic protections will bring us back to a period of water insecurity that Americans have forgotten and probably do not want to relive.”

— Jim Murphy, director of legal advocacy, National Wildlife Federation

Why this matters:

When the federal government pulls back protections under the Clean Water Act, the effects ripple. Many small and seasonal streams feed into the rivers and lakes that supply drinking water for millions of Americans. Wetlands, often dismissed as inconvenient swamps, play a key role in absorbing floodwaters, filtering pollutants, and sustaining biodiversity. Without federal oversight, states with powerful agricultural lobbies may struggle — or decline — to regulate pollution from fertilizer and manure runoff. In places like Iowa, this means more nitrates in drinking water, a chemical linked to birth defects and cancer.

Meanwhile, tribal communities with already limited authority over their water may find themselves increasingly sidelined. The Trump administration’s tighter interpretation of WOTUS may simplify regulations for some industries, but it also puts ecosystems and public health at greater risk, especially as climate change increases the frequency of floods and droughts.

Mr. Trump dismisses the threats posed by climate change, suggesting that rising seas would create more “oceanfront property.” He blames “climate lunatics” for environmental regulations that he says have been a drag on the U.S. economy.
At the most basic level, the Trump administration is dismantling the government’s ability to monitor a rapidly changing climate.
Last month, the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been working on the National Climate Assessment, a report mandated by Congress that details how global warming is affecting specific regions across the country.
The administration has purged the phrases “climate crisis” and “climate science” from government websites.","When the Trump administration declared two weeks ago that it would largely disregard the economic cost of climate change as it sets policies and regulations, it was just the latest step in a multipronged effort to erase global warming from the American agenda.

But President Trump is doing more than just turning a blind eye to the fact that the planet is growing hotter. He is weakening the country’s capacity to understand global warming and to prepare for its consequences.

The administration has dismantled climate research, firing some of the nation’s top scientists, and gutted efforts to chart how fast greenhouse gases are building up in the atmosphere and what that means for the economy, employment, agriculture, health and other aspects of American society. The government will no longer track major sources of greenhouse gases, data that has been used to measure the scale and identify sources of the problem for the past 15 years.

“We’re not doing that climate change, you know, crud, anymore,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told Fox Business on May 8.

By getting rid of data, the administration is trying to halt the national discussion about how to deal with global warming, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The notion of there being any shared factual reality just seems to be completely out the window,” he said.

At the same time, through cuts to the National Weather Service and by denying disaster relief through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the administration has weakened the country’s ability to prepare for and recover from hurricanes, wildfires, droughts and other extreme weather that is being made worse by climate change.

The president is also moving to loosen restrictions on air pollution, which experts say will lead to more planet warming emissions, and to overturn the government’s legal authority to regulate those gases.

Taken together, these moves are poised to leave the world’s biggest economy less informed, less prepared and, over time, more polluted.

Mr. Trump dismisses the threats posed by climate change, suggesting that rising seas would create more “oceanfront property.” He blames “climate lunatics” for environmental regulations that he says have been a drag on the U.S. economy.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump declared a national energy emergency, something that experts dispute because the United States is producing more oil than any country in history and is the world’s largest exporter of natural gas. Mr. Trump has cited the emergency as justification for speeding approvals for oil, gas and coal projects and expanding logging in national forests.

Some agree that reforms to the nation’s environmental regulations were overdue. Complex and lengthy processes to get permits to build pipelines, transmission lines and drilling projects have also meant significant delays for wind farms, solar projects and other clean energy, said Robert Stavins, a professor of energy and economic development at Harvard University.

“Permitting as whole in the United States is just a mess,” he said.

But the president has gone much further than just trying to speed up permits. He’s made the American government a global outlier in its denial of science.

“It’s as if we’re in the Dark Ages,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

At the most basic level, the Trump administration is dismantling the government’s ability to monitor a rapidly changing climate.

Last month, the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been working on the National Climate Assessment, a report mandated by Congress that details how global warming is affecting specific regions across the country.

In recent weeks, more than 500 people have left the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the government’s premier agency for climate and weather science. That has led the National Weather Service, an agency within NOAA, to warn of “degraded operations.”

NOAA also stopped monthly briefing calls on climate change, and the president’s proposed budget would eliminate funding for the agency’s weather and climate research. The administration has purged the phrases “climate crisis” and “climate science” from government websites.

The so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting effort spearheaded by the billionaire Elon Musk, has proposed closing a NOAA observatory in Hawaii that has been continuously monitoring greenhouse gas levels since 1958.

The data collected there were used to create the Keeling Curve, a well-known graph that showed the sharp recent rise in carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. The data from Hawaii and other NOAA monitoring stations are shared with scientists around the globe and inform international climate negotiations.

“The lack of scientific data collection is going to harm our ability to understand the natural and physical world,” said Brandon Jones, president of the American Geophysical Union. “It’s also going to impact our ability to provide early warning systems for severe storms or the next wildfire. It’s going to have an impact on lives.”

A spokesman for the Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, defended the cuts, saying that the agency was exploring new ways to collect data and did not expect disruptions to weather forecasting.

The capacity to respond

Instead, the White House is trying to shift responsibility to the states. The administration has canceled a FEMA program aimed at making communities more resilient before disasters hit, calling it “wasteful and ineffective.” And it said FEMA staffers would no longer go door to door to help survivors after a catastrophe.

In a statement, a spokesman for the National Security Council said that when disasters strike, states must have “an appetite to own the problem.”

“The Trump administration is reforming a broken disaster relief system that has repeatedly let Americans down,” said Kush Desai, an administration spokesman. “Instead of doling out blank checks, the administration is working with state and local governments to proactively make investments and enact common sense policies that prioritize disaster preparedness and resilience.”

As human-caused global warming increases, disasters are becoming more frequent, destructive and expensive. There were just three billion-dollar disasters in the United States in 1980, but that total increased to 27 last year, according to data collected by NOAA. The agency said last week that it would no longer tally and publicly report the costs of extreme weather.

Daniel Kaniewski, who served as FEMA’s acting deputy administrator during the first Trump administration, said it made little sense to cut programs that help harden communities against extreme weather.

“The longer we go without these programs, the more risk will accrue to these communities and the nation,” said Mr. Kaniewski, who is now a managing director at Marsh McLennan, an insurance broker and risk adviser. “And soon enough, we’ll all bear the consequences.”

Going into hurricane season, FEMA is being run by an acting administrator with no experience in emergency management. As of May 8, the agency had available about half as many staff members trained to respond to disasters as it did at the same time last year, according to agency documents. That follows months of downsizing at FEMA through resignations and layoffs.

FEMA has recently denied some requests for assistance from Arkansas, where a series of tornadoes in March was followed by a second round of destructive weather, including flooding and hail. It also rejected requests from several counties in West Virginia where February floods caused extensive damage; Washington State, which was battered by windstorms; and North Carolina, which is still trying to recover from Hurricane Helene, which destroyed 1,000 homes last year.

Jonas Anderson, the mayor of Cave City, Ark., population 1,994, where a tornado destroyed more than 20 homes and many local businesses, said FEMA’s denial of community assistance was “shocking and disappointing.”

“It’s pretty rough on people,” Mr. Anderson said.

Slashing regulations

The Environmental Protection Agency, which has been the government’s lead agency in terms of measuring and controlling greenhouse gas emissions, is being overhauled to end those functions. The administration is shredding the E.P.A.’s staff and budget and wants to revoke its two most powerful climate regulations: limits on pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks.

Mr. Trump has said that relaxing limits on pollution from automobiles wouldn’t “mean a damn bit of difference to the environment.”

But transportation is the largest single source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States and its pollution is linked to asthma, heart disease, other health problems and premature deaths.

Sensing an opening, two major chemical industry trade groups, have asked the E.P.A. administrator, Lee Zeldin, for a complete exemption from limits on hazardous pollution.

“Rolling back regulations will have a catastrophic effect on health in America,” said Harold Wimmer, the chief executive of the American Lung Association.

Throttling the energy transition

Mr. Trump has made no secret of his hostility toward wind power, along with most of the clean energy technologies that would help the country pivot away from oil, gas and coal and reduce the emissions driving climate change.

But actions by his administration last month shocked many observers. It ordered a stop to construction that was underway on a wind farm off the coast of Long Island.

That wind farm, developed by Norway-based Equinor, had received all necessary permits in 2023 — after nearly four years of environmental reviews — along with $3 billion in financing. The project, which been expected to provide electricity to 500,000 homes by 2027, was about 30 percent complete when the stop work order was issued.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested on social media that the permits had been rushed. Equinor is considering legal action.

“To stop a project that already has all its federal permits is fairly unprecedented, especially at a large scale, like this,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environmental programs for Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works to promote development in the area around New York City. “It shows how determined they are to hurt this industry.”

Around the world, countries are racing to adapt to a rapidly warming planet, reduce pollution and build clean energy. China, the only other superpower, has made a strategic decision to adopt clean energy and then sell it abroad, dominating the global markets for electric vehicles, solar panels and other technologies. Even Saudi Arabia, the second-largest producer of oil after the United States, is spending heavily on wind and solar power.

Average global temperatures last year were the hottest on record and 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, a threshold that nations had been working to avoid. Every fraction of a degree of additional warming raises the risk of severe effects and possibly irreversible changes to the planet. Nations must make deep and fast cuts to pollution to avoid a grim future of increasingly violent weather, deadly heat waves, drought, water scarcity and displacement, scientists have said.

But at this perilous moment, the United States is virtually alone in the world in rejecting climate science.

“Here we see a government that is taking a hatchet to the scientific enterprise,” Ms. Cleetus said. “It’s the kind of destruction that will have implications for a while to come.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/02/multimedia/00cli-blindeye-01-kjlc/00cli-blindeye-01-kjlc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:33.921144

An affirmative ruling would unfreeze the funds, held in a custodial account at Citibank, unleashing much needed capital to the nine plaintiffs that have been unable to pay staff or fulfill loans and technical assistance grants since mid-February. The opposite could give the EPA a greenlight to reclaim the funds.

The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, sought to catalyze a nationwide green lending infrastructure that could finance pollution-reducing projects that benefit rural and low-income communities and mobilize private capital. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has painted the program as rife with fraud and abuse, and its recipients as unqualified and conflicted, without providing any evidence. Despite broad-based subpoenas — the pretext for freezing the funds — government officials have uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing or malfeasance, according to a New York Times report.

A new analysis by Energy Innovation found that the program power up to 2.2 million homes with solar power each year, save consumers $52 billion in energy costs over the next 20 years, and spur $65.5 billion in private investment.

If the appeals court affirms the preliminary injunction issued by federal Judge Tanya Chutkan in mid-April, the best case scenario for green bank awardees, Citi would have no choice but to release the funds. The EPA would likely try to terminate the GGRF program again, but would have to go through prescribed rules, buying the green bank grantees time. Alternatively, the appeals court could reject the earlier court’s ruling, enabling the government to claw back the Congressionally appropriated funds. In between those bookends, one person close to the suit said, are numerous possible scenarios, all almost certainly involving appeals and counter-appeals and potentially leading to the Supreme Court.

The drawn out legal battle is already taking a toll. Last week, Rewiring America, a member of the Power Forward Coalition, laid off 28% of its workforce. “We are facing purposeful volatility designed to prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and from delivering lower energy costs and cheaper electricity to millions of American households across the country,” wrote the group’s Ari Matusiak in a post announcing the news.

Burning bridges

Other parts of the landmark IRA, a comprehensive law aimed at reshoring critical clean industries and supply chains, are facing their own threats. Energy Department officials are expected this week to “de-obligate” loans and guarantees to seven projects that had been offered conditional commitments by the agency’s Loan Programs Office, former DOE Loan Programs Office Jigar Shah said in an email.

The Biden administration boosted the LPO’s loan authority to $400 billion to help build “a bridge to bankability” for promising cleantech startups. Under Shah, former DOE Loan Programs Office chief, LPO committed more than $107 billion to 53 projects. Some $60 billion of those loans and guarantees were concluded; another $46.95 billion were still pending conditional milestones.

The conditional loans, said Shah, are intended to “signal to equity investors that the project can meet a ‘reasonable prospect of repayment.’” That, of course, assumes a stable policy environment — a quaint notion as House Republicans drafting a budget bill have take an ax to the IRA’s tax incentives, phasing out or eliminating provisions that cleantech companies and their investors had baked into their models.

“The House reconciliation bill has effectively repealed the Inflation Reduction Act and has caused these equity investors to think twice about investing in America,” said Shah. The bill, he said, would undercut nuclear power, critical minerals, geothermal and other energy sectors that the Trump administration claims to support. “When we lose the trust of equity investors, our loan applicants have no choice but to move away from commercializing their technologies in America or cancel their projects outright.”

The budget bill failed to pass a committee vote over the weekend. Although some Republicans support the IRA tax incentives, which have lured factories and jobs to their districts, the bill was torpedoed by hardliners pushing even more stringent IRA cuts.",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_1270641352.jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:59.767512

According to the agency's announcement, EPA plans to issue a proposed rule with respect to these changes to the PFAS MCLs in the fall and will finalize the rule in Spring 2026.
For more information on PFAS chemicals and the regulatory and litigation risks that they pose, please visit our PFAS webpage.","On May 14, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") announced that it will rescind the nationwide Maximum Contaminant Levels (""MCLs"") for certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (""PFAS"") set by the agency in April 2024, with the exception of PFOA and PFOS. For those two chemicals, public water systems across the country will now have an additional two years to comply with the MCLs. In its announcement, EPA previewed the following anticipated actions related to the regulation of PFAS in drinking water:

As noted above, the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, two of the PFAS substances most regulated to date, will remain in place at 4 parts per trillion, although public water systems will now have an additional two years (until 2031, rather than 2029) to comply with these MCLs.

EPA pledged to support the U.S. Department of Justice in ""defending ongoing legal challenges"" to the PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation for PFOA and PFOS.

The MCLs for four other PFAS — PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX) — along with the Hazard Index for combinations of these substances will be rescinded and possibly reconsidered.

The agency is establishing a new technical assistance and outreach initiative for public water systems (in addition to continuing to offer the water technical assistance (WaterTA) service). EPA states that the new initiative, known as the PFAS OUTreach Initiative, or PFAS OUT, will prioritize outreach to public water systems in need of capital improvements to address PFAS impacts and will connect those utilities with ""resources, tools, funding, and technical assistance"" to position them to achieve compliance with the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS by the new deadline.

The agency hinted at ""holding polluters accountable"" and prioritizing enforcement against industrial sources of PFAS contaminating public water supplies, noting that ""the need for a polluter pays model has guided a lot of the work to be done at EPA in the future.""

The South and Central America region meanwhile saw 489MW/2,157MWh, primarily driven by projects in Chile. April saw developer Grenergy and investor CountourGlobal bring online the second phase of Grenergy’s huge Oasis de Atacama solar-plus-storage project while independent power producer (IPP) Atlas Renewable Energy commissioned its BESS Del Desierto project.

The Oceania region (in Rho Motion’s data) also had its best month of 2025, deploying 494MW/1,097MWh, primarily in Australia, including the Cunderdin solar-plus-storage project with a 55MW/220MWh BESS.

Though Republican support for wind energy has dropped a bit in recent years, it remains above 50%.
In Virginia, Republican leaders have been among the biggest boosters of offshore wind for more than 15 years.
Legislators from both parties supported the creation of the Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority.
We can’t afford to lose four years of offshore wind progress for no better reason than that Trump wills it.","On May 5, attorneys general from 17 states and the District of Columbia — not including Virginia, regrettably — sued the Trump administration over its attacks on the wind industry. The lawsuit challenges an executive order, signed by President Donald J. Trump on his first day in office, stopping all approvals, permits and funding for wind projects across the country and offshore.

Since the order was signed, the administration hasn’t just blocked new projects, it’s issued a stop-work order for one project under construction in New York and revoked a permit for another. The actions inflict enormous damage on the wind industry and on the economies of states that need the energy and jobs this industry could deliver.

One state that will lose big under Trump’s order is Virginia, which has positioned itself to be a national leader in offshore wind deployment, supply chain and manufacturing. On top of that, Virginia badly needs the electricity from offshore wind to help meet the demand from data centers; it can’t afford to have a major new source of energy strangled in its infancy. Yet Attorney General Jason Miyares did not join the lawsuit.

Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

Sure, Miyares wants to be a good soldier in the Trump putsch. And no doubt he wouldn’t feel at home among all those Democratic AGs (there were no Republicans signing the complaint). But he could at least speak up in his state’s interest. Some well-timed advocacy would go a long way in showing the administration that wind energy is not a partisan matter.

It doesn’t have to be just our attorney general, either. The silence from Gov. Glen Youngkin has been equally deafening. What are they afraid of? Youngkin can’t run for reelection, and Miyares has already secured his party’s nomination in his bid for reelection this fall.

Youngkin vetoes clean energy bills supported by Dominion, environmental groups

Any politician who styles himself as pro-business ought to be pushing back on the Trump administration’s interference with contracts, destruction of American jobs and infliction of billions of dollars in damage to a growing domestic industry. Especially when it is happening to their own state, the big risk is in not speaking out.

And let’s face it, attacking wind energy is Trump’s own peculiar hobbyhorse, not his party’s. Though Republican support for wind energy has dropped a bit in recent years, it remains above 50%. Onshore wind is the largest source of electricity in Iowa and South Dakota and a major source in several other Republican strongholds. Wind power is responsible for billions of dollars in economic investment while keeping utility rates low in states that rely on it.

Offshore wind is more expensive, but states have embraced it for its potential to lower electricity bills over time while relieving grid congestion, creating well-paying jobs and providing clean, zero-carbon power to East Coast cities. Thirteen states have established offshore wind development goals, totaling over 112 gigawatts (GW) by 2050.

In Virginia, Republican leaders have been among the biggest boosters of offshore wind for more than 15 years. Legislators from both parties supported the creation of the Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority. With a boost from then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, the Virginia Department of Energy partnered with Dominion Energy on a research project that produced the nation’s first offshore wind turbines in federal waters. Republican support also paved the way for Dominion’s development of the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, now more than halfway to completion and expected to begin delivering electricity next year.

Nor is CVOW a one-off; the Virginia Clean Economy Act declares twice as much offshore wind power to be “in the public interest.” At the offshore wind International Partnering Forum held in Virginia Beach last month, Dominion displayed a poster of the projects it has in the works. These include a project off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, which Dominion acquired last October, as well as a huge lease area east of CVOW, which Dominion secured in a lease auction from the federal government last August. All told, Dominion’s projects could deliver a total of 9 GW of clean, renewable power.

As important as the energy itself is, Virginia leaders believe offshore wind can be a driver of economic development and job creation for the Hampton Roads area. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership touts Virginia’s strategic location, strong maritime industry and ready workforce as draws for businesses up and down the offshore wind supply chain.

Some businesses have already set up shop in Virginia to serve the industry. These include most recently a Korean subsea cable manufacturer that is investing almost $700 million for a facility in Chesapeake. Gov. Glen Youngkin was on hand for the groundbreaking last month, calling it “a proud moment for Virginia.” Attracting the company was only possible because of Virginia’s commitment to the wind industry – as well as the availability of federal tax credits that Trump also intends to eliminate.

CVOW will likely survive Trump’s attacks (albeit at a higher cost due to his tariffs), but Virginia’s ability to develop an offshore wind workforce and supply chain are very much at risk. The Trump administration’s war on wind power already threatens developers with losses in the billions of dollars. With permitting at a halt, companies are headed for the exits instead of creating the project pipeline necessary for offshore wind to become the powerhouse industry that it is in Europe and Asia.

Trump may have planned his economic sabotage to hurt northeastern states with Democratic governors, but the collateral damage to Virginia is considerable. As it is, our economy has taken a hit from Trump’s mass firings of federal workers, thousands of whom live here. We can’t afford to lose four years of offshore wind progress for no better reason than that Trump wills it.

“In Camden NJ, our commitment to brownfield redevelopment not only cleans up our environment but also revitalizes local neighborhoods, instilling pride among residents,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By transforming these spaces, we create economic opportunities and foster community resilience.”

The Camden Redevelopment Agency in New Jersey has been selected to receive $650,000 for its Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding is provided in addition to the $5,324,999 already awarded and recognizes the RLF program’s high performance despite significantly depleted funds.

Camden’s RLF program has successfully facilitated loans or subgrants for 11 cleanup projects that are either completed or in progress. Notable projects for the use of the new funding include Elijah Perry Park, the Knox Gelatin property, Judge Johnson Park, and the former West Jersey Paper Manufacturing site.

“This funding will allow the Camden Redevelopment Agency to continue its vital efforts to assess, safely clean up, and sustainably reuse land that has long suffered from the effects of harmful environmental contaminants,” said Senator Cory Booker. “I look forward to continuing to partner with the EPA and local organizations to ensure we continue to fund brownfield development that converts land from liabilities into productive local assets.”

“Because of these funds, kids will have cleaner parks and outdoor spaces to play, and those who live in Camden will be able to have a better quality of life overall,” said Senator Andy Kim. “These hazardous chemicals have been polluting Camden County for far too long, and I’ll be tracking the progress of these clean ups to be certain these communities see their completion.”

“I voted to pass the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create jobs, bolster public health outcomes, and improve the quality of life for residents in South Jersey,” said U.S. Representative Donald Norcross (NJ-01). “Brownfield Grants have been transformational across our region and especially in Camden City. Protecting our communities from harmful waste and repurposing these sites into valuable community assets for our neighborhoods has been a top priority for me. In Congress, I will continue to fight alongside local organizations to ensure the health and safety of South Jersey families.”

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in New Jersey have used previous EPA grants to assess, cleanup, and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results:

13.9 jobs per $100,000 of EPA Brownfield Grant funds spent

$20.45 for each $1 of EPA Brownfields funding expended on assessment, cleanup, and revolving loan fund grants.

Property values near cleaned-up sites increase by 5-15.2% with an estimated gain of $500,000 to $1.5 million in total property values

Increase of $29-97 million in local tax revenue in just the first year post-cleanup, per a study done in 2017.

“In a landmark decision reaffirming the principles and practices of sustainable development, the Hon’ble Supreme Court on May 16, 2025 struck down the Modi Government’s measures enabling the grant of ex-post facto environmental clearances.
The court said it ""must come down very heavily"" on the Centre's attempt to do ""something which is completely prohibited under the law"".
The Centre, as a result, was restrained from issuing directions for grant of ex post facto clearances in any form or manner or for regularising the acts done in contravention of the EIA notification.","Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday (May 19, 2025) hailed the Supreme Court decision striking down the measures enabling the grant of ex-post facto environmental clearances and said it was a ""damning indictment"" of the Modi government whose domestic walk is completely at variance with its global talk on environmental protection.

The Supreme Court last Friday (May 16, 2025) said the right to live in a pollution free atmosphere was a part of the fundamental right as it struck down the Centre’s office memorandum allowing ex post facto or retrospective environmental clearances to projects in violation of norms.

A Bench comprising Justices Abhay S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan made scathing remarks in its judgement delivered on a plea filed by Vanashakti organisation and said, “The Union Government, as much as individual citizens, has a constitutional obligation to protect the environment.”

Former Environment Minister Mr. Ramesh hailed the judgement which he claimed was a “damning indictment” of the Modi government.

“In a landmark decision reaffirming the principles and practices of sustainable development, the Hon’ble Supreme Court on May 16, 2025 struck down the Modi Government’s measures enabling the grant of ex-post facto environmental clearances. It declared such clearances illogical and illegal,” Mr. Ramesh said.

The Supreme Court held that the 2017 notification issued by the Modi government had the sole purpose of shielding violators who knowingly did not secure the mandatory requirement of prior environmental clearance under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, he said.

“It further ruled that the 2017 Notification and the 2021 Office Memorandum jointly violated binding precedents, encouraged polluters, and legitimised the degradation of air and water quality—blatantly infringing upon the fundamental right to a clean environment guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution,” Mr. Ramesh said.

“Pre-emptively disallowing for all measures granting ex-post facto environmental clearance in any manner, the Supreme Court noted ‘it is not possible to understand why the Central Government made efforts to protect those who committed illegality by not obtaining prior EC in terms of the EIA notification’,” he said.

Mr. Ramesh claimed that the judgment is a ""damning indictment"" of the Modi government whose domestic walk is ""completely at variance"" with its global talk as far as environmental protection is concerned.

The court said it ""must come down very heavily"" on the Centre's attempt to do ""something which is completely prohibited under the law"".

According to an announcement, bp's Archaea Energy and Rumpke Waste & Recycling have partnered to launch the facilities, which are located at the Pike Sanitation Landfill in Waverly and the Beech Hollow Landfill in Wellston.

The plants use Archaea's Modular Design technology to capture landfill gas, a natural byproduct of waste decomposition, and convert it into renewable natural gas. This process can lead to cleaner air, less odor and more sustainable energy compared to traditional fossil fuels, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The two landfills combined can process 6,200 cubic feet of landfill gas per minute into renewable natural gas, enough to heat around 25,238 homes annually, according to the EPA’s Landfill Gas Energy Benefits Calculator. The Pike Sanitation Landfill can process 2,000 cubic feet per minute, while the Beech Hollow Landfill can process 3,200 cubic feet per minute.

""Rumpke was among the first to implement green technology at landfills back in 1986,"" Jake Rumpke, area vice president of Rumpke, said in the announcement. ""Today we continue to look for innovative ways to increase sustainability. The Beech Hollow and Pike Sanitation Landfill projects add to our network of nine landfill gas-to-energy plants at our landfills. These recovery systems provide enough energy for more than 70,000 homes as well as fuel for a small portion of our truck fleet. We are excited to expand these sustainable practices to this part of the state. This plant will provide our Southern Ohio customers assurance that their waste is not only being properly managed – but beneficially reused.""

Archaea Energy is the largest renewable natural gas producer in the U.S. and aims to support customers' decarbonization goals and reduce the average lifecycle carbon intensity of the energy products it sells.

""The opening of these two plants marks a significant milestone not only for Archaea, but for the Buckeye state and its communities to drive change for lower carbon energy,"" said Craig Marcum, vice president of operations for Archaea Energy, in the announcement.

He has also vowed to ease the housing shortage across the nation. One promise may come at the expense of the other in the case of one agency's retrenchment.

In February, his administration sought to take back $20 billion awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency during Joe Biden's presidency to fund decarbonization projects around the country. The head of the EPA has justified the clawback attempt with unproven accusations that the grants were marred by ""programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse.""

As a result, tens of thousands of new apartments and houses that were expected to be financed with a portion of the EPA money are now in danger of not being built, nonprofit groups who were granted the funding say.

Climate United, a coalition that received roughly $7 billion of the money — known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — is suing the EPA along with other awardees over the withheld funding. The nonprofit estimates that about 30,000 single-family homes and another 30,000 apartment units were to be built with some of the funds that it and another group were set to administer.

""There's a significant part of the strategy focused on building not only new housing but new affordable and workforce housing,"" Beth Bafford, the CEO of Climate United, said.

There are varied estimates on how many new homes are needed in the US. Freddie Mac, a mortgage lending agency, calculated recently that the country is short about 3.7 million units.

While the tens of thousands of homes that might be built with money from the GGRF would be just a small contribution toward that huge need, the fund's proponents say the money would go to a particularly impactful segment of the market.

Bafford said that the focus of the GGRF money was on housing development projects in a part of the market with a lack of private sector financing options: affordable projects using energy-efficient systems and materials that are environmentally sustainable while helping mitigate utility costs for residents.

""We see massive gaps in the financial markets, and this program was built to address some of those gaps,"" Bafford said.

A spokesperson for Climate United said it had ""disbursed $25 million in loans and committed over $500 million in loans before the EPA terminated our grant agreement without warning.""

""Unlike the Biden-Haris administration, this EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars,"" an unnamed spokesperson from the EPA responded in an email.

The spokesperson said the GGRF's termination was ""based on substantial concerns"" over its ""integrity, the award process, and programmatic waste and abuse, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.""

Some developers are already feeling the impact

The impacts of the freeze have already been felt by some developers.

Megan Lasch, the chief executive of O-SDA Industries, a for-profit builder of affordable housing based in Austin, said the EPA's clawback attempt made her reshuffle a portion of the financing package she had been arranging for a 90-unit affordable apartment project her firm is developing in Fort Worth, Texas.

The roughly $37 million development involves renovating 801 West Shaw St., a historic building with 45 rental apartments, erecting an additional 45 units on land adjacent to the property, and building a pre-K facility.

Lasch said she had arranged to use some $3 million of GGRF money for the project from the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a member of Power Forward Communities, a coalition that received $2 billion of the EPA money.

When the GGRF money was held up, Lasch said that she found a replacement loan but that the new funding is more costly, carrying a roughly 4.5% interest rate versus the GGRF loan's roughly 1% rate.

""The patch was not pretty,"" Lasch said, adding that affordable housing projects often have thin margins and require deeply discounted financing to work. ""There's going to be ultimately a lot of projects that will just go by the wayside because they're not able to come up with a patch.""

The 801 West Shaw St. building is set to offer rents that are affordable for residents who earn between 30% and 60% of the area's median income, Lasch said.

Damon Burns, the CEO of Finance New Orleans, a public trust that helps fund and develop affordable housing in its namesake city, said that his organization had been allocated $5 million from the Coalition for Green Capital, which received $5 billion of GGRF money from the EPA.

Finance New Orleans was seeking to use about $1 million of that $5 million it was to receive in combination with $1.5 million of other funds it holds to build six or seven new homes with net-zero emissions.

Using GGRF money to augment his organization's funding pipeline to build more housing was a model that Burns said he had hoped to scale.

He said the prospect of having the GGRF money withdrawn was daunting because New Orleans is ""already a financially constrained city.""

""There is a huge concern that the disinvestment of the federal government will have an impact on all of our communities,"" Burns said. ""It means less mortgages for homeowners. It means less capital for developers.""

A climate-focused financing initiative

The GGRF was created with $27 billion of federal funds from the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which Congress passed in 2022. Some $20 billion of that amount was awarded to Climate United, Power Forward Communities, the Coalition for Green Capital, and other groups for various climate-focused financing initiatives. The remaining $7 billion went toward a federal program to fund residential solar energy installation projects.

In December, Project Veritas, a conservative media organization, published a video that showed a former EPA official suggesting that the agency, under Biden, had fast-tracked its award of the money in anticipation that the incoming Trump administration might seek to scuttle the program.

In the video, the official said: ""It truly feels like we're on the Titanic and we're throwing gold bars off the edge.""

Lee Zeldin, a former Long Island, New York, congressman whom Trump appointed as the head of the EPA in January, cited the video as evidence of misconduct in the allocation of the funds.

""One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars,"" Zeldin said in a video posted on his X account in February. ""The 'gold bars' were your tax dollars, and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden administration knew they were wasting it.""

Zeldin has ordered the termination of the GGRF.

In March, Climate United sued the EPA and Citibank, the financial intermediary for the $20 billion, in the federal district court in Washington, DC, over their refusal to release the money. Power Forward and the Coalition for Green Capital have joined the suit.

The EPA lost the initial argument for the case but has brought its complaint to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where it won a preliminary order in April to freeze the money as its appeal is being considered. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday.

'Every single project in the country is looking for gap funding'

While Climate United estimated that terminating the GGRF would put roughly 60,000 homes at risk, other parties involved in the financing program say that number could be even greater.

There has been a sharp increase in the number of housing developers interested in tapping financing from the GGRF, said Shaun Donovan, the president and CEO of the nonprofit housing lender Enterprise Community Partners. He was a secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Obama administration.

Donovan attributed that interest to growing construction costs from inflation and tariffs, which have driven up the price of building materials. Those overruns have punched holes in the budgets of a host of development projects that builders have scrambled to fill.

""Every single project in the country is looking for gap funding,"" Donovan said. ""What this GGRF money can do is to be that last dollar in, right? So even if it's only 5% or 10% of the project.""

A spokesperson for Enterprise said that it had received inquiries for about $1.2 billion of financing in recent months for a collection of projects totaling 18,426 units.

""My concern is that what this and other efforts to cut housing programs will do is make it impossible for the president to meet his goal of reducing housing costs,"" Donovan said.",https://i.insider.com/6827932968a2929008019797?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 06:00:33.377554

For those affected, the disruption brought not only inconvenience but real hardship, with the whole of civil society still grappling with the aftermath.

This isn’t a uniquely Iberian issue. In 2019, a lightning strike on the Hornsea One offshore wind farm in the UK triggered a cascading failure that left more than a million people without power and brought rail networks to a standstill.

Across geographies, energy infrastructure built for a different era remains all too vulnerable to disruption. Designed for the demands of the 20th century, our energy systems are no longer fit for the realities of the 21st. They remain too static and too slow to respond to sudden changes. The energy industry needs a fundamental shift, a move toward a resilient, digitalized and flexible energy system capable of adapting in real time.

To meet these challenges, we must invest in energy systems that are inherently resilient. Advances in artificial intelligence now make it possible to create self-healing grids: networks that can isolate faults, dynamically adjust, and continue to deliver power without interruption.

Moving away from a handful of large, fossil-fueled power plants – systems that could once be managed by a centralized command center and a few spreadsheets – towards a highly decentralized network of millions of renewable generation points and large-scale battery storage marks a fundamental shift. We also see the rise of consumer technologies like EVs that can store days of energy, and heat pumps that can vary their energy use without inconveniencing home owners. This transformation doesn’t just demand smarter coordination; it gives us the opportunity to build an energy system that is flexible, intelligent and capable of healing itself in real time. These distributed assets, when connected and coordinated intelligently with AI, can provide critical services to managing the grid, like energy balancing, voltage support, synthetic inertia, frequency regulation and congestion relief in milliseconds, delivering flexibility where it’s needed most.

Consumer-led technologies are accelerating this shift. In 2023, consumers spent twice as much on low-carbon technologies – EVs, home solar, batteries and heat pumps – as governments did. This marks a new era in which consumers are active participants in energy resilience. Each electric vehicle, for instance, is not just transport – it’s a potential battery for the grid, able to power a home for four or five days.

By 2030, an estimated 20.9 million EVs will be on American roads by 2030 (at minimum). Coordinated effectively, these vehicles will be able to offer another layer of defence against outages. Combined with large-scale batteries and smart grid infrastructure, we have the tools to design an energy system that can adapt, absorb shocks and recover – quickly and automatically.

Recent interconnector failures have shown the power of self-healing energy systems in action. In October 2024 and March 2025, trips on the North Sea Link (NSL) with Norway and Interconnexion France-Angleterre 2 (IFA2) with France cut up to 1.4GW of imports to Britain, causing sharp drops in generation leading to imbalance of supply and demand, like the one in Iberia (see graphs below). But this time, fast-acting frequency services from battery sites run on modern software helped stabilize the grid immediately before it led to blackouts. These assets absorbed the shock in real time, while consumer devices were able to shift demand and avoid outages while the system recovered.

NSL (UK- Norway Interconnector) trip reduced exports to the UK from 1.4GW to 0.

IFA2 (UK- France Interconnector) tripped, reducing imports to the UK by ~1GW.

A reliable energy system is the foundation of a functioning society. It powers hospitals, transports people and goods and keeps communications running. The consequences of even brief outages are real – and growing. But we are not powerless in the face of these risks. We have the technology, the infrastructure and the momentum to build something stronger.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/st7Y6A7Q_FOx64fYhAg6fIi0mYKPhE9TVixmozW6-ms/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9wZXhlbHMtZWNsaXBzZS1jaGFzZXJzLTcxNjcxOTk4NC0zMTI3NzAzOF9wcm9jZXNzZWQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:03.167550

Energy security remains a cornerstone of the U.S.-India partnership, being vital for economic growth and national security. A U.S.-India Energy and Industrial Partnership should involve deploying energy technologies at scale, reducing concentrations in energy supply chains and manufacturing, and strengthening both the domestic industrial base and industrial corridor between the two countries. This will require a four-pronged approach involving: research partnerships to leapfrog to new battery chemistries and small modular reactors, among other emerging technologies; trade missions and technology transfers in strategic sectors, including automotive and battery technologies; public-private partnerships in areas such as lithium-ion battery and ancillary component manufacturing; and a bilateral track involving governments and financial institutions for funding strategic sectors.

The United States and India can expect an eight-to-tenfold increase in demand for batteries and critical minerals (such as nickel, copper, lithium, and graphite) by 2035. Addressing this demand will require joint resource mapping, capital deployment, and manufacturing and technology partnerships. Particular efforts must also be made on automotive and transportation technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells, advanced driving assistance, and drones. Furthermore, India’s expansion of natural gas, green hydrogen, and nuclear power in its energy mix present opportunities for collaboration, with advantages for the United States in cost-competitive electrolyzers and nuclear energy components. All of these steps will present opportunities for collaboration and investments involving the private sector and the two countries’ start-up ecosystems.

Introduction

India and the United States have strengthened their bilateral cooperation in the past two decades, built on the foundation of shared values and interests of security, economic prosperity, trade, and investment. The two countries reaffirmed their commitment to bilateral cooperation, launching the U.S.–India COMPACT for the 21st Century, emphasizing energy security, critical emerging technologies, and trade enhancements, in a joint statement during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington in February 2025. Recent initiatives have included cooperation on power and energy efficiency, responsible oil and gas, including hydrogen and biofuels, batteries, the inclusion of India in the Mineral Security Partnership (MSP), INDUS-Innovation, the initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), and more recently the U.S.–India TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) which cut across strategic sectors including defense and aerospace. 2025–26 will remain a crucial period to maintain and expand on the bilateral efforts, building on the shared goals of industrial policy and energy security.

The United States and India have recently expressed intent to increase bilateral trade volumes to $500 billion by 2030, requiring double-digit growth in the next five years. Following this announcement, both countries have taken steps to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement. Bilateral trade was estimated to be around $129.2 billion in 2024, registering a robust 9.5 percent compounded annual growth rate since 2016. Since 2016, India has seen increasing energy trade with the United States, primarily imports, peaking at $14.7 billion in 2022, forming 28 percent of total Indian imports from the United States.

total trade and energy trade between 2016 and 2023, indexed by 2019 trade volumes.5

Energy security has been considered a cornerstone for economic growth and crucial for national security. Interestingly, both countries have seen 35–40 percent reduction in energy intensity economy-wide between 2000–2022 and had a similar share of renewables in power generation of about 22 percent (as of 2022). In terms of final energy consumption, about 54.4 percent comes from coal, oil, and natural gas in India, whereas the same constitutes about 72.2 percent in the United States. India remains a net energy importer (approximately 36 percent of its total energy supply) compared to the United States who is a net energy exporter (approximately 8 percent of its total energy production).

Observer Research Foundation America (ORF America) hosted a series of closed-door, invitation-only workshops with Indian and American energy and climate experts to better understand actionable opportunities for the United States to cooperate with India. Following the 2024 Indian and U.S. elections, ORF America closely tracked policy developments and changes in the strategic priorities of the newly elected governments. This special report builds on the outcomes from the workshops, recent policy announcements, and recommends a proposal for a U.S.-India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership. This partnership could leverage respective strengths and the bilateral relationship to meet the following objectives: 1) develop and deploy energy technologies at scale at home and abroad; 2) reduce concentration in energy supply chains and manufacturing of new energy technologies of the future; and 3) continue to strengthen both the domestic industrial base and the industrial corridor between the two countries.

Reducing Concentration and Increasing Commercialization in Technology and Energy Supply Chains

With the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States already has about 72 gigawatt hours (GWh) of lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity as of 2024, and over 36,000 tons (as of 2023) of battery recycling capacity domestically attracting some of the world’s largest investments. India is currently building capacity for over 60 GWh of battery manufacturing that is expected to be operational in phases from 2027 onwards. By 2035, estimates suggest that demand for batteries would be around 1000–1200 GWh and 160–380 GWh in the United States and India, respectively. The rapid growth in energy technologies has put the spotlight on battery supply chains including the availability of critical raw materials.

Global demand for critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, copper, graphite, and rare earths is expected to double by 2035 from 2024 levels in a business-as-usual scenario, with demand increasing by a factor of 3 to 5 times, in an accelerated global energy transition pathway. In this context, lithium demand for India and the United States battery market is expected to increase 8 times by 2035, from 2024 levels. Minerals such as nickel, copper, and graphite also have over half of their demand coming from base industrial sectors including infrastructure and steel, forming a strong foundational base to economic growth. Both the United States and India are net importers of critical minerals. The global landscape on critical minerals, while rooted in the context of energy transition technologies and manufacturing, has expanded to include other strategic sectors such as defense, aerospace, and high-value electronics, including semiconductors, further highlighting the importance of critical minerals as dual-use inputs.

A two-pronged strategy will be needed to secure the necessary raw materials from global markets for short- and medium-term demand in the next 5–10 years, while they continue to develop potential domestic resources that can cater to long-term supply, even under accelerated permitting timelines. During the deliberations, experts framed the emergence and vitality of critical minerals as integral to a new industrial revolution. In this context, it is crucial to highlight four areas: resource mapping, processing and refining, technology development, and recycling. Both the United States and India have critical mineral strategies, with India announcing its National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM) in February 2025, with many overlapping objectives, including accelerating domestic mineral exploration projects and recycling.

Participants from the U.S. government emphasized that India is among the only credible partners that can help break China’s dominance in clean energy manufacturing and strategic industries, including batteries, electrolyzers, and solar cells, as well as intermediary inputs such as refined or processed materials. Participants from both countries agreed that prioritizing diversification from China should be a key bilateral effort, in addition to strengthening bilateral cooperation. Participants at the New Delhi workshop, while echoing similar sentiments, emphasized that the bilateral partnership should also identify next-generation technologies that create a comparative advantage, an objective that aligns with the earlier bilateral iCET program and the newly announced U.S.–India TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) initiative. The newly announced research partnership between the Anusandhan National Research Foundation in India and the United States National Science Foundation can play a strategic role in advancing joint research and development (R&D) projects.

In terms of specific minerals for further bilateral attention, the Washington workshop highlighted that both the United States and India had import dependency across the mineral value chain. One such example is graphite, which was highlighted as a viable option to expand U.S.–India critical minerals trade. One expert pointed out that as of 2023, the United States sourced 48 percent of its graphite imports from China at a higher cost than India’s graphite export price. Materials such as graphite are used across sectors ranging from steel to consumer goods to batteries, and thus, even if India-sourced graphite can supply to non-clean technology sectors (given its ore quality) in the United States, it can relieve part of the commodity price pressure. A strategy of identifying mineral dependencies and an economy-wide approach of sourcing diversification can be beneficial for both countries. Experts at the United States workshop also highlighted that of the twelve strategic defense minerals for the United States, ten of them overlap with India’s priorities as well, while overall, nineteen minerals overlap across the critical mineral lists of the two countries.

While the development of upstream mineral extraction projects can have a longer gestation period, developing critical minerals refining capabilities can be achieved relatively faster in both countries. The Washington workshop participants expressed that the bilateral partnership could also evaluate the possibility of developing joint refining bases in Southeast Asia and Africa, beyond their own respective domestic capacities. However, India-sourced or Indian-company extracted and processed minerals are not currently Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) compliant, which calls for a bilateral critical minerals agreement that could make India an operationally compliant strategic partner.

In both the New Delhi and Washington workshops, participants discussed industrial policy efforts in the two countries, highlighting the focus on onshoring manufacturing through various policy measures requiring higher domestic content requirements. However, both countries will have to rely on international cooperation to ensure that they remain competitive and have market access while participating in global supply chains. Despite certain trade and economic tensions, the United States and India have comparative advantages that present an opportunity to create a critical minerals industrial corridor, mainly due to viable costs of capital and labor in India, and advanced scientific capabilities in both countries. Further, efforts such as the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative by the U.S. EXIM Bank, providing targeted financing to develop critical mineral projects from trusted partners, could be leveraged by India.

In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Strategic and Critical Materials Board, which will comprise members from other departments, including Energy, State, Commerce, and Interior, to ensure secure and resilient access to materials and minerals and to identify innovative solutions for complex industrial base challenges. For a successful partnership, India would also need to consider its institutional framework on critical minerals to ensure effective engagement and implementation.

While both countries focus on the development of domestic industrial bases that can cut across the value chain to improve their competitiveness, five key areas of bilateral cooperation emerge on critical minerals and supply chains:

Advancing resource mapping through collaboration between the United States Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of India

Joint deployment of capital in mineral assets and refining facilities in domestic and international markets

Technology partnerships for battery manufacturing and recycling, building on the Strategic Mineral Recovery Initiative

International cooperation through multilateral platforms, including the MSP and Quad, to ensure supply chain diversification

Joint track and trace approaches to identify areas of vulnerabilities, investment opportunities, and technology development.

Expanding Ties In the Automotive Industry and Technology Development

The United States and India are major automotive hubs and the world’s second and third largest markets, respectively. Technology advancements will be key to maintaining the global competitiveness of the automotive sector in both countries. This makes the automotive sector between the two countries an important potential sector of cooperation, and should be part of the ongoing trade discussions.

In the past, major U.S. automakers such as Ford, General Motors, and Navistar have had strategic investments in the India market, while Indian companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and Tata Sons have been making inroads in the United States, with the former having its North America Technical Center headquartered in Michigan.

Beyond vehicle manufacturing, automotive components trade has been robust between the two countries. While 27 percent of India’s total automotive component exports are to the United States (as of 2024), India remains the 9th largest trading partner in this sector with the United States. While around half of the component imports to the United States come from Mexico and Canada, India remains a key player in the Mexican automotive industry, with 6 percent of component exports from India, as well as most major Indian component manufacturers having factories in Mexico, thereby indirectly catering to the U.S. automotive market.

Further, both markets are expected to continue witnessing electric vehicle (EV) sales, strengthening opportunities for technology cooperation and investments in EVs, EV components, and electronics. The United States has built a strong capability around high-voltage EV powertrains since 2021, while India has shown its capabilities in innovation and cost optimization. Infrastructure development for EV charging also remains a key area for cooperation, with the United States already implementing advanced policies.

Recent bilateral cooperation in road transportation has been largely around electric mobility, through technical assistance driving EV adoption, deployment of electric transit buses, and assessing the investment landscape to facilitate capital flow in the e-mobility sector. For the next phase of e-mobility deployment, United States workshop participants looked to the trucking sector, where various global logistics players are transitioning their truck fleets in both countries, with automotive original equipment manufacturers making significant investments in electric, fuel cell, and hydrogen-internal combustion engine (ICE) technologies.

As sub-national governments in the United States continue to deploy electric and low-emission buses for transit and school buses, there is limited manufacturing capacity domestically, which provides an opportunity for Indian e-bus manufacturers to consider investments in the United States. The efforts of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC), the state’s government investment promotion unit, to bring more Indian businesses to the state, including the automotive sector, is a good example.

United States workshop stakeholders agreed that ambitious industrial policies can and should be aligned to aid this pillar of cooperation around the automotive industry and technology development, including e-mobility, alternative fuels, hydrogen, and other new emerging technologies, to ensure that the respective sectors in both countries continue to remain globally competitive. This takes further significance, especially in the face of aggressive, cost-competitive Chinese automotive products, namely electric vehicle exports to global markets.

Based on the deliberations, key areas of cooperation include:

Expanding automotive manufacturing in both countries, including joint ventures, foreign direct investment (FDI) by the U.S. and Indian companies.

Technology access and development for advanced automotive technologies, including electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and hydrogen ICE powertrains for trucks, advanced driving assistance (ADAS) technologies, among others.

Expanding transportation cooperation to include aviation and shipping sectors, including sustainable aviation and marine fuels, drones, VTOL aircraft, etc.

Advancing Development in Emerging Fuels, Including Hydrogen and Nuclear Cooperation

As both countries consider energy security goals, certain shared priorities emerge: (i) ensuring affordable and reliable energy for end use sectors; (ii) advancing grid reliability and resiliency; and, (iii) increasing share of nuclear power in the mix. In India’s case, three key strategies in its energy security pathway include:

Expanding natural gas to 15 percent share of the energy mix from the current 6 percent

Domestic production of 5 million metric tons (MMT) of green hydrogen by 2030

100 gigawatts (GW) of installed nuclear power capacity by 2047 with focus on small modular reactors.

Natural gas will play a key role in India’s energy security pathway in the near future. As India looks to increase its share of natural gas, it will continue to rely on imports, which complements the U.S. policy on expanding liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. India’s natural gas demand saw a 10 percent annual increase in 2024, driven by rapid expansion of infrastructure, especially for residential and transportation sectors. Since 2019, the number of compressed natural gas (CNG) stations for transport have quadrupled, while the number of residential gas connections have more than doubled, with a push towards clean urban transportation and access to clean cooking fuels. By 2030, the number of CNG stations and residential connections will almost double including a 50 percent expansion in the gas transmission grid.

India’s energy imports from the United States have consistently increased since 2016, primarily driven by LNG, reaching a peak in 2022. India and the United States have reaffirmed their commitment towards increasing energy trade including natural gas and investments in infrastructure involving private sector in both countries. With India’s increasing push for gas infrastructure and demand potential, the United States could emerge as a strategic energy supplier for India, with long term security of both the resource as well as in terms of prices.

Natural gas takes further significance for India as it looks to scale hydrogen production. Beyond India’s 5 MMT target of green hydrogen production by 2030, it also aims to become an exporter of green hydrogen. Hydrogen demand is steadily increasing in various sectors including industries, ports, steel manufacturing, and transportation, especially the marine and aviation sectors. However, hydrogen is still a nascent industry and has challenges including high costs to the end user and a lack of sufficient infrastructure.

Experts agreed that efficient production, distribution networks, and global markets must be leveraged to incorporate hydrogen technologies at scale. Experts agreed that leveraging low-cost clean energy in both the United States and India can help reduce the delivered cost of electricity in the production cycle. Moving hydrogen production closer to consumption areas is another solution to reduce costs, and a clear short-term strategy. Hydrogen for transportation remains uncertain due to lower costs of battery electric and conventional ICE vehicles, and existing unreliability in hydrogen infrastructure.

The United States currently has an annual hydrogen production capacity of about 10 MMT, most of it currently being grey hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas, using steam methane reforming. This emits around 3–5 kg CO₂e per kilogram (kg) of hydrogen produced, compared to the green hydrogen threshold of less than 1 kg CO₂e. In the case of India, the definition of green hydrogen is set at no more 2 kg of CO₂e per kilogram of hydrogen produced. These thresholds are important as they bring forth a clear understanding of the potential for hydrogen cooperation between the two countries. As India looks to scale up hydrogen deployment, a cost-effective pathway will include a mix of grey and green hydrogen in the near to medium term. With India’s relatively less stringent green hydrogen thresholds, the role of natural gas-based hydrogen production would be significant, increasing demand for natural gas. This offers a unique convergence of cooperation on both natural gas and hydrogen, between the two countries.

Prior to 2025, the two countries have been collaborating under the Renewable Energy Technology Action Platform (RETAP), to achieve their respective goals of reducing the cost of green hydrogen. Going forward, rather than integrating hydrogen across sectors, experts emphasized that its implementation should focus on select industries such as steel, ammonia, and fertilizers. For instance, Indian steel manufacturers are actively exploring green steel production to stay competitive and carbon-compliant in global markets, especially with the announcement of the green steel taxonomy by India’s Ministry of Steel. Electrolyzer costs are significantly cheaper in India than in the United States, and one expert argued that the existing United States and India partnership should be explored to expand its manufacturing in both countries. Long-term electricity grid storage is another viable use case for hydrogen, although its demand will not arise for another decade. Hydrogen is an important piece in the global fuels narrative, with significant investments from the oil and gas industry, but it is imperative to continue focus on its research and development before scaled implementation across sectors.

Nuclear power has been relatively stagnant in India at about 1.2 percent of its total energy supply, compared to 9.8 percent in the United States. India announced an ambitious Nuclear Energy Mission in February 2025, with the goal of achieving 100 GW of installed nuclear power capacity by 2047, with a focus on research and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The United States has always focused on nuclear energy as a key part of its energy security strategy, launching the Advanced SMR R&D Program in 2019. After a long gap, this opens a strategic opportunity for U.S.–India cooperation on nuclear energy, including private sector investment and technology licensing from American companies to India, which has also been emphasized in the U.S–India joint statement in February 2025. Building on the previous U.S.–India iCET program and the new TRUST initiative, a specific avenue of civil nuclear cooperation will be critical. This will enable the two countries to realize the full potential of the 2005 Civil Nuclear Agreement, including specific measures such as amendments to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act 2010 by India and the removal of restrictions on Indian nuclear entities and technology exports by the United States. The regulatory clearance approved by the U.S. Department of Energy to Holtec International, a U.S. firm, to transfer SMR technology to India in March 2025 is a significant step in that direction.

Based on the deliberations, key findings include:

Scaling hydrogen deployment through a combination of grey and green hydrogen to manage costs including prioritizing end-use sectors such as steel, ammonia, and fertilizer.

Leveraging cost competitive electrolyzer manufacturing in India to expand manufacturing in both countries.

Advancing a renewed strategic opportunity for U.S.–India cooperation on nuclear energy, including private sector investment and technology licensing from American companies to India.

With India’s increasing push for gas infrastructure and demand potential, the United States could emerge as a strategic energy supplier for India, with long term security of both the resource as well as in terms of prices.

Delivering Finance by Spurring Private Sector Investment

Emerging markets have the greatest economic growth potential and, with stable economic principles, offer an attractive home for capital investment. India remains among the most attractive markets for investment potential, with a robust gross domestic product growth of 5–7 percent annually, attracting over $1 trillion cumulatively in FDI since 2000. India ranks 39th in the Global Innovation Index 2024, rising from 80th in 2015 and 40th in the World Competitive Index 2024. These factors, coupled with India’s growing skilled workforce, large consumer market, and strong macroeconomic principles make it a strong investment destination.

In the period from 2000–2024, FDI from the United States to India totaled about $69 billion, being a leading market for American firms in areas such as e-commerce, aviation, railways, telecommunications, food processing, and heavy equipment.

India’s commitment to clean energy transitions brings with it a market potential of $1.1 trillion. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India’s financing requirements to meet its energy transition goals of 2030 and 2070 is a staggering $160 billion per year. Recent initiatives announced during state visits, the G20, Quad (India, United States, Japan, Australia) summits, Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), and at other forums, have been positive indicators of finance and investments continuing to remain a high priority for bilateral and multilateral cooperation.

United States workshop participants noted several avenues being pursued by the U.S. government to deploy capital towards India’s energy transition, particularly through the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC). India is currently the largest market for DFC at 10 percent with $4.3 billion exposure, with the aim of capitalizing on clean energy transition, transportation, and job creation. Of this, $1.6 billion is dedicated to clean energy projects.

In particular, the DFC’s financial instruments include guarantees and support mechanisms to attract private sector investment in sectors that are usually not bankable, i.e., real or perceived risk is too high for the private sector to invest. A combination of policy and financing mechanisms has resulted in significant success stories for electric buses and solar photovoltaic manufacturing. These success stories offer important lessons that can and should be applied to other sectors and technologies such as batteries, alternative fuels, efficient cooling, and supply chains. For example, managing cooling demand in India through efficient technologies and software is one way to manage surging power demand in the country.

While Washington workshop participants discussed efforts through DFC as a bright spot, New Delhi participants offered a more measured assessment of current bilateral and multilateral efforts. Indian participants agreed that India’s finance needs for its energy transition are in orders of magnitude larger than other developing countries. No one country, government, or institution will be the source of all this financing, so efforts from development finance institutions like the DFC and multilateral development banks like the World Bank by themselves will not be sufficient but can play a key role in derisking the inflow of private capital. Consequently, external private sector funding and foreign direct investment must be mobilized in the strategic sectors, especially as domestic capital inflows in India are not sustainable.

Bilateral or multilateral finance efforts must account for India’s size and complexity, including Indian federalism and sub-national engagement. For example, Indian participants suggested both governments explore partnerships to secure social protection funding for coal-dependent regions, especially as renewable energy in India gets cheaper, it will phase out non-renewable sources of energy such as coal plants. Moreover, another area to grow cooperation is engagement with state-owned enterprises in India, which span sectors beyond privately developed renewables and drive much of the energy transition in the country, including minerals, natural gas, hydrocarbons, nuclear, among others. In terms of target sectors for investment, New Delhi workshop participants also noted that Indian solar and e-mobility sectors are relatively mature. They stressed that new investments from international public funds should be redirected into sectors like grid scale energy storage, offshore wind, and green hydrogen that need more public sector support to encourage private investment.

In the context of clean energy manufacturing, investment, and innovation, the Washington workshop participants agreed that the United States must evaluate developments in the Indian private sector in tandem with governmental efforts. Along with the rise of global Indian companies, its start-up ecosystem is making strides in industries including critical minerals processing, battery manufacturing, hydrogen production, and e-mobility. On the other hand, India has used its Production-Linked Incentives (PLI) schemes to drive strategic private investment in sectors like battery manufacturing, electronics and components, and solar, among others, attracting close to $19 billion worth of investments between 2021–2024. Stakeholders agreed that it has had a significant impact in kickstarting the transition to create an enabling environment to increase private sector investment.

Both countries must therefore create channels for the private sector to address their impediments and concerns. The International Trade Administration (ITA) has been taking steps to address such concerns and deepen the U.S.–India commercial partnership. A key ITA focus area is clean energy supply chains, particularly solar energy. Improving the traceability of India–U.S. solar supply chains is imperative to reduce dependence on Chinese solar exports. Collective action through multilateral efforts, including Australia and Brazil, are necessary to address high-risk upstream issues in the solar value chain. Similar opportunities exist in critical minerals and battery supply chains. With the new TRUST initiative, strategic sectors such as defense and aerospace also offer significant market opportunities for private sector investment and have the potential to accelerate the development and deployment of critical future technologies.

Key findings of the workshops include:

Expanding financing opportunities beyond global Indian industries to include the start-up ecosystem which is making strides in critical and emerging energy technologies.

Exploring a U.S.–India investment vehicle expanding the Production-Linked Incentives (PLI’s) scheme to create a finance multiplier effect for critical and emerging energy technologies.

Improve the traceability of India–U.S. supply chains to reduce dependency and vulnerabilities.

The Path Forward: A U.S.–India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership

Drawing on the workshop outcomes, it is clear that the United States and India are best positioned to leverage their respective strengths and their bilateral relationship to: 1) develop and deploy energy technologies at scale at home and abroad; 2) reduce concentration in energy supply chains and manufacturing of new energy technologies of the future; and 3) continue to strengthen the both the domestic industrial base and the industrial corridor between the two countries.

To mutually strengthen strategic objectives, increase private sector investments, and capture economic opportunities, the United States and India should launch a U.S.–India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership that builds upon 20+ years of successful bilateral cooperation. This initiative should prioritize three key areas: (i) accelerate commercialization of strategic technologies and battery supply chains; (ii) expand automotive technology cooperation and investment; (iii) advance development of emerging fuels including hydrogen and nuclear.

For a long-term and successful partnership, industrial policy, technology development, and global competitiveness remain at the center, and achieving these concurrent objectives will require a four-pronged approach:

Research, Development, and Innovation: the partnership should reorient current research partnerships to focus on next generation emerging and critical technologies including leapfrogging to new battery chemistries, future automotive technologies, hydrogen and nuclear SMR. Mirroring the recent U.S.–India Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), the launch of INDUS Innovation aims to advance industry–academia partnerships and foster investments for new and emerging sectors including space and energy.

Trade and Investment: U.S.–India two-way goods trade in the automotive sector totaled $3.8 billion and $600 million in the battery supply chain as of 2023. Bilateral trade and investment have the potential to reorient battery supply chains away from China and potentially meet U.S. domestic battery production deficits, as well as open opportunities for technology transfer from the United States to India. Specific efforts could include trade missions, feasibility assessments, and export guarantees to advance cooperation in the specific sectors identified. Further, specific provisions within the trade framework to enable technology transfer in strategic sectors as well as flow of specific critical minerals and advanced batteries, export and import of nuclear technologies, hydrogen fuel and electrolyzers, could go a long way in building a global diversified supply chain for both countries.

Public-Private Partnerships: Under the bilateral partnership, launching a specific U.S.–India batteries task force bringing together major American and Indian industry players along with both governments, trade groups and civil society, could serve to catalyze strategic partnerships and investments needed to realize the other three pillars. India could provide an alternative regional hub for lithium-ion battery and ancillary component manufacturing in the Indo-Pacific. Additionally, specific tracks on automotive industry cooperation, and alternative fuels (including hydrogen and nuclear) would strengthen bilateral cooperation, opening new market opportunities. In the context of such partnerships, leveraging existing institutional mechanisms between the two countries can help accelerate the timelines, leading to tangible outcomes in the near term.

Finance: Beyond leveraging financial instruments from U.S. DFC, U.S. Export-Import Bank and U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) to crowd in private sector investment, the two countries can also setup a Finance for Strategic Sectors track, that brings together financial institutions and private investors in both countries periodically to clearly identify a pipeline of projects for potential investment prioritizing the sectors identified.

A U.S.–India Strategic Energy and Industrial Partnership has the potential to transform bilateral cooperation and grow private sector cooperation. Consequently, there is a need to break down past and existing U.S.–India partnerships and identify long-term goals and potential domestic measures that could hinder initiatives at an operational level. Partnerships need to account for these risks and vulnerabilities from both countries, and guard against them in the long-term scenario. Trust building is essential, and both countries need to take steps to ensure policy continuity and build towards a multi-dimensional long-term partnership that transcends short-term geopolitical tensions. Lastly, while domestic objectives around energy transitions may change, both countries will benefit from prioritizing industrial policy outcomes and global competitiveness, especially as global markets continue to focus on clean energy technologies and supply chains.

People who have been struggling to clean up decades of industrial pollution in the lower Cape Fear River basin are expressing their dismay and anger at a federal delay announced Wednesday on a crackdown on so-called forever chemicals that have fouled their drinking water.

That day, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to extend the timeline for water utilities to reduce the maximum safe levels for human consumption for a select group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as PFAS.

In 2024, under the Biden Administration, the EPA finalized the first-ever enforceable standards for six PFAS compounds: PFOA, PFOS, HFPO-DA (GenX), PFBS, PFNA and PFHxS. At that time, water utilities had until 2029 to comply with the new standards.

A year later, the Trump Administration’s newly appointed EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would uphold standards set for PFOA and PFOS — legacy PFAS that persist in the environment despite no longer being manufactured. But Zeldin also announced he would rescind and re-evaluate rules for the other four, including GenX.

GenX is the common name for the substance produced at the Chemours Fayetteville Works plant; it was discharged into the river’s water for decades until researchers revealed their presence in 2017.

Additionally, the new federal timeline gives utilities until 2031 to comply with the standards, extending the original 2029 deadline.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” Zeldin said in a news release. “At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.”

While Zeldin’s statement appeared aimed at reassuring the public that the EPA is taking control of the situation, to critics, it sounded like a betrayal — signaling, in their view, a retreat from more robust protections from substances that have become known as “forever chemicals” because of their persistence in the environment.

‘Not forward-thinking’

“Overall, PFOA and PFOS are chemicals of the past, though they are still present in drinking water sources. So removing them will get a lot of others,” said N.C. State University epidemiologist Jane Hoppin in an email. “But the other four are chemicals of the future, particularly GenX, so removing these rules would not be forward-looking.”

In 2017, Hoppin headed a team of researchers and launched the GenX Exposure Study, which revealed that most of the people from the Cape Fear River Basin who participated in the research have PFAS in their blood.

There are thousands of unique PFAS in the environment, according to experts. They’re present in multiple products to help make them slippery and resistant to oils, water and solvents, including some cosmetics and apparel, microwave popcorn wrappers, dental floss, firefighting gear and some firefighting foams.

PFAS exposure is associated with a range of adverse health effects, such as increased cholesterol levels, kidney and testicular cancer, pre-eclampsia in pregnant women and decreased vaccine response in children, among other conditions.

“The EPA is caving to chemical industry lobbyists and pressure by the water utilities, and in doing so, it’s sentencing millions of Americans to drink contaminated water for years to come,” said Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook in a statement.

Cook’s organization has worked throughout the country to document environmental problems.

“The cost of PFAS pollution will fall on ordinary people, who will pay in the form of polluted water and more sickness, more suffering and more deaths from PFAS-related diseases,” he said.

Kelly Moser, senior attorney and leader of the Water Program at the Southern Environmental Law Center, echoed this sentiment. “When this administration talks about deregulation, this is what they mean — allowing toxic chemicals in drinking water at the request of polluters,” she said in a release.

Living with PFAS

It has been a tumultuous eight years for thousands of North Carolinians living in the Cape Fear River Basin since the presence of the forever chemicals was first announced in 2017. Among those affected are residents whose drinking water wells are contaminated, likely because of PFAS that were incinerated at the Fayetteville Works plant and drifted far and wide in emissions from the factory.

Despite a 2019 consent order — established among Chemours, Cape Fear River Watch and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality — aimed at assisting residents with PFAS-contaminated wells, living with PFAS is a daunting challenge.

Jamie White, administrator of the Facebook group “Grays Creek Residents United Against PFAS in our Wells and Rivers,” which works to raise awareness about PFAS contamination, expressed the group’s frustration after the EPA’s latest announcement.

“Well, it shocked us all, first off — and when I say all I speak for the group,” White said during a call with NC Health News. “Number one, we have worked for eight years to get the limits lowered, to bring awareness to everybody, because our wells are contaminated.”

“[The EPA] extended the public water facilities another two years [before] having to have the chemicals cleaned out of their water systems — another two years of contaminating the public,” she said.

Jane Jacobs (EagleHeart), a tribal leader of the Tuscarora Nation — an Indigenous community with many members in the Cape Fear River Basin — criticized the lack of action to protect vulnerable communities.

“My children, my grandchildren, need to be protected from all of the poison, not some of the poison,” Jacobs said. “If somebody was pointing a gun at my kid right now, am I going to protect him from one bullet or all of the bullets?”

Jacobs also highlighted the disproportionate impact on her community.

“Being a bipoc community, we face a lot more environmental hardships than most people do,” she stated. “We have to drink the tap water. We don’t have money for filters, so for the people in my community, this affects us 10 times worse because we don’t have the money to protect ourselves.”

Looking ahead

While many expressed disappointment over the EPA’s decision, the environmental community remains hopeful that more stringent rules could eventually prevail at the state level — though it may take time.

One significant obstacle is the Environmental Management Commission, which is responsible for developing regulations to safeguard, preserve and improve the state’s air and water resources. Since 2022, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality has been working with the commission to establish regulations for PFAS and 1,4 dioxane — a cancer-causing pollutant that’s also been found to be widely discharged by industrial companies and ultimately flow into the Cape Fear River.

However, a series of delays have stalled progress, preventing the process from advancing to the public comment period — the next step toward establishing maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at the state level.

The most recent Environmental Management Commission meeting, on May 7, ended in another delay after the Office of State Budget and Management raised concerns about the proposal’s fiscal analysis.

Possible remedies

Despite the setbacks, several people at the meeting expressed relief, including Haw Riverkeeper Emily Sutton.

“There’s not actually any checks or enforcement to make sure that the plans that are drafted are effective, and so this [plan] doesn’t do anything for our downstream community members,” Sutton said.

She also criticized the fiscal analysis requested by the Office of State Budget and Management.

“The fiscal analysis that they’ve asked for also is flawed. It doesn’t include information about the financial impacts for downstream communities who are bearing the burden of this pollution. [The fiscal analysis] is looking at how much this is going to cost polluting industries. That’s not our concern. Our concern is the health of our community members.”

Southern Environmental Law Center’s Moser agrees that the commission’s proposal falls short of the outcome environmental groups demand.

“The EMC is siding with polluters and considering adopting rules that were written by polluters,” Moser said. “That could allow industrial facilities to release PFAs indefinitely into North Carolina’s drinking water sources and even increase the toxic water pollution that they are putting into our waterways.”

Sutton and Moser and their colleagues are closely monitoring Senate Bill S666 — the Water Safety Act — proposed by North Carolina Senate Majority Leader Michael Lee (R-New Hanover). If passed, the bill would deliver the state-level regulatory action environmentalists are pushing for.

“ [The proposed bill] directs the EMC to set regulatory limits on PFAs, and that is what our hope is,” Sutton said. “We don’t trust that this commission will hold polluters accountable, and unfortunately, the Department of Environmental Quality has to abide by what they are directed by the EMC.”

Moser pointed out that a potential remedy exists to address the water pollution problem:“It’s more important than ever that states like North Carolina, EPA and wastewater treatment plants use their current authority under the Clean Water Act to require that industry stops their pollution at the source before discharging it into our waterways.”

The Environmental Management Commission is scheduled to meet again in July, while the EPA is expected to update federal PFAS standards by late 2025, with finalization anticipated by spring 2026. Amid these ongoing challenges, Jacobs offered a rallying cry to fellow environmentalists: “We just need to keep pushing. We need to keep fighting.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Granular-Activated-Carbon-Filtration-Syst-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-19 06:00:36.822880

PHEVs combine a small battery with a polluting petrol engine and tend to be much more profitable than pure battery electric cars.
The government last month weakened the rules, which force carmakers to sell an increasing number of battery electric cars each year in order to meet the UK’s climate targets.
Keir Starmer argued that the government needed to help struggling carmakers, allowing more “flexibilities” that mean carmakers can sell fewer electric cars and avoid steep fines.
That will give carmakers a strong incentive to sell more PHEVs, as they will gain credits for lower emissions, meaning they have to sell fewer electric cars.","The UK government’s weakening of rules on electric car sales is likely to result in significantly more carbon emissions as sales of plug-in hybrids rise, according to analysis.

Relaxed rules could result in as many as 500,000 additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) on UK roads by 2030, according to modelling by T&E, a campaign group on transport and the environment. PHEVs combine a small battery with a polluting petrol engine and tend to be much more profitable than pure battery electric cars.

Experts said the findings suggested emissions would rise significantly because of the Labour government’s policy. The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, last month told parliament the weaker rules, known as the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, would cause a “negligible change to the carbon emissions” from cars sold in Britain.

The government last month weakened the rules, which force carmakers to sell an increasing number of battery electric cars each year in order to meet the UK’s climate targets. Keir Starmer argued that the government needed to help struggling carmakers, allowing more “flexibilities” that mean carmakers can sell fewer electric cars and avoid steep fines.

Tim Dexter, a vehicle policy manager at T&E UK, said: “The government’s changes will allow car manufacturers to sell more plug-in hybrids and for longer. Instead of accelerating the transition to zero-emission cars, the industry can maximise sales of lucrative PHEVs, which emit far more than claimed.”

In some years the sale of PHEVs could almost double, according to the analysis. PHEV sales are now expected to peak in 2028, at 280,000 a year, up from a previous forecast of 180,000 a year in 2025. Last year the industry sold 167,000 PHEVs, up 18% on the previous year.

Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, said: “Not only will this result in more CO2 being emitted in the midst of a climate crisis, it will hit the UK’s drivers in their wallets.”

He said the UK government was “distracting manufacturers from making the shift to building the EVs on which the UK car industry’s future depends”.

Alexander’s emissions claim appeared to be based on government policy that has been criticised by experts for relying on unrealistic figures. Crucially, the government’s analysis assumed PHEVs will continue to achieve the same share of the market as 2024 – despite generous emissions assumptions giving manufacturers a big incentive to sell more hybrids.

PHEVs have a polluting petrol engine but can make big emissions savings by running on a small rechargeable battery whenever possible. In an ideal world, PHEV owners would use the battery for most small trips, only using the engine for longer journeys. However, a number of studies have found that PHEV drivers do not reliably charge their vehicles, meaning the cars emit much more in the real world.

The EU is updating official figures to reflect this disparity. By 2028, average PHEV emissions will be assumed at 109 grams of CO2 per kilometre, up from the 32g average currently used. However, the UK government will continue to use the 32g average despite the Department for Transport in December acknowledging that PHEVs have “much higher CO2 emissions in the real world”. That will give carmakers a strong incentive to sell more PHEVs, as they will gain credits for lower emissions, meaning they have to sell fewer electric cars.

Ben Nelmes, the chief executive of New AutoMotive, a thinktank that has closely followed the ZEV mandate, said: “The government – and anyone who has bought a car – knows that manufacturer claims about MPG ratings should be taken with a large helping of salt. Yet ministers have decided to stake the UK’s largest climate policy on the accuracy of these ratings.

“That will sound naive to most people. We should not be surprised to see UK emissions fall more slowly as a result of recent changes to electric car targets.”

Here are four ways you may hear the Spanish blackout talked about in Virginia: 1.
However, the Spanish blackout has brought renewed attention to the importance of battery storage.
Spain has been phasing out its nuclear plants, but now some in Europe are saying the continent needs more nuclear power, not less.","At 12:33 p.m. on April 28, something happened in Spain that you’ll likely hear about in Virginia this fall.

The electric grid across Spain — and then Portugal and a small part of France — suddenly shut down.

The details of what happened are not in dispute: Some strange oscillations in the power grid began at 12:03 p.m., went away, then came back, then went away again. At 12:32:57, to be precise, the power supply suddenly started dropping. Just 27 seconds later, at 12:33:24, the grid collapsed and two counties (and part of a third) were blacked out.

It took until 4 p.m. before power was restored.

For the three and a half hours in between, trains couldn’t run (35,000 passengers were stranded) and planes couldn’t fly (well, they could, but the airports couldn’t operate). Traffic signals ceased to work, forcing police officers to take to key intersections to direct traffic. Bank customers couldn’t access their financial information. Virtually every aspect of a modern, electric-powered society came to a halt. At least five people died, from mechanical ventilators that stopped working or from carbon monoxide from generators that the victims used indoors or, in one case, a fire started by a candle. The impacts of the blackout were felt as far away as Greenland, because the telecom services there rely on a cable that goes through Spain.

What is in dispute is why this blackout, typically described as “catastrophic,” happened. Officially, nobody knows why. Spanish authorities are still investigating. So is the organization that represents 40 different grid operators across Europe. That hasn’t stopped some people from declaring they know the reason anyway. Usually, they blame one thing: solar power.

At the time the Spanish grid blinked out, it was getting 59% of its power from the sun. If you add in 12% wind, Spain was getting 71% of its energy at the time from renewables. Those who don’t think much of renewables were quick to seize on this dependence on solar energy. “It’s very sad to see what’s happened to Portugal and Spain and so many people there, but you know, when you hitch your wagon to the weather, it’s just a risky endeavor,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

There’s no evidence to support this — but also no evidence to deny it, either. The head of energy for the European Union said there was “nothing unusual” about the levels of renewable energy that Spain was relying on that day. Of course, there was also nothing unusual about the power supply that day — until there was none.

The reality is, we simply just don’t know what caused this blackout. We know it started at a single substation in Spain, but beyond that, we don’t know yet. Maybe it was a cyberattack. Maybe it was an old grid that needs to be modernized. Maybe it really was an overreliance on renewables — which do flow into a power grid differently than more conventional sources. That’s not fossil fuel propaganda. The senior climate and energy writer for the MIT Technology Review has written, “Did solar power cause Spain’s blackout?” and while she doesn’t have the answer, either, she does quote one tech expert that “wind and solar don’t contribute to grid stability in the same way that some other power sources do” — so it’s possible that a small problem with grid frequency caused by renewables could have cascaded into a bigger one. The Breakthrough Institute, a left-of-center environmental research group in California, published a cautionary report on the Spanish blackout: “That the Spanish grid collapsed under a bright sun just a half hour past midday fundamentally challenges platitudes that we have already solved the integration challenges of wind and solar power.”

The reason all this matters to us, half a world away, is that we are quite likely to hear about all this in the upcoming gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections in Virginia. That’s because energy is likely to figure in these elections in a way we haven’t seen since perhaps the days of “Howlin’ Henry” Howell railing against Virginia Electric Power in the late 1960s and early 1970s (as seen in this campaign ad from 1971).

Republicans signaled during this year’s General Assembly session that they intend to run against the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the 2020 law that mandates a carbon-free Virginia power grid by 2050. That unleashed a controversial wave of solar development across rural Virginia — controversial because some see solar as an ugly blight that turns their rural landscape into an unwanted industrial one. One Republican argument is the contention that the conversion to renewables is driving up power costs; Democrats counter that solar is actually cheaper than fossil fuels. Another Republican argument is that renewables are inherently unreliable — and that’s where the Spanish blackout provides a convenient and perhaps powerful example. It’s one thing to warn about the specter of blackouts; it’s quite another to point to one that’s already happened — even if nobody knows why it happened. Voters don’t have the patience to learn about the intricacies of “voltage control” or “synchronizing torque” or “ride-through capability,” all things that Power magazine discussed in its report on the blackout. The shorthand of “Spain relied on ‘the weather’ for power and got blacked out” is a lot easier to convey in a 30-second spot.

On the other hand, it’s possible that the Spanish and European reports — which might take weeks to complete — will come back and blame renewables (along with an old grid) to some degree for what happened. Again, we just don’t know.

However, we know that American reliance on solar energy is growing, although the percentages tend to be small. Virginia in April derived about 6% of its power from the sun, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s a bit higher than the national average of 3.9%. Virginia’s wind energy output is almost zero for now. However, Dominion Energy is developing the nation’s largest offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach, and Apex Clean Energy of Charlottesville is building the state’s first onshore wind project in Botetourt County. (Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.) Nationally, wind is more important than solar — about 10% nationally— mostly because of some Midwestern states where wind is their primary power source. (Iowa gets 65.5% of its power from wind; Kansas 40%, Oklahoma 38%.)

Renewables are also where the growth is: In the first nine months of last year, 90% of the new power added to the U.S. grid nationally came from renewables, with 78% of that coming from solar, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Here’s a telling indication about the growth of renewables: On one sunny day in April, the PJM power grid, which includes the big coal-producing states of West Virginia and Pennsylvania (as well as Virginia), hummed with more power from renewables than from coal. Spring and fall often show high percentages of renewables because there’s not the peak demand of power that freezing winter nights or scorching summer days produce. Still, the point is the debate over power sources is not some academic one, which means the lessons from Spain — whatever they might be — will be important to us.

Here are four ways you may hear the Spanish blackout talked about in Virginia:

1. Expect to hear more about the need for ‘baseload’ power.

This refers to a minimum amount of power that can be counted on and that can supply power continuously. For some, this means natural gas, coal or nuclear (more on nuclear to come). Some renewable advocates, though, contend that the need for baseload power is a myth, that renewables can do just fine, especially when augmented with battery storage (more on that to come, too). Very few of us have the technical expertise to debate all this in a scientific fashion, although that won’t stop people on either side from debating it in political terms. In any case, keep in mind that Virginia will never be 100% reliant on renewables because we currently get about 28% of our power from nuclear energy — and might get more.

2. Expect to hear more about battery storage.

The downside of renewables is that they’re intermittent sources of power — the sun doesn’t shine at night, the wind doesn’t always blow. That can be mitigated by storing power. Critics say that’s not the same as being able to run a gas plant or a nuclear plant or even a coal plant 24/7. After all, even batteries run out at some point. However, the Spanish blackout has brought renewed attention to the importance of battery storage. We already have batteries deployed in Virginia — Martinsville uses one to buy and store power during low-demand times (when power is cheapest) and then put it into the local grid when demand is higher (and power is more expensive). As we develop more renewables, look for more talk about battery storage — they go hand-in-hand.

3. Expect to hear more about nuclear power.

Whether because of concerns about the reliability of renewables or a concern that renewables won’t be able to hit decarbonization goals soon enough, some on the left have now joined with some on the right to embrace nuclear power. It’s not clean energy — there is radioactive waste, which is stored on site — but it’s not carbon-based, either. Spain has been phasing out its nuclear plants, but now some in Europe are saying the continent needs more nuclear power, not less. “If you want a lot of power and you want it to be fossil-free, then nuclear is your pick,” the Swedish energy minister told Politico. “The whole of the EU should not make the Spanish mistake” of not having enough backup power available.

In the United States, nuclear is now seeing a renaissance after falling into disfavor after the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have pushed for more nuclear power. In Virginia, so have both candidates for governor — Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears. The specific interest has been in a new type of small reactor known as small modular reactors. The only ones operable right now are in Russia and China, but the hope is that these reactors can be produced quickly and therefore relatively inexpensively, which would get around the traditional problem with nuclear power, which is that it’s slow and expensive to build. In Virginia, both Dominion and Appalachian Power are exploring these small reactors — Dominion at its existing North Anna nuclear site in Louisa County, Appalachian at its Joshua Falls substation in Campbell County.

4. Expect to hear more talk about ‘grid reliability.‘

Regardless of what’s to blame for the Spanish blackout, the fact is that many of Spain’s transmission lines are old — from the 1960s, in some cases. Transmission lines must be kept up-to-date, just like almost everything else. That hasn’t always happened. “While global investment in renewables has nearly doubled since 2010, investment in grids has barely changed at around $300 billion a year,” the Reuters news agency reports. “The amount needs to double by 2030 to over $600 billion a year to cover the necessary overhauls, according to the International Energy Agency.” Fortunately, Virginia is ahead of most states. The website Generator Source says Virginia ranks 13th for grid reliability (Utah ranks first; Louisiana last). Both Dominion Energy and Appalachia Power have embarked on “grid transformation” projects. However, that’s a bit more complicated than, say, repaving a highway. The more things we want to plug in, the more we need a grid that can handle all that power.

All this comes against a backdrop of growing power demands. The General Assembly’s research arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, produced a report in December that warned that if data center growth isn’t restrained, the demand for power in Virginia will triple. The PJM grid recently issued an advisory that, under its worst-case scenario, there won’t be enough power at certain times this summer.

Even without data centers, Virginia may need to produce more power anyway. We now import more power than any other state in the country — and that imported power tends to be more expensive than that we produce in-state. If we want cheaper power, we need cheaper sources. The problem with that is that nobody wants a power plant next to them. It’s a fine thing for politicians to say we need more power from this or more power from that, the trick is finding a place to do that. Solar has become controversial across Southside. We just saw 10 years of controversy over a natural gas pipeline. Some in Southwest Virginia objected to just the mention of a possible nuclear plant. The details of how we solve this conundrum will be both fascinating and perhaps messy. Politicians have some say in this, but not complete say. Market forces play some role, too. West Virginia legislators recently asked Appalachian executives whether having more data centers in the state would lead the utility to burn more coal. The answer was “no,” Appalachian would turn to natural gas because that’s cheaper.

So, when you hear candidates this fall debate energy, this is some of the background you’ll need to know — and that’s why what those reports into the Spanish blackout have to say might wind up being part of the Virginia campaigns.

AI, crypto, microchips, finance, aerospace, healthcare, real estate, were all on the agenda. But it’s energy that was one of the most attractive destinations for investment – both into the Gulf, and the US.

The Gulf has indeed moved into the US energy sector more deeply recently, mostly with gas deals for Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi strategic investor Mubadala. ADNOC’s new XRG unit is said to be looking for more gas assets in the US. In sharp contrast to oil, US gas prices have risen this year, and are supported by the rush to power data centres for AI.

During President Trump’s tour, the UAE committed to investing $440 billion in the US energy sector over the next decade, up from the current $70 billion. This includes the first primary aluminium smelter built in the US since 1980, which Emirates Global Aluminium will build in Oklahoma. Interestingly, XRG will also look at a 0.5 million tonne per year plant to capture carbon dioxide directly from the air, in partnership with Occidental in Texas.

Shale specialist enters Abu Dhabi

Conversely US companies will put $60 billion into UAE energy projects. This includes the entry of shale specialist EOG into Abu Dhabi, along with further investments by Occidental and ExxonMobil.

The state visit also brought deals for Saudi Arabia, said to total $600 billion: in particular, memoranda of understanding and agreements potentially worth $90 billion for Saudi Aramco, covering gas, chemicals, AI and other areas. Most notable was progress on three US LNG projects, Port Arthur with Sempra Energy, Louisiana with Woodside, and Rio Grande with Next Decade, with Aramco purchasing gas and/or investing. And the state oil giant will invest $3.4 billion in upgrading its Motiva refinery in Texas, the biggest in the US.

Stake in Golden Pass LNG plant

Qatar, which had no eye-catching energy announcements this time, has had a share in the under-construction Golden Pass LNG plant in Texas with ExxonMobil since 2019.

Going the other way, Riyadh has long sought a “123” deal on civil nuclear power cooperation. But it wants to be able to enrich uranium domestically, which traditional US policy has generally ruled out. It now appears Washington is no longer conditioning a 123 agreement on Saudi recognition of Israel, which remains out of reach while Israel continues its abandonment of the ceasefire and blockades Gaza. But President Trump’s visit brought no public progress in this area.

Scope for processing minerals

The Saudi and US energy ministries did agree to cooperate on mining and processing critical minerals, a less contentious and more straightforward area. Saudi Arabia has resources of gold, copper, phosphate, rare earths and other minerals of strategic importance. Both it and the UAE have invested significantly recently in resources in Africa. Non-Chinese sources are of keen interest to Washington. The Gulf, with its low energy costs and central geography, could also be a good place for processing minerals, an area where China is even more dominant than in their extraction.

However, the trip left behind two major contradictions.

First is the direction of investment. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in April: “It's going to involve investments both ways, massive UAE investments in the United States, and we’re going to see continued geo-strategic co-operation with the UAE.”

Oil price outlook

Saudi Arabia has been struggling to achieve its targets for attracting foreign direct investment. Oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, mining are among its strongest suits for wooing FDI. But it’s not clear the US has much to offer. American companies do feature in the minerals sector, and GE Vernova signed up during the visit to provide $14.2 billion of gas turbines and other systems. But recent investment and supply of equipment for areas from refining to solar to electric vehicles has much more preferred Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean companies.

Going the other way, President Trump has demanded lower oil prices to curb inflation. OPEC+ has obliged, though for its own, different reasons, instituting two large production increases. Lower oil prices, consequent on higher production as well as the economic worries triggered by tariffs, mean the Gulf countries have less to spend overseas, alongside heavy domestic development priorities. A possible deal with Iran over its nuclear programme would release yet more oil on to the market.

That matters less for deep-pocketed Qatar and the UAE, but it does challenge Saudi Arabia. The requested $1 trillion investment by the Kingdom in the US, always implausible, now is absolutely out of reach.

Contrasting forecasts for US drilling

It is understandable that during the visit, the oil exporters wanted their production policy to seem in accordance with President Trump’s wishes, and with internal discipline, not with bashing a successful American industry. But that is the practical outcome. Lower prices have already led to a slowdown in US drilling, and could lead to a stagnation or even decline in output this year, contrasting with forecasts of just three months ago for significant growth. Valuations in the US shale patch may be more attractive, but a shadow has fallen over its longer-term future.

The second contradiction is in US domestic energy policy. Renewable and nuclear power and electric vehicles are all attractive areas for Gulf investors. In October, after buying independent US renewable generator Terra-Gen, Abu Dhabi clean energy investor Masdar said it saw the US as one of its fastest growth markets, and targeted 10 gigawatts of capacity there out of its overall target of 100 GW by 2030. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund holds more than 58 percent of the shares of electric carmaker Lucid.

But the Trump administration is not friendly to energy other than oil and gas, even nuclear which initially seemed favoured. The budget bill now making its way through Congress looks set to gut nearly all support for solar, wind, hydrogen, nuclear, batteries and electric vehicles.

Eye-catching announcements

Both the GCC countries and President Trump got what they wanted from the tour: some specific deals, eye-catching announcements, warm words and no public clashes over controversial issues.

The headline investment numbers from the three Gulf countries are massive, with a fair share of double-counting and repeats of previous commitments. The reality will be somewhat less, and some of the roads to the energy future are barred, for now.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/he1lpout/trump-gcc-may-25.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=133921098827370000,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:16.207533

Poland, now Europe’s fastest-growing economy, has emerged as a vital partner in Washington’s broader efforts to reduce European reliance on Russian energy. With the European Union accelerating efforts to phase out Russian natural gas, U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear technology are set to play a central role in the continent’s future energy mix—and Poland is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, Caliber.Az reports, citing an article by The National Interest.

Recent developments underscore the deepening energy partnership. U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright visited Warsaw to oversee the signing of a key Engineering Development Agreement between the Westinghouse-Bechtel Consortium and Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ) for the construction of Poland’s first AP-1000 nuclear power plant. The three-unit facility marks a historic step in Poland’s long-term strategy to diversify its energy sources and is expected to generate thousands of American jobs across the supply chain. A second plant is also in the planning stages.

Poland plans to construct three nuclear power plants domestically and support others across the Three Seas region—a zone bounded by the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic Seas. The region is emerging as a battleground for global energy influence, with Russia, China, Japan, and France vying for major infrastructure contracts. The U.S., working in close coordination with Poland, aims to secure its role as the region’s leading energy partner.

The transatlantic cooperation extends beyond traditional nuclear reactors. Small modular reactors (SMRs), LNG terminals, and pipeline integration all form part of Poland’s pragmatic “all-of-the-above” strategy. The Świnoujście LNG terminal—Poland’s flagship import facility—is already the second-largest on the Baltic Sea after Germany’s Wilhelmshaven and serves as a crucial node in Central Europe’s energy network.

Beyond energy, Poland’s robust military investment—allocating more than 4 per cent of GDP to defence—adds to its growing stature as a reliable U.S. ally in confronting shared adversaries such as Russia and China. U.S. officials have described Poland as embodying the core tenets of a reinvigorated transatlantic alliance: a dynamic economy, strategic location, and deep commitment to regional security.

This vision aligns with Poland’s broader geopolitical outlook, shaped by the country’s wartime history and post-Soviet scepticism. Poland and the Baltic states were early critics of Germany’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, warning of the strategic risks of European dependence on Russian gas—a view later echoed by the Trump administration.

Poland has also taken a leading role in the Three Seas Initiative (3SI), a regional infrastructure and connectivity platform launched with Croatia. The initiative offers a democratic, self-sustaining alternative to China's “16+1” framework and has received strong backing from Washington. Former President Donald Trump personally endorsed the 3SI during his first term, promising U.S. financial support.

President Donald Trump wants to revive the struggling coal industry in the U.S. by deploying plants to power the data centers that the Big Tech companies are building to train artificial intelligence.

Trump issued an executive order in April that directed his Cabinet to find areas of the U.S. where coal-powered infrastructure is available to support AI data centers and determine whether the infrastructure can be expanded to meet the growing electricity demand from the nation's tech sector.

Trump has repeatedly promoted coal as power source for data centers. The president told the World Economic Forum in January that he would approve power plants for AI through emergency declaration, calling on the tech companies to use coal as a backup power source.

""They can fuel it with anything they want, and they may have coal as a backup — good, clean coal,"" the president said.

Trump's push to deploy coal runs afoul of the tech companies' environmental goals. In the short-term, the industry's power needs may inadvertently be extending the life of existing coal plants.

Coal produces more carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour of power than any other energy source in the U.S. with the exception of oil, according to the Energy Information Administration. The tech industry has invested billions of dollars to expand renewable energy and is increasingly turning to nuclear power as a way to meet its growing electricity demand while trying to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that fuel climate change.

For coal miners, Trump's push is a potential lifeline. The industry has been in decline as coal plants are being retired in the U.S. About 16% of U.S. electricity generation came from burning coal in 2023, down from 51% in 2001, according to EIA data.

Peabody Energy CEO James Grech, who attended Trump's executive order ceremony at the White House, said ""coal plants can shoulder a heavier load of meeting U.S. generation demands, including multiple years of data center growth."" Peabody is one of the largest coal producers in the U.S.

Grech said coal plants should ramp up how much power they dispatch. The nation's coal fleet is dispatching about 42% of its maximum capacity right now, compared to a historical average of 72%, the CEO told analysts on the company's May 6 earnings call.

""We believe that all coal-powered generators need to defer U.S. coal plant retirements as the situation on the ground has clearly changed,"" Grech said. ""We believe generators should un-retire coal plants that have recently been mothballed.""

Tech sector reaction

There is a growing acknowledgment within the tech industry that fossil fuel generation will be needed to help meet the electricity demand from AI. But the focus is on natural gas, which emits less half the CO2 of coal per kilowatt hour of power, according the the EIA.

""To have the energy we need for the grid, it's going to take an all of the above approach for a period of time,"" Kevin Miller, Amazon's vice president of global data centers, said during a panel discussion at conference of tech and oil and gas executives in Oklahoma City last month.

""We're not surprised by the fact that we're going to need to add some thermal generation to meet the needs in the short term,"" Miller said.

Thermal generation is a code word for gas, said Nat Sahlstrom, chief energy officer at Tract, a Denver-based company that secures land, infrastructure and power resources for data centers. Sahlstrom previously led Amazon's energy, water and sustainability teams.

Executives at Amazon , Nvidia and Anthropic would not commit to using coal, mostly dodging the question when asked during the panel at the Oklahoma City conference.

""It's never a simple answer,"" Amazon's Miller said. ""It is a combination of where's the energy available, what are other alternatives.""

Nvidia is able to be agnostic about what type of power is used because of the position the chipmaker occupies on the AI value chain, said Josh Parker, the company's senior director of corporate sustainability. ""Thankfully, we leave most of those decisions up to our customers.""

Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark said there are a broader set of options available than just coal. ""We would certainly consider it but I don't know if I'd say it's at the top of our list.""

Sahlstrom said Trump's executive order seems like a ""dog whistle"" to coal mining constituents. There is a big difference between looking at existing infrastructure and ""actually building new power plants that are cost competitive and are going to be existing 30 to 40 years from now,"" the Tract executive said.

Coal is being displaced by renewables, natural gas and existing nuclear as coal plants face increasingly difficult economics, Sahlstrom said. ""Coal has kind of found itself without a job,"" he said.

""I do not see the hyperscale community going out and signing long term commitments for new coal plants,"" the former Amazon executive said. (The tech companies ramping up AI are frequently referred to as ""hyperscalers."")

""I would be shocked if I saw something like that happen,"" Sahlstrom said.

Coal retirements strain grid

But coal plant retirements are creating a real challenge for the grid as electricity demand is increasing due to data centers, re-industrialization and the broader electrification of the economy.

The largest grid in the nation, the PJM Interconnection, has forecast electricity demand could surge 40% by 2039. PJM warned in 2023 that 40 gigawatts of existing power generation, mostly coal, is at risk of retirement by 2030, which represents about 21% of PJM's installed capacity.

Data centers will temporarily prolong coal demand as utilities scramble to maintain grid reliability, delaying their decarbonization goals, according to a Moody's report from last October. Utilities have already postponed the retirement of coal plants totaling about 39 gigawatts of power, according to data from the National Mining Association.

""If we want to grow America's electricity production meaningfully over the next five or ten years, we [have] got to stop closing coal plants,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" last month.

But natural gas and renewables are the future, Sahlstrom said. Some 60% of the power sector's emissions reductions over the past 20 years are due to gas displacing coal, with the remainder coming from renewables, Sahlstrom said.

""That's a pretty powerful combination, and it's hard for me to see people going backwards by putting more coal into the mix, particularly if you're a hyperscale customer who has net-zero carbon goals,"" he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108128679-17441448062025-04-08t203717z_1739258938_rc2wtdaq0qwu_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump.jpeg?v=1744144838&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-05-19 07:11:22.831205

A gas-fired turbine is a giant engine that transforms the energy in natural gas into electricity using a continuous, high-speed process.
How a Natural Gas Turbine Generates Electricity.","There is tremendous buzz around natural-gas-fired turbines right now with backlogs reportedly stretching five years into the future due to supply-chain bottlenecks, labor shortages and a surge in demand. The power generation industry is poised for a major upswing as data center development and overall electricity demand continue to accelerate, driving an even greater need for gas turbines. In today’s RBN blog, we will explore why gas turbines are so challenging to build and why there’s such a manufacturing backlog.

As we noted recently in Only Happy When It Rains, there’s been a lot of talk the past few months about artificial intelligence (AI) and plans by Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others to build a slew of data centers — energy hogs that require vast amounts of around-the-clock electricity. Developers have been considering the full gamut of power-generation sources — everything from renewables to nuclear — but almost everyone understands that gas-fired plants will be a big part of the solution. A number of major gas producers and just about every big midstreamer with a gas pipeline network have been talking up their plans to serve these new power plants, and several gas-fired projects — many tied directly to data centers — have already been announced. And while there are other fundamental factors stimulating demand for gas-fired power generation, the high profile of the data center development has put a spotlight on the prospects for acquiring the turbines needed to run a gas-fired power plant, a bigger challenge than it might appear.

Before we get into what’s behind the turbine bottleneck, let’s start with some basics on turbines and how they work. A gas-fired turbine is a giant engine that transforms the energy in natural gas into electricity using a continuous, high-speed process. As shown in Figure 1 below, it works by taking in air, squeezing it tightly and mixing it with fuel — creating a fiery (but controlled) explosion in its combustion chamber. The blast of hot, high-pressure gases rushes through and spins the turbine’s blades. The spinner on the turbine turns a shaft connected to a generator (bottom portion of graphic), where the mechanical energy is then turned into electricity. It then heads to a transformer, which increases the voltage, and then to a transmission line. (High-voltage lines allow electricity to be transmitted over long distances with minimal losses.)

The demand for energy increases, while the supply of resources decreases as they are strained by data centers and other large energy consumers.","After 15 months of deliberation, the Village Council of Winnetka met this week to continue discussing the Village’s contract with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency.

While the council did not reach a conclusion on Tuesday night, they heard from several energy experts and pushed for further information on sustainable power sources that are cost-effective, as well as additional details on the IMEA contract and the timeline for renewal.

An overarching concern from councilmembers and community members alike is ensuring the energy is sustainable. The Village aims to have net-zero generation by 2050, and many urged the council to delay their decision as the contract is not set to expire until September 2035 and a renewed contract — for which IMEA is lobbying – would extend to 2055.

Options

During Tuesday’s meeting, Nick Narhi, the Village’s director of water and electric, presented information on IMEA, followed by Mark Pruitt, the principal of the Illinois Power Bureau and Illinois Community Choice Aggregation Network, who detailed PJM, an alternative to IMEA.

IMEA is a nonprofit municipal joint action agency that has powered Winnetka since 1991. Winnetka also holds a seat on the IMEA board, giving the Village a direct voice in its power supply.

According to Village documents, IMEA acquires power and energy through an IMEA-owned plant and other power generating entities and uses energy from the Village’s electrical plant and 31 other municipal generation operations. The output of Winnetka’s plant is dedicated to IMEA, in exchange for monthly capacity payments and fuel costs.

PJM, or Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, is a regional transmission organization. Partnering with PJM would provide Winnetka with a marketplace to acquire electricity from companies like ComEd and even IMEA. PJM is the largest wholesale electricity market in the nation, and oversees 13 states and Washington, D.C.

Narhi and Pruitt laid out pros and cons to each, ensuring they touched on cost and sustainability.

Positives of IMEA

According to Narhi, the Village has accrued $47 million in capacity credits with IMEA since joining, because their plant helps fuel the organization. During a recent meeting, IMEA approved a more generous capacity payment structure that could allow the Village to profit even more over the next 10 years.

Another advantage, according to Narhi, is that staying with IMEA would allow for better planning. With Winnetka’s energy load being mainly residential, Narhi believes that IMEA provides clearer pricing in comparison to purchasing energy through wholesale.

IMEA’s energy is generated through solar, wind, hydroelectric and coal, as stated on its website. With sustainability being a key concern, Narhi did stress that IMEA is working to build a more climate-friendly infrastructure, including making rooftop solar panels more accessible and renewable energy credits possible.

PJM benefits

Pruitt presented to the council about PJM. The challenge to the wholesale market is the unpredictable nature of the cost of energy. The demand for energy increases, while the supply of resources decreases as they are strained by data centers and other large energy consumers. Meaning that the cost of energy is only going to increase, which would make financial forecasting much more difficult in the wholesale market.

PJM, however, better aligns with Winnetka’s sustainable needs. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, PJM also uses coal, but since they pull power from 13 states, 14% of PJM’s generation comes from coal.

The EIA article states, “In 2023, the use of coal-fired generation in PJM dropped to 34% of capacity. In 2023, coal-fired generation contributed 14% of PJM’s generation, while it made up 18% of its generating capacity. By comparison, in 2013, the capacity factor of coal-fired power plants in the market was 56%, when coal-fired power made up 44% of the market’s generation and 38% of its capacity.”

’10 years’

Following the presentation, residents took to the stand to voice their concerns, specifically on sustainability.

Laith Amin, a Winnetka resident and vice president of growth and strategic development for EcoEngineers, voiced concerns over the rush to renew a contract not set to expire for 10 years.

“So if we were to build an energy plan, identify our goals, do extensive consultation, take the time that we need, the time is on our side. We’ve really got 10 years. We will come to exactly the right result,” Amin told the council.

The council agreed that it was crucial to provide IMEA with an update on their discussion, considering it is a founding municipality, but emphasized that there is no rush to decide.

Roy, who also sits on the Rules panel, would not commit to voting to advance the bill in that upcoming vote.
The vote comes after four hardline conservatives on the committee tanked a vote on the legislation Friday, saying the cost-cutting measures in the bill did not go far enough.
While those changes are not fully ironed out, it was good enough for the holdouts to allow them to go forward.
“In an effort to move this bill forward, and I’m excited about the changes we’ve made, I vote present,” Norman said.","Republican deficit hawks allowed President Trump’s bill of legislative priorities to advance out of the House Budget Committee in an unusual late-night vote on Sunday, marking a key hurdle cleared for House GOP leaders and a sign of progress for warring Republican factions

After gaveling in after 10 p.m. on Sunday, the committee voted 17-16 to advance the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which would extend Trump’s tax cuts and boost his border funding priorities while reforming Medicaid and food assistance programs.

The four Republican holdouts who had tanked the vote on Friday — Reps. Ralph Norman (S.C.), Chip Roy (Texas), Andrew Clyde (Ga.), and Josh Brecheen (Okla.) — voted present to allow the bill to go forward, with Roy revealing that there was progress on moving up the start date for new Medicaid work requirements and speeding up the phase-out of green energy incentives.

In a sign of the high-stakes nature of the vote, the Speaker as well as White House Legislative Affairs Director James Braid made appearances off a room to the side of the late night Budget Committee affair.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said they are counting the vote “as a big win tonight.”

“There’s a lot more work to do, we’ve always acknowledged that towards the end there will be more details to iron out, we have several more to take care of,” Johnson said. “But I’m looking forward to very thoughtful discussions, very productive discussions over the next few days, and I am absolutely convinced we’re going to get this in final form and pass it in accordance with our original deadline, and that was to do it before Memorial Day.”

“So this will be a victory out of committee tonight, everybody will make a vote that allows us to proceed and that was my big request tonight.”

The next stop is the House Rules Committee, which is set to take up the legislation later this week and make last-minute changes to the bill to reflect any compromises and demands between deficit hawks and moderates in high-tax states.

Despite the victory for leadership, the conservatives indicated they still have more work to do.

Roy said that while he voted present “out of respect for the Republican Conference and the President,” the bill “does not yet meet the moment.”

He said the revamped measure would “move Medicaid work requirements forward and reduces the availability of future subsidies under the green new scam.” But, in a statement on X, he objected to provisions around green energy tax credits and Medicaid.

“This all ultimately increases the likelihood of continuing deficits and non-Obamacare-expansion states like Texas expanding in the future. We can and must do better before we pass the final product,” he wrote, alluding to wanting even more controversial Medicaid reforms like reining in the provider tax mechanism that allows states to extract more federal Medicaid matching dollars.

Norman also indicated he was looking for changes.

“We had some great changes, got a lot more work to do. We’re excited about what we did, we wanted to move the bill forward and it went like I thought,” he said.

We’ve been downgraded three times, we have problems with the money in this country, the debt, the FMAPs gotta be dealt with,” he said, referencing the share of Medicaid paid for by the federal government.

Roy, who also sits on the Rules panel, would not commit to voting to advance the bill in that upcoming vote. He would not answer questions about whether Trump — who on Friday had pressed Republican “GRANDSTANDERS” to “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!” — had talked to him about the bill.

The vote comes after four hardline conservatives on the committee tanked a vote on the legislation Friday, saying the cost-cutting measures in the bill did not go far enough.

Those fiscal hawks had said new Medicaid work requirements on “able-bodied” single adults and repeal of green energy incentives do not kick in soon enough, causing them to worry that the savings that are back-loaded on the overall 10-year cost of the package will not actually be realized.

On the other end of the Republican conference, moderates in high-tax states are demanding an increase to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, currently written as $30,000 — a figure that amounts to three times the current level, but that moderates says is not acceptable to win their votes for the sprawling package. Making changes to appease those members will require tweaks to the bill elsewhere.

While those changes are not fully ironed out, it was good enough for the holdouts to allow them to go forward.

“In an effort to move this bill forward, and I’m excited about the changes we’ve made, I vote present,” Norman said.

Democrats on the other side of the room exclaimed: “What changes?”

Ranking member Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) made a number of inquiries on those “side deals” being negotiated behind closed doors, saying that lawmakers and the public deserved to know what those are.

Desire 4 EVs Still Charged

Despite economic uncertainty and shifting market sentiment, consumer interest in electric vehicles (EVs) remains steady, according to the J.D. Power 2025 U.S. Electric Vehicle Consideration (EVC) Study. Released today, the study finds that 24% of car shoppers are “very likely” and 35% are “somewhat likely” to consider an EV—unchanged from 2024.

“EVs have secured a foothold in consumer consideration,” said Brent Gruber, executive director of J.D. Power’s EV practice. “To build on this, automakers need to offer affordable, compelling products and improve consumer education, especially around public charging.”

Key Highlights:

Active Cross-Shopping: Shoppers “very likely” to consider EVs explore an average of 2.9 brands, suggesting flexibility and openness to new entrants. EV buyers are more brand-agnostic than those shopping for gas-powered vehicles, showing strong potential for market share gains.

Concerns Shift: While price concerns dropped to 43% (down 4 points) and cost of ownership to 33% (down 2 points), public charging access remains the top deterrent at 52%, reflecting persistent misconceptions.

Demographic Divide: Younger consumers (25–49) are most interested in EVs but typically have lower incomes, with only 17% earning over $100,000. Older shoppers, while wealthier, show less interest—highlighting a gap between enthusiasm and affordability.

Regional Variation: EV interest is lowest in Midwest states like Wisconsin, Kentucky, Minnesota, and Ohio, where cold weather concerns and brand loyalty to legacy automakers dampen enthusiasm.

Now in its fifth year, the EVC Study benchmarks EV consideration by region, demographics, and psychographics. This year’s findings are based on 8,164 respondents planning to buy or lease a new vehicle within the next year, surveyed from January to April 2025.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-05-19 05:02:31.702271

Climate resilience requires more than levees and carbon markets.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FEMA should recognize digital infrastructure as eligible under mitigation grant programs.
Environmental regulators across federal agencies should treat digital access as a factor in environmental justice reviews.
Without a new legal and policy framework that connects digital equity to climate resilience, America’s most vulnerable communities will remain dangerously exposed—and unheard.","Equal access to technology is a necessary but overlooked part of responsible environmental regulation.

As the United States braces for what is likely to be another record-setting hurricane and wildfire season, one critical issue remains largely overlooked in emergency planning: the digital divide. In many of the country’s most climate-vulnerable areas, particularly across the American South, limited internet access is silently undermining disaster resilience and deepening environmental injustice.

Although climate policy discussions frequently highlight emissions reduction and energy transition, policymakers often overlook a foundational requirement for adaptation: access to information. In communities without broadband or digital literacy, missing a weather alert, failing to register for evacuation, or not knowing how to apply for disaster aid can be a matter of life or death. This disparity is not simply about convenience—it is about rights and survival.

The Undivide Project, which I direct, launched the Ten States Project to study the digital disparity. Our team conducted interviews with emergency managers, surveyed national and regional stakeholders, and reviewed over 190 laws and policies related to disaster response, digital infrastructure, and environmental justice. From this study of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, and five other states, we found that digital exclusion is not adequately recognized in disaster law and communities without digital access are being structurally excluded from resilience planning.

These communities—many of which are predominantly Black and low-income—are not just underserved; they are systematically excluded from the tools, information, and legal protections necessary to survive a climate emergency. The failure to treat broadband access as an essential utility and emergency service is worsening the climate resilience gap in America.

Our legal review revealed that most state emergency statutes focus almost exclusively on reactive measures, such as declaring a state of emergency, activating the National Guard, or suspending regulations. Fewer than 10 percent of the legal instruments we analyzed mentioned environmental justice. None explicitly addressed digital access.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not currently fund broadband infrastructure as a disaster resilience strategy, despite increasing reliance on digital registration, alerts, and reporting. Without policy change, communities already marginalized by race, income, and geography will remain last in line for assistance—and first in line for disaster impacts.

Consider Alabama’s Black Belt region, where more than 30,000 homes have failing septic systems that are worsening due to increased rainfall. A now-terminated U.S. Department of Justice investigation found that the state’s failure to address wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County constituted a civil rights violation. Residents in this region are also among the least digitally connected in the nation—many do not have reliable access to email or internet-enabled devices. When disaster strikes, they are cut off twice––first by infrastructure, and then again by information.

In Louisiana, redistricting disputes have diluted the voting power of Black communities along the Gulf Coast, while toxic industries continue to expand in “cancer alley.” In Texas, communities of color disproportionately suffered during the Great Freeze of 2021, and many were left without digital access to information about warming centers, emergency benefits, or infrastructure outages. These cases are not outliers—they are the product of a systemic failure to integrate digital equity into environmental and disaster law.

Climate resilience requires more than levees and carbon markets. It demands governance models that recognize digital infrastructure as essential to disaster response, community agency, and adaptive capacity. Legal scholars and regulators must begin treating broadband like electricity or water—a necessary condition for public safety and access to emergency services.

We propose a new framework: digital equity as a climate adaptation imperative. This means incorporating digital inclusion into the legal definitions of “resilience” and “mitigation” in state and federal codes. It means requiring environmental justice assessments to include digital exclusion. It means directing resilience funding to places where climate and digital vulnerability overlap.

Some states are taking steps in this direction. Virginia passed the Environmental Justice Act in 2020, which defines “fenceline” vulnerable communities and created an Office of Environmental Justice within its emergency management agency. North Carolina incorporated digital infrastructure planning into its resilience funding strategy. But without federal agency action and statutory mandates, these state efforts remain fragmented and insufficient.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FEMA should recognize digital infrastructure as eligible under mitigation grant programs. This includes broadband deployment, hot spot expansion, and digital literacy training for disaster preparedness.

Environmental regulators across federal agencies should treat digital access as a factor in environmental justice reviews. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could update its—recently removed—equity screening tools to include digital exclusion as a risk multiplier.

To supplement agency efforts, the U.S. Congress should modernize disaster law to reflect digital dependence. Updating the Stafford Act for example, to include digital equity and removing administrative barriers to broadband resilience projects would expand legal protections to communities that are currently excluded.

Voting rights protections enacted by Congress should also include digital participation safeguards. Communities must be able to engage in climate-related policy debates and disaster planning. Digital disenfranchisement undermines civic engagement and climate governance.

Ultimately, the digital divide is not just a technology issue—it is a governance issue. It reflects who has access to safety, who is heard in times of crisis, and who is left behind. As we prepare for a future of escalating climate extremes, we must ensure that digital equity is part of every emergency plan, every resilience policy, and every legal reform.

Environmental and disaster regulators have a responsibility to act. Without a new legal and policy framework that connects digital equity to climate resilience, America’s most vulnerable communities will remain dangerously exposed—and unheard.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sanders5.19.25-2177991924.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 04:08:42.671668

Donald Trump has instructed federal agencies to stop enforcing certain regulations. This move impacts areas like energy efficiency and environmental protection. The Department of Energy plans to eliminate some appliance standards. The EPA has reduced enforcement actions against the fossil fuel industry. Critics question the legality of these actions. Some legal experts believe this approach is unprecedented.

President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to halt the enforcement of numerous regulations, effectively sidelining laws he deems unfavorable, raising significant concerns among legal experts, environmental advocates, and civil servants.

Over 40 regulatory changes have been proposed at the Department of Energy, aiming to eliminate water and energy efficiency standards for household appliances such as faucets, clothes washers, and microwave ovens.

The administration estimates these changes will save taxpayers $11 billion, positioning it as the largest deregulatory effort in the department's history.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also seen a significant reduction in enforcement actions, particularly those impacting the fossil fuel industry.

Live Events

The agency has initiated 19 fewer cases per month on average compared to the Biden administration's last year in office.

Critics argue that these moves bypass lawful rulemaking processes, potentially violating laws such as the Administrative Procedure Act.

Richard Revesz, former head of the White House regulatory affairs office under President Joe Biden, stated, ""They're making across-the-board decisions not to enforce whole categories of standards, and it is of very dubious legality.""

The administration's actions have also impacted the Labor Department, where enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws has sputtered. Employees report that work at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has ground to a halt, even though much of it is still mandated by laws from the 1970s that have not been overturned.

These enforcement slowdowns have led to reduced hiring in legal sectors that defend companies against regulatory actions.

Stephen Springer, a managing partner at a legal recruiting firm, noted, ""CFPB enforcement work is dormant completely. I don't think anybody expects those enforcement areas to be particularly busy for the next three years.""

Legal experts warn that the administration's approach, choosing not to enforce laws the president dislikes, is unprecedented and legally dubious. Peter Shane, an emeritus law professor at Ohio State University, remarked, ""To my knowledge, no other president has taken that kind of stance.""

The automaker revealed this week it was “re-evaluating” its electrification strategy amid a turbulent and uncertain time for the auto industry.

Also: Subaru Trailseeker Is Faster Than A WRX But No One Knows If It’s A Wagon Or SUV

Look at Subaru’s US website and you’ll find just one EV: the recently facelifted Solterra. A second, the Outback-sized Trailseeker that made its debut at last month’s New York Auto Show, is scheduled to be added to the range for 2026. But we’re unlikely to see many more EVs join it any time soon.

Tariffs and Tax Credits: The Great Unknowns

Aside from a general concern about a slowdown in the rate of EV takeup, Subaru, like every other automaker, is hamstrung by a lack of clarity from the US regarding its long term position on both import tariffs and EV tax credits. Nobody knows what the tariff situation will look like six or 12 months from now or whether tax credits will be scrapped or not.

Subaru estimates Trump’s tariffs could cost it $2.5 billion this year because, although the company does have a plant in Indiana, it only builds around half of the 700,000+ cars the brand sells in the US each year, Auto News reports. The remainder have to be imported, an d while Subaru could theoretically push the US plant’s current 345,000-unit annual capacity to 500,000, its supplier base can’t handle more than 370,000 units without a major upgrade.

Overseas Production and Shifting Plans

That means the Trailseeker will probably have to be built overseas, Auto News suggesting production will take place north of Tokyo. Subaru also had planned to create a new EV-only plant, but is rethinking that strategy, too. It now says it might have to add combustion vehicles into the mix at the new site.

Plans to simplify EU sustainability reporting and due diligence rules lack sound economic analysis

Tabled in February, the European Commission’s omnibus proposal remains the talk of the day in sustainability policy circles. The EU executive is seeking to water down multiple laws, including the recently adopted Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

The CSDDD was only agreed on last year, and trade unions, civil society and progressive companies had considered it as a game-changer towards sustainability in global supply chains. However, the commission has started to question its own approach.

The legislation was intended to force large European and foreign companies to comply with human rights standards. The CSDDD looks likely to be significantly weakened in the name of competitiveness and economic performance, even though the commission’s unpredictable behaviour will do nothing to create trust in EU economic governance.

While many companies had already started to prepare for the newly established legislation, they now face substantial uncertainty. Indeed, the commission’s behaviour fuels fundamental uncertainty about the overall direction in the bloc in terms of sustainability policies. Will the EU remain a progressive international standard setter, or will it join a race to the bottom that it will never be able to win?

Today, in a statement co-signed by more than 80 economists from 11 EU member states, we express our concern that the commission’s proposal lacks substantial arguments and seems to be rooted in short-sighted political tactics rather than in sound economic analysis.

A value-based modern economy

Contrary to what the commission is arguing, sustainability legislation is less of a burden and more of an opportunity for European companies. In times of erratic “Trumponomics”, a clear and lasting approach to sustainability could enhance the EU’s position as a value-based modern economy that builds its wealth not on a systematic abuse of human rights abroad.

Much of the commission’s arguments used to weaken the support for the CSDDD focus on compliance costs for companies constituting an administrative burden. Most regulations come with associated costs. However, the commission’s own research has shown that compliance costs for large companies are a negligible percentage of revenues generated. The costs, however, are only one side of the equation.

The EU directive, in supporting compliance with human rights, also offers opportunities to reduce significantly the costs of economic activities that companies generate for third parties — so-called negative externalities.

The externalisation of costs harms local livelihoods and exporting economies and can also harm the economy more broadly. Human rights abuses such as poverty wages, unhealthy work conditions and the use of harmful pesticide create additional costs for society and are, unfortunately, too common in many economies of the global south. They also prevent affected countries from diversifying their economies and claiming a larger share of the value produced in global value chains.

The second political argument by the commission, that the CSDDD and the CSRD harm European competitiveness, also evaporates at closer scrutiny.

The sluggishness of the European economy can hardly be attributed to laws that have not yet been implemented or that have just entered into force. Restrictive fiscal policies and a systematic lack of investments in public goods, including infrastructure, a conflict-ridden global environment, and an export-oriented global model — now in crisis also due to US tariffs — are much more significant explanations.

Yet, these are much harder problems to solve. They require proper economic and industrial policies, rather than populist political moves pretending that cutting compliance costs will bring EU economies back to growth. On the contrary, a stable commitment to maintain a strong focus on sustainability in Europe is likely to provide a reliable context for European companies to adapt their long-term strategies and to promote sustainable growth.

In conclusion, the idea that sustainability obligations only create costs for companies is misguided. Legislators should also look at the benefits that the CSDDD will have for European economies and for the economies of its trading partners. Overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs by far.

Economic choices are political choices. With the omnibus proposal, the commission is cheering short-sighted populist calls and deviating attention from the big challenges the European economy faces. By continuing to allow for external costs and human rights abuses in supply chains, the EU risks falling back on its regulatory achievements in terms of sustainability.

The European parliament and the European Council can still stop the watering down of sustainability legislation. The failure to do so will come at a cost to us all.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/6ccca3b6-3d87-4cbf-85fd-e0138b543336.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 22:00:06.914106

GM's new LMR prismatic cells will utilize more affordable manganese in place of pricier nickel.
GM anticipates it could reduce the number of modules required in a large EV battery pack, from 24 to just six.

The LMR cells are designed to be a middle ground, offering a balance of cost and range for popular segments.","General Motors has announced a significant advancement in its electric vehicle battery technology: new lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic cells that are designed to slash manufacturing costs. This development, part of an extended partnership with LG Energy Solution, aims to create a future where a Chevrolet Silverado EV could be as affordable as a V8-powered Silverado 1500.

We've heard claims like these before, and they often come with extended timelines, but GM seems to believe this breakthrough can be brought to the market very soon.

A New Shape For A New Mineral

The core of this innovation lies in a shift in battery chemistry and design. GM's new LMR prismatic cells will utilize more affordable manganese in place of pricier nickel. Cobalt, another expensive material, will also see its role diminished. According to Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of propulsion and sustainability, the ultimate goal is to achieve price parity between electric and gas vehicles.

Physically, the new LMR prismatic cells are notably larger than the pouch cells currently used in vehicles like the Silverado EV, with each new cell weighing between six and eleven pounds and resembling an old DVD player in shape. GM anticipates it could reduce the number of modules required in a large EV battery pack, from 24 to just six. Despite the focus on costs, GM also claims these LMR cells boast 33 percent higher energy density than comparable lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) prismatic cells. These can be found in vehicles like specific models of the Tesla Model 3.

Strategic Sourcing, Diverse Applications

This new LMR technology is slated to first appear in GM's electric pickups and full-size SUVs launching in 2028. It is one part of GM's broader battery strategy, which involves deploying different battery chemistries for different vehicle types. More affordable LFP cells might be used in entry-level EVs where maximum range is less critical, such as a potential next-generation Chevy Bolt. High-nickel NMCA cells would be reserved for premium vehicles where customers would demand the most range, like the big and luxurious Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR cells are designed to be a middle ground, offering a balance of cost and range for popular segments.

To support this development, GM is also investing in its supply chain. In 2023, the company partnered with Element 25, investing $85 million to build a facility in Louisiana that will process manganese mined in Australia. GM says that its long-term domestic battery production strategy is not in reaction to recent developments with tariffs, and dates back several years.

Validation of the new LMR cells is scheduled to occur in 2027 at GM's Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan. The company is already fine-tuning the production processes for these cells, from mixing raw materials to creating electrodes from ultra-thin aluminum sheets. While the specific manufacturing locations for the LMR cells have not yet been announced, GM's existing Ultium Cells joint venture with LG Energy Solution has already produced over 100 million battery cells at plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

Importantly, General Motors assures that future vehicles equipped with these new LMR prismatic cells will maintain capabilities such as rapid DC fast-charging and will also be covered by the existing 100,000-mile battery warranty, ensuring that cost savings do not come at the expense of core EV necessities.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chevrolet-silverado-ev.png,N,,2025-05-18 21:01:59.083302

This week, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 Global EV Outlook, in which it projects that the share of plug-in car sales in the U.S. will increase from 10% today to 20% in 2030. That may sound like healthy growth—until you consider what the IEA had expected before the newly elected Republican trifecta began dismantling pro-EV policies.

In last year’s report, the organization estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would make up 55% of U.S. car sales by the end of the decade. Even in that rosier scenario, China would still be eating America’s lunch by a wide margin. Now, it won’t even be close.

From day one of President Donald Trump’s second term, the IEA notes, it became U.S. policy to “eliminate subsidies and other policy measures influencing markets in favour of EVs.” Here’s a quick recap of where things stand.

Congress is in the early stages of repealing the $7,500 clean-car tax credit, a key driver of EV affordability and sales. The Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency are each expected to relax tailpipe-pollution regulations that push automakers to clean up their fleets. There’s an effort underway to strip California of its ability to set an EV sales mandate, a framework that 11 other states and Washington, D.C. follow. And the federal government has effectively frozen billions of dollars in funding intended to beef up the nation’s charging infrastructure.

Meanwhile, China has already created the infrastructure and industry required for rapid EV sales growth. The IEA now projects that EVs and PHEVs will make up 80% of the country’s car sales by 2030, thanks to improvements in vehicle affordability, policies that make them cheaper to buy and government support for building out charging stations. This year, the IEA revised up its 2030 EV outlook for China by around 14 percentage points.

Europe is projected to leave America in its dust too, with an electric share of sales nearing 60%.

Other researchers who watch this space now see a similarly stunted trajectory for the U.S. EV sector, at least compared to what could have been.

In an April report, the International Council on Clean Transportation found that eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for EV buyers and manufacturers would depress plug-in car sales by 1.1 million units in 2030. It also projected that an IRA repeal would cost the U.S. 130,000 jobs across the vehicle manufacturing, battery and charging industries by that year.

Having a vibrant EV industry isn’t just about selling more clean cars or cutting planet-warming emissions. America’s competitiveness is at stake too, said Peter Slowik, the ICCT’s U.S. passenger vehicles lead and a co-author of the report.

“Long term, we will get to 100% [zero-emission vehicles]. And the question is: Who will be the winners and who will be the losers?,” he told InsideEVs. “When we do get to 100%, are U.S. vehicles going to be a bunch of imports from European automakers and China automakers and automakers from elsewhere? Or will we be able to preserve or even increase our market share?”

The ICCT still expects U.S. electric car sales to grow—albeit more modestly—in a no-IRA scenario, with demand propelled mainly by declining vehicle costs and technological improvements. ""There will be no turning back, even if incentives went away,"" Slowik said.

But the rest of the world isn’t sitting still. EV sales globally are projected to skyrocket, no matter who sits in the White House or how they feel about electric cars.

This year, the IEA expects a record 20 million plug-in car sales worldwide, accounting for around 25% of overall sales. By 2030, that number should hit 40 million—28 million EVs and 12 million PHEVs—or over 40% of global sales.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P306OA/s1/ford-f-150-lightning-mustang-mach-e.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 23:03:23.130195

However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.
The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.
While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles.
""We feel good about where pricing is versus where we started the year, so we've assumed things remain constant from here,"" Jacobson said, according to Inside EVs.","Inside EVs reported that General Motors is not planning to raise prices due to the current administration's tariff policies.

""We now expect pricing to be relatively consistent for the remainder of the year."" GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated, according to the report.

This announcement is surprising. Several of GM's EVs are assembled in Mexico, so the company is bracing for a huge cost impact in the billions of dollars. However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.

The article cites that the Equinox EV is currently the most affordable EV in the U.S. and that GM credits its Mexico build location for keeping costs so low. The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.

GM said it is expecting a $4 billion to $5 billion impact based on the current tariff policy, affecting imports from Korea, Mexico, and Canada. It plans to offset some of the costs with ""self-help initiatives"" and increased U.S. production of battery components, according to the report.

Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV has environmental and financial benefits. EVs do not produce air pollution that contributes to the warming of the planet, so it is a more eco-friendly transportation choice. EV owners can say goodbye to rising, fluctuating gas prices, saving money over time.

Some EV skeptics cite the negative environmental effects that are a result of the pollution created during the battery manufacturing and charging process. While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles. Roughly 30 million tons of minerals are dug up annually for the more affordable energy transition to EVs, and these minerals can often be reused, further reducing the environmental impact.

Jacobson is confident that GM's wide EV lineup – from the $35,000 Equinox EV to the $130,000 Cadillac Escalade IQ – will help the company maintain pricing.

IRA Labor Policy The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment.
Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.
As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created.
Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.","“It’s unfathomable to us. Unfathomable. In the history of our union hall, 134 years, we’ve never even come close to these numbers.” Trent Mauk, a training specialist at the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) in Michigan, said these words to Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein just over a year ago.

Mauk was referring to the massive growth in membership the union experienced thanks to the construction of two new electric vehicle battery plants. These plants were a direct result of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022. Before the IRA, UA members had to travel for work and experienced long bouts of unemployment. After its implementation, their apprentice program jumped from fifty trainees to almost two hundred.

With its reputation as an ambitious climate bill, it’s easy to overlook the IRA’s role in creating opportunities for unions in the clean energy sector. The building trades, often unfairly portrayed as uniformly opposed to climate action, have seen a substantial number of real jobs materialize for their members. This has translated into more general political support for clean energy development.

Key components of this legislation are now under threat as Republicans close in on their goal to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a $4 trillion tax cut for the rich. Paying for this primarily through cutting social programs like Medicaid is proving politically complicated. Republicans are now setting their sights on IRA tax credits, many of which are directly responsible for creating union jobs, as an area for cuts in the budget reconciliation process.

Building trades unions have started to speak out in favor of maintaining IRA tax credits for clean energy. Salvaging as many of these unionized projects as possible will be important to lay the groundwork for progress in the future under more favorable political conditions. Beyond the bread-and-butter gains for union members, positive experiences on these jobs can garner deeper political buy-in for green jobs going forward.

With roughly 60 percent of proposed IRA projects located in Republican districts, the fight over the IRA presents an opening to build unlikely coalitions in places conventionally viewed as hostile toward progressive environmental policy.

State-level coalition work helped build momentum for the passage of the IRA in the first place, and states will continue to be important battlegrounds over the next four years. Labor unions have an opportunity to aggressively mobilize their membership to defend good jobs, and environmental activists should join them.

IRA Labor Policy

The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment. Instead, it relies on tax credits to entice private investment in clean energy development. Relying on capital to make investments for the public good is always a shaky gambit.

Despite these limitations, some of the tax credits were cleverly designed to encourage the use of union labor. Companies receive a 30 percent tax credit if they pay their workers a prevailing wage for their region. More importantly for the building trades, companies also need to hire a designated number of union apprentices. These apprentices receive paid classroom instruction and on-the-job training.

It’s hard to deny that the legislation, whatever its limits, has been putting union members to work. Ethan Link, assistant business manager for the Southeast Laborers’ District Council, told Heatmap that it’s been like “night and day” since the passage of the IRA. Solar developers are proactively reaching out to the union about working together on projects. This has set off a virtuous cycle where, as a result, the union is investing in more solar training for apprentices.

The Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council was able to double its apprenticeship program as a result of the IRA. Kent Miller, the union president, believes that IRA incentives made Wisconsin’s four biggest utilities agree to employ union labor on all future clean energy projects.

Similar examples can be found across the country, from the growth of union offshore wind jobs off the coast of New England to a slew of wind and solar projects in Illinois.

The tax credits supported over $220 billion in manufacturing investment, and manufacturing employment increased by about 750,000 during the Biden administration. In March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that construction job openings were up by 111,000 from last year.

The GOP Attacks, Labor Speaks Out

The early drafts of GOP budget proposals reveal a party intent on derailing this progress. The House Ways and Means Committee put forward a plan to begin phasing out the clean energy tax credits in 2029 and have them completely expire in 2032. Under the current IRA law, the tax credits would expire in 2035, but only if greenhouse gas emissions went below 25 percent of 2022 levels.

More perniciously, the proposal essentially kneecaps the tax credits by changing an important provision. Currently, a project only needs to begin construction by a certain year to qualify for the tax credit. But Republican lawmakers want to require that projects be “placed in service” before 2032.

This change will hurt nuclear and geothermal energy development the most, since these projects require long-term planning, investment, and construction. If anything, this proposal will benefit short-term solar developers, the sector Republicans claim to dislike the most. The Trump administration is further destroying its own stated ambitions for nuclear energy (which is heavily unionized) via its Department of Government Efficiency–inspired assault on the Department of Energy.

Divisions over the IRA among Republicans have been brewing for a while, however. Many GOP lawmakers cannot ignore the investment and job growth the bill has already brought to their states. In August, eighteen House Republicans sent a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson imploring him to leave the tax credits in place. Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.

As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created. Last month, the Maine Building and Construction Trades Council hosted a press conference to highlight the growth of clean energy jobs in the state and demand that Congress hold on to the tax credits.

According to the Maine Labor Climate Council, there are 145 utility-scale projects in operation or development across the state that are eligible for the tax credits. “Mainers across the state have benefited from these important investments, from ironworkers building wind farms in Aroostook County to electricians installing battery plants in Lincoln and Gorham to the many solar fields spread across the state,” said Kilton Webb, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 567.

James Harrison from the Utility Workers of America penned an op-ed in the Detroit News about the development of the region’s largest battery storage facility. The project shows that these jobs can maintain the standards of the fossil fuel jobs that came before them.

“The new clean energy jobs that are coming to our community need to be as good as the coal jobs were, with family-supporting wages and good benefits. I have hope that we can get there due to the historic clean energy investments that are coming through the Inflation Reduction Act,” Harrison wrote.

More union leaders are recognizing that the clean energy transition is not a pipe dream; it’s already creating jobs, and the IRA was the key. “My fellow members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 46 in Western Washington are buying their first homes or getting out of debt after a job on a new clean energy project,” wrote Nicole Grant, IBEW Local 46 political director in Washington, in the Seattle Times.

The IRA became a labor bill almost as much as a climate one. As divisions over the Republican budget continue, a window of opportunity has emerged to build a coalition of labor and environmentalists to defend union jobs. Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.

Through the tireless work of organizations like the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, powerful labor climate coalitions at the state level have formed over the last decade. Despite the unfavorable political environment nationally, states can continue to make progress toward the development of more unionized clean energy jobs. Activists can start now by working to preserve the best of the IRA.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/17173009/GettyImages-1244828341.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 23:03:30.597519

In his first term, President Trump raised the idea of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan — at one point raised to $2 trillion — but time after time grand announcements were followed by — nothing. “Infrastructure week” became a running joke.

However, the state of the nation’s infrastructure is no joke and there was a bipartisan desire to actually get something done after decades of neglect. Thus, in 2021, President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

Along with the Chips Act and the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, they formed the Holy Trinity of Bidenomics.

When President Trump returned to office in January he signed a pair of executive orders freezing selected grants under these programs. His “Unleashing American Energy” order was all about fossil fuels and an attempt to stop grants supporting renewable energy.

Angst and lawsuits followed. In April, federal Judge Mary McElroy ruled these grants had to be unfrozen. Executive orders can’t undo Congressional appropriations. Little by little, grants announced, but not obligated. started to move.

The backlog is substantial at more than 3,000 grants and Republicans have not missed the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration’s management.

For example, states were to receive $5 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations nationwide by 2030. As of February this year, when the Trump administration froze the program, $3.3 billion had been allocated but only $40 million had been spent and precious few chargers had been built.

Note that the president froze the electric vehicle charger program before he held a publicity event for Elon Musk’s Tesla cars on the White House lawn.

However, that program and many others are an illustration of the problems that now confront the Trump administration: Federal agencies that don’t cooperate; state governments that have varying degrees of competence and capacity; and the difficulty of working with a stew of local governments, private sector partners and local interest groups.

Rather than using the IIJA as a political cudgel to beat the already vanquished Biden administration, the Trump administration has an opportunity to demonstrate its managerial chops — though given its chaotic character no one should hold their breath.

It is also an opportunity for the president to take credit for any completed projects, which is a given.

At an “Infrastructure Week” event hosted last week by the American Society of Civil Engineers, West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, the chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, stressed the opportunity and challenge of implementing the IIJA.

High on her agenda is streamlining the permitting process, increasing the safety and reliability of surface transport and figuring out how to pay for a sustained effort to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure given that revenue from the federal gas tax is declining thanks to more fuel efficient cars and the increasing numbers of electric vehicles.

ASCE puts out an annual report grading the nation’s infrastructure, and in its March report there was good news and bad news. The good news is that the overall grade was the highest it has been since 1998. The bad news is that the grade is C.

Illinois has already received billions from the IIJA and should receive more. There is a good deal to do. The ASCE report notes that 41% of the roads in Illinois are rated as poor or fair condition and that its grades for roads, drinking water and transit systems are all D-.

Can we find the better bipartisan angels of our nature to get some work done?

This story was reported by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powerful interests stalling climate action.

As an ice storm slicked roads across eastern Michigan on February 6, representatives from four houses of worship arrived at the offices of Democratic US Sen. Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs. Powered by renewable energy, the hubs offered residents shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan—and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne executive director Steve Wasko says his organization—which provides meals, clothing, daycare, and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood—has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels, and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States—including in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia—that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills—a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for nonpayment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15 percent of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households—roughly 23 million people—struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major US cities, including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15 percent or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14 percent of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades, despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump’s administration has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored.

The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist—and perhaps even deepen. “The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see.

Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44 percent of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45 percent of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70 percent between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45 percent—and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods.

“I think 70 percent or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit. Programs in 24 states and Washington, DC, support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one—the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa—is dedicated to low- and medium-income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50 percent of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief—only 9 percent of it is shaded, compared to 20 percent of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate-income households. “We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand. “Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Los_Angeles_redlining.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-05-18 18:04:25.256216

According to a Wall Street Journal report, GM told staff in an internal email, “We need your help!”GM warned that aggressive emissions rules could hurt business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable. Employees were encouraged to contact senators using talking points aimed at revoking a waiver that lets California set its own stricter emissions standards.

How the Wheels Have Turned

That same California rule was once backed by GM, which had pledged to sell mostly electric vehicles by 2035. However, market conditions have shifted significantly since GM committed to that plan. EV demand has cooled considerably. Sales of electric vehicles fell 5% in April, while overall U.S. car sales jumped 10%, according to Motor Intelligence. EVs now make up just 7% of the market nationwide.

In California, the EV leader, zero-emission vehicles currently account for about 20% of new car sales, far below the 35% target the state set for 2026. Rising costs, fewer discounts, and the potential loss of federal tax credits make EVs less appealing to price-conscious buyers.

Even GM has had to dial back its ambitions. It scrapped its plan to build 400,000 EVs by mid-2024, delayed the launch of a new Buick EV, and postponed opening an electric truck factory. Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), and Toyota (TM) have also slowed their EV rollouts.

Carmakers Rally Against ‘Unrealistic’ EV Mandates

Still, GM says it’s committed to electric vehicles and continues to invest in new models. A company spokeswoman said GM supports one consistent emissions standard nationwide that considers actual market demand. The lobbying push included workers in Michigan and other key states where lawmakers’ offices reportedly had received calls from GM employees.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major carmakers, is backing GM’s stance. It warns that California’s goals are unrealistic and could lead to job losses.

Supporters of California’s waiver say the state’s geography and environmental challenges justify stricter rules. But some Democrats, even from states with the ban, are starting to push back. They say the timeline is too ambitious and burdens consumers.

As one Long Island Toyota and Lexus dealer put it, EVs remain out of reach without subsidies. “The customers just aren’t there.”

and analysis of the writer:

As the summer travel season kicks off, thousands of Arizonans are hitting the road, many in vehicles still running on dirty fossil fuels like gas and diesel. But many of us travel cleaner, quieter, and smarter thanks to electric vehicles. I’m one of them, and I can tell you firsthand: Once you experience the benefits of driving electric, there is no turning back.

While EVs are a key way to help Arizonans save money on fuel and maintenance, the current Trump administration has missed the opportunity to make these cost-saving solutions more accessible. Fortunately, the available federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) make it more affordable for consumers to switch to cleaner transportation, including up to $7,500 for qualifying EV purchases. I purchased my used pollution-free electric vehicle and proudly display my Arizona “Clean Air — Blue Skies” plate. It’s more than a license tag — it’s a sign of pride.

While these tax credits have helped people make the leap, these incentives, along with federal EV infrastructure grants from the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that support building out public charging stations in Arizona, are now in limbo. The grants, which include the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, are designed to make EV charging more accessible, reliable, and widespread.

Arizona was allocated $76.5M through the NEVI program, but the current administration’s funding pause is delaying key projects statewide and putting the next phase on hold. Some of the communities impacted by the delay include Payson, Show Low, Lake Havasu City, Maricopa, Overgaard, Fort McDowell, Page, Bisbee, Douglas, Sierra Vista, Superior, Wickenburg, and Bullhead City, among many others. These rural communities have long lacked EV charging stations. Located near highways and transit stops, these stations would serve historically disadvantaged areas and expand access to clean transportation. Without urgent leadership, Arizona risks losing momentum and leaving rural communities behind.

As more Americans consider switching to electric, we need confidence that a reliable charging network is growing with demand. I’ve noticed improvements in public charging recently, and networks opening up to other brands (like mine) has been a game-changer. But we’re not done yet.

In Arizona, where long commutes, rural highways, and range anxiety make EV infrastructure even more critical, these federal investments mark the difference between progress and falling behind. Ensuring consistent funding and timely rollout of charging stations is essential for building trust and making EV adoption more appealing.

Driving an EV helps me save money. In Green Valley, I power my home and charge my EV with solar panels — something the IRA also supports with a 30% IRA tax credit for installation. That means virtually no fuel costs, even as gas and electricity prices rise, especially during the hot summer. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, EV drivers can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years.

With smart planning tools like PlugShare and my car’s built-in navigation, I’ve taken 1,000-mile road trips with ease. The ride is smooth, the drive is quiet, and best of all, it’s affordable — plus, my wife and I feel good knowing we’re contributing to a cleaner, healthier future.

For those still hesitant about EVs, especially in rural areas, technology has made finding chargers easier than ever. However, expanding access depends on continued federal investment. With more support, charging could become second nature, no matter where you live. That’s why we need Arizona lawmakers to accelerate, not stall, funding for pollution-free vehicles and EV infrastructure.

Let’s not lose our momentum. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air 2025 report, 84% of Arizonans live in areas with unhealthy air — yet 62% of voters support investing in charging infrastructure and incentives to make electric vehicles more affordable.

As we celebrate National Clean Air Month, take advantage of IRA programs and tax credits that support cleaner air, healthier communities, and greater energy independence. Visit PlugInAmerica.org/arizona to learn more about pollution-free vehicles and EV tax credits.

They were scheduled to go to credit unions across the country to help people finance clean energy projects at home, like solar panels.

It’s the latest funding freeze from the Trump Administration.

As Kit Miller and her husband got closer to retirement, they started thinking about how to save money.

“We thought what are the costs we can control and one of them is the cost of energy,” she said.

They installed solar panels on their roof and watched their energy bills go down.

“We’re seeing a drop. Maybe 15 to 20%,"" she said.

She installed a solar energy system, paid for by a loan from Genesee Co-Op Federal Credit Union.

Dan Apfel, the credit union’s COO, says it’s part of a program helping small businesses and low-income homeowners make clean energy upgrades, which could lower their overall energy costs.

“The grant money we get to support lending,” said Apfel. ""It really can help make loans affordable for people so they can save money day one.”

The money is supposed to come from a $10 million grant from the EPA as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. But Apfel says those funds are now frozen.

“Unfortunately, the EPA and Lee Zeldin, they don’t want to disperse the money,” Apfel said. [They say] it doesn’t meet the current administrations polices. But we really think families can benefit from the money.”

Th GGRF was set up in 2022 as part of the inflation reduction act. It allocated $27 billion to the EPA for clean energy projects that would lower greenhouse gas emissions.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin released a video about cuts to the GGRF.

""We won't be funding left wing ideological pet projects like the past administration,” said Zelden in the video. ""Today, the Green New scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success.""

Genesee Co-Op is one of 108 credit unions across the county affected by the funding freeze. Currently, access to the money is tied up in court. An appellate court is expected to decide by late May whether EPA has the authority to terminate the awards. It’s a decision that could affect thousands.

“Higher income people have been able to afford this for a while through tax credits,” said Apfel. ""They can afford the cost of the loan but lower income people really haven’t been able to access this.”

The new fully electric version of the Escalade – a first for the iconic Cadillac nameplate – is a gilded beast, tricked out with every luxury feature you could desire. I’m not used to this much luxury in a car (but I could easily get used to it). I’m driving the Escalade IQ Luxury 2 for a week. The following is a brief first-take review.

Size: It’s a luxury yacht on wheels

As a yardstick, I’ll compare it to two other giant high-profile electric vehicles, the Cybertruck and GMC Hummer EV.

Tesla Cybertruck (AWD): ~18 feet (length) / 6,600-6,900 lbs (weight)

GMC Hummer SUV EV: ~16.4 feet / 8,500 to 9,000 pounds

2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ: ~18 feet (length) / 9,300+ lbs (weight)

Speed / torque: don’t let the size fool you

Before the IQ arrived, I had just finished a test drive of the Cadillac Optiq, a compact crossover EV at the other end of the size/weight spectrum. So, I expected a step down in speed and torque. Nope. Despite the 9,000 pound+ weight and three rows of seats, the IQ keeps up with the much smaller (5,000-pound) Optiq. That’s with the acceleration features toggled on (Velocity MAX and sport mode). That was a surprise considering its size. Cadillac says the IQ does 0-60 in under 5 seconds. I believe it now. It produces 750 hp and 785 lb.-ft. of torque with Velocity Max.

Goodbye range anxiety

The IQ is rated at 450 miles of range. I have never test driven an EV with this kind of range. It changes everything. No more ABCs (always-be-charging) – a state of mind that afflicts every EV driver. And, when you do need a charge, the charging rates are very fast based on my testing at Tesla Superchargers. GM estimates 100 miles of range in about 10 minutes at a public DC Fast Charging station. So far, I’ve been charging at between 300 and 350 miles, so I haven’t gotten the rates that GM publishes. (With EV charging, when the battery’s charge exceeds 70-80 percent, charging rates drop off.) But even when I charged from 350 to the max of 450, it was fast. As fast as the rates on a Lucid EV I drove last year.

Public Charging: Tesla Supercharger heaven

The Escalade IQ I have came with a Tesla NACS adapter. I’ve been charging exclusively at Tesla Supercharger stations. Pure plug-and-play, i.e., you plug in and it just works. As a rule, I avoid Electrify America (when I can) based on years of frustration.

Sumptuous luxury

Curved Pillar-to-Pillar LED Display: A 55-inch curved LED display makes navigating information much easier than other EVs I’ve tested.

AKG Studio Reference Audio System: The Escalade IQ offers an available 36-speaker AKG Studio Reference audio system.

Rear-Seat Entertainment: Dual 12.6-inch displays with streaming to keep rear passengers entertained.

Driving experience

Air Ride Adaptive Suspension & Magnetic Ride Control: this adjusts the vehicle’s height and damping for handling various driving conditions. And Four-Wheel Steering improves maneuverability at low speeds and stability at high speeds.

GM Super Cruise Vs Tesla Full Self Driving

I’ve tested the most recent Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) updates 3 times in the past two months on the new Tesla Model Y “Juniper"" and once on the Cybertruck. Tesla’s FSD is amazing. It’s basically a robotaxi = the driver is the passenger. The problem is, it’s not flawless. That always makes me a little nervous – and I’ve had few mishaps with FSD in the past. I like the middle ground that GM has settled on with Super Cruise. GM leaves the local driving to you while offering true hands-free driving on the highway. Once you’re on the highway, Super Cruise will handle steering, acceleration, braking, and lane changes. In my testing of the IQ’s Super Cruise on Los Angeles highways, it does 90 percent of the driving on 118, 405, and 5.

Why is Super Cruise important?

Think of Super Cruise as a tedium reliever. Let’s say you’re taking a long trip that involves hours of yawn-inducing highway driving. That’s where Super Cruise takes over. It does the dull driving for you. I know people who have resisted any kind of driver assist until I explain to them what it’s for. Then they actually try it and are immediate converts.

And that happens at every traffic light, every intersection… We are sure you have also wondered why you paid for something they sold you as a “wonder”. Well, we have good news for you: the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) wants to eliminate the federal incentives that pushed half the planet into having this annoying system that has nothing to do with protecting the environment, which is what they claimed at first.

This was announced by the EPA Administrator himself, Lee Zeldin, with a message that leaves no room for doubt: “Where your car dies at every traffic light so companies can boast about being eco-friendly… The EPA approved it, everyone hates it, so we are going to fix it”. That’s it. Here’s the full story!

What is Start-Stop and why does everyone hate it?

The invention was very simple: when the car stops, the engine turns off. As soon as you release the brake or press the accelerator, it starts again. The idea was to reduce emissions and save fuel, especially in the city. But does it really work? Most people hate it because it delays the reaction time for quick starts, the air conditioning loses power, and of course, the starter motor suffers more than it should. Not to mention that actual fuel savings are minimal.

Almost all cars come with this system enabled by default. So, if you don’t want to be “stopping and starting” at every light, you have to manually disable it every time you start the car. Annoying, right? Hence so many complaints.

Where does it come from?

This start-stop technology became popular supposedly to save fuel, and it spread across Europe and the United States during the Obama Administration. Although it was not mandatory to include it, its use became widespread because federal regulations incentivized its implementation in vehicles.

But… does it really save anything?

According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Start-Stop can reduce consumption by 7% to 26%, but beware: this depends on traffic conditions, and for the most part, it only saves fuel during city trips with frequent stops. If you drive on highways, the system is practically useless.

Why does the EPA want to eliminate it now?

This initiative from Zeldin is part of a broader review of the regulations affecting the automotive industry. Basically, they are looking to eliminate measures that, in practice, do not provide significant benefits to consumers.

On social media, the proposal has been met with applause. Most comments agree, appealing to common sense.

The beginning of the end for Start-Stop?

Hopefully. Although the system is not mandatory by law, federal incentives made almost all brands include it as standard, and it is very annoying. If the EPA removes those “bonuses,” manufacturers will likely stop installing it in large numbers.

However, Zeldin’s proposal has sparked a bigger debate: do these regulations really benefit the consumer? Isn’t it time to listen more to those who actually buy the cars?

For now, Start-Stop has its days numbered. And many drivers won’t miss it.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/epa-stop-start-rollback-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 12:10:44.236784

Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.","“It’s unfathomable to us. Unfathomable. In the history of our union hall, 134 years, we’ve never even come close to these numbers.” Trent Mauk, a training specialist at the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) in Michigan, said these words to Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein just over a year ago.

Mauk was referring to the massive growth in membership the union experienced thanks to the construction of two new electric vehicle battery plants. These plants were a direct result of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022. Before the IRA, UA members had to travel for work and experienced long bouts of unemployment. After its implementation, their apprentice program jumped from fifty trainees to almost two hundred.

With its reputation as an ambitious climate bill, it’s easy to overlook the IRA’s role in creating opportunities for unions in the clean energy sector. The building trades, often unfairly portrayed as uniformly opposed to climate action, have seen a substantial number of real jobs materialize for their members. This has translated into more general political support for clean energy development.

Key components of this legislation are now under threat as Republicans close in on their goal to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a $4 trillion tax cut for the rich. Paying for this primarily through cutting social programs like Medicaid is proving politically complicated. Republicans are now setting their sights on IRA tax credits, many of which are directly responsible for creating union jobs, as an area for cuts in the budget reconciliation process.

Building trades unions have started to speak out in favor of maintaining IRA tax credits for clean energy. Salvaging as many of these unionized projects as possible will be important to lay the groundwork for progress in the future under more favorable political conditions. Beyond the bread-and-butter gains for union members, positive experiences on these jobs can garner deeper political buy-in for green jobs going forward.

With roughly 60 percent of proposed IRA projects located in Republican districts, the fight over the IRA presents an opening to build unlikely coalitions in places conventionally viewed as hostile toward progressive environmental policy.

State-level coalition work helped build momentum for the passage of the IRA in the first place, and states will continue to be important battlegrounds over the next four years. Labor unions have an opportunity to aggressively mobilize their membership to defend good jobs, and environmental activists should join them.

IRA Labor Policy

The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment. Instead, it relies on tax credits to entice private investment in clean energy development. Relying on capital to make investments for the public good is always a shaky gambit.

Despite these limitations, some of the tax credits were cleverly designed to encourage the use of union labor. Companies receive a 30 percent tax credit if they pay their workers a prevailing wage for their region. More importantly for the building trades, companies also need to hire a designated number of union apprentices. These apprentices receive paid classroom instruction and on-the-job training.

It’s hard to deny that the legislation, whatever its limits, has been putting union members to work. Ethan Link, assistant business manager for the Southeast Laborers’ District Council, told Heatmap that it’s been like “night and day” since the passage of the IRA. Solar developers are proactively reaching out to the union about working together on projects. This has set off a virtuous cycle where, as a result, the union is investing in more solar training for apprentices.

The Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council was able to double its apprenticeship program as a result of the IRA. Kent Miller, the union president, believes that IRA incentives made Wisconsin’s four biggest utilities agree to employ union labor on all future clean energy projects.

Similar examples can be found across the country, from the growth of union offshore wind jobs off the coast of New England to a slew of wind and solar projects in Illinois.

The tax credits supported over $220 billion in manufacturing investment, and manufacturing employment increased by about 750,000 during the Biden administration. In March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that construction job openings were up by 111,000 from last year.

The GOP Attacks, Labor Speaks Out

The early drafts of GOP budget proposals reveal a party intent on derailing this progress. The House Ways and Means Committee put forward a plan to begin phasing out the clean energy tax credits in 2029 and have them completely expire in 2032. Under the current IRA law, the tax credits would expire in 2035, but only if greenhouse gas emissions went below 25 percent of 2022 levels.

More perniciously, the proposal essentially kneecaps the tax credits by changing an important provision. Currently, a project only needs to begin construction by a certain year to qualify for the tax credit. But Republican lawmakers want to require that projects be “placed in service” before 2032.

This change will hurt nuclear and geothermal energy development the most, since these projects require long-term planning, investment, and construction. If anything, this proposal will benefit short-term solar developers, the sector Republicans claim to dislike the most. The Trump administration is further destroying its own stated ambitions for nuclear energy (which is heavily unionized) via its Department of Government Efficiency–inspired assault on the Department of Energy.

Divisions over the IRA among Republicans have been brewing for a while, however. Many GOP lawmakers cannot ignore the investment and job growth the bill has already brought to their states. In August, eighteen House Republicans sent a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson imploring him to leave the tax credits in place. Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.

As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created. Last month, the Maine Building and Construction Trades Council hosted a press conference to highlight the growth of clean energy jobs in the state and demand that Congress hold on to the tax credits.

According to the Maine Labor Climate Council, there are 145 utility-scale projects in operation or development across the state that are eligible for the tax credits. “Mainers across the state have benefited from these important investments, from ironworkers building wind farms in Aroostook County to electricians installing battery plants in Lincoln and Gorham to the many solar fields spread across the state,” said Kilton Webb, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 567.

James Harrison from the Utility Workers of America penned an op-ed in the Detroit News about the development of the region’s largest battery storage facility. The project shows that these jobs can maintain the standards of the fossil fuel jobs that came before them.

“The new clean energy jobs that are coming to our community need to be as good as the coal jobs were, with family-supporting wages and good benefits. I have hope that we can get there due to the historic clean energy investments that are coming through the Inflation Reduction Act,” Harrison wrote.

More union leaders are recognizing that the clean energy transition is not a pipe dream; it’s already creating jobs, and the IRA was the key. “My fellow members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 46 in Western Washington are buying their first homes or getting out of debt after a job on a new clean energy project,” wrote Nicole Grant, IBEW Local 46 political director in Washington, in the Seattle Times.

The IRA became a labor bill almost as much as a climate one. As divisions over the Republican budget continue, a window of opportunity has emerged to build a coalition of labor and environmentalists to defend union jobs. Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.

Through the tireless work of organizations like the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, powerful labor climate coalitions at the state level have formed over the last decade. Despite the unfavorable political environment nationally, states can continue to make progress toward the development of more unionized clean energy jobs. Activists can start now by working to preserve the best of the IRA.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/17173009/GettyImages-1244828341.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 03:00:03.935441

The EPA said on Wednesday it will weaken some of the limits that were put in place under former President Joe Biden last year to minimize PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Precautions experts suggest taking

“The news of weakening the PFAS regulations was truly a betrayal to all communities,” Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist with the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG), told Nexstar. “Nobody wants PFAS in their drinking water, and it’s important for everyone to voice their concern to their elected officials that rolling back drinking water protections is harmful.”

Stoiber added that, while regulatory mandates may shift, it’s always good to know what is in your drinking water. People who get their water from a private well may want to get their water tested, Stoiber said, especially if the home is near an area with PFAS contamination.

Residents who get their drinking water from a municipal supply can also have it tested, either by a county health department or a state-certified laboratory, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Homeowners can call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or by visiting www.epa.gov/safewater/labs for additional testing resources.

Stoiber and others at EWG have been maintaining a ZIP code-searchable database with the environmental group’s findings from samples collected between 2021 and 2023.

“Once you know what contaminants are in your water, it will help you to select an effective water filter,” Stoiber said. “One of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce your exposure to environmental contamination is to filter your drinking water. Reverse osmosis and activated carbon filters are most effective for removing PFAS.”

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science has advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels has become clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

“One hundred percent, California is targeted,” said Mary Creasman, chief executive of the nonprofit California Environmental Voters.
Cliff Rechtschaffen, a member of the California Air Resources Board, believes the president is targeting the state in part because of its special authority.
While the Clean Air Act issue is complicated, other battles may be simpler.
Beyond defending itself in the courtroom, California can also use legislation to go on the offensive, according to Creasman, of California Environmental Voters.","Less than six months into his second term as president, Donald Trump has initiated or proposed more than 150 actions that experts say are detrimental to the environment, which range from cancelling climate grant programs to loosening regulations that govern air and water quality.

Many of these actions have been part of the president’s larger goals of reining in government spending, increasing energy independence and restructuring federal agencies. But some also appear to target one state in particular: California.

Long known as a nationwide leader in climate and environmental policy, the Golden State has been in Trump’s crosshairs since his first administration, when he sparred with Gov. Gavin Newsom over issues such as forest and water-supply management. In recent months, Trump has escalated his California-specific efforts, including vowing to block the state’s ability to set strict tailpipe emission standards — a battle that has wound all the way up to the Senate.

Many of the president’s actions in the first 100 or so days of this administration have not only called out California by name, but also disproportionately targeted it. A leaked list of pending program cuts from the Department of Energy includes 53 projects in California — more than any other state — as well as more projects in blue states than red ones.

In April, the president named California in an executive order directing the Department of Justice to seek out and “stop the enforcement of” state laws that address climate change, in which he described California’s first-of-its-kind cap-and-trade program as an unfair means of punishing businesses for their use of fossil fuels.

Experts say it’s not surprising that the president is coming for California’s environmental progress. Trump received record donations from oil and gas companies during his campaign. Meanwhile, California, a Democratic stronghold, has set aggressive climate targets that seek to limit those industries and transition the state to carbon neutrality by 2045.

“One hundred percent, California is targeted,” said Mary Creasman, chief executive of the nonprofit California Environmental Voters. “It’s along the same lines as everything we have seen from this president: political retaliation at every turn toward anybody who disagrees with him on anything — and California disagrees with him on a lot.”

But California also has the tools, means and motivation to to fight back, Creasman and others said, including through litigation and legislation.

Already, the state has filed or joined nearly 50 legal actions against the current administration, at least seven of which pertain to the environment.

Among them is a lawsuit challenging the president’s declaration of a national energy emergency, which calls for for increased fossil fuel production, waived environmental reviews and the fast-tracking of projects in potentially sensitive ecosystems and habitats.

“These procedures misuse authorities meant for disaster response and bypass important health and environmental protections for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta wrote in a statement about that case.

Bonta has also joined a lawsuit against the administration’s plans to freeze federal funding for a number of programs that Trump has disparaged as “woke,” including environmental measures. Other suits challenge attempts to claw back funding for the construction of electric vehicle charging stations across the country; wind energy development; and the AmeriCorps program that deploys young people to disaster-relief organizations.

The California attorney general has also joined a motion to defend the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical-accident safety rules from state and federal efforts to weaken or repeal it, and has signed onto an amicus brief opposing mass federal layoffs at agencies such as the EPA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

State lawmakers — including Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla — have thrown their hats in the ring as well, penning letters to the heads of various agencies in opposition to climate grant cuts at the EPA, the closure of the federal disaster tracking system and other issues.

Such challenges are a critical line of defense for California and other states working to preserve climate progress, said Pete Maysmith, president of the League of Conservation Voters, a D.C.-based nonprofit advocacy group.

“We have to litigate, we have to organize, we have to win elections,” Maysmith said. “We need our champs in Congress — many of whom call California home — to stand up and fight against things like trying to revoke the clean air waiver that California has had for 50 years.”

Indeed, the battle over clean air waivers is among the state’s most ferocious fights so far.

For decades, California has been granted special authority to set its own vehicle-emission standards by utilizing waivers issued by the EPA. Clean Air Act waivers have been fundamental to the state’s efforts to limit greenhouse gases and transition to electric vehicles, such as its ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

But Trump has moved to block the state’s authority to do so, and earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives agreed with him. Now the battle is set for a vote in the Senate, which could happen as soon as this week.

Cliff Rechtschaffen, a member of the California Air Resources Board, believes the president is targeting the state in part because of its special authority.

“I think California stands out because we are the leader on so many things, including our clean car and zero-emission vehicle standard,” Rechtschaffen said. Should California lose the Senate battle, the state will challenge it in the court system, he said.

California can achieve a similar outcome without the waivers, Rechtschaffen said, such as raising registration fees or imposing taxes on heavily polluting vehicles — a tactic deployed in Norway that resulted in nearly all new cars purchased there last year being electric vehicles.

California could also consider instituting a statewide “indirect source” rule that would require ports and other facilities to limit pollution in the surrounding area, which could, for example, compel trucking companies using those ports to deploy low- or no-emissions vehicles.

While the Clean Air Act issue is complicated, other battles may be simpler. That includes Trump’s bid to halt the state’s cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and allows them to sell “credits” for unused emissions to other companies.

Experts say he does not actually have the authority to end California’s program.

“It’s not really something that Trump or the attorney general can do. If you want to stop the enforcement of state law, you have to go to court, and that’s the jurisdiction of the court,” Maggie Coulter, a senior attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, said about the executive order.

Rechtschaffen agreed, noting that the state does not need federal authority to maintain a cap-and-trade program. Neither the EPA nor Congress has created a national cap-and-trade program that preempts state programs, “so it’s completely lawful under state law, and I don’t see anything under current federal law that would threaten our program,” he said.

Beyond defending itself in the courtroom, California can also use legislation to go on the offensive, according to Creasman, of California Environmental Voters.

The state is already flexing its legislative strength with two 2023 laws slated to go into effect next year. Senate Bills 253 and 261 will require large corporations that do business in California to measure and publicly disclose their carbon emissions. Creasman said the laws leverage California’s market size to help push national policy, and could be a model for similar efforts in the future.

Another law winding through the state legislature, Senate Bill 684 — known as the “Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act” — would require fossil fuel polluters to pay for their share of damages and disasters caused by their emissions. The funds would be put toward projects and programs to prepare for and respond to climate change.

“As we see the federal government starting to shrink resources, ‘Polluters Pay’ is a really important mechanism,” Creasman said.

Should the federal government succeed at rolling back protections under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and other rules, California could also consider a concept known as “trigger laws” to restore state standards set under the previous administration, Creasman said.

Trigger laws become enforceable only by specific events or conditions. One recent prominent example was when several states used the laws to trigger immediate abortion bans in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.

This combination of weapons in California’s arsenal — litigation, legislation and a large economy — mean California can mount a good defense when it comes to the environment, Creasman added.

“The issues related to resiliency persist regardless of where they can be tied to climate change,” Vander Woude said.
“We’re focusing on the end result, not any ideological issues.” NIRPC deals with local priorities as well as federal priorities, Vander Woude said.","Trump administration edicts were woven like a thread through Thursday’s Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission meeting as the commissioners weighed how to continue pursuing local governments’ values without jeopardizing grants.

Director of Transportation Tom Vander Woude ran through changes in an update of last year’s Unified Planning Work Program, which outlines information about transportation spending. Among the language changes were removing tasks associated with climate change. And rather than referencing executive orders that relate to issues like environmental justice, the document now refers to the original legislation that prompted the executive orders that had been issued.

President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders so far this year have reversed previous presidential edicts aimed at preventing climate change or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

Gary Councilwoman Lori Lathan, newly appointed to the commission, kick-started a discussion of how the agency can continue to push for things like air quality improvement without referring to climate change or otherwise running afoul of Trump’s edicts.

“When they say advice, is that something that we’re required to make those changes,” she asked.

“Do we have to do them? Yes, we kind of do,” Vander Woude said, because those federal agencies oversee grants.

Various memos and formal communications with the U.S. Department of Transportation, all contracts and grant agreements have to comply with the new standards, he said.

Latham asked why the NIRPC document approved Thursday would refer to the legislation instead of executive orders.

The executive order related to environmental justice, for example, was rooted in civil rights legislation from the 1970s, Vander Woude said, so the document can refer to discrimination based on that legislation.

Congress makes laws; executive orders deal with how agencies implement them but don’t reverse the laws themselves.

Regarding climate change, NIRPC will focus on air quality rather than climate change.e

Under the Biden administration, there had been a movement for greenhouse gas analysis, but that since has been stopped by the Trump administration, so NIRPC and other agencies can’t do that anymore, Vander Woude said.

If organizations like NIRPC can’t enact programs to protect constituents, who will, Beverly Shores Town Council President David Phelps asked.

Lake County Surveyor Bill Emerson Jr., who chairs NIRPC’s Environmental Committee, said a resolution proposed by his committee and unanimously adopted at the meeting addresses this issue.

The resolution, on page 380 of a massive agenda packet for the meeting, noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had announced the cancellation of over 400 grants, the effects of which are still being figured out.

The resolution says NIRPC “reaffirms its commitment to protecting and improving environmental quality of life in Northwest Indiana including, but not limited to, improving air quality including greenhouse gas reduction, community tree planting initiatives, brownfield redevelopment, environmental justice capacity planning and natural hazards readiness planning.”

Vander Woude said even though the bulk of NIRPC’s work involves channeling federal funds for local governments in Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties, the agency also serves as a council of governments.

NIRPC can still pursue those activities without using federal funds to do so, Executive Director Ty Warner said.

Impacts like resiliency, previously directly tied to climate change, can still be examined. “The issues related to resiliency persist regardless of where they can be tied to climate change,” Vander Woude said. “You can deal with the impact; you can’t necessarily draw it back to that.”

That’s getting the job done without semantics getting in the way, Porter County Council President Andy Vasquez said.

“I think that’s exactly what we’re trying to do,” Vander Woude said. “We can describe it in various ways, but ultimately it’s about moving forward our vision, our values.”

“I think we’re going to have to be creative if we’re going to maintain our environmental justice and social justice focus,” Chesterton Councilman Jim Ton said. “If you don’t proceed with some of this, it’s going to be gone forever.”

That’s focusing on the end result without attributing it to causes, Warner said. “We’re focusing on the end result, not any ideological issues.”

NIRPC deals with local priorities as well as federal priorities, Vander Woude said. “We’re responsive to both.”

“I personally don’t see substantial changes in the actual work being done,” he said.

Lake County Councilman Randall Niemeyer urged the commission to focus on the nuts and bolts and stay out of the weeds on this issue. “It’s more window dressing than anything with the rhetoric,” he said. Focus on projects that have good results for the region, he said.

May 18, 2025 - By Mark Olalde - Days after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency sent an email to the entire workforce with details about the agency’s plans to close diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and included a plea for help.

“Employees are requested to please notify” the EPA or the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s human resources agency, “of any other agency office, sub-unit, personnel position description, contract, or program focusing exclusively on DEI,” the email from then-acting Administrator James Payne said.

No employees in the agency, then more than 15,000 people strong, responded to that plea, ProPublica learned via a public records request.

Trump has made ending diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs a hallmark effort of his second term. Many federal employees, however, are declining to assist the administration with this goal. He signed an executive order on his first day back in office that labeled DEI initiatives — which broadly aim to promote greater diversity, largely within the workplace — as “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” and ordered them halted. His pressure campaign to end DEI efforts has also extended to companies and organizations outside the government, with billions of dollars in federal funding for universities frozen as part of the fight.

Corbin Darling retired from the EPA this year after more than three decades with the agency, including managing environmental justice programs in a number of Western states.

“I’m not surprised that nobody turned in their colleagues or other programs in response to that request,” he said, adding that his former co-workers understood that addressing pollution that disproportionately impacted communities of color was important to the agency’s work. “That’s part of the mission — it has been for decades,” Darling said.

Payne’s note to agency employees listed two email addresses — one belonging to the EPA and one to the Office of Personnel Management — where EPA employees could send details about DEI efforts. ProPublica submitted public records requests to both agencies for the contents of the inboxes from the start of the administration through April 1.

The Office of Personnel Management didn’t respond to the request, although the Freedom of Information Act requires that it do so within 20 business days. The agency also did not answer questions about whether it received any reports to its anti-DEI inbox.

The EPA, meanwhile, checked its inbox and confirmed that zero employees had filed reports. “Some emails received in that inbox did come from EPA addresses but none of them called out colleagues who were still working on DEI matters,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement in May.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“The optimist in me would like to believe that maybe it is because, as an agency, we are generally dedicated to our mission and understand that DEIA is intrinsic in that,” a current EPA employee who requested anonymity said. “On the flip side, they’ve done such a good job immediately dismantling DEIA in the agency that folks who are up in arms might have just been assuaged.”

Although DEI programs are often internal to a workplace, the administration also put a target on environmental justice initiatives, which acknowledge the fact that public health and environmental harm disproportionately fall on poorer areas and communities of color. Environmental justice has been part of the EPA’s mandate for years but greatly expanded under the Biden administration.

Research has shown, for example, that municipalities have planted fewer trees and maintained less green space in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of people of color, leading to more intense heat. And heavy industry has often been zoned or sited near Latino, Black and Native American communities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was confirmed in late January, has boasted about cutting more than $22 billion in environmental justice and DEI grants and contracts. “Many American communities are suffering with serious unresolved environmental issues, but under the ‘environmental justice’ banner, the previous administration’s EPA showered billions on ideological allies, instead of directing those resources into solving environmental problems and making meaningful change,” he wrote in an April opinion piece in the New York Post.

The EPA spokesperson said employees with more than 50% of their duties dedicated to either environmental justice work or DEI were targeted for layoffs. The agency “is taking the next step to terminate the Biden-Harris Administration’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Environmental Justice arms of the agency,” the spokesperson said.

EPA environmental justice offices worked on a range of initiatives, such as meeting with historically underserved communities to help them participate in agency decision-making and dispersing grants to fund mitigation of the carcinogenic gas radon or removal of lead pipes, Darling explained.

“A sea change isn’t the right word because it’s more of a draining of the sea,” Darling said. “It has devastated the program.”

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, and nine of their House Republican colleagues are calling on Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith to save the clean energy tax credits passed under the Inflation Reduction Act. We agree — repealing these tax credits is a direct threat to Iowa’s economy, workforce, and energy security.

Here in Iowa, those very same clean energy tax credits are already delivering results. They’re helping small businesses in Fairfield cut costs, giving farmers near Ames tools to improve their bottom line, and training electricians in Sioux City for high-skilled, good-paying jobs. They’re putting solar panels on barns, boosting local economies, and keeping family energy bills manageable — all while building a more stable power grid.

A recent study commissioned by the Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits will support more than 2,300 jobs in Iowa every year through 2032 — that’s $116 million in wages and nearly $240 million added to our state’s economy annually. And these jobs aren’t just short-term. They include long-term careers in manufacturing, engineering, transportation, and energy operations for Iowans.

A repeal of the clean energy tax credits would undo our progress. It would mean higher costs for families and businesses — projecting a 7% to 10% increase in energy bills by 2026, according to national projections. It would slow job growth, shrink opportunity, and make us more reliant on the same fossil fuel volatility that’s cost Iowa consumers and businesses dearly in the past.

When you combine clean energy with traditional power sources, you get lower costs, fewer price spikes, and more energy resilience in times of extreme weather that strain our power grid. The clean energy tax credits help to make this resilience and economic prosperity happen; it’s about having a diverse energy mix that works better for everyone while boosting local economies.

Clean energy is now one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country and it’s helping keep young people in Iowa by offering skilled, meaningful work in their own communities. These investments are not red or blue. They’re just smart policy.

We know how to lead here in Iowa. We’ve led the country in wind energy, 13 GW, and are now charting a path forward in solar, storage, and other technologies. We innovate. We adapt to emerging technologies that uplift working families. And when we see something that’s improving the lives of our neighbors, families, and friends, we don’t tear it down — we build on it.

This is a critical moment to continue building for the future. Congress has the power to either preserve the momentum we’ve created and safeguard clean energy tax credits that enable Iowa to prosper or send our state back to a time with more expensive energy and fewer job opportunities for young Iowans, and shrink a burgeoning high-skilled industry. We urge Iowa’s representatives to protect these tax credits, support our clean energy workers, and keep Iowa’s economy charging forward.

Half of China's heavy truck sales could transition to electric vehicles by 2028, a significant increase from the projected 10% in 2024. This insight was shared by Zeng Yuqun, chairman of battery manufacturer CATL, during a recent heavy-truck battery-swapping event, as reported by the Shanghai government-affiliated news site Jiemian. For more details, visit the full report here.

The advancement in electric heavy trucks is expected to further reduce fuel demand in the trucking sector, which has already seen a shift with the rise of LNG trucks in China. CATL has recently inaugurated a 60 gigawatt-hour energy storage and EV battery manufacturing base in Shandong, marking its first such facility in northern China. This development is part of a broader strategy to create an energy industry battery cluster in the region, valued at billions of yuan.

According to data from the IndexBox platform, the global electric vehicle market is experiencing rapid growth, with China leading the charge in both production and adoption. The strategic initiatives in Shandong align with the province's goal to establish a 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) lithium battery industry, covering the full spectrum from electrode materials to battery assembly.
