For many years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has provided transparent and credible public information about climate pollution from some of the largest sources nationwide. It provides the foundational data we need to protect people from climate change and all its ensuing damages – from worsening floods, fires and heat waves, to rising insurance costs – but the Trump EPA has proposed getting rid of it.

Today EPA held a hearing for the public to comment on that proposal. Three EDF staff members testified, including Senior Attorney Edwin LaMair.

“Since its inception a decade and a half ago, the [Greenhouse Gas] Reporting Program has provided comprehensive information that is foundational to effective climate policy and the protection of public health and welfare … its data underpin[s] key EPA policies – including standards for power plants, oil and gas facilities, and landfills,” said LaMair in his testimony. “Eliminating or delaying reporting would obscure pollution from public view, eroding confidence in emissions reductions ... We strongly oppose EPA’s proposal.”

This is not the first time the Trump EPA has attacked the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Earlier this year, Administrator Lee Zeldin shut down the program’s reporting portal for over a month without explanation and then unlawfully tried to delay the deadlines for companies to report their climate pollution. EDF filed a lawsuit challenging those actions. The Trump administration also refused to release this year’s U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory – an annual accounting of pollution that uses Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data. EDF got those documents through the Freedom of Information Act and made them publicly available on our website.

What the 2026 and 2028 Elections Mean for Clean Energy Clean energy will likely be a major issue in the 2026 midterm elections, in which Republicans will be defending narrow margins in both the House and Senate.
If Democrats take control of either the House or the Senate, or both, the accelerated expiration dates of some clean energy tax credits could be reversed.
The results of this election will most certainly determine the longer-term future of clean energy tax credits.

On one hand, the OBBBA expanded the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) and made permanent both opportunity zones (OZ) and new markets tax credits (NMTC). On the other, the OBBBA accelerated expiration dates for many clean energy tax credits that were either created or enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and greatly expanded foreign entities of concern (FEOC) restrictions. Navigating the new FEOC rules, which generally takes effect Jan. 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers, poses a major challenge for developers who have relied on components for clean energy facilities made by companies with ties to a “covered nation,” or are based in or involved with companies based in one of these nations, a list that includes China.

Through an executive order issued July 7, President Donald Trump directed Treasury to take prompt action to strictly enforce the termination of the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for wind and solar facilities within 45 days, including issuing beginning of construction (BOC) guidance. In response, on Aug. 15, the Internal Revenue Service issued Notice 2025-42 that prospectively narrows the BOC definition for solar and wind projects and limits the availability of prior rules. The announcement was better than many feared after President Trump’s executive order.

The pivot in direction following the passage of the IRA, which widely expanded clean energy tax subsidies, to the narrowing and repeals contained in OBBBA highlights the dramatic effect elections can have on tax policy. Depending on the outcomes of the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections, the United States could either continue with a pared-back approach to renewable energy incentives or abruptly reverse course and once again expand clean energy incentives.

Key Provisions of the OBBBA

Surviving Technologies

The OBBBA wasn’t bad news for all clean energy technologies, as several non-solar/wind technologies survived relatively unscathed or were even mildly enhanced. For example, energy storage, geothermal, hydro, biogas and renewable and natural gas were relatively unscathed. Fuel cell property was given eligibility under IRC Section 48E, regardless of emissions. The nuclear power PTC was given a three-step phasedown after the previous expiration date and the clean fuel PTC was extended by two years to 2029. The legislation retains the transferability and elective pay provisions used to monetize clean energy tax credits. One change, however, was that energy credits cannot be transferred to a specified foreign entity (SFE) under the new

FEOC restrictions.

Incentives Facing Accelerated Expiration

The harshest news from the OBBBA came with early sunset dates for clean energy incentives for automobiles, homes and commercial buildings. Vehicle acquisition credits under Sections 30D, 25E and 45W expired Sept. 30, 2025. For owner-occupied homes, credits for residential clean energy property (Section 25D) and energy-efficient improvements (Section 25C) remain available through Dec. 31, 2025. Meanwhile, credits for vehicle refueling infrastructure (Section 30C) and commercial buildings and new homes (Sections 179D and 45L) are set to expire June 30, 2026.

Solar and Wind Facilities

Under OBBBA, to qualify for the investment and production tax credits, solar and wind facilities must generally be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027. However, under a transition rule, projects that begin construction by July 4, 2026, retain eligibility for these clean energy tax incentives if placed in service by the end of the calendar year four years later. This transition rule highlights the importance of the definition of BOC, as modified by IRS

Notice 2025-42.

First, the revised rules contained in Notice 2025-42 do not apply to properties that began construction (as determined under prior guidance) before Sept. 2, 2025. Those properties may continue to rely on the more liberal prior BOC guidance.

For all other solar and wind facilities that begin construction on or after Sept. 2, 2025, the 5% safe harbor is now limited to solar systems that are 1.5MW or less. This means the physical work test is the sole BOC test for most facilities that began construction on or after Sept. 2, 2025.

Under the physical work test a taxpayer must “maintain a continuous program of construction.” A safe harbor exists where the continuity requirement is deemed to be satisfied by placing an applicable wind or solar facility in service by the end of the fourth calendar year after the calendar year in which construction began. For example, if construction began on Aug. 20, 2025, the wind or solar facility is deemed to satisfy the continuity requirement if it is placed in service by Dec. 31, 2029.

The 5% safe harbor test had been available to determine BOC for investment and production tax credit eligibility since 2013. The 5% safe harbor is now available only for low-output solar facilities, which are properties with nameplate capacity of no more than 1.5 megawatts (MW) alternating current (AC). Two or more solar facilities with integrated operations must aggregate their capacities for this test, making it more difficult to stay under the 1.5 MW limit. (Note: Most apartment buildings with solar panels fall well below the 1.5 MW standard, often featuring only about 10% of that nameplate capacity. That means they can generally still use the 5% safe harbor.)

Notice 2025-42 provides additional guidance on the physical work test. The notice largely retains existing standards, requiring that physical work of a significant nature be performed, and focuses on the nature of the work performed, not the amount or the cost. There is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required. Examples of what constitutes “significant physical work” are included in the notice.

Qualifying Physical Work and Continuity Requirements

For wind properties, “significant physical work” includes such on-site work as excavation for foundations, setting anchor bolts, pouring concrete pads and the on-site assembly of turbines and tower units. For solar properties, it includes the installation of racking or other structures to affix to the site panels, collectors or solar cells. For both wind and solar, qualifying off-site physical work includes the manufacturing of custom components that would not be held in inventory, including such things as transformers, inverters, racking and mounting equipment.

As noted above, the guidance confirmed that work must be continuous and provided two paths to qualify:

place the project in service within four calendar years after the calendar year BOC was met, or

if the project is placed in service beyond the four-year window, be able to somehow substantiate continuous work. Certain excusable disruptions include specific weather events, natural disasters and permitting delays.

Other Eligibility Timelines and Strategic Planning

For other technologies that qualify for the tech-neutral PTC or ITC–such as battery storage–there was more grace in the OBBBA. The current credit amounts will generally remain for those technologies that begin construction through 2033, dropping to 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035 and then going away beginning in 2036.

The obvious takeaway from the OBBBA and the BOC guidance is that wind and solar developers should start construction as soon as possible on as many facilities as is feasible within the parameters of the existing guidance. More specifically, begin construction by Dec. 31, 2025, to generally avoid the new material assistance FEOC rules and by July 4, 2026, to avoid the Dec. 31, 2027, placed-in-service deadline.

As issues arise in applying the BOC standards, additional guidance from the IRS could be forthcoming. Clean energy developers should also remember that the 5% safe harbor is provided for in Treasury guidance, not the statute, which means Treasury could further limit its availability for other technologies.

FEOC Considerations: Compliance Challenges Ahead

Treasury has yet to address FEOC, but such guidance is expected before the end of the year. Stakeholders expect challenges in meeting FEOC requirements, since so many components are made by companies with ties to China.

The OBBBA prohibits taxpayers from receiving “material assistance” from prohibited foreign entities. The definition of material assistance establishes initial minimum non-FEOC cost percentages. These minimum percentages vary based on technology and components and increase annually for most starting in 2026.

Taxpayers will need to document compliance with FEOC rules, including the minimum non-FEOC cost ratios. Documenting such compliance will be time consuming and expensive. (Novogradac is developing a service line to assist clients with that challenge, similar to documenting compliance with domestic content criteria.)

As clean energy developers seek components from manufacturers without ties to FEOC and compliant producers increase output, manufacturers with disqualifying foreign ties, particularly those supplying solar and wind projects, will face growing demand shortages.

Remaining Questions, Anticipated Guidance

The upcoming Treasury FEOC guidance is expected to include how entities will be identified and treated as prohibited foreign entities (PFEs) establish rules to prevent foreign-influenced entity (FIE) circumvention, provide guidance on preventing circumvention through contracts or licensing arrangements, clarify treatment of foreign-controlled entities and further define “effective control” and “material assistance,” including what constitutes BOC for the Dec. 31, 2025, deadline.

Treasury must also provide safe harbor tables and guidance to identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or the direct material cost of eligible components attributable to a PFE, with rules to determine the amount of material assistance from a PFE. It will additionally need to issue regulations to prevent circumvention of the guidelines through stockpiling products, components or subcomponents of eligible components during the period before the application of the material assistance requirements.

What the 2026 and 2028 Elections Mean for Clean Energy

Clean energy will likely be a major issue in the 2026 midterm elections, in which Republicans will be defending narrow margins in both the House and Senate. If Republicans continue to hold the House and Senate (Trump’s presidency isn’t scheduled to end until Jan. 20, 2029), there may be further reconciliation legislation that could more aggressively roll back the remaining clean energy tax incentives. If Democrats take control of either the House or the Senate, or both, the accelerated expiration dates of some clean energy tax credits could be reversed. In 2028, voters will elect the next president, as well as determine control of both chambers of Congress. The results of this election will most certainly determine the longer-term future of clean energy tax credits.

During the interim, clean energy stakeholders should actively communicate to members of Congress, Treasury and the IRS the impact of existing guidance and how future regulations can be most effective.

The clean energy sector is at a crossroads. The OBBBA and subsequent guidance underscore the urgency for developers and investors to act swiftly and strategically with the evolving regulatory terrain. While the rollback of certain incentives presents challenges, the mission remains unchanged: to build a cleaner, more resilient, more affordable energy future. The next three years will be pivotal. Engaging with Treasury, participating in working groups and educating policymakers are essential steps to ensure that clean energy remains a cornerstone of community development.",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2025-10-01 19:01:27.498320

Although the U.S. has been the world’s leading producer of crude oil and natural gas for several years running, Trump campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill.” For years, Trump has labeled climate change a “hoax” and has attacked plans to address climate change as wasteful.

Likewise, Project 2025 repeatedly called for an end to former President Joe Biden’s “war on fossil fuels.” The document accused Biden of denying Americans “cheaper and more abundant energy,” while wasting “hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies” on “unreliable renewables.”

There is scant mention in Project 2025 of the threats posed by climate change.

“You don’t see a concern for sea levels rising. You don’t see a concern for more frequent extreme weather. You don’t see any discussion of the catastrophic flooding that we’re seeing around the world. You don’t see any discussion of rising global temperatures,” David Graham, author of “The Project: How Project 2025 Is Reshaping America,” told NPR. “Instead, what you see is an argument that the U.S. is not doing enough to drill oil and gas.”

As he did in his first term, Trump has taken steps to withdraw from international climate agreements and rollback regulations, while moving to increase fossil fuel production on federal lands and waters.

But in his return to the White House, Trump has gone way beyond what he did in his first term. He has declared a national energy emergency, rescinded funding for green energy projects, and quickly moved to eliminate climate research and climate-focused offices and programs.

Perhaps symbolic of his second term, Trump is seeking to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and safety.

As we’ve written, the Obama-era endangerment finding is the legal foundation that allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles — that cause climate change. At the same time, the Trump administration is seeking to rollback new fuel economy standards that were adopted last year.

Project 2025 called on the EPA “to update the 2009 endangerment finding” and for the emissions standards to be repealed.

“It is not an overstatement to say that the Trump administration has launched the worst White House assault in history on the environment and public health,” Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, told Inside Climate News. “If this assault succeeds, it could take a generation or more to repair the damage.”

The Republican-controlled Congress has gone along with much of the administration’s actions, but it has pushed back on some of Trump’s efforts to defund scientific research.

Why it matters: The $7,500 tax credit was a significant incentive for qualifying buyers, but President Trump and congressional Republicans recently killed it.

Between the lines: Tesla factored federal discounts into its lease pricing for all of its models. Now that those discounts are gone, the company's hiking those prices to make up the difference, explains Kelley Blue Book.

The Model Y lease goes from a range of $479 to $529 to a range of $529 and $599, while the Model 3 goes from $349 to $699 to a range of $429 and $759, Reuters notes, citing a review of Tesla's website.

The intrigue: Tesla likely enjoyed a significant increase in demand late in the third quarter as consumers sought to get ahead of the tax credit's demise, according to William Blair analyst Jed Dorsheimer.

""As expected, the end of the EV tax credit has caused a pull-forward in demand, but it has been stronger than we originally estimated,"" Dorsheimer said in a research note.

Consensus estimates call for Tesla to report 443,000 EV deliveries when it releases its quarterly figures on Thursday, according to Dorsheimer.

Threat level: Tesla isn't the only automaker expected to take a hit from the end of the EV tax credits.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tuesday that he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if EV market share goes from a range of 10% to 12% in September to 5%, CNBC reported.

""I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,"" he said.

Hyundai Motor, meanwhile, is reportedly not ready to test the new EV economics. It's reducing the sticker price of its 2026 Ioniq 5 compact crossover models by up to $9,800, and continuing to offer customers a $7,500 cash incentive for 2025 models through October, per Automotive News.

Yes, but: Tesla investors don't seem too concerned as they focus on the company's roadmap to autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots.

The U.S. tax credit was introduced in 2022 under President Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
Since August 2023, the tax credit has also been available for used electric cars, provided they meet specific requirements to qualify for the subsidy.","As of today, the tax credit for purchasing electric cars, both new and used, has expired in the US. Some manufacturers are reportedly trying to extend the availability of subsidies through their dealers for a little longer.

As U.S. President Trump decided in the summer, the tax credits of $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles and $4,000 for the purchase of used electric cars will end on September 30.

According to information from the Reuters press agency, Ford and General Motors are attempting to persuade car dealers to sign up for financing programs to extend the $7,500 benefit for leased vehicles beyond the expiration of the government subsidy.

A loophole

In doing so, the manufacturers are apparently exploiting a loophole in the subsidy guidelines: the manufacturers themselves, together with their financing service providers, are making a down payment for vehicles that are already in stock at dealerships but have not yet been sold to customers.

“Those down payments will qualify the lending arms for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles, according to the documents and dealers. From there, dealers would offer leases on those cars to retail customers as usual for several more months, with the $7,500 subsidy factored into the lease rate,” Reuters writes, citing information from dealers who were informed about this procedure by the manufacturers.

With this ‘trick’ and the ‘internal’ sale before September 30, dealers could continue to offer discounted vehicles in their leasing rates from October onwards until the ‘subsidized’ stock is depleted. However, the Reuters article does not provide any information on the number of vehicles to which this trick was applied.

“We worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases,” General Motors explained in response to a query from the news agency, but also did not provide any details on the scope of the offer.

Ford, on the other hand, stated that it was “working to provide Ford EV customers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until December 31.” At least a specific offer period, the fourth quarter, is mentioned here, but Ford also leaves open the question of how many vehicles can be offered in this way.

First a rush, then a slump?

Experts anticipate another surge in demand for electric cars in September, capitalizing on the subsidy. However, a slump in sales figures is forecast for the entire fourth quarter, similar to the trend in Germany after the abrupt end of the environmental bonus subsidy at the end of 2023. It is unclear how long it will take for the U.S. market to recover from the impact of the subsidy.

The U.S. tax credit was introduced in 2022 under President Joe Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Since August 2023, the tax credit has also been available for used electric cars, provided they meet specific requirements to qualify for the subsidy.

Since the turn of the year 2023/2024, it has also been possible to assign the tax credit, which was actually paid out with a delay when filing the tax return in the following year, to the dealer at the time of purchase. The dealer could then offer up to $7,500 in discount on the purchase and, in turn, apply for the government subsidy.

Some international automobile manufacturers have since decided to withdraw electric vehicle models from the US market, such as Honda and Nissan, while local manufacturers, including Tesla, are seeing lower sales and margins in their automotive sales.

While some conditions are changing, such as the tariffs on imported cars from Europe, and the U.S. government is investing in the mineral supply chain, it remains to be seen how the U.S. industry will recover from these changes.",https://newmobility.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Scherm­afbeelding-2025-10-01-om-11.13.57.png,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:38.404632

September 30, 2025

The Honorable Scott Bessent

Secretary

United States Department of the Treasury

1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW

Washington, D.C. 20220

Dear Secretary Bessent,

We write to alert you to a serious violation of Congressional intent that threatens great harm to U.S. taxpayer dollars and ask for your immediate assistance in rectifying this problem.

As you know, Congress recently enacted Public Law 119-21, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, giving working class families massive tax relief, ending the Green New Scam, and fully funding our border security and national security needs. As part of this law, Congress amended Sections 25E, 30D, and 45W of the tax code, which collectively provide tax credits for the purchase of certain “clean vehicles.” These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off. The intent of P.L. 119-21 is clear – no credits allowed after September 30, 2025.

To implement this law, on August 21, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance (IR-2025-86) which provided clarification on the availability of the EV subsidies for taxpayers who enter into a written binding contract and make a downpayment on an eligible “clean vehicle.” This guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer. It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal downpayment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months.

Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors. Treasury, working with the IRS, must act decisively to clarify the guidance to ensure that only written binding agreements which identify the lessee are eligible and that the deposit must be made by the end user to qualify. We look forward to working with you to address this issue promptly in order to protect taxpayer dollars.

Sincerely,

BERNIE MORENO

In the electric utility sector, the shutdown could affect state-run energy programs that are funded through appropriations, including energy efficiency programs, renewable energy, utility assistance for low-income households and revolving energy funds.
Most federal construction contracts are within this category, as “they were already awarded on a fixed-price basis and funding was appropriated at the time of the award,” according to an emailed AGC statement.

State and local private construction tied to federal projects would also likely face obstacles, added Geldert-Murphey.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Contractors across the country are measuring the impact of a government shutdown that went into effect Wednesday.

The stoppage will freeze construction activity immediately on certain sites, both temporarily and in some cases permanently.

In the electric utility sector, the shutdown could affect state-run energy programs that are funded through appropriations, including energy efficiency programs, renewable energy, utility assistance for low-income households and revolving energy funds. It could also slow or halt the approval and oversight process for new energy infrastructure.

The first pain point will be on projects that rely entirely on federal dollars, said Marsia Geldert-Murphey, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and current senior associate at GBA, a Lenexa, Kansas-based AEC firm.

Though money could be technically in place, a shutdown could still sideline contracting officers and other oversight staff. That could leave projects stuck in neutral, Geldert-Murphey said.

“The real problem is going to be the federal employees,” said Geldert-Murphey. “Are they going to be furloughed? In many cases, we can’t move forward with the project if the federal oversight is not there.”

While projects in progress are typically allowed to move forward, any activities that require input or approval from government employees simply cannot proceed, said Erik Wright, principal at Precision Construction Services, a San Luis Obispo, California-based contractor. He added that delays are more likely than cancellations in these instances.

“When the government shut down in late 2018, early 2019 for around 20 working days, projects in the final stages of contracting or early stages of construction were delayed three to four months,” Wright said. “We had contracts in process late in 2018 that didn’t end up coming through until April and May of 2019, which presented significant cash flow and staffing challenges for us.”

Being in a state of limbo would have immediate effects on contracts and supply chains. Prices are locked for only so long, and prolonged delays force suppliers to reprice bids and contractors to remobilize crews at added cost, Geldert-Murphy said.

Fixed-price contracts

On the other hand, existing fixed-price contracts with appropriated funds should be allowed to continue, according to Associated General Contractors of America. Most federal construction contracts are within this category, as “they were already awarded on a fixed-price basis and funding was appropriated at the time of the award,” according to an emailed AGC statement.

That includes projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as well as the Highway Trust Fund, according to AGC. The IIJA included funding for a number of energy initiatives, including regional hydrogen hubs, carbon capture, advanced nuclear reactors, energy storage, grid resilience and electric vehicles.

Projects sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration should not be impacted, since they’re not subject to annual appropriations, according to AGC. In other words, these agencies should continue to make timely payments to contractors on work performed, regardless of a government shutdown.

But cost-type contracts and awards still in the pipeline are far more exposed to the fallout of a shutdown, should one happen. State and local private construction tied to federal projects would also likely face obstacles, added Geldert-Murphey.

“If the federal project is delayed and you’re assuming that you’re going to be building connecting to something that’s already built, the cascading effect can be devastating,” Geldert-Murphey said. “If they [contractors] don’t have that communication on the federal side, you’re at a standstill, which is again, a domino effect of pushing back decisions that are being made.”

Many state, municipal and nonprofit projects rely on federal grants, said Wright, meaning that a public shutdown could discourage private clients from moving ahead with capital projects as well.

“The construction supply chain is tightly interconnected, so if federal infrastructure or defense work slows, demand volatility for materials and subcontractors will spread beyond federal jobs,” Wright said. “Repeated shutdowns erode confidence in the government as a reliable contracting partner, which can influence how firms price future bids and whether they pursue certain opportunities at all.”

At Messer Construction, a Cincinnati-based contractor, Paul Richter echoed these concerns.

“A prolonged shutdown lasting several months could potentially stunt progress for planning and development of future projects, leading to a disruption to the flow of work on a longer-term horizon,” said Richter, the operations vice president.

The firm’s military projects are largely insulated in the short-term, Richter said, because funding through the Military Construction program or Operations and Maintenance accounts is typically locked in well in advance. The risk stems from facility staff who may be sent home, which would prevent renovation projects from moving forward. Richter added that a lengthy shutdown would hinder future work as well.

That uncertainty, ultimately, will hamstring construction activity once again.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/e578ZA9uivpWfoKCZFTGg_VK8_V4QfzFQz2uDVLF8lY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjM4MTIzMzA2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-01 18:02:10.441398

Shell Lubricants, a division of the Shell Oil Company, has created a breakthrough new thermal management fluid for use in EVs, according to New Atlas.

While that might sound like something that requires a degree in chemistry to understand, the end result is simple: faster charging times.

But just how much faster? Shell has claimed that its fluid allows EVs to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in about 10 minutes, per New Atlas.

Several challenges have confronted experts looking for ways to charge EVs faster. Namely, fast charging can compromise safety and potentially shorten a battery's lifespan.

According to a statement by Shell, the company ""has successfully formulated and demonstrated a high-performance EV thermal management fluid with the ability to unlock significant reductions in charging times without compromise to battery safety, thermal stability or lifespan, aiding the widespread adoption of battery electric vehicles.""

In the comment section of the New Atlas article, readers expressed mixed views on the announcement.

""This is great news,"" said one commenter. ""I'm impressed that even oil companies are seeing the inevitable (and profitable) future.""

Others were more skeptical.

""It's probably a consumable,"" another commenter wrote. ""EVs will take over, but now you'll need to go to Shell to get your 'battery gas.'""

While companies can change, consumers have plenty of reasons to be wary of Shell based on the company's checkered history.

For example, a Shell subsidiary operating in Nigeria has faced years of litigation over allegations that, in 2008, two of the company's pipelines leaked oil into local waterways for five straight weeks. Last summer, a Nigerian monarch demanded that the company pay billions in reparations before shutting down operations in the country.

While EVs do have an environmental cost, research shows that their cradle-to-grave environmental impact is far less than that of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

For example, while the world still generates much of its electricity from burning dirtier, nonrenewable fuels like coal and natural gas, an EV charged off the average American power grid still is only responsible for as much heat-trapping pollution as a gas-powered car getting 100 miles per gallon, according to MIT Climate Portal.

To push the environmental benefits of driving an EV even further, and to save money on electricity, you can charge your EV with home solar. Doing so is cheaper than charging off the grid or at a public charging station, while also giving you the added satisfaction of knowing your vehicle is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

If upgrading to home solar feels overwhelming, EnergySage can help with free, easy-to-use online tools that allow you to compare quotes among vetted local installers while also making sure that you take maximum advantage of government rebates and other incentives available in your state.

However, federal EV tax credits shuttered Sept. 30. With tax credits for solar expiring Dec. 31, this is your last chance to act if you want to take advantage of the thousands of dollars in potential savings.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shell-thermal-management-fluidimage-recbt5cnGUSjfChYU.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:47.733056

In a letter to Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft dated Sept. 24, the attorneys general accused them of using “environmental accounting gimmicks” to say they’re powered by renewables.

“These claims appear deceptive given the increasing electricity demands of those companies and the realities of the U.S. electrical grid,” the letter says, before requesting the companies answer a series of questions about their energy use, policies and claims.

The state officials specifically criticize how the tech companies buy clean energy.

“The attorney generals are questioning the longstanding way we've done things,” said John Rogers, associate director of energy analytics at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Rogers said companies don’t always have control over where utilities get power. So, they may buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) from solar or wind farms to be more green and offset their energy use.

The attorneys general said companies don’t actually use that energy, and this doesn't make them “powered by” renewables. A spokesperson from Amazon said this reliance on RECs is temporary.

“Amazon purchases RECs as a temporary bridging mechanism while we wait for renewable energy projects to come online,” the spokesperson wrote via email.

Rogers said buying RECs fuels more demand for renewables.

“You can be forcing action elsewhere in the market,” he explained.

The attorneys general also claim the tech companies are pushing utilities toward “harmful net-zero goals,” and this has led to coal and gas plants shutting their doors.

“These utility commitments have helped contribute to the phenomenon of early retirement of coal and natural gas plants, which is raising state concerns and threatening the integrity of the electric grid,” the letter reads.

The attorneys general also say that this threatens President Donald Trump’s efforts to “unleash American energy.""

Rogers said these points may suggest the state officials have ulterior motives.

“Their interest may not be entirely about ensuring the integrity of renewable energy markets and more about propping up fossil fuels,” he said.

The letter asks companies to respond to Montana’s Officer of Consumer Protection by Oct. 27.

The spokesperson from Amazon said the company has received the letter and is reviewing it. A representative for Microsoft said no comment. Google and Meta did not respond by deadline.

American Commercial Barge Line, which owns the former Jeffboat property, announced last week that the Indiana Economic Development Corporation has awarded a $20 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. to support the riverfront development

This grant follows a $6.5 million Indiana READI grant awarded to the project in December.

According to the news release, this grant funding is a “foundation for the transformation of the Jeffersonville riverfront into a vibrant, mixed use development.”

Steve Bollinger is principal and executive vice president of business development at Thrive Companies, the agency serving as master developer for the project.

He said these grants, along with potential upcoming tax increment financing, or TIF dollars, are what make redevelopment of the former shipyard on prime riverside real estate viable.

“Otherwise, this project doesn’t happen,” he said. “So it’s everything.”

Jeffboat closed in 2018 after 80 years of barge-building operations at the site. The footprint includes what was originally the Howard shipyard, which opened in 1838 for steamboat production.

The past several years have seen a renewed spirit in what could be the next iteration of the mile-long strip of land long devoted to boat-building.

In 2023, planners unveiled a preliminary framework for what could potentially go there, including housing, retail, residential and green spaces.

Project timeline

Over the next three to six months, project leaders will start gathering community input on whether the architectural pieces discussed during the first planning phases are still what residents want to see there.

“And obviously it needs to be done with the economics of the deal being a part of it,” said Bollinger. “Because what we don't want to do is put something out there [that’s not] based in reality.”

Site work is expected to start within nine to 12 months and take around two years. That includes bringing in a lot of dirt — an estimated 700,000 cubic square feet — to raise parts of the site.

Once the site is ready, construction is slated to begin in late 2028 or early 2029. Bollinger said parkspace should be finished before or around the same time the first structures are completed. That will pull in downtown Jeffersonville as well as downtown Louisville, “and there's this connection through it all.”

This is Thrive Companies’ first project out of central Ohio. They’re based in Columbus. The team became interested in developing the Indiana riverfront site early on in the process, Bollinger said.

That interest grew when they discovered how much state and local support there was for redevelopment at the site.

Upon visiting the city, they also were impressed with amenities like the Big Four Bridge and historic downtown area.

“It's just like, ‘Man, this city has mojo to it. It has a vibe to it. It's …creating its own thing, and it feels really good,” he said.

Jeffersonville Mayor Mike Moore said he feels lucky and is glad state leaders see the value in this project in Jeffersonville.

The city partnered to help fund initial designs a couple years ago. He said it can also use TIF dollars to help fund amenities like the extension of the Ohio River Greenway through the area.

Moore said he wants the site to be publicly accessible.

“I don't want a gated entrance where you got to live there to get in there,” he said. “We're going to have thriving restaurants down there and a beautiful boardwalk to…have a nice, safe place to enjoy the river view and mingle and walk around to restaurants, coffee shops and pubs.”

George Piccioni, vice president of business development at American Commercial Barge Line, said in the release the grant funding comes after more than four years of planning.

Car companies are stepping in to preserve discounts and smooth the sell-down of existing EV inventory after the federal EV subsidy phased out Sept. 30. GM and Ford are making the $7,500 discount available for leased vehicles that are in transit or on dealer lots. Hyundai’s offer applies to leases and purchases: The Korean automaker will kick in $7,500 in cash for the 2025 version of its Ioniq 5; it’s also lowering the price of the 2026 model by as much as $9,800, depending on the trim.

EV sales are expected to slow in coming quarters as President Donald Trump’s policy changes take hold and automakers dial back production and rejigger product plans to add more gas and hybrid models. Full battery-electric models have been a tough sell for many American car buyers, who’ve been turned off by high prices and spotty charging infrastructure.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%” from about 10% now, Ford CEO Jim Farley said at a conference in Detroit this week. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

Automakers’ profits are already taking a hit to absorb the cost of US tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. Based on the trade agreements Trump announced this summer, tariffs could add an extra $5,500 to the cost of an imported vehicle, and $1,000 on US-assembled vehicles with imported components, according to researcher Cox Automotive.

EV Divergence

Growth in EV sales in the US are not expected to move much this decade, reaching 11% of the U.S. market by 2029 compared with 8.1% last year, according to a September forecast by EY, a unit of consultant Ernst & Young Global.

But it’s a different story in other parts of the world. EY predicts EVs in Europe will make up more than half of new vehicle sales by 2032. In China, they’ll surpass half the market in 2033.

Automakers are pursuing different strategies to cope with the uneven pace of adoption. While Hyundai is retooling its $5.5 billion plant in Savannah, Ga., to make hybrids as well as EVs, it’s not downplaying their market relevance.

“I do believe because of the surge we saw in September, there’s going to be a reset in October, maybe November. But the EV market will settle,” said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai’s North America business.

“There was an EV market before the IRA and there’s going to be an EV market after the IRA,” he told reporters on a call Sept. 30, referencing former President Joe Biden’s climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act.

Hyundai said it’s dipping into its own pocket to fund the $7,500 cash rebate on the 2025 Ioniq 5 and the discounts on 2026 models.

Parker said the move “showcases our financial strength and the ability to navigate the market with a lot of uncertainty.”

Ford and GM are simply passing along the value of federal credits they already locked in through their finance arms.

GM Financial put a down payment on about 30,000 EVs before Oct. 1, which means the credit company can lease the vehicles with the tax credit baked into the price. Once a lease is written, the lender gets paid back by the Internal Revenue Service, said a person familiar with GM’s operations.

“Ford is working to provide Ford electric vehicle shoppers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31,” the company said in a statement.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-10/EV-Credits-1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 17:06:00.234829

The once-popular Xterra was discontinued in the United States a decade ago due to tougher emissions standards and a broader industry shift away from boxier, truck-based SUVs.
The carmaker imports EVs like the Leaf to the United States from Japan, but has reduced those volumes due to tariffs.
The company is hoping those models bolster sales in the United States, which slid 6.5% in the second quarter and were flat in the first six months of the year.
Meunier said the revamped Xterra will share a platform, hybrid powertrain and parts with the midsized Frontier pickup, Pathfinder SUV, Infiniti QX60 and possibly another as-yet-unnamed Infiniti SUV.","Nissan Motor Co. will revive its Xterra SUV as a hybrid model to be built in Mississippi and halt plans to make an electric vehicle in the United States, according to its top executive for the Americas.

The Japanese carmaker will reboot the Xterra nameplate in 2028 as a V-6 engine-powered hybrid to help fill unused capacity at its plant in Canton, Mississippi, said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. It’s also considering building an upscale Infiniti version of that model and moving the full-size Armada and Infiniti QX80 SUVs to the factory.

“The dealers are super excited about it because it’s going to be a great example of Nissan coming back,” Meunier said in an interview Tuesday, adding it will “bring scale back to the plant and get the costs at the right level.”

Nissan is undergoing a massive downsizing effort globally as it tries to regain profitability, but in the key U.S. market it’s planning to boost gas-powered vehicle output in response to President Donald Trump’s trade and environmental policies.

The once-popular Xterra was discontinued in the United States a decade ago due to tougher emissions standards and a broader industry shift away from boxier, truck-based SUVs.

As part of the shift, Nissan has frozen plans to make a fully-electric model in Mississippi as U.S. demand for EVs has softened — and may drop further with the expiration this month of federal subsidies. As recently as March, Nissan had said it was on track to launch a battery electric model in Canton in 2028 and planned to source batteries for it locally from South Korea’s SK On.

The carmaker imports EVs like the Leaf to the United States from Japan, but has reduced those volumes due to tariffs. Nissan continues to consider options for making EVs in the United States, but Meunier said that may hinge on dramatic cuts to manufacturing costs or finding a partner to split the risk.

“With the market being very uncertain about EVs, I think it’s the right thing to do,” he said.

Meanwhile, Nissan is readying a new version of its entry-level, Mexican-made and gas-powered Sentra compact sedan for launch in the United States later this year and a plug-in hybrid option for its best-selling Rogue compact SUV in early 2026. The company is hoping those models bolster sales in the United States, which slid 6.5% in the second quarter and were flat in the first six months of the year. On Wednesday, Nissan will release U.S. deliveries for the most recent quarter through September.

Meunier said the revamped Xterra will share a platform, hybrid powertrain and parts with the midsized Frontier pickup, Pathfinder SUV, Infiniti QX60 and possibly another as-yet-unnamed Infiniti SUV.

Nissan’s other U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee, was set to go down to a single work shift earlier this year, but the carmaker decided to maintain two production shifts daily after the Trump administration imposed tariffs. Meunier, who rejoined Nissan in January after a stint at rival Stellantis NV, said he hopes to add a third shift in Smyrna once an all-new version of the Rogue debuts.

While the White House’s tariffs have injected uncertainty into the auto industry and upended supply chains, the Nissan executive said the tough trade regime has injected a needed sense of urgency into Nissan’s attempted makeover of its U.S. operations.

“I keep saying it’s a good thing for Nissan, it forces us to rethink, he said. “It forces the company to do the right thing. When you think about a big market like the U.S., you need to be localized.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/01/PDTN/86455022007-nissanbg-sizdm-3-i-67-re-4-fotb-74-pyfcpo-5-q.jpg?crop=2999,1688,x0,y156&width=2999&height=1688&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-01 19:02:30.420914

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said in a press release a Biden-era rule governing the phaseout of these chemicals led to “an increase in consumer costs and shortages.”

As a result, the EPA says that to address the issue, it will propose to allow the use of refrigerants that are much more potent contributors to global warming for the time being.

HFCs are a family of chemicals that are used in cooling, including in refrigerators and air conditioners.

They replaced ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. However, they are highly potent greenhouse gases and therefore have become a significant contributor to climate change.

In 2020, President Trump signed a bipartisan compromise into law that requires an 85 percent phasedown in their use by 2036.

In 2023, the Biden administration issued a rule restricting the use of more potent HFCs during the phasedown. The Biden rule limited some sectors to only using hydrofluorocarbons that are no more than 150, 300 or 700 times as powerful as carbon dioxide.

The Trump administration is now proposing to loosen the rules for certain sectors, allowing retail fridges to now use chemicals that are 1,400 times as powerful as carbon dioxide, for example. It is also delaying compliance timelines for certain industrial process refrigerators.

“Hardworking Americans have made their voices and frustrations heard about the lack of availability of refrigerant alternatives during hot summer months and regulations that increase the cost of living for families.

Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin joined the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition last month, increasing membership to 13 state governors.

Launched in May, the coalition aims to promote more affordable electric vehicles, support U.S. automotive manufacturers and preserve states’ authority under the Clean Air Act.

The coalition was formed by the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan group of 24 governors. States will address their own challenges and opportunities while working together to achieve the coalition’s collective goals, the Climate Alliance said in a press release.

Dive Insight:

New electric vehicle sales were strong in the past two months as buyers rushed to take advantage of federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30. However, the share of EVs compared to total automotive sales declined in the second quarter both year-over-year and compared to the first quarter, according to CleanTechnica.

“Sales of EVs will likely fall dramatically when tax credits expire,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough in an Aug. 27 statement.

A further blow to EVs came in June when Congress and the Trump administration ended California’s authority to set its own stronger vehicle emission standards. A 1990 federal law allows 17 additional states and the District of Columbia to follow California’s vehicle emissions regulations.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, representing many of the industry’s automakers and suppliers, supported the administration’s actions. “An aggressive regulatory push toward battery electric vehicles – ahead of consumer demand and without market readiness – will reduce U.S. vehicle production and auto jobs versus a more balanced approach that prioritizes and preserves vehicle choice,” said the group’s president and CEO, John Bozzella, in an April 29 blog post.

The coalition’s 11 initial governors said in a May 23 statement that “The federal government and Congress are putting polluters over people and creating needless chaos for consumers and the market.”

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a Sept. 4 statement, “We need to make it easier, not harder, for consumers to upgrade to electric vehicles — and that’s exactly what we’re doing through this state-led partnership.”

The Climate Alliance said it is making resources available to coalition members to help them reduce vehicle pollution and enable consumer access to more affordable zero-emission vehicles.

Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in an emailed statement that the organization is “proud of Hawaiʻi and Wisconsin for joining 11 other states to improve access to electric vehicles at a time when the federal government works to prop up the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our economic well-being and health.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Vh3Q-yrLd0frxR23T1lSKf7mCD9z1fkXoEc-JCJUePg/g:nowe:0:233/c:2500:1412/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjA0NTg4MDQ0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-01 17:04:30.062548

ICYMI: Senator Murray Comments After Republicans Push Country Into Shutdown

***WATCH full press conference HERE; DOWNLOAD HERE***

Washington, D.C. – Today,U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a senior member and former chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, held a virtual press conference on how Democrats are fighting to save critical Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits that middle-class families in Washington state and across the country rely on to be able to afford health insurance. Joining Senator Murray for the press conference were Washington State Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer and Maya Tussing, a small business owner in Washington state who relies on ACA tax credits to afford health care.

At the press conference, Senator Murray called out Republicans for refusing to come to the table to negotiate a deal with Democrats to keep the government open and protect Americans’ health care, and reiterated that she stands ready to negotiate a bipartisan funding bill to reopen the government and prevent Americans’ health care costs from skyrocketing. Senator Murray has been speaking out nonstop about the urgent need to save health care and keep the government open and calling on Republicans to come to the negotiating table to work out a bipartisan deal—which they have so far refused to do. As the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Murray leads legislation supported by the Democratic caucus that would reopen the government, address the health care crisis, and protect Congress’ power of the purse from Donald Trump and Russ Vought’s nonstop, lawless efforts to block funding from reaching communities across the country.

For months, Republicans have refused to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits, and if they are left to expire, 22 million Americans across the country—including more than 216,000 people in Washington state—will see their health care costs and premiums skyrocket. Premiums will more than double for Americans who buy health care through the ACA exchanges, and these higher costs will push 4.2 million people off their health coverage over the next decade—including an estimated 80,000 people in Washington state. In Washington state, health insurers have been approved for an average rate hike of 21 percent this year in large part due to the Republican failure to extend the ACA enhanced premium tax credits. A fact sheet on what the expiration of the ACA tax credits would mean for people in Washington state is HERE.

“I don’t know why Republicans think they can just sweep the health care crisis they created under the rug. But we are here to say: we are forcing this issue. We are going to talk about health care whether Republicans want to or not,” said Senator Murray. “The American people are demanding action, and they are demanding it now. Why? Because the new, higher health care rates—those are being set right now. Notifications to families? Those are in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away, and families are panicking. I have heard from one family in Washington state whose premiums could jump from $278 a month, to as much as $1,800 a month. There is a simple solution here—to simply save the ACA tax credits that 22 million people rely on to afford health care—including over 200,000 people in Washington state. Republicans have made clear they will quite literally shut down the government rather than address this problem.”

Senator Murray played a critical role in passing the enhanced premium tax credits in the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and extending them in the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, and she has been fighting for months to make sure these important health care tax credits don’t expire, including cosponsoring multiple pieces of legislation—the Health Care Affordability Act and the Protecting Health Care and Lowering Costs Act—that would make them permanent.

“Last year, more than 216,000 people in the individual market qualified for enhanced premium tax credits. Tax credits are crucial to helping people afford and keep coverage,” said Washington State Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer. “Our Exchange predicts that 80,000 people to drop coverage, if the enhanced premium tax credits are not extended. If fewer people are enrolled because of costs, older and sicker people will remain, driving up costs for everyone. This, along with growing uncertainty at the federal level does not bode well for next year. As your insurance commissioner, I can tell you what insurers do NOT like and that’s uncertainty. Uncertainty does NOT create a stable, vibrant, competitive market. It creates chaos and high costs for consumers.”

“Six years ago, I launched a small business with a partner that helps nonprofits manage their financial resources. We’re lean, we’re mission driven, and we’re growing, and most importantly, we are passionate about what we do. However, we’re not large enough to provide me and my family with employer sponsored health insurance, and that’s why the ACA was a lifeline for me, because it allowed us to focus on building our business without my agonizing over how to secure health insurance. And at the time, it seemed like a stroke of luck, and an example of the US’ brilliant policy innovation. And it sounds a bit sappy, but it was the first time I really felt fortunate to be an American because of the incredible dynamism in this country and the fact that everyone here is so supportive of small business owners, and it seems so easy to launch a business. But while our take home pay grew steadily, our health care premium spiked. And last year they increased fivefold, and with the expiration of tax credits, they’ll double, making it tenfold—a tenfold increase in two years. And our health care costs could cost more than our home life and auto insurance combined,” said Maya Tussing, a small business owner in Washington state who relies on ACA tax credits to afford health care. “Running a small business requires reliable expense forecasting, and that means that if these credits expire, many entrepreneurs will face sudden premium spikes that they couldn’t have anticipated. And that kind of unpredictability can be devastating, especially when it’s driven by policy decisions that are totally beyond our control… Families like mine are bracing for higher premiums, deductibles and co pays, and then we’ll be forced to ask ourselves, how sick do I have to be before I can justify paying for treatment? And that’s not how health care should work in the wealthiest country in the world. And this is the moment for Congress to act.”

Senator Murray’s remarks, as delivered on today’s press call, are below:

“Thank you all for joining me today.

“We are here to put a spotlight on an issue Republicans are trying as hard as they possibly can to ignore—the health care crisis they have created, which is forcing people to lose their health insurance, hospitals to close their doors, and will soon mean millions of Americans will pay more than double what they pay now for their health care premiums if Congress doesn’t act.

“Seriously, Republicans have decided they would rather shut down the government than talk to Democrats about preventing premiums from exploding next year.

“One big issue with that Republican plan? Ignoring—or lying about—this problem won’t make it go away. Families with health care at stake know this all too well.

“Because when you go online to buy health insurance and find your monthly payment has more than doubled—you are going to notice it. When your health care is suddenly way out of budget for your family, that’s not something you can ignore. In fact, it’s something that will break the bank for many people, and force millions to simply drop their coverage altogether.

“I don’t know why Republicans think they can just sweep the health care crisis they created under the rug. But we are here to say: we are forcing this issue. We are going to talk about health care whether Republicans want to or not.

“And it’s clear as day, they do not. Because they know their position is unpopular—a top House Republican recently said as much in private—and urged colleagues ‘don’t talk about it.’

“So Democrats are going to force Republicans to come to the table to negotiate with us. The American people are demanding action, and they are demanding it now.

“Why? Because the new, higher health care rates—those are being set right now. Notifications to families? Those are in the mail now. Open enrollment is weeks away, and families are panicking.

“I have heard from one family in Washington state whose premiums could jump from $278 a month, to as much as $1,800 a month.

“There is a simple solution here—to simply save the ACA tax credits that 22 million people rely on to afford health care—including over 200,000 people in Washington state.

“Republicans have made clear they will quite literally shut down the government rather than address this problem.

“What do they plan on telling farmers—a quarter of whom are enrolled in the health care exchanges, who will see their costs increase exponentially? What do they plan to tell small business owners, and workers, and people who are self-employed—half of whom get their coverage through the ACA exchanges?

“Because saying ‘tough luck’ is not going to cut it. And neither is ‘we’ll fix it later’ for that matter. Later is too late! Republicans are saying they will just sit on their hands until those higher rates are locked in for the next year, and that is unacceptable.

“We have to act now. Families know it. Patients know it. Small business owners know it.

“And that’s why Democrats are insisting on acting now. We are not going to let Republicans keep sabotaging Americans’ health care. Democrats are fighting to reverse the cuts, lower costs, and protect health care for the people we represent back home.

“People who are speaking out about just how devastating it will be if Republicans refuse to save these critical health care tax credits. I’m joined by some of them today.

“Republicans may shut down the government, but they will not shut down this debate.

“And they will not shut out the voices of people across the country who want us to act before their health care costs skyrocket, before their insurance is out of reach, before it is too late.”

Ryan Libby, the director of subscriber acquisitions for solar farm operator PowerMarket, said work on the project is complete and is awaiting connection to ComEd’s power grid.
Should the school district become the anchor tenant, like the individual subscribers, it will receive a 50% discount on its ComEd bill for the power used.
A reduction in school district expenses would mean a break for property taxpayers.
“Together, we are turning yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities, rebuilding a stronger, more sustainable future for our residents.” District 60 Board of Education President Michael Rodriguez echoed Cunningham’s comments.","Approximately 1,000 Waukegan residents will likely pay nearly $400 a year less for electricity, and the city’s taxpayers who live within the boundaries of Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 may benefit as well, as the solar farm at the Yeoman Creek landfill becomes active.

A former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site, the 40-acre parcel — roughly bounded by Lewis, Sunset, Western and Glen Flora avenues — was useless to the district for nearly 60 years. Now, it contains 20,000 solar panels to be connected to Commonwealth Edison’s grid.

Ryan Libby, the director of subscriber acquisitions for solar farm operator PowerMarket, said work on the project is complete and is awaiting connection to ComEd’s power grid. The company takes energy from the farm and reduces the subscriber’s bill appropriately.

“The goal is to be fully operational by the end of the year,” Libby said. “This is exclusively for Waukegan residents due to the city’s status as an environmental justice community and the high percentage of low- to moderate-income families.”

PowerMarket completed the Yeoman Creek Community Solar Farm on Friday in Waukegan and continues to work with District 60 and others to register approximately 1,000 subscribers who will save an estimated $391 annually on their electric bills.

Libby said the savings come from a 50% discount on the power generated from the farm. The reduction is an estimate, and can be more or less depending on the amount of electricity used.

Along with the individual subscribers, Libby said plans also call for an “anchor tenant” to contract to use 40% of the power generated. Negotiations are ongoing for the major subscriber, but are not final yet.

“As of right now, I’m still waiting for the paperwork for the anchor agreement to come together,” he said. “The school (district) has expressed interest in enrolling some of its facilities as the anchor.”

Nick Alatzakis, District 60’s communications director, said the proposal is under review.

Should the school district become the anchor tenant, like the individual subscribers, it will receive a 50% discount on its ComEd bill for the power used. A reduction in school district expenses would mean a break for property taxpayers.

Waukegan Mayor Sam Cunningham said in an email that converting a one-time Superfund site and landfill into a productive use does more than create clean, renewable energy. The benefits go to low- and moderate-income families who need it most.

“It’s an investment in our people,” Cunningham said. “Together, we are turning yesterday’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities, rebuilding a stronger, more sustainable future for our residents.”

District 60 Board of Education President Michael Rodriguez echoed Cunningham’s comments. He sees both an immediate benefit and one that could last a long time. It helps the people who need it most.

“We took a property which had been a landfill for the city for a long time and turned it into something to benefit our city for years to come,” Rodriguez said.

So far, about 600 people have applied to subscribe. Libby said some applications are approved and others are in the review process. The school district is actively promoting the opportunity on its website, through texts and on social media, with approximately 1,000 openings available overall.

“We’re excited about this initiative because it helps households save on electricity bills while transforming district-owned land into a source of clean energy that benefits the entire community,” Alatzakis said.

If applicants live in a U.S. Census Tract — 68% of Waukegan residents do — where the majority of residents are considered low- to moderate-income, Libby said they merely need to provide a copy of a recent ComEd bill. The other 32% must show they are in the low- or moderate-income category.

And, for the same reasons, matching electricity consumption with unbundled RECs does not reduce emissions despite the companies’ claims.
The AGs assert that rather than adding new green energy, this will deprive consumers of reliable energy, as wind and solar are not reliable.
The emphasis companies put on renewable energy pressures utilities to move away from fossil-fuel-generated baseload power.","Last week, Attorney General Austin Knudsen of Montana announced a 16-state Republican investigation into four ​“big tech” companies regarding purportedly deceptive renewable energy claims. AG Knudsen and the states sent a letter to the companies to ​“raise serious concerns and request further information” regarding claims that the companies are 100% powered by renewable energy. The AGs request a response to a list of questions by October 27.

The letter alleges that the companies buy unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) in order to make their claims, but that claims to consume, use, or be powered by 100% renewable energy based on RECs may be misleading. A REC does not prove that additional renewable energy would be generated with the purchase or that the purchaser actually used renewable energy. Further, because the tech companies use electricity from the power grid, reliant on fossil-fuel-generated baseload power, they are not being powered 100% by renewable energy even with REC purchases. The letter explains that a contractual right to make a representation from an REC can still mislead consumers – just as if they had purchased the right to make a Made in the USA claim. And, for the same reasons, matching electricity consumption with unbundled RECs does not reduce emissions despite the companies’ claims. Rather, those companies have actually created emissions through the use of fuel-generated baseload power.

The AGs admit that the FTC’s Green Guides suggest renewable energy claims can be made using renewable energy certificate matches, but they argue that this language does not apply to emissions claims. And they further state that Green Guides are nonbinding and not preemptive –signaling these AGs intend to interpret their UDAP laws broader than the Green Guides at least in this instance.

The states also express concerns that the tech companies have both caused increased demand for electricity (including from AI products) while seeking to ​“lock up” nuclear power -- seeking to hook data centers directly to nuclear plants for energy. The AGs assert that rather than adding new green energy, this will deprive consumers of reliable energy, as wind and solar are not reliable. The emphasis companies put on renewable energy pressures utilities to move away from fossil-fuel-generated baseload power. This shift to shut down fossil fuel generation combined with increased energy needs of these companies ​“threaten[s] the integrity of the electric grid.”

The letter concludes with a list of 21 questions directed at all four companies requesting information on the purchases of unbundled RECs and how RECs support usage claims or reduced emissions claims.

There are multiple takeaways from this letter. First, this letter is the latest in the ongoing focus of state AGs on ​“big tech” and potential misrepresentations made by these companies. Second, companies should recognize that even where AGs may not have available pre-suit discovery tools, or may choose not to use those tools, AGs can use the power of the press release and informal letters to obtain relevant information. Finally, this action demonstrates a continued focus by Republican AGs in particular in ensuring adequate access to fossil fuel generated power. The crux of the AGs’ concern is that by misleading the public that they are 100% powered by renewable energy, these companies may drive the closure of coal and natural gas plants, threatening the power grid. Continued reliance on fossil fuels is a focal point of other challenges like the ongoing lawsuit against major investment firms alleging they used their ownership interest in the coal market to further green policy initiatives.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.kelleydrye.com/content/uploads/SEO-images/blog-defaults/adlawaccess.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 18:01:55.795750

And, the Bee Lab, a small but mighty department that helps research and protect bees, might lose its funding. If we want to have a fighting chance at saving the bees, we first need to save the Bee Lab.

What is the Bee Lab?

The Bee Lab is the only federal program that works to identify, study, and monitor American bee species.

Housed in the U.S. Geological Survey, the lab consists of two scientists working to understand bees, from their genetics to their ecological importance. However small, this duo has been the backbone of bee research for decades.

What does the Bee Lab do?

Nearly every bee researcher– and many advocates and conservationists– has relied on the lab for invaluable data. That’s because the Bee Lab is the only federal entity with the expertise to identify native bees.

The researchers catalogue and monitor over 4,000 bee species, studying their behavior and habitat needs. And, the Bee Lab documents species variations with stunning macro photographs.

To assist researchers, from students to scientists, the lab provides free online tools, including a database of all their activity that is open to public use. Around 500 publications have referenced it.

And, to study how bees interact with plants and other wildlife, the lab also cultivates a large and thriving pollinator garden that attracts bees, monarchs and many other species. It’s so successful that conservation groups, park departments, academics and more come to the garden to learn and to use samples native plants for their work.

Without the Bee Lab’s work, advocates and scientists will not have the resources they depend on to save the bees from extinction. Bees, wildlife and people will suffer without their work.

Why is it more important than ever to protect bees?

There are over 4,000 species of bees in the U.S, but because of habitat loss, pesticide use and more, they’ve been dying at unprecedented rates. Since 1947, the U.S. honeybee population has declined by 60%.

Bees are lynchpins of our ecosystems— they’re essential to so many other types of wildlife. They pollinate the flowers and trees that provide shelter and fruit to other species.

And, bees pollinate many of the agricultural crops we eat every day, like tomatoes and blueberries. The plight of bees poses a gigantic threat to the wildlife around us, but also the food that nourishes us. That’s where the Bee Lab comes in.

What we can do to save the Bee Lab

As we’ve pointed out to Congress for years, there’s a lot of wasteful spending in the federal government, but this small program is just not an example of that. The small investment in bee research is hugely important.

That’s why we’ve been sending messages to U.S. House Representatives urging them to save the Bee Lab. But we need your voice to make our message clear to them: pollinator research matters, and we will not let the bees die.

AI servers are so power hungry that utilities are keeping coal-fired power plants that were slated for closure running to meet the needs of massive servers. And in the South alone, there are plans for 20 gigawatts of new natural-gas power plants over the next 15 years — enough to power millions of homes — just to feed AI’s energy needs.

Multi-billion dollar companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta that previously committed to 100 percent renewable energy are going back to the Jurassic Age, using fossil fuels like coal and natural gas to meet their insatiable energy needs. Even nuclear power plants are being reactivated to meet the needs of power-hungry servers.

At a time when we need all corporations to reduce their climate footprint, carbon emissions from major tech companies in 2023 have skyrocketed to 150 percent of average 2020 values.

AI data centers also produce massive noise pollution and use huge amounts of water. Residents near data centers report that the sound keeps them awake at night and their taps are running dry.

Many of us live in communities that either have or will have a data center, and we’re already feeling the effects. Many of these plants further burden communities already struggling with a lack of economic investment, access to basic resources, and exposure to high levels of pollution.

To add insult to injury, amid stagnant wages and increasing costs for food, housing, utilities, and consumer goods, AI’s demand for power is also raising electric rates for customers nationwide. To meet the soaring demand for energy that AI data servers demand, utilities need to build new infrastructure, the cost of which is being passed onto all customers.

A recent Carnegie Mellon study found that AI data centers could increase electric rates by 25 percent in Northern Virginia by 2030. And NPR recently reported that AI data centers were a key driver in electric rates increasing twice as fast as the cost of living nationwide — at a time when one in six households are struggling to pay their energy bills.

All of these impacts are only projected to grow. AI already consumes enough electricity to power 7 million American homes. By 2028, that could jump to the amount of power needed for 22 percent of all US households.

But it doesn’t have to be this way.

AI could be powered by renewable energy that is non-polluting and works to reduce energy costs for us all. The leading AI companies, who have made significant climate pledges, must lead the way.

Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta have all made promises to the communities they serve to tackle climate and pollution. They all have climate pledges. And they have made significant investments in renewable energy in the past.

Those investments make sense, since renewables are the most affordable form of electricity. These companies have the know-how and the wealth to power AI with wind, solar, and batteries — which makes it all the more puzzling that they’re relying on fossil fuels to power the future.

If these corporate giants are to be good neighbors, they first need to be open and honest about the scope and scale of the problem and the solutions needed.

As these companies invest billions in technology for AI, they must re-up investments in renewables to power our future and protect our communities. They must ensure that communities have a real voice in how and where AI data centers are built — and that our communities aren’t sacrificed in the name of profits.

The reintroduction of federal coal lease auctions represents a significant shift in US energy policy, offering nearly 600 million tons of recoverable coal across four states. These auctions serve as a critical test for measuring industry interest in expanding coal operations amid changing energy markets and environmental concerns.

The Trump administration's decision to resume coal leasing on federal lands marks a sharp reversal from previous policies. With sales scheduled in Alabama, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming, these auctions represent the first substantial offering of federal coal resources in years and provide insight into whether policy support can revitalize a sector that has experienced significant decline.

According to Energy Information Administration data, US coal production dropped 40% between 2013 and 2023, while federal acreage under coal mining leases decreased by 11% during the same period. This decline occurred primarily due to competition from natural gas and increased mining permitting fundamentals under previous administrations.

Current Coal Market Context

The federal competitive leasing program's revival comes after years of restrictions. Under the Biden administration, new coal leases on federal lands were largely halted, creating a backlog of applications from companies seeking to expand their operations.

One of the most significant changes supporting this revival is the reduction in royalty rates from the previous 8-12.5% to a flat 7% following recent tax law changes. This reduction aims to improve project economics and encourage mining companies to bid on new leases.

Industry experts see these auctions as a critical indicator of whether policy support can translate into renewed investment in coal resources. The outcome of these sales will likely influence future federal energy leasing decisions and broader resource development strategies.

What Coal Resources Are Being Offered in the 2025 Auctions?

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is conducting a series of competitive sales across multiple states, each targeting specific coal reserves with varying characteristics and potential applications. The combined offering represents approximately 586.8 million tons of recoverable coal, ranging from high-value metallurgical coal for steel production to thermal coal for electricity generation.

Alabama Metallurgical Coal Tracts

The auctions begin on October 1, 2025, with the offer of two leases in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. These leases cover underground mining rights beneath 14,050 acres (5,686 hectares) of private land and are estimated to contain 53 million tons of metallurgical coal primarily used in steelmaking.

These valuable coal deposits are adjacent to existing operations owned by Warrior Met Coal, which first applied to lease these additional areas back in 2009, highlighting the lengthy timeline often associated with federal resource leasing.

Metallurgical (or ""met"") coal represents a premium segment of the coal market, as its properties make it essential for steel production. Unlike thermal coal, which faces competition from renewable energy sources, metallurgical coal has fewer substitutes in industrial applications.

Utah Thermal Coal Offering

Following the Alabama sale, the BLM will auction the Little Eccles Tract in Emery County, Utah on October 2, 2025. This smaller offering spans just 120 acres but contains an estimated 1.29 million tons of recoverable coal.

The tract's location adjacent to Canyon Fuel Company's Skyline mine creates operational synergies that could make this modest reserve economically attractive. The company specifically requested this tract to extend the life of its existing operation.

Utah's coal industry has historically been more resilient than other regions, benefiting from both thermal coal markets and some specialty coal applications. The state's coal typically offers higher heat content compared to other western US deposits.

Montana and Wyoming Large-Scale Offerings

The most substantial coal resources in this auction series are located in Montana and Wyoming, representing the heart of the Powder River Basin—America's most productive coal region.

On October 6, 2025, the BLM will offer 1,262 acres in Montana with an expected 167.5 million tons of recoverable coal. This will be followed by an even larger Wyoming auction on October 8, offering 3,508 acres containing an estimated 365 million tons.

Both tracts were requested by Navajo Transitional Energy Company (NTEC), which is owned by the Navajo Nation and already operates mines in these areas. NTEC's participation highlights the complex economic interests at play, as tribal enterprises seek to develop resources that provide revenue and employment opportunities for their communities.

Combined, these Montana and Wyoming tracts contain over 532 million tons of recoverable coal—approximately 90% of the total coal resources being offered in this auction series.

How Does the Administration Plan to Revitalize the Coal Sector?

The federal government has implemented a multi-pronged approach to support coal industry expansion, focusing on both regulatory changes and financial incentives. This strategy represents a significant shift from previous administrations' policies toward coal and fossil fuel development on federal lands.

Regulatory Framework Changes

Central to the administration's approach is streamlined permitting for new and expanded mining operations. This includes expedited review processes and reduced administrative barriers that previously extended the timeline for lease approvals.

Perhaps the most impactful change is the reduction in royalty rates from the previous range of 8-12.5% to a flat 7% rate. This adjustment, enabled through tax legislation passed earlier in 2025, directly improves project economics for potential bidders by reducing the ongoing payment obligations to the federal government.

The renewed access to federal lands previously unavailable for coal leasing represents another key pillar of the strategy. By reopening areas that were effectively off-limits under the previous administration's policies, the government has expanded the potential resource base available to coal producers.

Environmental assessment requirements for certain projects have also been modified to accelerate approvals while still maintaining required regulatory oversight, according to administration officials.

Financial Support Mechanisms

Beyond regulatory changes, the administration has committed ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" to support coal-fired power plant development and upgrades. This investment aims to ensure that domestic coal production has sufficient demand from electricity generators.

Tax incentives for domestic coal production and utilization further enhance the economic attractiveness of coal mining operations. These incentives are designed to improve competitiveness relative to other energy sources and imported coal.

Infrastructure investment supporting coal transportation networks—including rail improvements and port facilities—addresses logistical bottlenecks that have hampered some coal operations. Efficient transportation is particularly critical for coal, which has relatively high weight-to-value ratios compared to other commodities.

Research funding for advanced coal technologies and decarbonisation in mining also forms part of the strategy, seeking to address environmental concerns while maintaining coal's role in the energy mix. This includes support for carbon capture and storage technologies that could potentially reduce coal's carbon footprint.

What Is the Expected Industry Response to These Auctions?

Industry representatives and market analysts have expressed varying perspectives on the potential success of these auctions and their ability to revitalize the coal sector. While some anticipate strong interest driven by policy support, others point to persistent market challenges that could limit participation.

Industry Optimism

The National Mining Association has projected confidence in the upcoming sales. Their spokesperson Ashley Burke stated: ""With energy needs only accelerating, and an administration in place that properly values reliable, affordable fuel sources, American coal producers are well positioned to make the most of new leasing opportunities to answer the call for increased domestic coal.""

Companies with adjacent operations have particular incentive to participate in these auctions. Warrior Met Coal's interest in the Alabama tracts would allow them to expand their metallurgical coal production without the costs of developing entirely new mine infrastructure. Similarly, Canyon Fuel Company's interest in the Utah tract would extend the life of their existing Skyline operation.

The participation of Navajo Transitional Energy Company in requesting the Montana and Wyoming tracts demonstrates tribal economic development interest in coal resources. For the Navajo Nation, coal mining represents a significant source of jobs and revenue that supports essential services for tribal members.

Market Challenges

Despite policy support, the coal industry continues to face significant challenges that may influence auction participation. Competition from natural gas remains intense, with gas-fired generation often displacing coal in electricity markets due to cost advantages and operational flexibility.

The ongoing decline in coal-fired electricity generation capacity nationwide presents a fundamental demand challenge. As older coal plants retire without replacement, the domestic market for thermal coal continues to shrink, potentially limiting interest in new reserves.

International market pressures and fluctuating demand for thermal coal add another layer of uncertainty. While export markets provide opportunities for some US coal producers, they also introduce exposure to global price volatility and competition from major exporters like Australia and Indonesia.

Rising renewable energy deployment and cost competitiveness further complicates the long-term outlook for coal. As wind, solar, and battery storage technologies continue to advance, their role in electricity generation expands, potentially limiting coal's future market share.

What Environmental Concerns Surround the Coal Leasing Program?

The renewed coal leasing initiative has drawn criticism from environmental organizations concerned about climate impacts and ecological consequences. These groups argue that expanding coal production contradicts climate goals and risks creating stranded assets as the energy transition progresses.

Climate Impact Considerations

Environmental advocates have expressed alarm about the long-term implications of new coal leases. Emma Yip, attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, warned the leases are ""really only working to prop up a dying industry by locking in coal reserves that won't even be mined until we're well into the second half of the century.""

This criticism highlights concerns about long-term carbon emissions from newly leased reserves. Since federal coal leases typically last 20 years and can be extended as long as commercial production continues, resources leased today could be mined for decades, potentially conflicting with future emissions reduction targets.

Questions about alignment with international climate commitments have also emerged. Critics argue that expanding fossil fuel production on federal lands contradicts broader policy goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with international agreements.

The potential for stranded assets represents another concern as the global energy transition continues. If market conditions or policy environments change significantly in coming years, companies investing in new coal leases today could face challenges recovering their investments.

Environmental Review Process

Despite streamlining efforts, leases remain subject to federal environmental assessments. These reviews evaluate potential impacts on air and water quality, wildlife habitat, cultural resources, and other environmental factors before final approvals are granted.

Public comment periods remain required before final approvals, allowing community members, environmental groups, and other stakeholders to provide input on proposed leases. These comments must be considered and addressed in final decision documents.

State and federal permitting requirements still apply beyond the lease issuance itself. Mining operations must secure additional permits addressing specific environmental protections, mine reclamation innovation plans, and operational constraints.

Ongoing legal challenges to regulatory changes add another layer of complexity and uncertainty to the leasing process. Several environmental organizations have filed or threatened litigation challenging aspects of the revived leasing program, potentially affecting implementation timelines.

How Does Coal Fit Into America's Changing Energy Landscape?

The coal industry's position in the US energy mix continues to evolve amid competing priorities and technological changes. While some advocate for coal's continued role in providing reliable baseload power, others point to its declining share in electricity generation and environmental impacts.

Energy Security Arguments

Administration officials have cited the need for reliable baseload power generation as a key justification for supporting coal. Unlike some intermittent renewable sources, coal plants can operate continuously and predictably, providing stability to the electrical grid.

Concerns about grid stability during extreme weather events have intensified following several high-profile power disruptions in recent years. Coal advocates argue that maintaining fuel diversity, including coal capacity, enhances resilience during periods of stress on the energy system.

Domestic resource utilization reducing foreign energy dependence represents another security-focused argument for maintaining coal production. The abundant domestic coal reserves provide an energy source not subject to international supply disruptions or price manipulation.

Coal stockpiles provide an energy security buffer that few other generation sources can match. The ability to store substantial fuel reserves on-site at coal plants offers protection against supply chain disruptions that might affect natural gas or petroleum-based generation.

Artificial Intelligence and Electricity Demand

One of the newest arguments for maintaining coal capacity centers on growing electricity demand from data centers and AI applications. These facilities require enormous amounts of reliable electricity, with some large AI computing centers consuming as much power as small cities.

The debate over meeting peak load requirements with intermittent renewables has intensified as electricity demand forecasts have been revised upward. Some analysts question whether renewable deployment can scale quickly enough to meet this growing demand without maintaining conventional generation capacity, including coal.

This growing demand has sparked renewed debate over the appropriate energy mix for reliability and sustainability. Coal industry representatives argue that premature retirement of coal assets could leave the grid vulnerable to supply shortfalls as electricity demand accelerates.

Coal is increasingly positioned as a potential solution for baseload power needs in this high-growth scenario. Proponents argue that its reliable generation profile and abundant domestic supplies make it well-suited to support the expansion of data centers and AI applications, particularly in regions where renewable resources are less abundant.

What Economic Impacts Could Result From Expanded Coal Mining?

The economic implications of coal lease expansion extend beyond the mining companies to affect local communities, government revenues, and broader economic sectors. These impacts vary significantly by region and depend on the scale of development that ultimately occurs.

Community Economic Benefits

Potential job creation in rural mining communities represents one of the most frequently cited benefits of coal development. Mining jobs typically offer higher wages compared to other available employment in rural areas, with positions often paying $70,000-$100,000 annually including benefits.

Tax revenue generation for local governments provides funding for essential services like schools, roads, and public safety. In many rural counties with significant mining activity, resource taxes form a substantial portion of the local government budget.

Indirect economic activity through supply chains and services creates a multiplier effect, with each direct mining job typically supporting multiple additional positions in transportation, equipment supply, maintenance services, and local retail and hospitality businesses.

Infrastructure development in mining regions often accompanies major coal projects. Companies frequently invest in road improvements, railroad spurs, water systems, and other infrastructure that can benefit the broader community beyond the mine itself.

Revenue Generation

Federal royalty payments at the newly established 7% rate will generate ongoing revenue throughout the production life of leased resources. These payments are based on the value of coal produced and represent a direct financial return to taxpayers from public resources.

Bonus bids during competitive lease sales provide immediate upfront revenue. These one-time payments, which can range from thousands to millions of dollars depending on the tract's size and quality, are made by the winning bidder to secure the lease rights.

State severance taxes on coal production create another revenue stream that directly benefits state budgets. These taxes vary by state but typically range from 2-10% of production value, funding education, infrastructure, and other state priorities.

Local property and sales tax benefits accrue from both mining operations themselves and the economic activity they generate. Property taxes on mining equipment and facilities provide steady revenue to local governments, while increased commercial activity boosts sales tax collections.

How Are International Coal Markets Influencing US Production Decisions?

Global coal market dynamics significantly impact the economic viability of US coal production and export opportunities. International demand, price trends, and competition from other major producing countries all influence domestic production decisions and investment in new leases.

Export Market Opportunities

Metallurgical coal demand for global steel production represents the most valuable export opportunity for US coal producers. Premium US met coal commands higher prices in international markets, particularly in regions with growing steel industries like Asia and parts of Europe.

Thermal coal exports to countries expanding coal-fired generation, particularly in Asia and parts of Africa, offer additional market opportunities. While environmental policies in many developed nations are reducing coal use, several developing economies continue to build new coal capacity.

Competition with major coal exporters like Australia, Indonesia, and Russia presents challenges for US producers. These countries often have lower production costs, more favorable transportation logistics to key Asian markets, or specific quality advantages for certain applications.

Shipping costs and logistics significantly affect competitiveness in international markets. US coal faces higher transportation costs to reach Asian markets compared to Australian or Indonesian suppliers, creating a structural disadvantage that must be overcome through quality premiums or other factors.

Global Policy Considerations

International climate policies affecting coal demand trajectories create uncertainty for long-term investment decisions. As more countries implement carbon pricing, emissions limits, or other climate policies, the outlook for coal demand becomes increasingly complex and regionally differentiated.

Energy transition timelines varying by region and country create a patchwork of market opportunities and risks. While some developed economies have established clear coal phase-out timelines, other regions anticipate continued or even expanded coal use for decades.

Coal phase-out commitments in developed economies, particularly in Europe and parts of North America, have reduced traditional export markets for US coal. These policy-driven changes have forced producers to seek alternative customers in emerging markets.

Growing coal consumption in developing Asian markets, particularly India and Southeast Asian nations, partially offsets declining demand elsewhere. These economies continue to build new coal-fired generation capacity to meet rising electricity demand, creating potential export opportunities for US producers.

What Does the Future Hold for Federal Coal Leasing?

The long-term outlook for federal coal leasing remains uncertain, with multiple factors potentially influencing its trajectory. Political, market, technological, and policy considerations will all shape the future landscape for coal development on public lands.

Policy Stability Questions

Potential for policy reversals under future administrations creates significant uncertainty for long-term investment decisions. The history of oscillating energy policies between administrations makes companies cautious about commitments that might span multiple presidential terms.

Legal challenges to regulatory changes could modify or delay implementation of the current leasing program. Environmental organizations have filed lawsuits challenging various aspects of federal coal policy, and court decisions could significantly impact how the program proceeds.

Congressional oversight and legislative actions may also influence the program's direction. Changes in congressional control could lead to new legislation affecting coal leasing, mining regulations, climate policy, or other factors relevant to coal development.

State-level energy and environmental policies create another layer of complexity, as states maintain substantial authority over mining permits, water quality regulations, and other aspects of coal development regardless of federal leasing policies.

Market Evolution Factors

Long-term electricity demand growth projections will substantially influence coal's future role. If electricity consumption accelerates dramatically due to AI, data centers, and electrification of transportation and heating, the pressure to maintain diverse generation sources, including coal, may increase.

Renewable energy cost trajectories and deployment rates continue to improve, potentially further eroding coal's market position. If solar, wind, and storage technologies maintain their historical cost reduction trends, they may increasingly outcompete coal generation on purely economic grounds.

Natural gas price forecasts and production trends represent another critical variable. Should natural gas prices rise significantly from current levels, coal's competitiveness in electricity markets could improve, potentially increasing interest in new coal resources.

Carbon capture technology development and deployment could dramatically alter coal's environmental profile and market prospects. If these technologies become economically viable at scale, they could enable continued coal use while addressing climate concerns, potentially extending the life of the coal industry.

FAQ: US Coal Auctions and Mining Policy

How much coal is being offered in the current federal auctions?

The current auctions across Alabama, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming include approximately 586.8 million tons of recoverable coal resources. The largest portions are in Wyoming (365 million tons) and Montana (167.5 million tons), with smaller amounts in Alabama (53 million tons) and Utah (1.29 million tons).

These resources range from metallurgical coal used in steelmaking to thermal coal for electricity generation, representing diverse quality characteristics and potential applications. The total offering would support multiple decades of mining at typical production rates.

Who can participate in federal coal lease auctions?

Qualified coal mining companies, including both domestic and foreign-owned entities operating in the US, can participate in the competitive bidding process. Participants must meet financial and operational qualification requirements established by the Bureau of Land Management to ensure they have the capability to develop the resources responsibly.

Companies must demonstrate financial solvency, technical capability to develop the resource, and compliance with various legal requirements. The BLM evaluates these qualifications before allowing companies to participate in the auction process.

What happens to the money generated from coal lease sales?

Revenue from coal lease sales includes both upfront bonus bids and ongoing royalty payments (currently 7% of production value). These funds are typically split between the federal government and the state where the coal is located, with states receiving approximately 50% of the proceeds in most cases.

The federal portion funds various government programs, while the state share typically supports education, infrastructure, and other public services. This revenue-sharing arrangement provides direct financial benefits to coal-producing states from resources developed within their boundaries.

How long do coal leases typically last?

Federal coal leases generally have an initial term of 20 years and can be extended as long as the lease is producing coal in commercial quantities. Companies must meet diligent development requirements, typically beginning production within 10 years of lease issuance, to maintain their lease rights.

If commercial production ceases for an extended period, the lease may be subject to termination. This structure encourages timely development of leased resources while allowing for long-term operations once production begins.

What environmental reviews are required before mining can begin?

Even after obtaining a lease, companies must complete extensive environmental impact assessments, secure mining permits from state and federal agencies, develop reclamation plans, and address potential impacts to water, air, wildlife, and cultural resources before mining operations can commence.

These processes typically involve multiple regulatory agencies, public comment periods, and detailed technical studies. The requirements ensure that environmental considerations are thoroughly evaluated and appropriate mitigation measures are implemented before ground-disturbing activities begin.

The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) establishes minimum federal standards for coal mining operations and reclamation, while state regulatory programs often impose additional requirements specific to local conditions. Together, these regulations govern how mining activities are conducted and how disturbed areas are restored after mining is complete.

The evolution of mining trends continues to influence how these operations are managed, with increasing focus on sustainability and minimizing environmental impacts throughout the mining lifecycle.

The context makes it worse. Here’s what Wright said: “Texas has the fastest rising wholesale electricity prices of any region in the country, 100 percent rise in wholesale prices from the start of the Biden administration to today.”

That is objectively false.

The fastest rising wholesale costs of any region?! Has he heard of PJM?

Here are some facts, which one would hope the Secretary of Energy would have access to:

According to ERCOT’s Independent Market Monitor, adjusted for inflation, wholesale prices in 2024 were lower than 2020, which was the COVID year. To repeat, not only are prices not up 100% from 4-5 years ago, they are actually lower.

There were three high-priced years: 2021 (due to Winter Storm Uri), 2022 (due to higher gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine), and 2023 (due to the second-hottest summer in recorded Texas history and a dearth of solar and batteries to provide electricity during peak and net peak periods, respectively).

Costs in 2024 – Texas’ sixth-hottest summer – were 50% lower than 2023. It was, according to ERCOT and the IMM, one of the lowest-cost years in the history of the Texas market.

Don’t take my word for it. Here’s the Independent Market Monitor’s data:

And 2025 is shaping up to be another year of relatively low wholesale electricity costs in Texas. As the Energy Information Agency has shown, wholesale prices in ERCOT have been far lower than the national average each of the last two summers:

And the cost of ancillary services this summer were stunningly low, mostly due to batteries:

Wright can hate renewables; it doesn’t make sense but that’s his right. But he can’t – or at the very least shouldn’t – misinform or mislead the public.

Outdated Thinking

Here’s more from Wright last week:

“So the electricity grid doesn’t just collect electrons and store them somewhere. It has to match supply and demand at every second.”

That is an actual quote from the Secretary of Energy of the United States of America – who apparently isn’t aware that batteries exist.

Battery storage was absolutely essential this summer in helping Texas avoid price spikes and energy emergencies, as the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, Houston Chronicle, and others have reported in recent weeks.

Over just a couple of years, battery storage resources on the ERCOT grid have scaled at a staggering pace: Texas now has enough battery capacity to equal 15% of peak demand; it’ll be nearly 20% by the end of the year.

And that’s just utility-scale – there’s another gigawatt of distributed storage in homes and garages across the state, plus 20 gigawatts more rolling around in electric vehicles; with the right price signals, EV batteries also could be deployed to the grid in times of scarcity, as stationary storage is doing today.

The phenomenal growth of battery storage resources are transforming grids around the world. In the ERCOT market, operators are storing up low-cost power – including but not limited to renewables – every day. That power is then available when demand is high and supply is scarce.

ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas told me batteries are one of the most “innovative things that has happened to the electric grid since the invention of the electric grid.”

Batteries increase grid reliability and resiliency while lowering costs.

The Secretary of Energy, of all people, should know that we can, in fact, store power now.

Costs, Costs, Costs

Across the country, energy inflation is weighing on consumers and slowing the economy. Wright himself has said it’s a liability for the Administration.

But he’s taking a bad situation and making it worse.

Study after study has demonstrated the role that Texas’ nation-leading renewables are playing in containing energy costs. Studies released this spring – amid a fusillade of baffling anti-energy attacks in the Texas Legislature – showed that shutting down renewables in Texas would dramatically increase the risk of blackouts and increase wholesale market costs in ERCOT by $115 billion over 15 years.

Another study showed that the Administration’s anti-energy actions could make Texas businesses’ power costs go up 54%.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is among the many voices urging the Trump Administration to end its attacks on renewables: “ America needs every possible electron it can get, from any source, to ensure affordable and reliable energy,” the Chamber declared last month.

That’s because employers have to live in the real world, where AI and data centers are helping to drive demand ever higher and consumers are dealing with rising costs and energy inflation.

Secretary Wright should join us in that real world where wholesale power prices in Texas are the lowest they’ve been in a long time. Texas has a diverse resource mix that’s working.

Secretary Wright shouldn’t mess with Texas, especially with made up stats.

After years of battling misguided, top-down mandates from California regulators, common sense prevailed, freeing fleets, manufacturers, and drivers to pursue real, sustainable progress in reducing emissions.

For too long, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) attempted to dictate national policy by isolating industries, coercing manufacturers, and imposing one-size-fits-all solutions. The 2023 Clean Truck Partnership (CTP) was a prime example: a regulatory straitjacket that sought to strip companies of their rights, destabilize supply chains, and force fleets down an uneconomic path toward electric trucks that were unready for prime time.

That chapter is now closed. In a bipartisan victory for both the environment and the economy, Congress and President Trump revoked California’s special waivers and reaffirmed that EPA—not Sacramento—sets America’s emissions standards. With that, the CTP collapsed, restoring a level playing field and clearing the way for the trucking industry to continue advancing proven, practical solutions.

And the wins didn’t stop there. This summer, truck manufacturers including Daimler, International, Paccar, and Volvo formally walked away from the CTP, rejecting coercion and recommitting to working with their customers on technologies that actually work. This decision is already paying dividends: carriers once again have confidence that their investments in equipment will be grounded in sound science and market realities.

While CARB clings to ideology, the trucking industry continues to deliver results:

Clean Diesel Leadership: Thanks to decades of innovation, today’s trucks are 99% cleaner for particulate matter and NOx emissions than those built decades ago. Sixty new trucks today emit as much as just one truck did in 1988.

SmartWay Success: Since 2004, the EPA’s voluntary SmartWay program has helped carriers save more than four billion gallons of fuel, reduce 379 million barrels of oil consumption, and slash carbon emissions, all without mandates.

Phase 1 & 2 Standards: Supported by ATA, these commonsense fuel efficiency regulations are projected to reduce oil consumption by 2.5 billion barrels, saving the industry $220 billion in fuel costs between 2014 and 2027 and cutting CO2 emissions by 1.37 billion metric tons.

Promising Alternatives: Renewable diesel is already proving to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions more effectively than electric trucks at a fraction of the cost and without the infrastructure challenges.

Other Major Wins for Trucking and the Environment

The summer of 2025 also delivered two other big victories for environmental progress:

Proposed Repeal of the Federal EV Truck Mandate: The Biden-era “Phase 3” rule would have forced fleets into electric trucks regardless of cost or feasibility. Its proposed repeal, if enacted, will be a victory for common sense. This decision ensures that emissions standards are based on what’s achievable and effective, not political ideology.

Fixing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Guidance: EPA’s move to address DEF system failures was another example of practical policymaking. Previously, these failures could trigger dramatic engine derates, stranding trucks and disrupting supply chains. We’re thankful to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for recognizing the problem and delivering a solution that keeps trucks moving while protecting the environment.

The message from this summer is clear: when government respects the role of markets, innovation, and collaboration, the trucking industry delivers. Environmental progress does not come from coercion or ideology. It comes from empowering fleets and manufacturers to do what they’ve always done: drive America forward with cleaner, more efficient technology.

As we turn the page on the CTP and California’s failed experiment in government expansionism, we remain committed to protecting the environment, strengthening the economy, and ensuring that common sense rather than bureaucratic overreach guides us forward.",https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/styles/featured_image/public/2023-12/Energy%20and%20Environment.jpg?h=56a25956&itok=1itCXci1,N,,2025-10-01 18:02:15.263606

In Detail : India’s solar manufacturing sector saw significant growth in the first half of 2025, adding 44.2 GW of module capacity and 7.5 GW of cell production. This surge is fueled by a strong 186 GW project pipeline planned through 2027 and ambitious government targets for 2030, highlighting the country’s commitment to expanding domestic solar capabilities and supporting renewable energy transition.

TOPCon technology dominated the new module additions, contributing 39.9 GW, followed by 3 GW of monocrystalline modules. For the first time, heterojunction (HJT) module capacity of 1.2 GW was introduced, reflecting India’s push toward advanced, high-efficiency solar technologies to meet both domestic and export demand.

As of June 2025, 91.5 GW of module production and 13.1 GW of cell production had received ALMM certification, ensuring compliance with India’s domestic manufacturing policies. These certifications aim to support local manufacturing, encourage investment, and align with the government’s vision of building a robust domestic solar supply chain over the next decade.

Indian manufacturers currently have 182 GW of module capacity and 86 GW of cell capacity under construction, scheduled for commissioning by 2027. Additionally, 97 GW of modules and 84.7 GW of cell capacity have been announced for future expansion, expected to come online by 2030 or earlier, demonstrating long-term planning and commitment.

India imported 44.6 GW of solar modules and cells in H1 2025, with cells accounting for 66% and modules 34% of the imports. Despite rising domestic manufacturing, the sector remains dependent on imports for raw materials like polysilicon, highlighting the need to scale up local production and reduce supply chain vulnerabilities.

Exports remained modest, with nearly 3 GW of modules and 83 MW of cells shipped primarily to the United States. However, U.S. tariffs of 50% on Indian solar panels have affected export volumes, creating challenges for manufacturers who previously relied on overseas markets to absorb production capacity and drive technology upgrades.

Many Indian factories are currently operating at just 25% of their total capacity, indicating underutilization despite rapid capacity additions. This gap underscores the importance of policy support, investment incentives, and infrastructure development to fully realize the country’s solar manufacturing potential and achieve efficiency gains.

Government initiatives, clean energy mandates, and domestic procurement policies are playing a critical role in sustaining growth. Incentives and regulatory frameworks are encouraging manufacturers to expand, adopt advanced technologies, and compete with global players while contributing to India’s climate and energy goals.

Looking ahead, India aims to reach 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with nearly 170 GW of projects already underway. The next few years will be crucial as the country strengthens its domestic solar manufacturing base, reduces import dependency, and solidifies its position as a major player in the global clean energy transition.",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Solar-Manufacturing5.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 19:01:44.779414

Climate change is the biggest threat facing our ocean. Every day we see its alarming effects on ocean ecosystems and coastal communities: intense ocean heat waves, coral reefs bleaching, melting sea ice, habitat changes, sea life population declines and devastating damage due to stronger and more frequent hurricanes. Each one is a grave reminder that to protect our ocean, we must address climate change. Our most promising strategy is to transition away from harmful oil and gas to responsible clean energy.

Luckily, ocean-based climate solutions can help solve the climate crisis. According to the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy the ocean has the potential to contribute as much as one-third of the annual greenhouse gas emission cuts needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C., through restoring coastal and marine ecosystems, decarbonizing maritime transportation, scaling marine renewable energy and others.

The most significant of these opportunities is ending fossil fuels and shifting to clean ocean energy.

At Ocean Conservancy, we believe a responsible, rapid and just transition to the ocean as a source of 100% clean energy by 2050 is both possible and essential. Through science-based research, smart policy, accessible finance and global collaboration, we can create a better future—one where our ocean is healthy, marine wildlife is resilient and protected from climate change, and clean ocean energy supports our country’s energy needs while providing good paying jobs with cleaner air and water for all.

Let’s change course

Protecting the ocean, us and our planet from climate change will take a comprehensive shift away from harmful oil and gas to responsible clean ocean energy. This transition will require coordinated, long-term strategies including: responsible planning, with no future oil and gas leases, a global reduction in plastic production, and smart structuring of offshore wind development to be safe for marine life; a reconfiguration of ocean energy financing, including phasing out oil and gas subsidies, and mobilizing funding for marine renewable energy; and smart end-of-life processes for infrastructure in the ocean are safer and more accountable.

She’s now working as a cybersecurity defense analyst on their global cybersecurity incident response team out of Houston, Texas.
“Chevron is an energy company, and energy runs America.
Cybersecurity is incredibly important in the energy industry and has a larger role in that than you might think.
She also served as vice president of the Society of Women Engineers and as fundraising chair for Women in Computer Science.","Meet Arushi Ghildiyal who recently graduated from LSU with a degree in cybersecurity at 20 years old and is now working for one of the nation’s best cybersecurity teams at Chevron.

Last year around this time, LSU alumna Arushi Ghildiyal from Dallas, Texas, walked into her first hardcore hacking class at LSU, Software Vulnerabilities and Exploitation. There, she realized her passion for what’s known in the cybersecurity world as “red-teaming,” or going on offense to find weaknesses in networks, software, and hardware. Even before graduating with her bachelor’s degree in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity from LSU in May, Ghildiyal was hired by Chevron. She’s now working as a cybersecurity defense analyst on their global cybersecurity incident response team out of Houston, Texas.

“I returned to the same company I interned with last summer, so I knew it’s a place where I want to work,” Ghildiyal said. “Chevron is an energy company, and energy runs America. Cybersecurity is incredibly important in the energy industry and has a larger role in that than you might think. If an attacker shuts down the energy industry, they shut down a lot of things for a lot of people—a lot could go wrong.”

“We work with Chevron’s team at Volexity and they are insanely skilled. The fact we have a student there fulltime right out of school is crazy.”

Andrew Case, director of research at Volexity, a cybersecurity firm specializing in threat intelligence and incident response, and industry liaison for cybersecurity at LSU since 2017

At LSU, Ghildiyal was able to finish her undergraduate degree in just three years by stacking opportunities. Earning an average of 18 course credits per semester—the equivalent of six classes—Ghildiyal put herself on the academic fast-track while also dedicating time to cyber research, service, and clubs to build her network and gain hands-on experience.

As a freshman, Ghildiyal helped LSU researchers Ibrahim “Abe” Baggili and Andrew Webb launch their project to secure virtual and augmented reality applications for U.S. military missions and training, funded by a $600K Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, grant. That research recently led to a published paper at USENIX Security ’25. Also in her freshmen year, Ghildiyal served as an ambassador for the Society of Women Engineers at LSU.

“Getting involved in clubs was really important for me because I came from Dallas, so coming to LSU, I knew nobody,” Ghildiyal said. “Getting involved in the community really helped me stay motivated and make friends, and I also learned a lot about communication and leadership.”

Networking and “talking to everyone” at LSU career fairs earned her three offers for internships her first summer. She chose International Paper in Memphis, Tennessee, because it had the strongest cyber focus.

“That summer, I got a hands-on look at different types of potential exploits and vulnerabilities,” Ghildiyal said. “I was essentially making data more accessible for International Paper’s cybersecurity teams to better respond to different findings.”

In her sophomore year, which also was her junior year, Ghildiyal joined the first cohort of students who were trained by LSU and the university’s industry partner TekStream to work in the LSU-hosted Security Operations Center, or SOC, which now protects almost all higher education in Louisiana from cyber threats. She also served as vice president of the Society of Women Engineers and as fundraising chair for Women in Computer Science.

“My most impactful class that year was Operating Systems,” Ghildiyal said. “The biggest thing I both liked and disliked was learning there’s no perfect design in operating systems. There’s no perfect solution. Everything just depends on what you want, and everything has security implications. You want peak performance? Great, but those speed gains will come with security tradeoffs. You want super secure? Sure, but stronger security checks and protections can increase overhead.”

As an incoming senior, Ghildiyal joined the LSU Cybersecurity Clinic to help secure small businesses in Louisiana, which also helped her get certified as a GIAC Certified Enterprise Defender. She also completed her pivotal internship with Chevron, where she helped increase cyberattack detection coverage and build an AI security assistant.

“I also helped set up another AI to help our teams respond faster,” Ghildiyal said. “I helped with their threat detection system—just consolidating everything and running gap analyses. We were able to identify blind spots where we were missing detections and test areas where we had detections that hadn’t been hit before.”

“In cybersecurity, it’s critical to have visibility into everything, so I was able to do some dashboarding as well,” Ghildiyal continued. “Just helping with triage to identify and respond more quickly to things.”

During her senior year, Ghildiyal served as president for Women in Computer Science, hosting the largest LSU hackathon ever in collaboration with the Security Society at LSU. She was also the LSU chapter lead for Women in Cybersecurity while hosting cyber workshops for other students (“Intro to Defensive Networking,” “Breaking into Cybersecurity: From Infosec to Ethical Hacking”) and competing in national capture-the-flag events (Penn State SillyCTF, WiCyS CTF, AWS Security Jam).

“In just a couple of years, Arushi went from walking into her first hacking class at LSU to defending one of the nation’s most critical industries at Chevron. Her success is proof that when talent meets opportunity, our students don’t just graduate, they lead, and they win.”

The pace of change in the U.S. power sector is speeding up.

Dramatic federal policy and funding reversals on fossil fuels and renewables are challenging the industry’s ability to adapt at a time of rising demand and rapid technological advancement. Tariffs, supply chain snarls and rising global temperatures complicate the sector’s response.

At the same time, distributed energy resources and ever-more-sophisticated software are making the grid more flexible, allowing for creative solutions to these and other system strains. Energy professionals, experts, government officials and other stakeholders will come together at conferences in 2026 to share knowledge, network and innovate.

So why are forecasters expecting Baton Rouge to see more than 2% growth?
Forecasters point to a very bullish outlook for industrial construction in the MSA.
Scott says forecasters had discussions with executives of three area firms, which alone plan to add at least 10,000 jobs over the next two years.
Forecasters’ optimism regarding the Capital Region is based on some $21.3 billion in announced industrial projects that have issued final investment decisions.","The Baton Rouge metro could gain 10,500 jobs next year and another 11,100 in 2027, making the area the fastest growing in the state in absolute growth, according to the latest version of the Louisiana Economic Forecast led by economist Loren Scott.

While Scott expects the state’s economy to operate in an environment of slow national economic growth, he predicts Louisiana will add 74,500 jobs over the two-year span, finally breaking through the 2 million mark this year and continuing into 2027.

He writes that several major uncertainties cloud forecasters’ view of the future, including the national economy, oil prices and interest rates. Generally, a 1.5% workforce growth rate is considered good. So why are forecasters expecting Baton Rouge to see more than 2% growth? Forecasters point to a very bullish outlook for industrial construction in the MSA. Baton Rouge is the headquarters for several large industrial contractors, including Turner Industries, Performance Contractors, Cajun Industries, MM&R, ISC, the Newtron Group, who are expected to rapidly build up their workforces following recent announcements of final investment decisions.

Scott says forecasters had discussions with executives of three area firms, which alone plan to add at least 10,000 jobs over the next two years. In addition, the Greater Baton Rouge Industrial Alliance also completed a survey of firms in the MSA and estimated construction worker demand will increase from 22,191 in the second quarter of 2025 to 39,921 by the third quarter of 2026—an increase of 17,730 workers.

Forecasters’ optimism regarding the Capital Region is based on some $21.3 billion in announced industrial projects that have issued final investment decisions. While a majority of those projects are planned for Ascension Parish, the parish is still poised for additional future growth. Some 17,000 acres of riverfront property are available for new projects in the parish’s new tax increment financing district, the RiverPlex MegaPark, on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

LSU leads the MSA in nonindustrial construction, with four university-related projects driving most of the $800 million nonindustrial projects slated for the region over the next two years. “The $400 million LSU Entertainment Center was about to issue an official ‘go’ to Denver-based Oak View Group,” the report reads. “Then, the top official with that company was indicted for an alleged price-fixing scheme involving a similar project in another state. We expect this will just delay, but not terminate, this project.”",https://s25562.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Baton-Rouge-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-01 15:05:34.592794

But Trump administration officials have not acknowledged whether the E.P.A.
employees said that they were working without pay, and that Trump administration officials had not told workers how long the funding would last.
He added: “This administration should stop playing games with federal workers.”","Environmental Protection Agency employees who expected to be furloughed in the government shutdown were working on Wednesday after receiving a letter late Tuesday instructing them to “work on activities which currently have funds available.”

It was unclear how many of the 15,166 employees at the E.P.A. received the exemption notice, but union officials said that they believed it to have been nearly the entire staff.

A spokeswoman for Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said that the agency was operating under its shutdown plan. That plan, however, calls for only 1,734 employees — about 11 percent of the staff — to continue working.

Federal agencies do have balances of appropriated funds that carry over from the previous funding period. Those funds could be used to stay operational for a short time — typically a week or two — after a government shutdown. But Trump administration officials have not acknowledged whether the E.P.A. is being kept open from those funds or from other unspent money from laws passed during the Biden administration.

E.P.A. employees said that they were working without pay, and that Trump administration officials had not told workers how long the funding would last.

“Continue to work on initiatives as directed by your leadership,” Aaron Szabo, who leads E.P.A.’s air office, said in a memo to his staff on Wednesday reviewed by The New York Times. He advised that employees would be “notified if there is any change in status.”

The lack of transparency, union leaders said, has fed the chaos surrounding the Trump administration’s plans for federal workers amid the impasse between Republicans and Democrats over spending.

Real World Reaction To Tariffs

'Unpredictable' Tariff Expansions Make it Harder to Justify U.S. Investments, Automakers and Suppliers Warn

Automakers and suppliers urged the Trump administration to end ""unpredictable expansions"" of tariffs, saying they're making it harder to justify investments in the U.S. That's the message of a Sept. 16 letter to the Trump administration from automotive trade groups and associations representing other industries. The business groups criticized the recent expansion of steel and aluminum tariffs to cover more than 400 new products, including auto parts and industrial robotics, saying it was ""implemented without adequate notice"" and creates more costs and uncertainty for U.S. businesses. ""At a time when many are dealing with fragile supply chains, global competition and inflationary pressures, this process creates additional uncertainty that risks slowing growth and deterring investment in the United States,"" said the letter addressed to Jeffrey Kessler, the undersecretary for industry and security at the Commerce Department.

Underwater car trade-ins climb to highest level since 2021

A growing share of American drivers are finding themselves ""underwater"" or ""upside down"" on their auto loans, reaching a four-year high, according to data from Edmunds. More than one in four (26.6%) of new vehicle trade-ins carried negative equity during the second quarter of 2025. This is up from 26.1% in Q1 2025 and marks the highest level in four years. The last time a higher percentage was recorded was Q1 2021, when nearly a third (31.9%) of new car trade-ins were underwater. Being underwater on an auto loan isn't a new phenomenon. Still, the combination of affordability pressures, negative equity and higher interest rates is creating a challenging financial environment for American car buyers. The average amount owed on upside-down loans was $6,754, slightly lower than Q1 2025's $6,880 but up from $6,255 in Q2 2024.

California Dems scramble to boost oil production

Ford courts riskier borrowers with lower rates for F-150 pickups

Ford is racing to sell more F-150 pickups this quarter by offering lower interest rates to buyers with the weakest acceptable credit histories. The deal available until the end of the month will allow consumers with shakier credit profiles to pay the lower interest rate offered to those with stellar credit records. Ford is courting these low-credit customers as it looks for a strong close to the quarter for its best-selling pickup, which starts around $39,000 and goes to almost $80,000. Like most automakers, Ford has been largely absorbing the costs of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and auto parts to keep plants humming and sales volumes high, even as it cuts into profits.

AI will impact dealers

Most U.S. car dealers expect artificial intelligence (AI) to significantly impact their operations, with half predicting AI will cut jobs by 2030. By 2035, 87% believe AI will fully replace some human roles. Only 5% think AI will never replace dealership staff entirely. The findings come from a nationwide survey of 500 U.S. car dealers commissioned by dealer tech company Phyron. The results align with a McKinsey report predicting 400 to 800 million global jobs could be displaced by new technologies, including generative AI, within five years. Yet, workers handling complex or 'messy' tasks, i.e. those managing multiple information streams and dynamic situations, face little immediate threat from AI, according to Phyron CEO Mattias

Honda ends U.S. production of Acura ZDX EV at GM's Tennessee plant

Honda is ending U.S. production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which had been scheduled to begin its 2026 model year production this month at General Motors' Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee, according to information obtained by the Detroit Free Press. The company said the decision reflects current market conditions for electric vehicles and its long-term strategic priorities. The automaker confirmed that production of the Honda Prologue, another electric model assembled by GM in Mexico, will continue. Honda said the ZDX provided a foundation for its electrification strategy and will be followed by the all-electric Acura RSX, set to launch in Ohio in the second half of 2026, along with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development.

Aggressive driving changes

Some aggressive driving behaviors have increased over the past decade while others have actually fallen, but nearly all drivers say they've engaged in them. AAA discovered the trends in a recent update of a study its Foundation for Traffic Safety first conducted in 2016. Comparing today's results with the original, it found aggressive driving feeds on itself. Since 2016, cutting off fellow motorists has jumped 67% and honking in anger 47%, according to this year's study. That's particularly concerning because AAA said it found that the more drivers experience others' aggression on the road, the more likely they are to drive aggressively themselves.

In two landmark cases, the court will soon have the opportunity to reassert the federal government’s authority over questions of national energy and environmental policy.

Environmental groups believe that energy use increases global temperatures, causes sea levels to rise and creates more destructive weather. Their campaign to curtail energy has taken many forms — including asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to block pipelines and the Interior Department to deny oil and gas leases — but it met a roadblock with the 2024 election and the Trump administration’s subsequent blizzard of executive orders lifting overregulation.

Rather than pursue their interests in Congress or before the electorate, environmental extremists have now allied with bankrupt cities and trial lawyers to use the courts to shake down the energy industry. Blue cities and states have filed tort suits in state courts to extract money for allegedly causing weather-related costs in their jurisdictions.

The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to take up one of those cases, Boulder County v. Suncor Energy, following a ruling this year from the Colorado Supreme Court that allowed the county’s case to move forward in state court. Borrowing theories of liability from tobacco and opioid litigation, Boulder alleges that energy companies sold their products without disclosing climate risks. Such claims plainly intrude on federal authority over interstate pollution.

Other climate cases are still progressing in lower state courts. In Hawaii, summary judgment motions are pending in a case seeking damages for rising sea levels. Hawaii’s highest court allowed this litigation to move forward in 2023 with Justice Todd Eddins issuing a remarkable concurrence, declaring that litigation would proceed under the “Aloha Spirit,” regardless of federal precedent.

In Rhode Island, the state judge presiding over a similar lawsuit against the energy industry compared it to developing nations devastated by natural disasters, citing Kenya, Tanzania and the Seychelles. The suggestion that Rhode Island has suffered comparable “severe destruction” is telling: judges are inflating rhetoric to justify climate claims, not grounding them in law.

Meanwhile, other states are effectively trying to replace federal authority over environmental policy. In Louisiana, plaintiffs obtained a $750 million judgment (potentially over $1 billion with interest) against Chevron for coastal erosion that they claimed was caused by oil extraction during World War II. Those companies had been under federal contracts to supply aviation fuel for the war effort. Yet eight decades later, Louisiana claims it can punish those practices retroactively.

The energy firms sought to move the case to federal court because of its genesis in work for the federal government. But a divided 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel refused to allow it. As Judge Andrew Oldham rightly noted in dissent, crude oil extraction plainly “relates to” war production. If states can sue private businesses for their wartime work generations later, future cooperation with the federal government will be chilled, raising the costs of national defense. This coming term, the Supreme Court will review the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

Despite some disappointing rulings from activist judges, a growing number of state courts are beginning to resist such frivolous claims. A Maryland judge rejected Baltimore’s lawsuit that alleged fossil fuels caused sea rises that have harmed the city; the Maryland Supreme Court will hear the appeal later in October. A South Carolina court dismissed Charleston’s similar claims, which blue city officials will almost certainly appeal as well. Likewise, nearly identical state and municipal lawsuits have been similarly dismissed in Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and New Jersey.

Notwithstanding some recent wins, climate lawfare is like Hydra — new cases are constantly being brought. Even if higher courts ultimately overturn them, simply forcing the industry to defend against these suits imposes enormous litigation costs. That alone is a victory for environmental radicals. At this stage, the Supreme Court must act to reaffirm federal authority over national energy and environmental policy.

If climate change is producing harmful effects nationwide, then the nation should decide how to address it. As the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in a 2021 case rejecting New York City’s lawsuit against Chevron, “the question before us is whether a nuisance suit seeking to recover damages for the harms caused by global greenhouse gas emissions may proceed under New York law. Our answer is simple: no.” However, they frame their aims, blue cities and states are trying to set nationwide climate policy through litigation — violating federal law and tort principles.

As the country decides how to respond to climate change, those choices — including the possibility of not acting — must have nationwide legitimacy. Courts cannot allow a handful of blue jurisdictions, aided by trial lawyers and environmental activists, to dictate those decisions for the rest of America.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Scalia.AEIdeas.031224.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 15:04:08.693629

Sustainea Bioglycols, an innovative company focused on manufacturing sustainable plant-based chemicals with a low-carbon footprint, has announced plans to invest $400 million in Lafayette, Ind. The company will work closely with Primient, a local producer of food and industrial ingredients made from plant-based, renewable sources.

Sustainea will ultimately convert corn-based dextrose precursors provided by Primient into Bio-MEG (monoethlene glycol), a chemical intermediate used in everyday products from bottles and food containers to footwear and more. The renewable feedstock will reduce the need for traditional fossil-based plastics. It integrates seamlessly into existing manufacturing and recycling processes without compromising performance or functionality.

“Investing in Lafayette allows us to do more than build this innovative technology, it means strengthening Indiana’s agricultural markets, creating new opportunities for local corn growers, and contributing to the state’s thriving agbioscience economy,” said Gustavo Sergi, CEO at Sustainea.

“Together with our partners, we are proud to position Indiana at the forefront of innovation in chemistry and also excited to see Indiana and United States of America becoming the cradle of the global transition toward sustainable and competitive packaging, textiles and apparel.”

Primient added that the area’s strong agricultural base will help production.

“Partnering with Sustainea allows us to leverage locally grown corn to reduce reliance on fossil-based plastics, delivering real value to farmers, businesses and consumers alike,” said Travis Montoya, Lafayette Plant Manager for Primient. “Our team in Lafayette is uniquely positioned to support this investment with high-quality, low-carbon dextrose and a strong agricultural base — helping increase demand for Indiana corn and support growth in the regional economy.”

Sustainea said it plans to create up to 190 new, high-wage jobs in the coming years to support its growth. Production is slated to begin in 2028.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in U.S. electric-vehicle sales following the disappearance of a critical $7,500 tax break for buyers.

“It’s a game-changer,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said during a Detroit event on Tuesday, just hours before the federal subsidy expired.

Farley said he would not be surprised if electric-car sales drop to 5% of total U.S. vehicle sales next month. That would be about half the level from August – a monthly record as consumers hurried to take advantage of the credit – and among the lowest levels in several years.

“The EV market is going to collapse in October,” said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. Japan’s Nissan is still rolling out a redesigned version of its Nissan Leaf small EV in the U.S., but Meunier expects tough competition as rival automakers strain to find buyers for their electric cars.

“That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” Meunier told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.

Congress approved a $7,500 tax credit in 2008 for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the U.S. that use certain levels of domestically sourced batteries and materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration. His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations. Trump campaigned last year on ending former President Joe Biden’s “EV mandate.”

Electric-vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University.

A SURPLUS OF UNSOLD EVs

The U.S. already lags other major car markets in EV adoption. In China, the global leader in EVs and production of batteries and their raw materials, sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have surpassed 40% in recent months. Europe’s penetration rate has hovered close to 20%.

Even with the U.S. tax credit in place, sales growth in electric cars had decelerated in the past two years, before the deadline rush this past summer. That slowdown occurred in spite of automakers launching a slew of new EV models. Electric-vehicle sales rose just 1.5% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Some dealers worry that the removal of the $7,500 tax credit will saddle them with unsold EVs.

Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a U.S. Midwest dealer group, said his group would take fewer EVs from manufacturers in the near term as his team waits to see how consumer demand shakes out.

Brad Sowers, who owns dealerships in the St. Louis, Missouri, area that sell Chevrolet, Jeep and other brands, said he thinks more-affordable EVs will continue to sell. But he worries that pricier models such as General Motors’ Chevy Silverado electric pickup truck – which can top $90,000 – will struggle.

GM and Ford are seeking to ease the blow of losing the tax incentive through programs that would allow dealers to roll the tax break into lease terms for several more months, Reuters reported this week.

Hyundai is offering $7,500 off its 2025 model-year Ioniq 5 EVs, and up to $9,800 in price reductions on 2026 model years of the vehicle, said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America.

“There was an EV market before IRA, and there’s going to be an EV market after IRA,” Parker said.

Volvo Car CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters in a recent interview that the Swedish automaker will not shift its strategy based on government policies.

“Our ambition is to be an electric company. That is not based on any tax credits or incentives. It’s based on an electric car is better for U.S. consumers.”

Automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in U.S. electric-vehicle sales following the disappearance of a critical $7,500 tax break for buyers.

""It's a game-changer,"" Ford F CEO Jim Farley said during a Detroit event on Tuesday, just hours before the federal subsidy expired.

Farley said he would not be surprised if electric-car sales drop to 5% of total U.S. vehicle sales next month. That would be about half the level from August – a monthly record as consumers hurried to take advantage of the credit – and among the lowest levels in several years.

“The EV market is going to collapse in October,” said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. Japan's Nissan 7201 is still rolling out a redesigned version of its Nissan Leaf small EV in the U.S., but Meunier expects tough competition as rival automakers strain to find buyers for their electric cars.

“That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” Meunier told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.

Congress approved a $7,500 tax credit in 2008 for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the U.S. that use certain levels of domestically sourced batteries and materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration. His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations. Trump campaigned last year on ending former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate.""

Electric-vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University.

A SURPLUS OF UNSOLD EVs

The U.S. already lags other major car markets in EV adoption. In China, the global leader in EVs and production of batteries and their raw materials, sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have surpassed 40% in recent months. Europe’s penetration rate has hovered close to 20%.

Even with the U.S. tax credit in place, sales growth in electric cars had decelerated in the past two years, before the deadline rush this past summer. That slowdown occurred in spite of automakers launching a slew of new EV models. Electric-vehicle sales rose just 1.5% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Some dealers worry that the removal of the $7,500 tax credit will saddle them with unsold EVs.

Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a U.S. Midwest dealer group, said his group would take fewer EVs from manufacturers in the near term as his team waits to see how consumer demand shakes out.

Brimstone (headquartered in Oakland) and Gallo Glass (in Modesto) are two other California companies with projects on the DOE’s cancellation list from May.

If these projects are fully cut, California will lose a crucial opportunity to modernize its manufacturing base, create high-quality jobs, and to be among the first states to produce net-zero emission cement. This comes at a time when investment in decarbonization is more important than ever to ensure that California can deliver on its emission reduction requirements while ensuring energy affordability.

These projects, to which funding had been obligated earlier this year, are already delivering benefits to their local communities. In Southern California, where National Cement had planned to use its $500 million grant to retrofit its cement plant to produce net-zero emission cement, the company has already successfully demonstrated the viability of a cleaner cement blend, LC3 (limestone-calcined clay). In June, National Ready Mixed Concrete Company completed test pours of walls and slab and found strong performance and strength while reducing emissions up to 34 percent. By replacing some conventional cement—which is very emissions-intensive to produce—with calcined clay, LC3 reduces emissions while increasing the volume of cement that a plant can produce. California imports 20 percent of its cement, some of which could be offset by in-state production of LC3.

Brimstone (headquartered in Oakland) and Gallo Glass (in Modesto) are two other California companies with projects on the DOE’s cancellation list from May. Brimstone secured a $189 million grant to build a facility to manufacture cement without process emissions at commercial scale. Gallo Glass was awarded $75 million to install a demonstration hybrid electric furnace to reduce its use of natural gas and increase recycled content in its glass bottles.

The effect of these supply-side cuts is compounded by the Republican reconciliation package clawback of nearly $32 million that had been awarded to California to help the state build highway infrastructure with clean, innovative, resilient American-made cement.

The analysis was presented by the “New Energy Alliance,” a group of 20 companies including Enpal, 1Komma5° and Octopus Energy as well as engineering company Bosch, real estate company Vonovia, metering company Techem, automotive industry company Volkswagen Group Charging (Elli) and others. Decentralised solutions describe an energy ecosystem that generates and stores energy close to the point of consumption, including PV systems, battery storage solutions, heat pumps and e-mobility based on smart and bidirectional charging. The analysis found that fast and target-oriented measures to better integrate these solutions are necessary to tap into a possible added value of 255 billion euros by 2045.

By contrast, the major focus on new gas-fired power plants as backup for renewables chosen by economy minister Katherina Reiche would not be justified. Even if gas plants have a purpose in a cost-efficient system, putting too much weight on the fossil fuel plants that run on imported natural gas comes with geopolitical risks by keeping Germany dependent on importers, the analysis concluded. Digitally connected systems based on solar and wind power, on the other hand, can stabilise the power system and strengthen the German economy as a high-tech location in markets of the future. An “interplay” between centralised and decentralised would offer the most efficient approach.

Energy company 1Komma5° commented that, besides renewable power and “needs-based” backup capacity, decentralised options should be “consistently developed as a third main pillar of Germany’s energy mix.” Individual households and small companies had the biggest potential for becoming more cost-efficient in their energy use, the company said, arguing that a more flexible demand and supply pattern could save the average household up to 1,200 euros per year.

A recent monitoring report of the German energy transition commissioned by economy minister Katherina Reiche found that the transformation generally is advancing on the right course. The monitoring labelled as a “reality check” by the minister underlined that the expansion of renewable energy sources and flexibility solutions such as storage are needed both to reach the country’s climate targets and keep the economy competitive.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-10-01 17:04:56.655717

This would be a significant change from the country’s energy mix, which has been reliant on fossil fuel production in general, and gas in particular, for many years. The graph below shows that the contributions of gas to the country’s energy mix have increased in recent years, accounting for over two-thirds of domestic electricity generation in 2024.

The report notes, however, that the current RPDP would require significant investment in new electricity generation, and leave Thailand vulnerable to foreign gas imports. It notes that US$153 billion in new investments will be needed to meet the RPDP targets, and in 2024 imported gas accounted for 40% of gas used in Thailand, up from just over 20% in 2015, and this trend is expected to continue in the years to come.

Ember recommends dramatically increasing the solar and storage targets, in particular, set out in the RPDP, calling for 89% more new solar capacity and 60% more new battery capacity. The report calls this the “cost-optimal pathway” as, while investment in new energy projects will be US$15 billion higher than under the RPDP plan, the replacement of gas generation capacity with new solar and storage projects will cut power generation costs by US$1.8 billion.

The report also calls for a lowering of gas consumption by 11%, compared to RPDP figures. This would reduce fuel costs by US$16 billion compared to the RPDP scenario, meaning that the combination of greater solar and storage investments, and a lower reliance on gas imports, would generate a net saving in new energy investments, while improving the resilience of the country’s grid.

“Emerging countries are at a crossroads of meeting a rising electricity demand at affordable costs to drive the economy while cutting emissions for sustainability goals,” explained Ember energy analyst and lead author of the report, Lam Pham.

“Solar, coupled with battery storage, represents the optimal pathway to address this trilemma. The energy transition of Thailand towards home-grown renewables could lower energy costs, cut emissions and strengthen energy security by mitigating dependence on fossil fuel imports.”

The report also notes that there is likely to be considerable demand for new electricity generation from electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and data centre deployments. Ember expects data centres alone to increase electricity demand by 10TWh by 2037, with the market to grow by a combined annual growth rate of as much as 8.5% between 2025 and 2027, while EVs are expected to account for one-fifth of the country’s electricity demand by 2037.

Ember said that solar and storage ought to be the “foundation” of the country’s changing energy mix, which could be prone to “demand spikes or renewable shortfalls” in the coming years.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sungrow-Thailand.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 16:02:44.650431

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published proposed revisions to the procedural framework rule for conducting risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) on September 23, 2025, 90 Fed. Reg. 45690. The proposed rule seeks to overhaul significant portions of the 2024 Biden-era rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 37028 (May 3, 2024), 40 C.F.R. Part 702, Subpart B, citing the need for a more efficient evaluation process that can be completed within the statutory timeframes. That 2024 rule had revised the first Trump EPA’s version of the Risk Evaluation Framework Rule, 82 Fed. Reg. 33726 (July 20, 2017). The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) website indicates that EPA expects to issue a final rule in April 2026.

The preamble to the proposed rule states that the proposed revisions specifically target changes made in the 2024 final rule that may not be consistent with the best reading of TSCA and that may impede the timely completion of risk evaluations, unnecessarily impairing the effective and efficient protection of health and the environment. The preamble also frequently references issues raised during the public comment period for the Biden-era rule as support for seeking to ease the regulatory burden associated with risk evaluations.

The proposed rule includes the following proposed revisions:

A requirement for EPA to make a determination of unreasonable risk for each of the conditions of use within the scope of the chemical’s risk evaluation, instead of a single risk determination on the chemical substance as a whole.

Changes as to how EPA will consider occupational exposure controls such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and industrial controls when conducting risk evaluations and making risk determinations.

Changes regarding EPA’s discretionary authority to determine which conditions of use, exposure routes, and exposure pathways it will consider in a risk evaluation.

Revisions to certain regulatory definitions.

Revisions to the procedures and requirements EPA would follow when revising or supplementing risk evaluation documents.

Amendments to the process and requirements that manufacturers (including importers) are required to follow when they request an Agency-conducted TSCA risk evaluation.

Comments on the proposed changes are due by November 7, 2025.

Proposed Revisions

Risk Determinations by Condition of Use

Chief among the proposed changes is the elimination of the “whole chemical” approach to risk evaluations. The Risk Evaluation Framework Rule adopted by the first Trump administration in 2017 provided that EPA “will determine whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment under each condition of use.” In practice, this amounted to individual risk determinations for each condition of use. In 2021, the Biden EPA announced a different approach, stating, “The agency plans to make the determination of unreasonable risk just once for the whole chemical when it is clear the majority of the conditions of use warrant one determination.” The 2024 revision of the Risk Evaluation Framework Rule provided that “EPA will make a single determination as to whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk … under the conditions of use.” The 2025 proposed rule would reverse course again, saying, “EPA will determine whether the chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk … by making separate risk determinations for each condition of use.”

Both approaches rely on interpretations of TSCA section 6(b)(4)(A). It provides that EPA is to conduct risk evaluations “to determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk … under the conditions of use.” Multiple courts of appeals are considering this very issue in judicial review of the risk management rules issued by the Biden EPA and their respective risk evaluations. Under Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), a court is to determine the “best” interpretation of a statute, not an agency, meaning that the courts will not defer to either of EPA’s conflicting interpretations of this TSCA provision.

Occupational Exposure Controls

Another proposed change relates to the consideration of whether exposure controls, including PPE, are used to protect employees from exposure to a chemical substance. The proposed rule would add:

In determining whether unreasonable risk is presented, EPA’s consideration of occupational exposure scenarios will take into account reasonably available information on the implementation and use of occupational exposure control measures such as engineering and administrative controls and personal protective equipment.

This language would replace the 2024 rule’s provision, taking the opposite approach, under which a risk evaluation would consider:

known and reasonably foreseen circumstances where subpopulations of workers are exposed due to the absence or ineffective use of personal protective equipment. EPA will not consider exposure reduction based on assumed use of personal protective equipment as part of the risk determination.

This issue also involves statutory interpretation, specifically the meaning of the definition of “conditions of use” in TSCA section 3(4), which includes both “reasonably foreseen” conditions and those that are intended or known. Non-use of exposure controls may be reasonably foreseen, but use of exposure controls may be generally known to prevail. This is another issue ongoing in the judicial challenges to risk management rules and their risk evaluations.

In the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA requests comment on whether a definition of “reasonably foreseen” would be helpful. If so, the preamble indicated that EPA would likely rely on language used in determinations under TSCA section 5 that a chemical substance is not likely to present an unreasonable risk:

Reasonably foreseen conditions of use are future circumstances, distinct from known or intended conditions of use, under which the chemical substance may be manufactured, processed, distributed, used, or disposed of. EPA expects that the identification of “reasonably foreseen” conditions of use will be made on a fact-specific, case-by-case basis.

EPA’s Discretionary Authority Over Scope of Risk Evaluations

TSCA section 6(b)(4)(D) directs EPA to identify in the scope for the risk evaluation the conditions of use that “the Administrator expects to consider.” The 2017 Risk Evaluation Framework Rule’s preamble found that the quoted language:

suggest[s] that EPA is not required to consider all conditions of use. Consequently, EPA may, on a case-by-case basis, exclude certain activities that EPA has determined to be conditions of use in order to focus its analytical efforts on those exposures that are likely to present the greatest concern, and consequently merit an unreasonable risk determination.

The 2024 revision disagreed with that approach and instead declared that “EPA will not exclude conditions of use from the scope of the risk evaluation.” It added that “a fit-for-purpose approach may result in varying types and levels of analysis and supporting information for certain conditions of use.”

Now, the 2025 proposal would restore the 2017 position by deleting the 2024 statement because “EPA believes that TSCA is best read as permitting the Agency to exercise discretion … under TSCA section 6(b)(4)(D) in determining what conditions of use EPA expects to consider in a risk evaluation, recognizing that the statute clearly envisions comprehensive risk evaluations.” The preamble identified uses of a chemical substance as an impurity or byproduct as conditions of use that might be excluded from the scope of a risk evaluation for that substance, although “generally the better approach for most chemical substances” is to consider those uses together with other uses of that substance, citing the example of 1,4-dioxane. Another example mentioned as an excludable condition of use is use in a product at de minimis levels.

This issue has not arisen in cases contesting risk management rules and their conditions of use.

Regulatory Definitions

EPA proposes removing the phrase “overburdened communities” from the definition of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.” The statutory definition in section 3(12) does not mention that phrase. The Biden EPA added the phrase to the definition’s list of examples of groups of individuals that may be at greater risk. The proposed definition would become essentially identical to the statutory definition:

“Potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation” means “a group of individuals within the general population identified by EPA who, due to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or mixture, such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.”

EPA proposes to take this action in response to concerns from commenters that the phrase and its explanations in the 2024 rule preamble were overly broad and vague. EPA requests comments on whether its regulatory definitions should depart from the statutory definitions.

EPA proposes to add a definition for “weight of scientific evidence.” The 2017 final rule added a definition, but the 2024 rule deleted it, on the basis that it was “both unnecessary and could inhibit the Agency’s flexibility to quickly adapt to and implement advancing scientific practices and approaches.” The proposed 2025 definition would differ from the one in the 2017 rule. It would state:

“Weight of scientific evidence” means “an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation. Quality and relevance determinations, at a minimum, should include consideration of study design, fitness for purpose, replicability, peer review, and transparency and reliability of data.”

The 2024 rule also deleted the 2017 definition of “best available science,” but the current proposal does not include a definition for that term. Both terms are used in section 26, but TSCA does not define either term. Whether EPA relied on the best available science is an issue in the pending litigation on the asbestos risk management rule.

Revisions to Existing Risk Evaluations

The 2024 version of the rule added a provision on revising final risk evaluations, whereby EPA generally must undergo the prioritization process again before making revisions. The 2025 proposal would eliminate that restriction, asserting that EPA must be able to efficiently fix risk evaluations that do not meet the statutory science standards under TSCA sections 26(h) and (i). This regulatory change would allow EPA to revise a risk evaluation without re-prioritization in other circumstances as well. For example, EPA would be able to revise a risk evaluation when a scientific error results in a determination that a condition of use presents an unreasonable risk, when, in fact, it does not. Under the proposed change, EPA would have to publish a new draft and final risk evaluation and solicit public comments and peer review, as appropriate.

Simplifying Requirements for Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations

EPA is proposing to scale back information collection obligations that the 2024 rule imposed on manufacturers requesting risk evaluations. Specifically, EPA proposes to delete language requiring manufacturers to provide EPA with the information necessary to carry out the risk evaluation, shorten the meaning of “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” in this context, and only require manufacturers to submit information on the conditions of use that are identified in the risk evaluation request.

Commentary

This ping-pong approach to the Risk Evaluation Framework Rule reflects the conflicting statutory interpretations and policy views of the different Administrations. Another example of multiple revisions of regulatory requirements is EPA’s Risk Management Program, 40 C.F.R. Part 68. See our alert here.

At some point, the courts may resolve certain of these statutory interpretation disputes by providing what they consider to be the “best” reading of TSCA. A judicial challenge to the 2024 rule was argued before the D.C. Circuit on March 21, 2025; however, that case is currently held in abeyance pending further court order. While publication of the 2025 proposed rule might result in resolution of that case, it is likely that the first case to go to decision is the one involving the methylene chloride rule and its risk evaluation, as the case was argued before a panel of the Fifth Circuit on June 3, 2025, four months ago.

The Risk Evaluation Framework Rule is the basis for all chemical substance evaluations conducted according to its procedures. The proposed rule is deregulatory in nature, with significant scale-backs from the 2024 final rule and the proposed reimplementation of some 2017 provisions. It raises important issues for many stakeholders. Beveridge & Diamond encourages affected companies and their trade associations to submit comments by November 7, 2025.

According to Experian, the relatively new company claims 46.89% of the U.S. EV market in the second quarter of 2025. The Detroit Three are all fighting for the rest of the pie, and Chevrolet’s been gaining ground in an interesting reversal.

Ford came out of the gate strong with its 2022 EV sales

Ford went after Tesla hard with its F-150 Lightning, attempting to undercut the Cybertruck prices. Its big play was the Mustang Mach-E, a uniquely American twist on the formula that makes the Tesla Model Y the planet’s best-selling vehicle.

The Blue Oval’s buzzy new EV lineup landed it 28.42% of the U.S. EV market by quarter two of 2022. But instead of major redesigns for these winners, CEO Jim Farley is pivoting to focus on an all-new factory type (also based on Tesla innovations) and an upcoming electric compact pickup truck. As a result, newer and shinier EVs from Detroit are chipping away at Ford’s market share.

By Q2 2023, Ford’s EV market share had dropped to 20.61%, then by Q2 2024, it had dipped to 19.72%. Now, it’s at a shocking 13.48%.

In the same time, Hyundai’s market share rose as high as 22.18% before falling to 17.01% after a major recall led to Hyundai EV durability concerns.

The latest winner in domestic EV sales

The consistent winner has been Ford’s cross-town rival: Chevrolet. In Q2 2022, Chevy could only claim 12.97% of the market. But in the past four years, Chevrolet and Ford have nearly swapped places, with 25.9% of non-luxury EVs sold in the U.S. in Q2 2025 wearing bowties.

It’s interesting to note that instead of going toe-to-toe with Tesla’s offerings, Chevy has offered some unique models. The Volt was one of the only range-extended EVs ever available, and a fresh take on the formula. But it was discontinued. Now the Bolt is a true compact car, smaller than anything Tesla makes. Its latest designs include huge EV trucks and SUVs, including the new Hummer and the Silverado/Sierra. While they aren’t included in this “non-luxury” category, Cadillac’s EV lineup—including the Rolls-Royce-priced Celestiq—is large and uniquely Cadillac.

Of course, the most popular Chevy EV is still its direct Model Y competitor, the Equinox crossover.

The Tax Incidence Of EV Tax Credits Within economic theory lies the concept of “tax incidence”.
This same tax incidence example applies to the now disappearing EV tax credit.
Effective October 1, the $7,500 EV tax credit will no longer be offered for EV purchases.","The $7,500 EV tax credit was one of many casualties resulting from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While this bill was signed into law on July 4, the credit did not expire for several months, according to Forbes. However, as of October 1, these credits are no longer available, leading to questions about the future of this segment of the automotive industry. Most notably, the tax incidence for purchasing these vehicles shifts from the Federal government to the purchasers or the car manufacturers. This article discusses how tax incidence shapes retail consumer decisions and whether the disappearance of this credit will affect the automotive industry, most notably, those companies that have invested heavily in the manufacturing and production of EVs.

EV Tax Credits

The EV tax credit was first introduced in 2005 and greatly expanded in 2011, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The amount that has been given for these vehicles is up to $7,500, which the dealer removed from the price of the car. In turn, the dealer applied for a rebate from the federal government for the amount of the tax credit.

This tax credit has led to a massive increase in the number of EVS purchased over the past two decades. As discussed by Forbes, EVs were once extraordinarily expensive, and purchasing one meant an undue financial burden on the consumer. Put differently, most purchasers early on acquired these vehicles less because it was a wise financial decision and more because of the non-financial benefits, such as making a positive impact on the environment and fighting global warming.

The EV tax credits changed the calculus for purchasing these vehicles. Many consumers saw the tax incentives as a mechanism to acquire an EV since it substantially lowered the after-tax costs relative to other vehicles. As demand rose due to the lower cost, producers of the EVs ramped up production and enhanced their products. The entire car industry has been upended by newcomers, such as Tesla and Rivian, which offer fully electric vehicle options at prices not much different than their counterparts in gas-powered vehicles. Other manufacturers, like Ford and General Motors, and luxury brand vehicles like Audi and BMW, have increased manufacturing and sales of EVs.

The Tax Incidence Of EV Tax Credits

Within economic theory lies the concept of “tax incidence”. This idea was coined early on by research published in the Journal of Political Economy, stating that the person or entity paying the tax may not necessarily be the person physically paying the tax bill to the government. Other academic research has expanded on this concept, demonstrating that tax incidence can vary substantially across taxpayers, business entities, and governmental regimes.

As an example, according to CBS News, the state of Illinois will now apply a $0.50 tax on every sports gambling bet made via sports betting apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and Underdog. These gambling companies must decide who will ultimately bear the burden of taxation imposed by the State of Illinois. If the companies bear the tax incidence, then they can determine the tax bill based on the number of wagers and pay it, thereby lowering the company’s earnings. However, if the companies want to shift the tax incidence to their customers, then they can add on a $0.50 surcharge to every bet made in the state of Illinois. This addition would make each bet more costly. However, it will be their customer who ultimately bears the burden of taxation. While it may come as little surprise that the gambling companies chose the latter, this example helps illustrate that the tax incidence for new layer of tax fell on the consumers rather than the company.

This same tax incidence example applies to the now disappearing EV tax credit. Effective October 1, the $7,500 EV tax credit will no longer be offered for EV purchases. Consider a Tesla Model Y, which has a standard all-in purchase price of around $47,500. On September 30, the price of this vehicle is $40,000, but that price reverts back to its standard purchase price the very next day. Thus, moving forward, the price of the EV will be $7,500 more expensive that it was before the tax credit’s expiration.

The question now arises whether the company or the taxpayer will bear the incidence of this tax. For instance, Tesla can maintain their price on their vehicles even after the tax credit is no longer offered. However, this decision would come at a risk that consumers may now be less incentivized to purchase the electric vehicles, resulting in a decline in demand at the standard price. On the contrary, Tesla can absorb the costs of the tax credit and continue providing consumers with the same price, even though Tesla will not receive the tax rebates from the government. While the decision by the automobile manufacturers has not yet been made, they will soon need to decide on their pricing strategies now that the EV tax credit is no longer available.

The notion that EV manufacturers will need to decide between decreased demand and decreased profit margin suggests that the automobile manufacturers will take a hit to their earnings one way or another due to the disappearing EV tax credit. Put differently, if demand declines because the price is now higher (without a corresponding increase in after-tax earnings) then earnings will fall. Conversely, if the automobile manufacturers absorb the costs, then their profit margins will also decline. What is key for these companies is that they balance out the tax incidence of the reduced tax incentives.

As discussed by CNBC, the automobile industry is about to establish a new baseline demand for EVs. With the EV tax credit going away starting October 1, this article demonstrates that the auto manufacturers will need to assess their sensitivity for absorbing these diminished tax incentives by lowering their retail prices or passing these diminished tax incentives onto the consumer by maintaining their prices (albeit with a higher after-tax price). Regardless of their decision, the EV auto industry is now facing its toughest battle as it seeks to continue its rise in popularity without federal EV tax credits.",https://static.mocortech.com/www/static/images/news/og_img.png,N,,2025-10-01 15:03:16.146810

My childhood was spent in Houston and filled with daily summer showers and fall hurricanes. Family vacations were spent at Hill Country lakes and Gulf Coast beaches. And the entirety of my career has been in the water industry in San Antonio. My children are growing up spending weekends at our favorite spot on the Frio River. This summer, my four-year-old witnessed the Frio River flood and has already developed a respect for the power of water.

My father instilled the desire to pursue an engineering career, but I found myself in the water industry by chance. An internship in college opened my eyes to the critical role played by public utilities. That internship led me to begin my engineering career working for public municipalities as a consultant. I worked on many water and wastewater projects in the San Antonio and Texas regions but found myself supporting the River Authority Utilities Department. As I got to know the team and their passion for the critical services they provide – I jumped at the opportunity to work with them.

I’ve had the privilege of serving as Manager of the Utilities Department since December of 2024. In this role, I oversee the operation of our wastewater treatment plants, guide infrastructure improvements to our collection systems, and ensure that our utilities operate efficiently and responsibly. Every project we undertake is rooted in the River Authority’s mission: to protect and enhance the San Antonio River Basin. For me, that means turning technical expertise into real, measurable benefits for the communities we serve. Wastewater isn’t something most people think about day to day—but the way we manage it has a direct impact on the health of our rivers, the quality of our environment, and the resilience of our communities. Our team’s work behind the scenes makes sure that the water leaving our treatment plants is safe, that our infrastructure can withstand growth and change, and that our operations continue to set the standard for excellence.

When I look ahead, I’m especially excited about strengthening workforce development for our wastewater field staff. The men and women who are passionate about this critical service are truly the heart of our department. Their work is often behind the scenes, yet it is essential—from the crews who maintain the collection systems, to the operators who ensure proper treatment, to the technicians who keep equipment running, and the compliance staff who safeguard both our community and the environment. These careers are not always recognized alongside other valued trades, yet they are vital to public health and the future of our waterways.

Amado Zambrano, Chief Operator of the River Authority’s Utilities, gives a tour of the Martinez II WWTP to incoming staff.

With many seasoned operators approaching retirement, we face a significant employment gap. It is our responsibility to invest in training, mentorship, and recognition to inspire the next generation of water professionals and instill in them the same passion for service. At the same time, I see tremendous potential to pair this workforce development with innovation – from smart technologies that allow us to detect and resolve issues faster, to sustainable infrastructure practices that minimize environmental impact. Together, people and technology will drive our ability to continue improving how we serve the community and protect the river.

For me, water is more than a resource—it’s a responsibility. Working at the River Authority allows me to carry that responsibility with pride, knowing that each improvement we make today will ripple forward for years to come.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Automotive executives are bracing for a freefall in U.S. electric-vehicle sales following the disappearance of a critical $7,500 tax break for buyers.

""It's a game-changer,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said during a Detroit event on Tuesday, just hours before the federal subsidy expired.

Farley said he would not be surprised if electric-car sales drop to 5% of total U.S. vehicle sales next month. That would be about half the level from August – a monthly record as consumers hurried to take advantage of the credit – and among the lowest levels in several years.

“The EV market is going to collapse in October,” said Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas. Japan's Nissan is still rolling out a redesigned version of its Nissan Leaf small EV in the U.S., but Meunier expects tough competition as rival automakers strain to find buyers for their electric cars.

“That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is a lot of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,” Meunier told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.

Congress approved a $7,500 tax credit in 2008 for buyers of electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act extended the credit, while also limiting eligibility to EVs built in the U.S. that use certain levels of domestically sourced batteries and materials.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s tax-cut and spending bill, signed into law in July, set the September 30 expiration. His administration has taken other steps that could slow momentum for EVs, such as pausing the fines that car companies pay for failing to hit fuel-efficiency regulations. Trump campaigned last year on ending former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate.""

Electric-vehicle registrations could fall 27% without the tax credit, according to a joint study in November 2024 from professors at the University of California, Berkeley, Duke University and Stanford University.

A SURPLUS OF UNSOLD EVs

The U.S. already lags other major car markets in EV adoption. In China, the global leader in EVs and production of batteries and their raw materials, sales of electrics and plug-in hybrids have surpassed 40% in recent months. Europe’s penetration rate has hovered close to 20%.

Even with the U.S. tax credit in place, sales growth in electric cars had decelerated in the past two years, before the deadline rush this past summer. That slowdown occurred in spite of automakers launching a slew of new EV models. Electric-vehicle sales rose just 1.5% in the first half of this year from a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.

Some dealers worry that the removal of the $7,500 tax credit will saddle them with unsold EVs.

Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a U.S. Midwest dealer group, said his group would take fewer EVs from manufacturers in the near term as his team waits to see how consumer demand shakes out.

Brad Sowers, who owns dealerships in the St. Louis, Missouri, area that sell Chevrolet, Jeep and other brands, said he thinks more-affordable EVs will continue to sell. But he worries that pricier models such as General Motors’ Chevy Silverado electric pickup truck – which can top $90,000 – will struggle.

GM and Ford are seeking to ease the blow of losing the tax incentive through programs that would allow dealers to roll the tax break into lease terms for several more months, Reuters reported this week.

Hyundai is offering $7,500 off its 2025 model-year Ioniq 5 EVs, and up to $9,800 in price reductions on 2026 model years of the vehicle, said Randy Parker, CEO of Hyundai Motor North America.

“There was an EV market before IRA, and there’s going to be an EV market after IRA,” Parker said.

Volvo Car CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters in a recent interview that the Swedish automaker will not shift its strategy based on government policies.

“Our ambition is to be an electric company. That is not based on any tax credits or incentives. It's based on an electric car is better for U.S. consumers.”

Coming after the state legislature’s new law eliminating the interim carbon pollution reduction requirement, risking significant increased residential energy bills and putting North Carolinians on the financial hook for expensive new gas plants and unproven technologies. Duke Energy’s plan does not do enough to take advantage of cost saving energy efficiency and demand response and less polluting clean energy sources like solar, wind, and batteries.

Duke’s proposal is the first step in developing an updated plan to replace the 2024 Carbon Plan. The utilities commission is tasked with developing a plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The state legislative majority abandoned the goal set in the bipartisan 2021 North Carolina law to lower carbon pollution from power plants in the state by 70% from 2005 levels by 2030. The plan filed by Duke Energy raises serious questions about whether the regulated monopoly is taking decisive enough action to comply with North Carolina law.

Interested parties have 180 days after the utility files with the N.C. Utilities Commission to file critiques of Duke’s plan. As part of its review, the commission will hold a public comment period, public hearings, and an evidentiary hearing.

A coalition of public interest groups—Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Sierra Club, and Vote Solar, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center—are parties to the utilities commission proceedings.

The clean energy advocates’ initial reactions to Duke’s proposed Carbon Plan follow.

Mikaela Curry, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Manager, said, “Duke’s proposal to delay coal retirements is a disappointing and unsettling departure from the utility’s previous commitments. The plants are still old and outdated, and increasingly unaffordable because of equipment, labor, and railway shortages. None of this has changed except Duke’s hunger for more money on the backs of hard-working families and small businesses, all in the name of delivering electricity to power-hungry data centers owned by the richest companies in the history of the world. Duke Energy has an obligation to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy for North Carolinians, and as its CEO, Harry Sideris should ensure his company is prioritizing clean, proven technology instead of putting his thumb on the scale in favor of burning coal longer or overbuilding new gas plants to benefit his worldwide monopoly utility shareholders.”

David Neal, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said, “We’re concerned that regulated monopoly Duke Energy is continuing to rely on expensive new gas power plants, leaving North Carolina families on the hook for escalating fuel costs and making it harder to reach the 2050 carbon neutrality requirement. Duke yet again appears to have fallen short of taking full advantage of energy efficiency, load flexibility, renewables, and storage, which remain the cheapest and fastest suite of options for meeting rising demand. As always, we will scrutinize Duke’s filing and explore better options for North Carolinians that reduce carbon pollution as quickly and affordably as possible.”

Jake Duncan, Vote Solar, said, “Today, Duke Energy published yet another plan that lets North Carolinians down. This is the third Carbon Plan that fails to meet the moment. Instead of investing enough in low-cost, fuel-free distributed clean energy resources like solar that strengthens communities and lower bills, Duke is doubling down on massive new methane gas plants and delaying coal retirements. The result will be higher costs for families, more pollution in local communities, and a worsening climate crisis.”

The heart was always off-limits to surgeons. Cutting into it spelled instant death for the patient. That is, until a ragtag group of doctors scattered across the Midwest and Texas decided to throw out the rule book. Working in makeshift laboratories and home garages, using medical devices made from scavenged machine parts and beer tubes, these men and women invented the field of open heart surgery. Odds are, someone you know is alive because of them. So why has history left them behind? Presented by Chris Pine, CARDIAC COWBOYS tells the gripping true story behind the birth of heart surgery, and the young, Greatest Generation doctors who made it happen.

In 2023, the coal plant’s particulate matter (PM) emissions allegedly exceeded EPA limits by 70%.","BOW, NH. – Merrimack Station, New England’s last coal-burning plant, has closed. News broke of the New Hampshire plant’s closure within 24 hours of the Trump administration announcing sweeping measures to revive the coal industry, including opening 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal mining leases, extending compliance deadlines, and rolling back health-improving safeguards against air and water pollution.

The closure comes three years ahead of the 2028 retirement date previously reached following negotiations with Sierra Club, The Conservation Law Foundation, EPA, and the plant’s owner Granite Shore Power. Granite Shore Power cited financial reasons for its move to shutter the plant and consider installing a large solar array and utility-scale batteries. No public announcement was made when the plant stopped producing power on September 12, and the process of shutting down is ongoing.

The Trump administration's “Coal Day 2.0” agenda will increase air pollution from coal plants across the country, negatively impacting public health in New Hampshire and the Northeast.

“The early retirement of Merrimack Station is further proof that the Trump Administration propping up aging, expensive coal power is political posturing and a handout for coal executives at the expense of American taxpayers,” said Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Laurie Williams

“Bow and the Capitol region can be comforted knowing Merrimack Station will no longer release unhealthy coal pollution into our air and damaging warm-water discharges into our river,” added Sierra Club New Hampshire Chapter Director Cathy Corkery. “Now, we look ahead to remediation of the Merrimack River and a clean, locally-powered solar array along its banks. When paired with battery storage, this new facility will provide our community with local, cleaner, healthier, and more reliable energy.”

Merrimack Station has had an outsized impact on local air and water quality, as the state’s largest single source of air pollution. In 2023, the coal plant’s particulate matter (PM) emissions allegedly exceeded EPA limits by 70%.

These grants are funded by the Environmental Protection Agency's Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) program. The purpose of the DERA program is to support projects designed to achieve significant diesel emissions reductions.

Diesel engines, particularly those manufactured before the stringent standards required from today’s vehicles, emit pollution that can contribute to health conditions like asthma and heart and lung disease. Diesel exhaust can also damage crops and other vegetation, contribute to the formation of acid rain, impair visibility and further climate change and global warming. Many communities of color and low-income communities may be disproportionately impacted by pollution from mobile sources.

Duke Energy is executing an ambitious energy transition, keeping customer reliability and value at the forefront as it builds a smarter energy future.","Update to the long-range plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators last year supports economic success of both states

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy's road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

""North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy's low energy rates continue to support this region's economic success,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.""

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan's future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company's recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

""We've also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,"" Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What's next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

GM sold 710,347 vehicles in the quarter across its full lineup, an 8% change year over year.

General Motors set an electric vehicle sales record in the third quarter, more than doubling sales year-over-year, ahead of the federal tax credit expiration.

GM reported Oct. 1 that it sold 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter in the U.S., compared with 32,095 last year at this time, further cementing GM's position as the second-largest seller of electric vehicles in the U.S. behind Tesla.

GM sold 710,347 vehicles in the quarter across its full lineup, an 8% change year over year.

The Detroit automaker also set record sales for gas-powered crossovers and SUVs across its brands, particularly redesigned models such as the Chevrolet Traverse, Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Acadia, GMC Terrain and Buick Enclave.

Buick faced double-digit losses in the quarter while Cadillac had its best quarter in over a decade, GM said.

Duncan Aldred, senior vice president and president of North America for GM, told the Detroit Free Press that the automaker set records in a quarter much stronger than anticipated.

“When the tariffs were announced, we thought there was a pull ahead effect, which would give a payback later on,” he said. “That payback hasn't really come.”

Tax credit boost

Similarly, Aldred said the company is sure of strong electric vehicle sales in the fourth quarter despite another potential pull ahead sales effect from losing the tax credits.

Car buyers were eligible for a tax credit of up to $7,500 on qualifying new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 on a used EVs. President Donald Trump signed a bill in July pushing up the expiration date for the federal clean vehicle tax credit, which expired Sept. 30 instead of its original expiration date in 2032.

Car shopping experts forewarned that the rush of buyers would all but halt without the credit, though GM and Ford managed to find a workaround that allowed EVs intended for leasing to qualify ― while supplies last.

“We've invested an awful lot into what is an exceptional EV portfolio, the broadest in the industry,” Aldred said. “We love the products, the customers love the products, we think we can maintain a healthy level of sales going forward.”

Other sales results

GM sold 40,780 Buicks in the quarter, down 14%. Total Chevrolet sales of 458,189 rose 8%, and GMC sales increased 9% to 164,853 vehicles.

Cadillac sales leapt 25% in the quarter to 46,525.

(NYSE: OKLO), an advanced nuclear technology company, announced today that it has been selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), along with three other companies, for the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Line Pilot Projects.

Similar to the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, in which Oklo was also selected to participate, the Fuel Line Pilot Projects are designed to accelerate the permitting, construction, and operation, drive private sector investment, and create a fast-track approach to licensing.

Under DOE’s Fuel Line Pilot Projects, Oklo will build and operate three fuel-fabrication facilities to support the deployment of advanced reactors. This work aligns with DOE’s objective to ensure a robust domestic supply of advanced nuclear fuel for research, development, and demonstration purposes, including projects within the Reactor Pilot Program.

In August 2025, Oklo and its subsidiary Atomic Alchemy, an innovator in radioisotope production, were selected for three of DOE’s 11 projects under the Reactor Pilot Program. The program follows executive orders signed in May 2025 aimed at reinvigorating America’s nuclear energy industry.

“We are honored to be selected by DOE for these historic projects that will help restore America’s nuclear fuel supply chain,” said Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte. “Through the Fuel Line Projects and Reactor Pilot Programs, DOE is laying the groundwork for the next wave of nuclear development and deployment, and Oklo is proud to contribute by building the advanced fuel infrastructure needed to deploy our powerhouses and strengthen U.S. energy security.”

These DOE selections add to Oklo’s recent progress. On September 4, 2025, Oklo announced a Fuel Recycling Facility as the first phase of an Advanced Fuel Center in Tennessee, with a total investment of up to $1.68 billion. On September 22, 2025, Oklo broke ground on its first Aurora powerhouse at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho.

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes, and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy.

The term that starts this year will include cases that touch on issues related to campaign finance, the environment, voting rights, and immigration, among others.

Seth Chandler, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said he feels the most important case that is coming this term is Trump v. Slaughter.

“It’s about the ability of the president to control what were previously called ‘independent agencies.’ These are things like the Federal Trade Commission, the FCC, the Federal Election Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, all the agencies to which Congress has been delegated vast amounts of power over the past hundred years,” Chandler said. “And they’ve done so under the assumption that the president can’t fire people that he doesn’t like.”

However, Chandler said President Trump believes that those restrictions on his authority are unconstitutional.

“What the president wants ultimately is the ability to fire those people and replace them with people who are more persuaded of his ideology,” he said.

This is not the only case centering on Trump’s power as president this term. The case Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump is about the president’s tariffs, which he has passed without explicit authorization of Congress.

“Instead, what the president is relying on is a statute called the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which does give the president power to act in certain emergencies,” Chandler said. “And the thought is that this is really going beyond the expectations of Congress when they passed the statute and that the president shouldn’t be able to take such major actions without a clear statement from Congress that this is acceptable. The president takes the opposite view.”

Voting rights are also on the agenda this Supreme Court term, in a case called Louisiana v. Callais. This case centers on whether section two of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is constitutional.

“Louisiana believed that it needed to draw two districts of its seven in which African Americans would have a reasonable chance of getting their preferred candidate elected,” Chandler said. “But that doesn’t sound like race blindness of the sort that the court has said should apply in, for example, college admissions or elsewhere.

And so we have a tension between section two of the Voting Rights Act, which has been interpreted to require essentially race consciousness and notions of equal protection, which suggests that race should not be used except perhaps under the most extreme circumstances.”

The court will also likely rule on a case that will decide the constitutionality of Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship.

“The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that every person born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof is a citizen of the United States,” Chandler said. “Historically, that little qualifier, ‘subject to jurisdiction thereof,’ has been interpreted very, very narrowly to only apply, for example, to children of ambassadors or enemy aliens who have children while they’re here.”

The justices heard a case on this executive order last term, but didn’t rule on the executive order’s validity outright, Chandler said. Instead, they focused their ruling about the extent to which federal courts could offer relief.

But the case has now gone back down to lower courts and is very likely to rise up again to the Supreme Court.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/us-supreme-court-building-g7a3c1fd71_1280-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 13:03:55.921126

Hyundai’s third-quarter total US sales climbed 13% to a record 239,069 vehicles, with EV sales doubling from a year ago.
The gains were particularly pronounced in September, when its EV sales jumped 153% from the same month in 2024.
The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.” Some EV proponents had looked to states including California to step in and replace the expiring federal EV tax credits.
Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, dashed those hopes with a Sept. 19 announcement that his state won’t replace the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit.","Carmakers including Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. saw a surge in new electric vehicle sales this past quarter, giving the industry a boost despite ongoing uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s shifting trade policies.

Shoppers rushed to take advantage of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit that expired Sept. 30, pushing up sales of pure battery-electric vehicles 21% from the prior-year period to a record 10% of overall deliveries, according to estimates from researcher Cox Automotive.

That momentum prompted Cox to bump up its forecast for the seasonally adjusted annual rate of U.S. sales to 16.1 million vehicles after a more modest upwards revision in June to 15.7 million.

Automakers whipsawed by policy changes have been dialing back EV production and rejiggering product plans to add more gas and hybrid models. That dynamic created a buyers’ market for EVs as manufacturers rushed to sell down inventory, and an interest-rate cut helped some shoppers shrug off lingering affordability concerns.

“It’s last call at the bar, everyone is stepping up and ordering,” said Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics for JD Power, which expects sales of about 16.1 million new vehicles this year. “If we weren’t having this experience in EVs right now, we might be asking, ‘Why are sales so sluggish on the combustion engine side?’ It’s perhaps masking a bit of weakness.”

The industry is pulling back the curtain on its performance Wednesday, when major automakers from General Motors Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. to Stellantis NV are expected to release U.S. vehicle sales results. EV maker Tesla Inc. is expected to report global figures on Thursday.

Ford’s US deliveries rose 8.2% in the quarter, driven by strong sales of sport-utility vehicles such as the Bronco, which rose 41%, and the newly redesigned Expedition large SUV, which was up more than 47%. The automaker’s EV sales set a quarterly record of 30,612 vehicles, up 30%. The highly profitable F-Series pickup trucks rose 4.7%.

Hyundai’s third-quarter total US sales climbed 13% to a record 239,069 vehicles, with EV sales doubling from a year ago. The gains were particularly pronounced in September, when its EV sales jumped 153% from the same month in 2024.

Regulation Rollback

Trump campaigned on rolling back many of former President Joe Biden’s EV-friendly policies, such as environmental regulations and the federal tax credit, and Congress followed through in July with a major tax-and-spending bill. As a result, 2026 will mark the first time in nearly 15 years that the federal government will not subsidize new EV purchases.

Most industry observers forecast a slowdown in EV sales in the coming quarters, as without the federal incentives they are still more expensive than gas-powered cars. EV average transaction prices rose in August to about $9,000 more than prices on conventional models.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said Tuesday in a speech in Detroit. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

Some EV proponents had looked to states including California to step in and replace the expiring federal EV tax credits. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, dashed those hopes with a Sept. 19 announcement that his state won’t replace the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit.

Some carmakers are stepping into the void. Hyundai said Wednesday that it would extend $7,500 cash incentives in October for 2025 models of its Ioniq 5 EV, while also lowering prices by as much as $9,800 on certain 2026 versions.

Tesla’s Model Y and 3, the Honda Prologue, Chevrolet Equinox, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ford Mustang Mach-e were among the biggest beneficiaries of the EV surge in the first two months of the quarter, according to Cox. Ford, GM, Toyota and Hyundai continued to gain total market share in the period while Stellantis, owner of the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands, suffered small declines.

Many Chevy and Ford dealers’ websites have had a clock counting down to the second when the federal tax credit ends.

Rob Miles, a banker from Denver and a lifelong car enthusiast, said he’d been wanting to buy the electric Mustang Mach-e since it came out. The timing was finally right to get one in July.

The federal incentive and “the rebates that Ford was offering were extremely intriguing,” Miles said.

Beyond the incentive grab, there’s a sense of urgency among some shoppers that prices will go up on 2026 models as carmakers look to recoup some of the cost of the new tariff burden. Based on the trade agreements Trump announced this summer, Cox estimates the US government will collect roughly $100 billion in tariffs on imported autos, parts and materials this year. That could add an extra $5,500 to the cost of an imported vehicle, and $1,000 on US-assembled vehicles with imported components, according to Cox’s chief economist Jonathan Smoke.

Rather than jolt buyers with sticker shock, automakers have been eating some of the costs themselves while spreading the rest across their lineups. But new vehicles coming out for 2026 are already starting to show markups, said Carlos Hidalgo, who owns two Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep Ram stores and a Hyundai store in California. Now, he’s fretting that he will have trouble making up the lost EV volume.

“We had the rush with the electric stuff and the plug-in stuff, but that goes away, so we gotta figure out what we’re gonna do next,” said Hidalgo, who’s still waiting for the new hybrid Jeep Cherokee and new Grand Cherokee models to arrive at his stores.

Ongoing Uncertainty

Uncertainty around tariff costs is poised to spike again as the Trump administration looks to renegotiate the terms of its trading pact with Mexico and Canada next year. Regardless of where the levies ultimately land, manufacturers will feel it in their cost structures and look for other ways to cope beyond raising prices, such as stripping out features or revising trim levels, said Erin Keating, an executive analyst with Cox.

“Some add features but eliminate lower trims, shrinking the range of affordable options and pushing buyers toward more expensive models,” Keating said.

Still, there are positive drivers for the economy too, according to researcher Edmunds.com. Interest-rate cuts and deregulation are giving companies some flexibility on costs, and a strong stock market is giving people the confidence to buy, especially those who can afford a new car in the first place.

“We’re seeing more consumers return to the market with aging trade-ins, which is a strong signal that there’s still real pent-up demand,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for Edmunds.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. power company Duke Energy is considering adding large nuclear reactors to its fleet and extending the life of some coal plants as part of a long-term energy plan aimed at meeting sharply rising electricity demand in the Carolinas.

Electric utilities across the U.S. are boosting power infrastructure plans to account for rapid growth in electricity consumption, driven by AI data centers, the electrification of transportation and buildings as well as a resurgence in domestic manufacturing.

The recent surge in power use has sparked renewed interest in nuclear energy, which produces around-the-clock electrons that are virtually carbon-free.

""We're seeing energy needs over the next 15 years that are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the past 15 years,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president.

Duke’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan was filed with regulators on Wednesday and outlines its strategy through to 2040, updating the 2023 version that covered energy needs through 2038.

The plan includes a proposal to study the addition of large light-water reactors and small modular reactors, with potential sites at Belews Creek in North Carolina and the W.S. Lee site in South Carolina. Duke is targeting a 2037 in-service date for new nuclear generation.

If Duke moves forward with the nuclear part of its plan, the power utility would be building new reactors for the first time in decades.

The proposal is set against a backdrop of power consumption at record highs and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to roll back incentives for wind and solar development while promoting fossil fuels and nuclear energy. Duke said it will seek extensions of between two and four years for several coal plants with dual-fuel capability, citing recent federal policy changes. The company said it still intends to retire its ageing coal fleet as new resources come online.

“That extension helps bridge the gap,” said Glen Snider, Duke's managing director of integrated resource planning.

Duke is the largest operator of regulated nuclear power in the U.S. and among the biggest coal plant operators in the country.

The company also plans to more than double its battery storage capacity from earlier projections to 5,600 megawatts (MW) by 2034 and maintain its target for 4,000 MW of solar power capacity.

Wind power, the company said, is economically unviable for its customers through 2040.

The utility also plans to expand its natural gas fleet, adding two combustion turbines to the five combined cycle units proposed in its 2023 plan. It will increase liquefied natural gas storage to improve reliability and reduce fuel cost volatility.

Duke's proposed upgrades to existing nuclear and hydropower facilities will add nearly 600 MW of clean capacity.

It's no secret that the EV tax credit was a boon to the industry. That $7,500 credit helped a lot of buyers afford EVs, whether it was via a purchase incentive done right at the point of sale or placed into a lease.

30% Ford Says Expect EV Market To Half

Photo by: Ford

Man, EV companies can’t catch a break, huh? For a long time, U.S.-market EVs tended to be heavily reliant on Tesla for a lot of reasons; the cars themselves were kind of the only game in town that was worth a damn to the average consumer.

Range, price and general usability hit all of the sweet spots with consumers, especially with the (relatively) reasonably priced Model 3 and Model Y. Add in the tax credit, and it was a sweet time for Tesla.

But now that automakers are finally starting to catch up, they’ve been cut off at the knees. The tax credit was a large incentive for American car buyers, tacitly admitted by Ford CEO Jim Farley. According to reporting from Fortune, Farley said that the death of the EV tax credit could cut the industry in half:

Ford CEO Jim Farley, speaking at the Ford Pro Accelerate summit in Detroit on Tuesday, said he sees a huge impact from the policy change.

While he still sees EVs being a “vibrant industry” going forward, it’s also “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.” He called the end of the $7,500 consumer incentive a game-changer and said he wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5% of the industry from the current level of roughly 10% to 12%. The most recent forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData estimated that EVs would account for 12.2% of new-vehicle sales in September 2025.

Farley reminded the audience that he always says, “The customers are pesky. They surprise you.” And what he’s learned is that “customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”

On one hand, this feels like a complete no-brainer. Until relatively recently, EV efforts from most companies that aren’t Tesla have been aimed at the upper-class buyer. A $75,000 car, no matter if it’s electric or not, is a hard sell in today’s world, where buyers feel incredibly squeezed by an increased cost of living.

On the other hand, Ford is right around the corner when it comes to introducing its reasonably priced EV project. There’s a world of difference between its planned $30,000 and the $75,000 example Farley mentioned in conversation. Having that hurt at the knees isn’t great for our EV market.

Fortune implied that Ford still sees electrification in general as the way forward for the U.S. market.

“Partial electrification is more interesting to customers than we thought…we think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with.” And they’re falling out of love with pure-play EVs, he implied.

Still, this isn't great news for the EV market and all of the supply chain that has been building up to support what everyone thought would be a boon in new American electric vehicle manufacturing. The world will continue to go electric, so let’s hope this is temporary.

60% Tesla Has Already Updated Its Lease Pricing

Photo by: Patrick George

While other brands, local dealerships, and other entities are scrambling to update their incentives and sales pricing, there’s no slacking at Tesla. Initially spotted by Reuters and confirmed by us, Tesla has already changed its lease pricing on its new EV models:

Tesla and its rivals had been passing these credits on to customers through competitive lease offers.

The monthly lease of the electric vehicle manufacturer's best-selling Model Y increased to a range between $529 and $599, from a range of $479 to $529. Prices of all vehicles, however, remain unchanged. Model 3 lease prices touched a range of $429 to $759 per month, from a range of $349 to $699.

Demand for battery-powered models is already showing signs of a slowdown after rapid growth earlier in the decade. Sales could drop after the credits dry up, auto executives and analysts have warned.

As a person who looks at the glass as half full, these prices don’t seem like too much of a stretch. A jump from $349 to $429 for the Tesla Model 3 isn’t insignificant, especially for buyers on a budget, but this still feels relatively competitive against similarly priced ICE premium sedans.

Purchase prices for the cars haven’t changed, and some Teslas, like the Model S and Model X, were too expensive to qualify for purchase-level tax credits anyway.

90% Tax Credit Claims Weren’t Always Lease-Only

It’s no secret that the EV tax credit really helped with leasing. Not long ago, before the credit died entirely, new legislation meant reconfiguring the application of the credit, no longer allowing for use on new purchases of cars not made in North America.

But that didn’t apply to vehicles owned or run by commercial entities, creating a clever loophole for banks and leases. Thus, the $7,500 credit could be applied to leases, bringing down the initial cost and monthly payment. Thus, you'd think that most, if not all, EV purchases would be leased, right?

Well, no. According to data from Experian (and reported on by Automotive News), the actual ratios may be a little less cut and dried:

The Tesla Model Y was the top-selling electric vehicle in the second quarter of 2025 but only 30 percent of those sales were for leases, according to Experian. About half of all Model Y customers financed their purchase with a loan.

In contrast, the Chevrolet Equinox EV was the third-most-popular EV in the quarter, and 60 percent of those purchases were leases.

Other models quoted, like the Model 3, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Ford Mustang Mach-E, hovered around a 60%-ish lease rate.

Interestingly, Automotive News says that on average, EV leases were $175 cheaper per month than EV loans.

100% Is The Death Of The EV Tax Credit Overblown?

The incentives to both buy and build zero-emission cars are gone for now, but we haven’t quite reached price parity en masse for EVs and ICE cars. It seems like we were getting close, but the little bit of assistance to get us over the line is now totally gone.

And yet the world continues to electrify. I’m not going to assert that the tax credit did nothing. But in a world where people shop for cars primarily based on their monthly payments, did those deals help as much as, say, a cheaper EV in general?",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/E6YN7B/s1/ford-cm.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 12:08:28.451932

The Department of Energy will take a five per cent equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a five per cent stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33 per cent before the opening bell Wednesday.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas ""helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.""

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cellphones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world's largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies.

The government is getting a 10 per cent stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges.

The administration spent $400 million US of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner.

Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15 per cent cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

$182M US of debt service deferred

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million US on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million US of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada's Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion US federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries.

GM has pledged more than $900 million US to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build one million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, said Thacker Pass is a ""massive opportunity"" for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

""Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than one per cent of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals, strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,"" he wrote.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7648024.1759328894!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/lithium-americas-nevada-loan.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-10-01 12:08:15.297147

As promised by the current administration, the $7,500 federal tax credit for certain EV purchases has completely ended (cue the collective “boo”). It was a good run while it lasted, and many US consumers were able to more easily go all-electric thanks to those incentives.

Where do we go from here?

While some automakers (mostly those in Japan) have significantly dialed back electrification strategies, others are pushing forward. Better yet, BEV-only automakers like Lucid Motors are extending the $7,500 credit themselves.

Not all Rivian prices previously qualified for federal tax credits, but the American automaker still offered plenty of lease and purchase incentives of its own and continues to do so. However, with the tax credit now a fleeting memory, my first thought was how much it would affect lease prices at Rivian, for instance, so I looked into it.

As of today, some Rivian lease prices are significantly less expensive, while others have been increased. It all depends on what trim you’re looking for.

Rivian lease prices as of October 1, 2025

With tax incentives in the rearview, it will be up to individual EV automakers to offer lease and purchase deals on their models. As we previously covered, Rivian was offering customers excellent lease incentives until the witching hour of September 30, 2025.

A day later, we are navigating a world without those government perks (or any government at all due to a looming shutdown). However, there is a bright side – Rivian leases are still available, and the prices of some variants have actually gone down.

As promised, here are the current lease prices for the 2025 Rivian R1S and R1T trims, effective October 1. We’ve also included the previous price as of September 30, for comparison. Note that all numbers are starting prices with all standard included components – zero upgrades.

There you have it. The highest hike in lease prices we’re seeing is on the Tri Motor version of the Rivian R1T. There are still plenty of deals coming from Rivian in the future as the American automaker continues to grow and expand its lineup.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Rivian-lease-prices-R1T.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-01 12:06:00.847704

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

Michigan has more than 85,000 registered EVs on the road, ranking in the top 15 states nationwide. The credits were structured so buyers could see the savings right at the dealership.

Ingrid Malmgren with Plug In America says clean car standards and EV tax credits helped automakers shift away from gas-powered vehicles and boost the job market.

“This led to manufacturing plants for both batteries and EVs in a number of states around the country, leading to hundreds of thousands of new jobs,” Malmgren said.

Analysts warn the rollback of federal tax credits could slow Michigan’s auto sector as global demand for EVs accelerates. The Big Three automakers have invested billions while resisting strict rules, and with one in four cars sold worldwide now electric, the automakers risk falling behind. Malmgren points out that credits for batteries and advanced vehicles gave manufacturers the green light.

“To really incentivize automakers to help make this shift and make it easier for them to transition to EVs.”

There is one bit of less-bad news regarding the tax credits: The credit for installing home charging equipment remains on the books until June 30, 2026.

Carmakers respond

Different automakers are approaching the situation differently. Yesterday, it emerged that both Ford and General Motors have come up with a temporary solution: buying all their own EVs before the credit expired, then leasing those vehicles to customers through dealerships at a $7,500 discount. That's good news if you're looking to lease an F-150 Lightning; a Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq, or Vistiq; a GMC Sierra EV; or a Chevrolet Blazer, Equinox, or Silverado.

Meanwhile, Tesla, which is facing a constantly eroding market share due to stale product lines and its CEO's political activity, has chosen a different path. Reuters reports this morning that lease prices for the Model Y and Model 3 have gone up.

A Model Y lease would have cost between $479 and $529 per month to lease yesterday; today, that price range is $529–$599 a month.

The boom in artificial intelligence is driving a surge of new electric demand, which has contributed to a global shortage in gas turbines. Natural gas is a favored fossil fuel, since it can be used as a round-the-clock fuel that’s cleaner than coal and easier to build than nuclear.

Xcel plans to install five of the turbines at a 1,200-megawatt plant it’s building in Gaines County to kick in when demand peaks, the companies said in a statement on Wednesday. Another five turbines will help Xcel power a roughly 930-megawatt facility on the site of a coal plant the utility plans to close in Bailey County.

The companies didn’t disclose the purchase price for the turbines, which have combined capacity to power about 500,000 homes. Siemens Energy will deliver the first of the turbines in early 2026 and the new plants are expected to supply the central US grid operated by the Southwest Power Pool, which serves more than 18 million people in 14 states.

Xcel is building the plants as Texas faces unprecedented demand for electricity from data centers, oil production and the state’s overall economic growth. The region, like much of the US, has aging infrastructure that’s increasingly being tested by extreme storms and wildfires. Now demand for AI is adding to the strain, forcing companies to quickly upgrade the grid while trying to keep power reliable and affordable for customers.

As a result, orders for gas turbines are increasing, with Siemens Energy, GE Vernova Inc. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. ranking as the dominant manufacturers of large gas turbines.

Mitsubishi Power Ltd., a key supplier of gas turbines used to generate electricity, said last month that it expects demand for the equipment to remain “very high” for the next three to five years as the world builds out power-hungry data centers.

The Department of Energy’s new reactor pilot program is not just another research initiative. It represents a bold experiment to see if advanced nuclear can move from concepts to real projects, and do so rapidly. If successful, this program could redefine how the United States develops nuclear energy; if it fails, it may reinforce lingering doubts about the ability of the U.S. to build next-generation nuclear projects at scale.

Established under one of the four executive orders signed May 23, 2025, the program directs DOE to authorize advanced reactor demonstration projects outside of national labs, and is aimed at achieving “criticality” for at least three test reactors by July 4, 2026. A request for applications was issued on June 18 and initial selections followed on Aug. 12, with DOE picking 11 projects from 10 companies. Subsequent applications are permitted on a rolling basis.

Crucially, these reactors will be authorized solely by DOE, bypassing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as permitted under DOE’s authority under the Atomic Energy Act. The companies must self-finance each project, from design through decommissioning, and select their own sites.

The program could succeed in multiple ways.

Fast-track from lab to launch. By setting a clear deadline of three reactors nearing criticality in just over a year, DOE is stepping up to bridge the gap between design and operation. This is a departure from nuclear’s usual timeline of many years, even a decade, from licensing through construction.

Unlocking private capital. Investor interest in nuclear energy has grown, but regulatory, cost and construction schedule uncertainty has so far slowed turning the interest into project finance for advanced nuclear in the U.S. DOE’s pilot approach provides timely government authorization and a clearer path to future NRC licensing. That clarity reduces perceived risk and could catalyze private equity, infrastructure funds, and utility investment.

U.S. reclaims strategic leadership. China and Russia have operating advanced reactors, and countries like Canada, the U.K. and France are pursuing SMRs aggressively. A rapid U.S. demonstration fleet signals that America intends to compete both economically and geopolitically in nuclear energy.

Why this could be a game-changer

If even one of these pilot reactors goes critical and demonstrates commercial operation safely, the impact could be transformational. It would prove that modular reactor designs can work at scale, supply investors with real-world reference projects and shift broader planning from “concept” to “commission.” In energy policy terms, it could start a nuclear renaissance, firming up the electrification and clean power goals of the 2030s and beyond. It could also help solve critical data center power needs as those needs expand beyond our current ability to power them.

However, this program carries a risk that must not be ignored. By relying solely on DOE authorization and bypassing NRC oversight, there is a real danger that the public may perceive these test reactors as subject to diluted safety standards, especially if DOE staffing or technical capacity is diminished. If nuclear technology is associated with any regulatory loosening or political interference, it could erode public trust in nuclear safety, which is a trust that took decades of careful regulation to build.

This is more than a theoretical risk, it’s existential for the industry. Public confidence in nuclear regulation underpins everything from site licensing to financial underwriting. Without preserving institutional integrity at DOE and NRC, accelerated deployment could come undone in the courtroom, in the markets or in the media.

An additional pragmatic note is that many of these pilot projects involve modular or micro-reactors using novel designs, while at the same time we are seeing efforts to restart shuttered light-water reactor sites as the lowest-hanging fruit to bridge the gap until SMRs or micro-reactors can be commercially operational. This makes sense strategically — leveraging existing grid connections, workforce and regulatory familiarity — but it underscores the importance of ensuring that legacy licensing frameworks and safety standards remain rigorously applied.

Any misstep in the LWR restarting process or any other near-term, nuclear-adjacent activity, like fuel production or plutonium storage and transportation, could undermine the support and momentum that is currently propelling advanced nuclear projects.

Oversight must remain solid

Nuclear energy’s promise must always be balanced by an unshakable commitment to safety. While advanced reactor programs offer the potential for cleaner, more reliable power, the handling of nuclear fuel and materials is not a challenge that can be rushed or minimized. Each step in the nuclear regulatory oversight process should meet the highest standards, including dismantling retired nuclear warheads and storing plutonium, as well as managing the spent fuel from our existing fleet of reactors.

Each of these steps reflects a hard-earned truth — nuclear fission material remain hazardous for decades or even centuries, and they demand the highest standards of care.

If public confidence is to grow alongside investment in new nuclear technology, safety in fuel management and long-term storage must be non-negotiable. Moving too quickly, or lowering oversight in the name of speed, risks repeating past mistakes and undermining the very future this program is designed to build.

The report analyzed all 50 states and Washington, D.C., looking at factors like extreme heat, flooding and air quality, as well as policies to combat these threats.

Vermont was ranked the best state for its climate preparedness and low health risk, while West Virginia ranked last. States in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest generally scored well, while several states in the South and Southwest ranked among the worst.

Top 10 States

Bottom 10 States

The report found a clear correlation.

“Our scorecard shows that states with strong clean energy and resilience policies are doing a better job protecting health and health care infrastructure, while other states leave patients exposed during potential crises,” said study author Matthew Eckelman, an associate professor at Northeastern University in Boston.

Some areas face unique dangers.

Southwestern states like Arizona and New Mexico have the greatest risk from extreme heat, while health infrastructure in low-lying coastal states like Florida and Louisiana has a high flood risk.

Florida has the nation’s highest percentage of hospital beds — nearly 15% — located in high-hazard flood zones, the study showed.

Extreme weather events are devastating and costly.

Last year alone, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported 27 weather and climate disasters with damage topping $1 billion in each. These disasters resulted in 568 direct or indirect deaths, making 2024 the eighth-highest fatality year in the last 45 years.

Commonwealth Fund President Joseph Betancourt stressed the basic necessity of climate readiness.

“People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather,” he said in a news release.

The study authors urged states to take four key steps to reduce harmful health impacts and improve resilience:

Strengthen clean energy and energy efficiency policies.

Support health care facilities in preparing for extreme weather and assessing climate risks.

Require standardized reporting of health care sector emissions to guide improvements.

Help hospitals and clinics invest in resilient infrastructure, clean power and low-emission transportation for staff and patients.

Founded by Jodee Smith, FARMWISE Indiana mobilizes a team of seasoned value chain professionals located throughout the state. Their mission: connect Indiana’s farmers and food producers with institutional buyers, including schools, universities, restaurants, retail outlets and health care providers by increasing access to value-based procurement pathways.

“FARMWISE Indiana is about building relationships that benefit everyone from farmers and food producers to the communities they nourish,” said Smith. “We’re focused on making local food a bigger part of Indiana’s economy and identity.”

With a focus on sustainability, industry engagement and economic resilience, the program promotes local food procurement that supports small and mid-sized farms while meeting the growing demand for fresh, regional products.

The initiative seeks to grow institutional demand and create reliable markets, fostering a more connected, climate-resilient and locally rooted food economy.

According to the USDA Ag Census, sales from farmers to wholesale buyers increased 280% from 2017 to 2022, totaling more than $305 million.

More than 50% of food service buyers surveyed define local as being grown or made in Indiana.

Those 200 buyers are spending more than $550 million purchasing food each year. Substituting food grown and made in Indiana can boost the state's food economy.

According to the survey, buyers are motivated to buy local because of quality, freshness and taste; however, lack of time and challenges buying local through distributors are the top barriers for buyers.

The FARMWISE Indiana project is funded by a grant from Builders’ Initiative and has many partners in the state, including the Indiana State Department of Agriculture, Indiana State Department of Health, Indiana State Department of Education, Purdue Extension, Sustainable Agriculture, Research and Education through the USDA, Northwest Indiana Food Council, Northeast Indiana Local Food Network, Food and Growers Association, Urban Seeds, Fischer Farms LLC and Partners in Food and Farming.",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/madisoncourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b1f849ba-dcd8-11ea-9099-4387d0bdd6af.png?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-10-01 13:03:46.436355

when women in boardrooms or at the helm of major institutions were a rarity. In assembling our biennial list of the Most Powerful Women in Washington, we had the opposite problem: We came across so many impressive, talented, and influential women that we could have filled many more pages.

We read, researched, and reached out to people in the know across the DC area, from business to media to politics, and asked for names of women in their particular field of expertise or beyond whom they considered powerful. Who is making things happen and having an impact? Who gets her calls (or texts or emails) returned immediately? Who is leading the way in her field? Who has senators on speed dial—and vice versa?

The list of nearly 250 women that follows includes a range of categories, with both those who are in the headlines—White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, for instance—as well as others pulling strings quietly behind the scenes. More than once, we heard from a source, “This is the most powerful woman you’ve never heard of.” Or “She won’t be on any other list but has real power.”

Some women in Washington have power by virtue of their position or their proximity or access to power. Some for their leadership. Some for their ability to mobilize vast networks and connections to make things happen. Some for the skill, expertise, or innovation they bring to their field.

Of course, politics tilts the scales here, especially in these acutely partisan times. That means the list right now includes many Republicans, especially Trump-aligned Republicans who are filling the majority of top government positions, as well as those from both parties who are pushing back against the MAGA agenda and making their voices heard. We know that some of the women on this list, especially those in the national spotlight, can be seen as controversial, polarizing figures. We don’t aim to pass judgment on the job they’re doing or whether they’re using their power to further the public good. We simply mean to present a snapshot of the women who, in the fall of 2025, are wielding—or in some cases challenging—the levers of power in the nation’s capital.

Governor, Federal Reserve Board

Susie Wiles

White House Chief of Staff

The onetime Prince George’s County Executive became the first African American senator in Maryland history when she defeated former GOP governor Larry Hogan last November.

Prince George’s County Executive

Sworn in on Juneteenth, the former Prince George’s state’s attorney, who had prevailed in a nine-person Democratic primary, got right to work highlighting public safety and her county beautification effort, Project Elevate.

Winsome Earle-Sears

Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and GOP Nominee for Governor

Susan Collins

US Senator from Maine; Chair, Senate Appropriations Committee

The longtime swing senator now has the “power of the purse” to determine which Trump priorities are funded.

Joni Ernst

US Senator from Iowa; Chair, Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee

The influence that the high-ranking Republican wields in her party appears to have an expiration date on it now that the two-term senator and combat veteran has decided not to seek reelection next year.

As the fourth-highest-ranking Republican in the House, the former business owner played a key role in messaging and advancing the President’s sweeping budget overhaul.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

US Representative from New York

Since her election in 2018 at age 29, AOC has become the most powerful progressive in the House, her dynamism and fundraising prowess likely shaping the Democrats’ approach to the midterms.

Fort Worth Report is certified by the Journalism Trust Initiative for adhering to standards for ethical journalism.","An energy giant is set to break ground for a data center project across about 430 acres in southeast Fort Worth amid concerns about noise pollution and declining value of nearby homes and businesses.

On Sept. 30, City Council members unanimously approved Black Mountain Power LLC’s request to amend the zoning of 119 acres that will allow for the project to move forward. The council previously approved related zoning changes for 312 acres.

Tuesday’s vote allows the land located at the southeast corner of Lon Stephenson Road and Forest Hill Drive to be used for light industrial.

In January, the company first requested council members approve a zoning change of 141 acres to light industrial. The company then acquired an additional 171 acres, also approved by council members in June.

Describing it as one of the “largest economic developments” in Tarrant County’s history, Black Mountain Energy LLC CEO Rhett Bennett said the project will benefit Fort Worth by providing millions in local taxes and thousands of job opportunities.

But several speakers said the project would hurt nearby businesses and natural areas, namely Weston Gardens, which sits roughly a hundred yards from the site.

“There will always be another opportunity for a data center in this day and time but never another place like Weston Gardens,” the garden center’s president Jackson Weston said.

Noise, light and air pollution generated by the data center will threaten the garden and its viability as a venue for the public to enjoy, said Jackson Weston and his mother, Sue Weston, the garden center’s founder and owner.

“No one wants to go to a garden that’s not peaceful and quiet,” she said.

Bennett assured council members that concerns about noise and traffic congestion were taken into consideration by implementing a “buffer” between the data center and nearby homes and properties. A floodplain between the data center and garden will contribute to mitigating noise disturbances, he said.

“We want to be thoughtful and be good neighbors regarding any noise or visibility issues,” Bennett said.

Jackson Weston questioned where Black Mountain Power would pull an adequate amount of water to power the digital facility, considering Weston Gardens relies on groundwater.

“If they’re denied city water due to restrictions, will they drill wells and deplete our water table?” Weston said.

When called to the dais, Bennett told council members Black Mountain Power has no plans to drill well water and will rely on Fort Worth’s municipal water supply.

Depending on a project’s resource needs, developers may be required to upgrade water transmission lines prior to construction, water department director Chris Harder told the council.

Paris Sanchez, a former landscape architect with Weston Gardens, agreed with Bennett on the benefits brought by data centers.

But those advantages come at “tremendous” environmental costs, Sanchez said, such as the amount of electricity required to power the facilities.

Electric consumption varies depending on the size of a data center, Mohammad Islam, University of Texas at Arlington assistant professor of computer science and engineering, told the Fort Worth Report. Data centers processing artificial intelligence, for example, require hundreds of megawatts of electricity.

About 16,400 homes in the United States can be powered on 100 megawatts.

Increased electricity use such as that from a data center can strain local energy infrastructure, Islam said.

Residents residing near the data center’s planned site lost power for three days during the February 2021 freeze in Texas that impacted millions, Sanchez told the council.

High demands for electricity, including those from constantly operating data centers and aging infrastructure, leaves the community susceptible to outages, Sanchez added.

While the water utility will service Black Mountain Power, data centers tend to have a greater impact on statewide resources rather than local supplies due to the amount of water required to generate electricity at this magnitude, Islam explained.

“You are not just getting power from one single energy source like one power plant but, rather, you are taking power from all of these different power plants,” Islam said.

Fort Worth resident Jessica Gonzalez stressed the importance of protecting Weston Gardens as a natural area.

Speakers said they worry that air pollution generated by the data center will compromise residents’ health, the local ecosystem and prompt habitat loss.

“Development and innovation are all inevitable … but at the same time, I think it is vitally important to protect the green spaces that we’ve got,” Gonzalez said. “I’m very, very concerned about the adverse effect that it could have on Weston Gardens (and) the surrounding areas … that mean so much to me and to other Fort Worthians.”

Before unanimously approving the zoning change, council member Jeanette Martinez was echoed by council members Deborah Peoples, Elizabeth Beck and Mayor Mattie Parker in her call for Fort Worth officials to consider an ordinance that creates limits and restrictions for data centers.

“I’m genuinely concerned about the number of data centers establishing themselves in the city of Fort Worth,” Martinez said. “Data centers require a significant amount of energy and water to operate.”

As part of his approval for the site plan, council member Chris Nettles, who represents the area, said he wants to ensure that Fort Worth officials meet the concerns of its residents and those in adjacent cities, such as Everman, Kennedale and Forest Hill.

“It is incumbent on the city of Fort Worth to make sure that, number one, we take care of the water and, number two, that we’re good neighbors,” Nettles said. “I’m very confident that the buffer will be enough to support between (Weston Gardens) versus the data center.”

The bottom-line findings: The EV purchased with the tax credit had the lowest total cost, the EV purchased without the tax credit had the next-lowest cost, and the gas vehicle was the most expensive to own.
The loss of the new vehicle tax credit greatly increased the financing cost for an EV, raising it above the cost of financing a gas vehicle.
Overall, EV drivers pay much less on average to fuel their vehicles, which gives EVs a major cost savings advantage in this category.
10 ways EV drivers can keep saving money There are many ways that EV drivers can keep reducing their daily costs.","The total cost of owning an electric vehicle changed on Oct. 1, 2025. That’s when no one could use the federal tax credits for new clean vehicles (a.k.a. 30D in the federal tax code), used clean vehicles (25E), and commercial clean vehicles (45W). These tax credits were designed to lower the upfront cost of EV purchases through 2032, and their early termination is likely to have a big impact on the EV market in the immediate future. However, there are still so many benefits of driving an EV that will never go away. EVs can be super easy to charge at home, fun to drive, and are better for the environment.

The total cost of ownership for a vehicle (also known as a TCO analysis) includes not only the upfront cost of the vehicle but also the maintenance, insurance, fuel, and registration costs that a driver can expect to pay every year. With the end of the tax credits and other recent market and policy changes, it’s worth revisiting this total cost and taking a deep dive into each category.

Calculating the total cost of vehicle ownership

For this analysis, we compared the gas and electric versions of the 2025 Chevrolet Equinox LT. These two cars are nearly identical, except for their fuel source, making them good for comparison. We also calculated the total costs for an EV with the tax credit for new clean vehicles (30D), which gave buyers a credit of $7,500 towards a vehicle purchase.

The bottom-line findings: The EV purchased with the tax credit had the lowest total cost, the EV purchased without the tax credit had the next-lowest cost, and the gas vehicle was the most expensive to own.

Each section below explains our methodology and the changes impacting each category.

The vehicle purchase cost

More than 80% of new car purchases are financed, so we included financing in our calculations. We assumed a loan duration of 5 years, an interest rate of 10%, and a down payment of 20%. Some automakers offer financing deals, and an interest rate of 5% could save the EV driver up to $4,000 on financing costs. We also assumed a sales tax of 7.6%, consistent with the national average. We used formulas from PlugStar.com to calculate the amount due at signing and the monthly loan payment.

The loss of the new vehicle tax credit greatly increased the financing cost for an EV, raising it above the cost of financing a gas vehicle. However, our financing cost did not include any non-federal incentives. There are still opportunities to take advantage of state and local tax incentives or other deals that can lower the upfront cost of a vehicle. Tariffs will very likely have an effect on new vehicle prices soon, regardless of drivetrain, but it’s unclear what the exact effects will be.

Vehicle maintenance

Over 10 years, the owner of the EV would save about $2,416 in maintenance costs compared to the gas car. We used AAA’s Your Driving Costs to calculate the maintenance costs for each car and assumed that it is driven 12,200 miles per year, the national average in 2023 according to KBB. EVs are cheaper to maintain because they have fewer moving parts and fewer fluids to replace. The battery can last 20 years or more, and the motor and electronics require little to no regular maintenance. This leads to fewer repairs needed and lower maintenance costs overall.

Car insurance

The EV owner in this scenario would pay about $3,360 more in insurance costs over 10 years. We again used AAA’s Your Driving Costs to find a yearly estimate for full-coverage insurance for an EV and compact SUV. EVs can be more expensive to insure than gas cars if they have a higher MSRP, requiring a higher level of insurance. And although EVs have fewer moving parts that require repairs, if the car ever needs to be repaired, it might need specialized parts that are shipped from other states. These increased insurance costs might be growing pains of the early EV market and could decrease over time.

Registration and additional fees

License and title fees are the same for both cars, so we estimated $90 for the initial registration year. We estimated $52 for registration each year after that, based on state averages.

However, in many states, there are additional fees that EV drivers have to pay for registration or charging. This is because gas cars contribute to state and federal highway revenue through gas taxes, while there is no equivalent fuel tax for EVs (although EV drivers pay into the system in other ways). The federal tax on gasoline has not been raised since 1993, which is partially why our transportation funding is lagging behind. In some states, the revenue from EV taxes goes towards charging infrastructure. There have also been recent proposals at the federal level to add hefty EV fees.

The National Conference of State Legislatures tracks EV and hybrid fees in each state, and we estimated an annual EV fee of $120 from this data. EV drivers pay more in road user fees than gas car drivers pay in gas taxes in at least 32 states, according to Atlas Public Policy. EV drivers want to pay their fair share for transportation funding, but these fees should not be punitive, as many of them are right now.

Electricity costs

When it comes to fueling up, EV drivers almost always have a financial advantage. Over 10 years, it costs more than twice as much to fuel a gas car as to charge an EV, for a total savings of $7,523 for the EV driver. We used an average residential electricity rate of about 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. We also assumed that 12% of charging occurred at public charging stations at an average rate of 48 cents per kilowatt-hour. Drivers who use public charging more often would pay more in fuel costs, since public charging electricity rates are higher than residential rates.

Residential electricity costs have risen in recent years due to increased load from AI data centers and air conditioning, decreased incentives for renewable energy generation, and the repeal of funding appropriated for grid upgrades. Gasoline prices are also artificially low, since the U.S. pays around $31 billion annually in direct fossil fuel subsidies, much more than any subsidies for renewable energy. Gas prices today don’t reflect these subsidies or the negative societal costs of fossil fuels, such as air pollution, which contributes to and exacerbates health issues like asthma.

Electricity and gasoline costs vary greatly by state. The Zero Emission Transportation Association’s ‘Electricity vs Gasoline Calculator’ breaks down fuel savings for an EV versus a gas car. These annual savings can range from 13% to over 60% depending on the state, using the Chevrolet Equinox as an example. Overall, EV drivers pay much less on average to fuel their vehicles, which gives EVs a major cost savings advantage in this category.

10 ways EV drivers can keep saving money

There are many ways that EV drivers can keep reducing their daily costs. Here are 10 of our favorites:

Consider buying a used EV – buyers are getting great deals!

Look up EV purchase and charging incentives available from your utility, state, and city. These incentives are easy to search on PlugStar.com.

See if your vehicle manufacturer or utility offers discounts on charging equipment.

If you live in multifamily housing, look for incentives that might cover the cost of installing charging at multifamily properties from your state, city, or utility.

Charge at home if you can, and consider using a Level 1 or low-power Level 2 home charger to meet your daily needs.

Use free public chargers, which are easy to search for on PlugShare.

Find out if your workplace offers free or low-cost EV charging.

Learn about managed charging options from your local utility, and take advantage of time-of-use rates to save money during peak periods.

Install vehicle-to-building or vehicle-to-grid charging to power your home or get credits from your utility. Many EV drivers integrate solar panels into this system.

Do your research along the way to get great deals on every purchase and service!

If you can’t currently charge at home, there are still ways to save money with an EV. You can advocate for right-to-charge policies in your state or city, which will give drivers who live in condos, apartments, or HOAs the right to install charging stations if they meet baseline requirements. Drivers don’t have to pay the installation costs by themselves; many states, cities, and utilities offer incentives for charging installation at multifamily housing. Although charging at home has the highest cost-saving potential, many utilities, municipalities, companies, and organizations are working to make charging more affordable and accessible for everyone.

In July, TTU System established a partnership with Fermi America to create what they described as one of the most significant power campuses in the US and the largest advanced energy, private grid and intelligence development in the world. The Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus aims to support the growing demands of artificial intelligence (AI), data innovation and sustainable energy. It will be located in the Texas Panhandle and will include 18m square feet of data centres and generate up to 11 GWe of IT capacity from natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear energy.

Under the first LOI, Siemens Energy is to deliver in 2026 three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbines capable of producing up to 1.1 GWe in combined cycle mode. These are designed for round-the-clock, base-load power, and add to Fermi’s total of 2 GWe of already secured or contracted natural gas generation capacity for the site.

The second LOI envisages collaboration on Siemens nuclear steam turbines, generators, and control systems. These would be integrated into Fermi’s nuclear portfolio, which is expected to include four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors. In August, Fermi America, co-founded by former US Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry, also signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to develop the nuclear component the hypergrid.

The project is seen as central to the Trump administration’s energy dominance agenda. “Winning the AI arms race doesn’t just take software developers. It takes more electricity,” said Doug Burgum, chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council.

“No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,” said Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. “The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America’s position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.”

Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder, noted: “Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for – highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy- through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that’s how America keeps its AI edge.”",https://www.neimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/10/Fermi_America__Rendering_of_the_Fermi_America_Campus.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 14:04:37.357610

The CBA’s program will feature a 20-week training experience combining educational models and job-readiness training in building science, workplace citizenship, communications and financial literacy.
“Over the next six months, CBA will work closely with workforce development consultants and local partners to evaluate and incorporate leading educational programs into the final Climate Service Corps design,” the CBA statement concluded.
Massachusetts Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer said in the announcement statement last week that “Massachusetts is full speed ahead on creating good-paying, meaningful clean energy jobs.” “Today, MassCEC is making our vision for a Climate Service Corps a reality.
This creates a clear pathway — from recruitment and skill development to hands-on climate service and work experience in permanent career placements,” MassCEC said.","LOWELL — The Healey-Driscoll administration and other officials formally launched the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center’s Climate Service Corps last week, and with it comes grant funding for a Lowell-based organization to design a program to train young people in sustainable building.

Coalition for a Better Acre was one of four organizations from across the state to receive this year’s Climate Service Corps grant award, with $50,000 going to the organization to help it focus on “training local young people in sustainable building operations in public and affordable housing in the Greater Lowell area.”

The program designed by CBA will be done in conjunction with the city of Lowell and the Lowell Housing Authority.

“The Climate Service Corps is an investment in both people and progress,” said MassCEC CEO Dr. Emily Reichert in a statement. “By supporting organizations that train and mentor young adults for clean energy careers, we are building a workforce that is ready to meet the state’s growing needs and ensuring that clean energy reaches communities quickly, equitably, and effectively.”

CBA has served the Acre neighborhood in Lowell for more than 40 years, starting in 1982 when a group of community members got together to push back against an urban renewal plan that would have displaced hundreds of residents. Over the years the organization has grown, and now CEO Dan Rivera said this grant funding enables them “to invest in the future of the young people in the Acre and our community at large.”

“By preparing the next generation for climate-critical careers, we’re not only opening doors to good-paying jobs, but also ensuring a healthier, more sustainable Lowell for all,” said Rivera in a statement Tuesday morning. “We are excited about launching a program at a time when the Commonwealth is making a concerted effort to invest in affordable and public housing that lowers energy for low-income families while improving comfort and air quality right here in the Acre.”

The CBA’s new Climate Service Corps will be aimed at the education and training of local young adults in “building science fundamentals and sustainable building operations,” according to Tuesday’s statement from the organization. The training curriculum will take into account the general move to all-electric systems in new homes.

The CBA’s program will feature a 20-week training experience combining educational models and job-readiness training in building science, workplace citizenship, communications and financial literacy. Upon completion, participants will “be equipped to pursue careers in fields such as Weatherization, HVAC, Building Automation Systems, Building Inspection, and Facility and Property Management,” the CBA said.

“Over the next six months, CBA will work closely with workforce development consultants and local partners to evaluate and incorporate leading educational programs into the final Climate Service Corps design,” the CBA statement concluded.

Massachusetts Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer said in the announcement statement last week that “Massachusetts is full speed ahead on creating good-paying, meaningful clean energy jobs.”

“Today, MassCEC is making our vision for a Climate Service Corps a reality. Kudos to our hardworking team at MassCEC, and I can’t wait to see the good work these young people are going to do in the world,” said Hoffer.

Other recipients of this round of grant funding for climate-based job training include the city of Boston’s Office of Workforce Development for Powercorps Boston, which is receiving $375,000 for program implementation support. Greenfield Community College, where the grant awards were announced last week, received $374,995 for the same thing. The Worcester Community Action Council will receive $50,000 in grant funding for planning support.

The CSC will focus on young people aged 18 to 24 “in environmental justice neighborhoods, low-income communities, federally recognized or state-acknowledged tribes and current and former workers of the fossil fuel industry,” MassCEC said in the announcement last week.

“The CSC provides planning grants to support local initiatives, and implementation grants to launch and enhance the programs.

A look at the global natural gas and LNG markets by the numbers

1.2 Bcf/d: FERC has approved a request from Caturus Energy LLC to begin site prep for the proposed 9.5 million tons/year (Mt/y) Commonwealth LNG terminal in Louisiana. Commonwealth is currently unsanctioned, but Caturus is one of a growing list of U.S. developers vying to be the fifth company to reach a final investment decision on a U.S. project this year. At peak operation, the facility could add roughly 1.2 Bcf/d in feed gas demand to the Gulf Coast market by early 2029.

36 trains: Venture Global Inc. has begun introducing nitrogen to Block 17 at its Plaquemines LNG facility after an order granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The introduction of nitrogen is usually shortly followed by a request to introduce feed gas, launching early production activities. The block of two modular liquefaction trains is the final pair of Plaquemines’ 36 trains to begin commissioning. At peak capacity, the facility could create between 2.6-3.2 Bcf/d in feed gas demand for the Gulf Coast market.

10 Mt/y: A fourth midscale train at Cheniere Energy Inc.’s Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion project has been undergoing startup activities, according to a filing with Texas environmental regulators. The Houston-based company told state officials flaring and other commissioning activities could last up to a year as crews bring the 0.626 Mt/y capacity train online. Once complete, all seven trains of Stage 3 would increase export capacity at Corpus Christi LNG by 10 Mt/y.

500 MMcf/d: Cedar LNG Partners LP disclosed it is planning to seek federal approval from Canadian energy regulators to upsize the capacity of its proposed LNG export project in British Columbia to 500 MMcf/d. The project partners, led by the Haisla Nation and Pembina Pipeline Corp., were originally approved to export 400 MMcf/d. The floating LNG unit currently under construction in South Korea could add around 3.8 Mt/y in export capacity to Canada’s growing BC LNG hub by 2028.

The report stated that without voluntary commitments from companies to purchase renewable power, many projects would face financing challenges, threatening the ability to meet rising US electricity demand.

It also underscores the importance of virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs), which allow companies to lock in long-term contract with renewable energy projects to buy the future electricity generated at a predetermined price.

Securing financing for a project is contingent upon the loan provider having clarity on who will purchase the electricity and at what price.

Without such contracts in place, projects are unlikely to obtain the necessary loans for development.

CEBA US strategy senior vice-president Misti Groves stated: “It confirms that corporate buyers are critical to ensuring the US can build enough clean energy at the pace and scale that’s needed to meet skyrocketing power demand from the growth in artificial intelligence, electrification, and a resurgence in US manufacturing.”

Pine Gate Renewables executive vice-president David Groleau stated: “Corporate buyers are the backbone of clean energy deployment, anchoring project financing and shaping the future of reliable, cost-effective power.”

Pine Gate is a US-based company that develops, owns and operates utility scale solar and energy storage projects.

Completed by the renewable energy data firm REsurety, the study examined the economic performance of 251 wind and solar projects within three key power markets: the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and PJM Interconnection.

The findings revealed that the renewable power projects frequently encounter substantial financial challenges in generating revenue without the backing of corporate buyers.

VPPAs decrease the number of projects experiencing financial difficulties – by 90% in MISO and PJM, and by 80% in ERCOT.

Renewable energy certificates (RECs) play a significant role by decreasing the number of projects facing financial difficulties by 30% and offering a stable source of additional revenue.

Since 2016, corporate buyers have emerged as a stabilising influence in the US clean energy sector, contributing to more than 40% of the new clean energy capacity additions.

Solar energy company Primergy chief commercial officer Emily Cohen stated: “The acceleration of corporate purchases from clean energy projects transformed the US market over the past 10 years, providing developers and owners long-term, stable revenues on projects and a view on future demand to help maintain continued growth.

“As new markets evolve, we are excited to see more corporates buying energy across the country to bring the benefits of new energy resources.”

CEBA is a business trade organisation dedicated to mobilising a network of energy consumers and partners to implement market and policy strategies aimed at achieving a carbon emissions-free energy system.

The changes are also expected, the department's secretary has said, to enhance enforcement of the state's oil and gas sector.
Often at the center of complex disputes in a state rich with energy resources, the department has a large and expanding footprint.
Groundwater regulation in Baton Rouge is now fully under the control of the newly reorganized state agency.
""This agency is designed by the oil industry for its own benefit, and that should scare everyone in this state,"" Rolfes said.","Louisiana's energy and natural resources agency will be fully reorganized and have its second new name in less than two years starting Wednesday after a suite of internal and legislative changes over the past 21 months.

Officials with the new Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources, say the changes will place it on a more modern and transparent footing to balance ""economic growth and environmental stewardship.""

The changes are also expected, the department's secretary has said, to enhance enforcement of the state's oil and gas sector. It will also streamline permitting, a change welcomed by the industry.

""In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago. Technology, industry and environmental best practices have changed a great deal over those decades, and it’s time this agency caught up,"" Dustin Davidson, secretary of the renamed department, said in a statement earlier this month.

Often at the center of complex disputes in a state rich with energy resources, the department has a large and expanding footprint. It has a hand in regulating oil and gas, pipelines, wind and solar energy, underground injection, carbon capture and sequestration, groundwater use, and development in the coastal zone.

Department officials warned that, though the reorganization would be in effect Wednesday, the full integration from operating under the old structure to the new one could take time.

Among the changes instituted this spring and summer by the Legislature, the reorganization has also done away with a district dating from the mid-1970s that oversaw groundwater use to prevent saltwater intrusion into the Baton Rouge-area's aquifer. Groundwater regulation in Baton Rouge is now fully under the control of the newly reorganized state agency.

Oil and gas groups welcomed the broader reorganization, while one environmental group said it expected to see little difference from what they claimed is an agency that has been an industry ""rubber stamp.""

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, pointed out that the former department secretary who led the reorganization, Tyler Gray, previously led an industry trade group, the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.

""This agency is designed by the oil industry for its own benefit, and that should scare everyone in this state,"" Rolfes said.

Tommy Faucheux, the current president of LMOGA, countered that his trade group is optimistic the changes will clear up red tape and uncertainty, a shift that is ""essential for the state to prosper.""

""It’s important that our state’s regulatory structure can challenge industry to improve while working productively to foster the economic opportunities in oil and gas that will keep our kids here in Louisiana,"" he said.

Six new offices

Faucheux and Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, also welcomed the arrival of Davidson as the new secretary. Faucheux highlighted his experience with energy policy, while Moncla cited his past work with Davidson, who was previously DENR deputy secretary and a former congressional staffer in Washington.

Gray, Landry's first appointment to the department, led the reorganization until he stepped down last month. The effort followed an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry early in his term.

The new department will go by the acronym ""C&E,"" which had been the Department of Natural Resources for decades before an earlier name change in January 2024 to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

Implemented through two regular sessions and one special legislative session, the changes did away with the historical Office of Conservation and shuffled offices within the new department while boosting their number from four to six.

The Office of Conservation was Louisiana's chief oil-and-gas regulator since the early days of the state's petroleum industry. The office's gubernatorially appointed commissioners retained independent regulatory powers through the years even after the office was folded inside DNR.

The Legislature, at department officials' urging, first removed the administrative division between the department and the office. It then did away with the conservation commissioner and vested the commissioner's powers in the secretary of the new department.

In the most recent session, Act 458, sponsored by state Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, was the primary vehicle for the reorganization. Many of its more than 225 pages removed responsibilities from the state commissioner of conservation and handed them to the new C&E secretary.

Among the six new offices, the reorganization consolidated oil, gas and coastal management permitting and compliance, the latter of which affects wetlands development, under one Office of Permitting and Compliance.

A separate division, the Office of Enforcement, will handle inspection and enforcement of permitted oil and gas wells and other activities for which the state has regulatory primacy, such as underground injection and carbon capture.

'Win over the public trust'

In a recent speech to carbon capture executives at LSU, Davidson emphasized the significance of separating permitting from enforcement.

The biennial filing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission projects average annual bill increases of about 2.1% over the next decade, less than inflation and far lower than costs forecast in the company’s prior plan.

“North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy’s low energy rates continue to support this region’s economic success,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president.

The plan calls for new natural gas units in Person, Catawba, Rowan and Richmond counties, expanded battery storage at sites including the Mayo Plant in Person County, and next-generation nuclear at Belews Creek in Stokes County. Duke is also targeting 4,000 megawatts of solar by 2034, while continuing its phased exit from coal.

Electricity demand in North Carolina and South Carolina is growing at eight times the pace of the prior 15 years, fueled by manufacturing projects that have brought more than $19 billion in investment and 25,000 new jobs to North Carolina in 2025 alone. Duke said the resource plan is meant to keep the state competitive by ensuring reliable power for industry and residents alike.

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

North Carolina projects

The plan’s footprint stretches across the state:

Person County would host two combined-cycle natural gas plants supporting heavy manufacturing growth in the Triangle and central Piedmont.

Catawba and Rowan counties are targeted for new combustion turbines to handle peak demand, adding flexible generation capacity along the I-85 corridor.

Richmond County could see another turbine, reinforcing a long-standing hub of power production in southeastern North Carolina.

Belews Creek in Stokes County remains a candidate for small modular nuclear reactors, positioning the site for one of the first next-generation nuclear projects in the Southeast. Alternatively, Duke is considering large light water reactors at its Cherokee County site in South Carolina. Proceeding at either site would represent the plan’s largest investment.

Mayo Plant in Person County is one of several sites listed for large-scale battery storage, part of a 5,600-megawatt buildout across the Carolinas.

Duke also highlighted upgrades already under way: 300 megawatts of new nuclear capacity added through efficiency uprates at existing reactors, and a 280-megawatt boost at the Bad Creek pumped storage hydro station, which supplies both Carolinas.

Growth pressures

Electricity demand across North Carolina and South Carolina is rising at a pace eight times faster than the prior 15 years. New projects announced in North Carolina this year alone have topped $19 billion in investment tied to more than 25,000 jobs, much of it in manufacturing.

That growth has already outpaced the forecast filed just two years ago. Duke says the plan is designed to keep the state competitive by ensuring reliable and affordable power for both new industry and residents.

Energy transition

While natural gas and nuclear anchor the new plan, Duke is also targeting 4,000 megawatts of solar by 2034, with sites to be determined through competitive bidding. Battery storage, meanwhile, is nearly doubling from the prior plan to meet near-term growth and take advantage of federal tax credits.

Coal plants at Belews Creek, Cliffside and Marshall could see their lives extended briefly under new federal rules, but Duke said it is maintaining a phased exit from coal.

Next steps

The plan builds on the 2023 filing approved last year and dovetails with Duke’s request to combine its two North Carolina utilities into one system. That merger, if approved, could save more than $1 billion by avoiding duplicate infrastructure.

South Carolina regulators will receive their own version of the plan later this year, followed by public hearings in both states in 2026.",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FASTFACTSDUKE.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 11:01:18.467969

READ: The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 30% Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada's Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

If you are a Consumers Energy customer, you’ll soon be paying more for natural gas.

State utility regulators approved a 8.1% rate hike for CMS natural gas customers. The increase in monthly bills will begin in November.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) said the rate increase will amount to an added $6.44 on the monthly bill for a typical residential customer using 75 ccf (hundred cubic feet).

The Commission also directed CMS to present detailed evidence in its next gas rate case demonstrating the company’s efforts to offset inflation with productivity increases.

The MPSC directed CMS to file an updated 10-year gas delivery plan by the end of 2026. The plan will need to consider the costs and risks of various energy transition pathways, and to include in the plan forecasted yearly sales for each major customer class and the amount of throughput expected on a peak demand day for each year.

The commission also approved enhancements to an assistance program for low and moderate income customers, along with some infrastructure investments to improve reliability.

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy's road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

""North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy's low energy rates continue to support this region's economic success,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.""

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan's future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company's recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

""We've also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,"" Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What's next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

Nevertheless, CRE owners must bridge the gap while keeping their operating budget intact.
Energy efficiency initiatives are the bridge.
First, benchmark every facility to flag the worst energy efficiency performers.
Finally, suppose you are unable to outrun the clock on the ITC regulations and their effect on solar projects.","America’s commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios are under a two-sided squeeze. On one side, electricity demand is exploding as data centers, reshored manufacturing, and fleets of EV chargers are plugged into buildings never designed for such loads. The Department of Energy expects nationwide consumption to jump 25-30% by 2030, and many local grids are already issuing capacity warnings.

On the other side, the solar-subsidy landscape that once underwrote rooftop projects has started to shift. While the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) preserved the headline 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC), the subsequent “One Big Beautiful Bill” has accelerated timelines and restricted access depending on equipment and financing choices. Under the new rules, projects seeking the tax credits must either commence construction by July 4, 2026, or, if they do not, be placed in service by December 31, 2027, with additional “foreign entity of concern” restrictions beginning in 2026 that can disqualify projects using ineligible components. For CRE portfolios, this creates a narrow, time-bound window to lock in credits and compliant supply chains, which is why owners should move quickly to advance solar in parallel with efficiency upgrades.

Solar paradox

Despite these challenges, the long-run case for on-site solar remains strong because wholesale energy prices will keep rising with demand. Nevertheless, CRE owners must bridge the gap while keeping their operating budget intact. Energy efficiency initiatives are the bridge. LED retrofits, advanced controls, and right-sized HVAC upgrades deliver day one cash-flow-positive savings while avoiding policy uncertainty.

Each kilowatt-hour saved is a dollar back into the company that can be used for other revenue-driving operations. Efficiency also multiplies savings in other areas: by cutting peak load, it frees electrical capacity for future electrification projects, extends the life of existing equipment, and buys runtime from backup generators and batteries when the grid blinks. In this context, efficiency is not just a green initiative — it decreases costs and provides infrastructure insurance.

Subsidies & regulations

As it becomes harder to implement solar due to the ITC restrictions, companies should now be asking how efficiency can offset rising rates and where upgraded controls can enable revenue. Decision makers increasingly screen capital requests through a three-part filter:

Savings — immediate reduction in kWh and kW charges

Resilience — ability to ride through outages or demand-response events

Sustainability — contribution to emissions-reduction targets

Projects that score on at least two fronts move to the top of the queue, and efficiency nearly always clears the bar.

On the regulatory front, 10 states and more than 40 cities have adopted Building Performance Standards that set energy-use thresholds for large properties, with non-compliance penalties reaching $10 per square foot per year in Washington, D.C., and daily fines of $1,000 in Boston. Because most standards ratchet downward every five years, owners who bank early efficiency gains effectively front-load compliance and avoid paying twice: first in fines, later in rushed capital projects. Investors now view proactive upgrades as a hedge against policy risk rather than discretionary ESG spend.

In 38 states, Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) programs can fund 100% of hard and soft costs at fixed rates up to 30 years. State green banks in New York and Connecticut layer credit enhancements on top, while national energy-as-a-service providers wrap design, installation, and maintenance into a single monthly fee. In short, lack of capital is no longer a credible reason to defer upgrades.

A new path forward

From this, a practical roadmap is emerging for addressing changes to subsidies and regulations. First, benchmark every facility to flag the worst energy efficiency performers. Second, tackle “no-regrets” measures with two- to four-year paybacks such as networked lighting, VFDs on pumps and fans, demand-controlled ventilation, and occupancy-based controls. Third, bundle upgrades across multiple sites to unlock scale pricing and qualify for energy-as-a-service or operating-lease financing that keeps debt off the balance sheet. Finally, suppose you are unable to outrun the clock on the ITC regulations and their effect on solar projects. In that case, it may be worth waiting 18-24 months while monitoring the economics of upgrading or further changes to regulations.

Today’s advanced technologies are enabling smart building platforms to pull real-time data from submeters, occupancy sensors, and weather feeds, then use machine-learning models for fine-tuning setpoints minute by minute. A recent case study at 45 Broadway in Manhattan showed that AI controls cut HVAC energy use by 15.8% and saved $42,000 annually. Broader analyses suggest AI could trim building energy consumption by at least 8% across climate zones. For owners managing dispersed portfolios, cloud dashboards make it practical to benchmark, dispatch technicians, and verify savings without flying staff from site to site, closing the loop between strategy and measurable results.

Over time, portfolios will need both efficiency and distributed generation to meet decarbonization and resilience goals, efficiency to flatten the load curve, and solar plus storage to supply the remainder. Timing matters, though. Only efficiency delivers value today, making it the on-ramp to everything else.

The remainder of this decade will reward owners who move from subsidy chasing to load management. By treating efficiency as the prerequisite for resilient, low-carbon operations and by measuring success in freed-up capacity as well as kilowatt-hours saved, CRE leaders can protect profitability now while positioning their portfolios for a far more electrified and opportunity-rich future.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies.
GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada's Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/19a21881-ca2e-4c58-9ac3-29d5a9706b13/20251001T120004/19a21881-ca2e-4c58-9ac3-29d5a9706b13_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 10:00:44.233603

“We’re seeing a lot in biosciences…We’re also still seeing significant interest in potential growth of data centers and artificial intelligence.

Duke submitted its biennial resource plan Wednesday morning to the North Carolina Utilities Commission. It’s a proposed roadmap of how the utility will operate in the coming years.

One of the biggest issues the utility will face is supplying energy to the growing region.

Click to resize

According to Duke, customer needs over the next 15 years will grow at eight times the rate of the previous 15 years.

To put it in perspective, South Carolina uses about 80 terawatt hours per year, according to Glen Snider the managing director of integrated resource planning.

The expected growth “is equivalent to what South Carolina consumes today,” Snider said.

And that growth isn’t just from residents.

“We’re seeing continued growth in general manufacturing,” said Kendal Bowman. Duke’s North Carolina president. “We’re seeing a lot in biosciences…We’re also still seeing significant interest in potential growth of data centers and artificial intelligence. We are definitely seeing a strong pipeline of businesses and we think it will only continue.”

The second issue is customer cost.

The plan is to lean on existing energy sources to keep customer costs down. In the proposed plan, customers may see an average 2.1% annual increase over the coming decade. That’s lower than the current inflation rate of 2.9% and about half the yearly average of previous plans, Bowman said.

To put that into dollars, Bowman said a decade from now residents would see about a $30 increase as opposed to a $54.

“We’re doing everything we can to try to keep rates as low as possible for our customers, while we’re doing our part to make sure we keep jobs and investment coming to the Carolinas,” Bowman said. “We’re trying to keep those costs as low as possible by maximizing our existing generation. We’re trying to squeeze out every megawatt we can from our existing fleet of assets.”

With the plan submitted, the state’s utility commission in the coming months will schedule several public hearings on the plan. The commission will vote on the plan by the end of 2026.

And later this year, Duke will file a similar plan with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina.

Here’s a look at some of the resources, a bit more information on data centers and the Power Bill Reduction Act:

Increase in battery storage and nuclear

Duke plans to lean in on battery storage and nuclear, especially because there are tax credits available for utilities interested in both investments.

In Duke’s previous plan, the goal was to increase battery storage by 2,900 megawatts through 2031. That’s expanded to 5,600 megawatts by 2034.

In this plan, Duke wants 1,117 megawatts of new nuclear to come online by 2037.

“We’re the nation’s largest nuclear operator in the country,” Snider said. “Nuclear provides nearly half of the energy on the grid today and as load grows, we need to grow our nuclear fleet.”

Battery storage is what it sounds like. When demand is low or when prices are lowered, the utility will store energy for high use times, such as the middle of a summer day or an early winter morning.

Natural gas

Duke would like to build two natural gas-powered generators combustion turbines in Rowan County. The additions would make up seven sites for increase natural gas creation. The utility requested permission to build the new turbines at the former Buck Steam Station site in July.

Solar, coal and wind

With the passage of the Power Bill Reduction Act, which Gov. Josh Stein vetoed and the general assembly overturned, Duke is no longer obligated to reduced its carbon emissions by 2030. However, the utility still has to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

There’s also the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which cut renewable tax credits for wind and solar energy.

Duke is no longer pursuing wind options in the immediate future, siting that the resource isn’t economically viable.

Solar is still a focus for the utility, especially with the upcoming ending of tax credits. Several solar centers are nearing construction completion.

The Power Reduction bill also gives the utility leeway to continue utilizing its existing coal plants. It will extend usage of the dual-fuel plants by two to four years, including the Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County.

In Duke’s previous plan, the goal was to convert that plant into a nuclear site. The retirement extension, Snider said, allows for a better and possibly cheaper conversion to nuclear in the future.

“We’ve been in the middle of transitioning away from coal for more than a decade,” Snider said. “We think an orderly transition out of coal still makes sense given the aging nature of our fleet. But having the flexibility to incrementally move some retirements by a couple of years really does help… We can respond to the growth we’re seeing, and it allows us to spread those retirement investments evenly over time to minimize bill impacts.”

Data centers in North and South Carolina

The plan doesn’t address data centers but Duke acknowledges that more data centers will possibly make their way to the Carolinas.

One of the major worries of residents is whether the utility will foot the bill for the additional energy usage that data centers are known to need.

Bowman said Duke puts together its rates by cost of service and with large load customers, such as data centers, its rates are different from residents.

But the utility and the commission is looking into protections for residents in regard to data centers and possible increases of energy bills.

High electricity prices hit the poorest households the hardest since they spend a larger share of their money on their power bills.
So, no — we’re not in an energy crisis, but it’s unlikely that your power bills will come down anytime soon.","Like most Americans this month, your most recent power bill may have given you a shock. Residential electricity rates have risen fast across the US — more than 30 percent on average since 2020 and almost double the rate of inflation in the past year — with no end in sight.

It’s not great for anyone’s budget, whether you’re a renter or an industrialist. High electricity prices ripple beyond consumers and throughout the whole economy, disrupting manufacturing, construction, transportation, and more.

And of course, electricity prices are a huge political issue. President Donald Trump campaigned on cutting energy prices in half, and now that they’re moving in the wrong direction, he has taken to blaming renewables, the cheapest sources of new generation, and promised $625 million to the ailing US coal industry. Power bills are becoming a hot button in local politics, too, like the New Jersey governor’s race, and you’ll likely see them featured in more political ads.

Given how fast and how high electricity prices have jumped, just how worried should we be? Is this a crisis, something that’s going to put more households in danger of getting their power shut off while driving up inflation and slowing growth? Or is this a return to normal after an era of unusually low prices?

There are several dynamics driving the current power price spike. Rising electricity demand, volatile fuel prices, inflation, tariffs, a slowdown in transmission line construction, and long delays in adding new generators to the power grid are all conspiring to create more expensive utility bills. And these variables aren’t changing direction anytime soon, so unfortunately, your bills will likely rise further.

“All of those factors are combining to create a scenario in which there could be long-lived year-over-year increases in electricity prices,” said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

High electricity prices hit the poorest households the hardest since they spend a larger share of their money on their power bills. Power shutoffs due to nonpayment were already rising at the beginning of the year. Close to 80 million Americans have to trade off between paying their electricity bills and other expenses like health care and housing, and utilities are asking their regulators to raise rates further. “To a big segment of households — lower income-, even moderate-income households — it’s already a crisis,” Quigley said.

But there is some important context you have to consider, and some of the big picture trends are actually working to help us spend less on energy and reduce our impact on the environment. How quickly this happens, though, will depend on policy decisions in the near term.

One thing to keep in mind is that electricity is just one form of energy that you use. You may also have to pay for natural gas for heating and cooking, as well as gasoline for your sedan or pickup truck. But many American homes are electrifying, trading gas furnaces for more efficient heat pumps, gas burners for induction stoves, and V8 engines for electric motors. Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit think tank, dubbed this combined basket of household electricity and fuel spending the “energy wallet,” using it as a way to track how these trends are changing over time while accounting for fuel switching.

Last month, EPRI released a report calculating that in 2024, the average annual US energy wallet spending was $5,530 per household. Gasoline was the largest slice of that pie, at $2,930 per household, while electricity was $1,850. Adjusting for inflation, overall energy spending has actually held fairly steady since 2000. And prior to 2024, electricity spending was mostly level as well. Perhaps it’s more remarkable that overall energy spending was so stable for so long.

Now, electricity prices are surging in addition to all of the uncorked demand from the Covid-19 pandemic, when the global economic slowdown and pressure from policymakers kept a lid on utility bills.

“I think if we were to repeat this analysis for next year, there would probably be a little bit of an uptick this year, but the data that I’m looking at doesn’t suggest a really significant increase in the historical context,” said Geoffrey Blanford, the lead author of EPRI’s report.

But there isn’t just one story unfolding across the country.

The US has a particularly chaotic energy system. How much people pay to light their homes, stay warm, and get around varies a lot from state to state, and even among neighbors. For example, Texas households tend to spend a larger share of their budgets on keeping their pickup trucks running, while families in Massachusetts spend a greater portion on staying warm.

So, no — we’re not in an energy crisis, but it’s unlikely that your power bills will come down anytime soon. There is some good news though: In the years ahead, Americans are actually poised to spend a smaller share of their incomes on energy overall as technology makes it more cost-effective to shift away from fossil fuels.

“In our forward-looking scenarios, one of the key drivers for change is electrification, particularly light-duty vehicles,” Blanford said. “This tends to actually reduce the energy wallet in real terms per household over time even as you’re spending more on electricity.” Though electric car sales have slowed down in the US, they are still rolling into more driveways. And as homes and appliances become more efficient, that will help reduce energy bills as well. Based on current trends, the average US household energy wallet will shrink by 36 percent by 2050, with state-level declines anywhere from 10 to 50 percent, according to the report.

Looking ahead to the upcoming winter, there are also things that policymakers can do to soften the blow of higher electricity rates for the most vulnerable families. One is to bolster initiatives like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, an initiative Trump wanted to eliminate. Another is to impose generation requirements on major new power users like data centers to run AI models so they aren’t competing with households for existing electrons on the grid. “These data centers, which are kind of ground zero of all of the angst about increasing costs, they should be, without question, required to bring their own power,” Quicgley said.

And there needs to be a major push to deploy more generation and upgrades to the power grid, particularly energy storage. Grid-scale batteries have seen breathtaking growth in the past few years, but they’re still a small segment of the energy mix. “There needs to be a huge push to foster battery deployment,” Quigley said. “The quickest way to bring on new generation is to look at solar and storage.”

We’re still facing chaos in the energy industry, and the Trump administration isn’t making things easy for utilities, power providers, and even the fossil fuel industry. But we have many of the tools we need to manage higher utility prices, if we’re willing to invest in them. For us normal people, the US Department of Energy recommends tactics like conducting a home energy audit, using energy-efficient appliances, installing double-pane windows, and sealing gaps in doors.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/GettyImages-2203483581.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C12.005100727099%2C100%2C75.989798545802&w=1200,N,,2025-10-01 10:00:36.154515

While development-stage firms have gone public before, its unusual for a company under a year old with no revenue to pursue an IPO at a $10 billion-plus valuation.

“It (Fermi’s IPO) speaks to the gold rush happening in AI infrastructure right now. It’s a cash geyser,” said Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs.

Amarillo, Texas-based Fermi sold 32.5 million shares at $21 each in an upsized IPO, after marketing them between $18 and $22.

Founded in January 2025, Fermi secured a $12.5 billion valuation in the IPO, just months after issuing convertible bonds at a valuation of $3 billion.

“Demand for AI-driven infrastructure — and Fermi’s plan to pair it with its own modern power sources — has investors intrigued,” said Troy Hooper, co-head of equity capital markets, Americas, at Mergermarket. “The company’s political ties are seen as another tailwind.”

Co-founded by former Texas Governor and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Fermi has bold ambitions. The company is aiming to build the world’s largest energy and data complex, powered by nuclear, natural gas and solar.

BUILD IT, THEY WILL COME

Project Matador, Fermi’s flagship project, is expected to deliver 1.1 gigawatt of power by 2026 end and up to 11 GW at scale. A gigawatt of power is roughly half the Hoover Dam’s full generating capacity, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Last month, Fermi entered a non-binding letter of intent with its first tenant for a 20-year agreement. Still, it does not expect tenant revenue to commence until 2027.

“Any investor buying Fermi will need to have a mindset of “if you build it, they will come,” Kennedy said.

Analysts said execution will be key to sustain market enthusiasm, with investors expected to closely scrutinize signed contracts and progress on its ambitious buildout.

A successful listing could pave the way for other long-duration, capital-intensive AI infrastructure bets, according to Hooper.

Still, some caution persists.

“History offers a cautionary note: many pre-revenue IPOs during the Dot-com era and the recent SPAC boom failed to live up to the hype and ended poorly,” Hooper said.

None of this is to say that climate change is not a real and urgent problem.","On Oct. 6, the Maryland Supreme Court will hear consolidated appeals in climate lawsuits filed by Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County against numerous American energy companies. At stake is whether Maryland law can be stretched to hold American energy producers liable for the global effects of climate change.

State court judges in Baltimore and Annapolis already dismissed these cases as preempted by federal law. The question now is whether Maryland’s highest court will affirm that ruling or allow identical litigation that has failed in Maryland and across the country to continue.

Since 2017, close to three dozen states, counties and municipalities have tried to use state consumer or nuisance laws to pin the costs of climate change on energy producers. Most have lost. Courts in New Jersey, South Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania have already dismissed such claims, finding them far beyond the scope of state laws.

Climate change is a global challenge. Emissions come from billions of decisions made over more than a century, across every state and country. Courts have consistently recognized that no single jurisdiction can regulate global emissions through local tort law. As one South Carolina judge warned, these suits risk creating a “chaotic web of conflicting legal obligations.” That is why the U.S. Supreme Court in American Electric Power v. Connecticut – in a decision handed down by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – unanimously held that federal law governs these claims, and why Maryland judges have already dismissed them.

Even the Biden-Harris administration acknowledged that these cases face constitutional hurdles. In the former solicitor general’s brief, the Justice Department admitted that climate lawsuits may falter when they attempt to penalize companies for out-of-state or international conduct. The brief noted defendants “may ultimately prevail on their contention that respondents’ claims are barred by the Constitution … to the extent the claims rely on conduct occurring outside” state borders. That rationale led a Delaware state court to narrow that state’s lawsuit to in-state emissions and a Baltimore court to dismiss its case outright last year. The legal foundation for climate litigation is shaky at best.

National security leaders have also urged caution. Retired Air Force Gen. Richard Myers and retired Navy Adm. Michael Mullen warned that undermining petroleum production through litigation could harm America’s fuel security and military readiness.

None of this is to say that climate change is not a real and urgent problem. Marylanders know firsthand the risks of rising seas, stronger storms and hotter summers. But the state’s path forward lies in practical solutions, not courtroom battles with little chance of success.

Maryland has already invested in resilience projects, renewable energy and emissions-reduction initiatives that make a measurable difference. Expanding those efforts, through innovation, infrastructure and collaboration will do far more for local communities than years of costly litigation likely to end in dismissal.

It is also worth noting that the Baltimore, Annapolis and Anne Arundel County cases have been brought by San Francisco-based trial lawyers. Their interests do not align with Maryland’s. For them, the lawsuits are part of a broader campaign, regardless of whether they succeed. For Maryland, however, the risk is wasted time, taxpayer dollars and missed opportunities to implement real solutions.

Climate change is a challenge of governance and policy, not ambulance-chasing tort law. Disputes of such interstate and international nature belong with Congress and federal agencies, not local courts. Allowing state-level claims to proceed risks turning judges into policymakers, imposing regulations through litigation rather than democratic debate.

Maryland’s own circuit judges recognized this, finding that the Constitution’s federal structure does not allow state law to be applied to claims tied to global emissions. Upholding those rulings would not be a denial of climate action. It would be an affirmation that the courts must respect their proper role.

If Maryland truly wants to lead on climate solutions, it should build on the work already underway: Investing in coastal resilience, supporting technological innovation and fostering partnerships with federal agencies and the private sector. These initiatives can deliver real benefits for Maryland families, workers and communities. By contrast, pursuing lawsuits that have already failed in New York, Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina — and Maryland — itself is a distraction. It will not bring the progress Marylanders need.

The Maryland Supreme Court has an opportunity to bring clarity and finality. By affirming the dismissals, it can ensure that the state’s energy and resources are directed toward viable solutions, not prolonged legal battles. Doing what’s best for Maryland means moving beyond litigation and focusing on policies that actually work.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1182600677-2048x1436.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 11:01:21.554159

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy's road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

""North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy's low energy rates continue to support this region's economic success,"" said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy's North Carolina president. ""By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.""

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan's future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company's recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan's projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

""We've also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,"" Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What's next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

Here's how a shutdown affects that effort","SETH BORENSTEIN  science, ABC News",,,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/epas-job-protect-americas-air-water-land-shutdown-126104888,"WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency was already reeling from massive stuff cuts and dramatic shifts in priority and policy.
“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules.
He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed.","WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency was already reeling from massive stuff cuts and dramatic shifts in priority and policy. A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33% before the opening bell Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

Plan meets significant growth while saving customers money – future bill impacts are below inflation

CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy today filed its biennial long-range energy modernization plan for its dual-state system with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan is Duke Energy’s road map to serve customer growth needs while protecting reliability and keeping costs as low as possible. Customer bill impacts for the proposed plan are projected to average 2.1% annually over the coming decade – lower than the rate of inflation and significantly less than projected costs for the previously approved plan.

Our view:

“North Carolina is the top state for business, and our focus is on ensuring Duke Energy’s low energy rates continue to support this region’s economic success,” said Kendal Bowman, Duke Energy’s North Carolina president. “By expanding our diverse generation portfolio and maximizing our existing power plants to meet growth needs, we will ensure reliable energy while saving all our customers money.”

The big picture:

The plan reflects rising electricity demand across the Carolinas at an unprecedented pace, driven by the economic success of North Carolina and South Carolina. So far in 2025, companies have announced new projects delivering more than 25,000 jobs and $19 billion in investments in North Carolina, most of which are for new manufacturing facilities.

Across the Carolinas, customer energy needs over the next 15 years are expected to grow at eight times the growth rate of the prior 15 years. To put this in perspective, that projected increase in energy use is more than double the growth forecasted when the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan was initially filed.

The 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan also adapts to significant policy changes at state and federal levels. Recent energy legislation in both states emphasizes reliability, while changes in federal regulations and tax credits support advanced nuclear and battery storage and provide flexibility for existing coal and new natural gas generation.

To minimize the plan’s future costs for customers while maintaining reliability and powering growth, the company’s recommended energy mix has evolved accordingly. Compared to the prior plan, changes in proposed resource actions include:

Nuclear: added large light-water reactor (LLWR) technology for evaluation in addition to small modular reactors (SMRs), targeting potential 2037 in service for new nuclear generation at either Belews Creek, N.C. (SMR) or the W.S. Lee site in Cherokee County, S.C. (LLWR), expanding license activities to include both LLWR and SMR sites to preserve optionality.

Natural gas: maintained the five combined-cycle (CC) units called for in 2023 modeling for baseload generation and increased the number of combustion turbines (CT) for peak needs by two to a total of seven, helping meet continued load growth; added enhanced liquified natural gas storage to reduce fuel cost volatility and boost reliability.

Locations: CCs – Person County, N.C. (2), Anderson County, S.C. (1), third site to be determined (2); CTs – Catawba County, N.C. (2), Rowan County, N.C. (2), Richmond County, N.C. (1), fourth site to be determined (2).

Solar: targeted 4,000 megawatts (MW) by 2034, maintaining the 2025 procurement target to maximize customer benefits of the remaining federal energy tax credits for solar.

Locations: to be determined through annual competitive bidding process.

Battery storage: expanded to 5,600 MW targeted by 2034 – an increase of 2,900 MW over the 2023 plan’s projection through 2031 – to meet near-term growth and leverage tax credits that provide savings for customers.

Locations: across the Carolinas, including the Allen, Riverbend and Mayo coal plant sites.

Wind: not an economically viable resource for customers through 2040 but will be reassessed at next plan update.

Pumped storage hydro: limited near-term development of a second power block at Bad Creek to preserve optionality and take advantage of tax credits; deferred in-service target from 2034 to 2040 to reduce grid upgrade costs and accelerate in-service dates for crucial near-term projects including solar already in development, natural gas, hydro and batteries.

Coal: following federal actions that eased restrictions on coal generation, targeted potential two- to four-year extensions of units that have dual-fuel capability (Belews Creek, Cliffside, Marshall). Maintaining an orderly exit from coal as approved by state regulators, while extending the operational life of these fuel-flexible assets for a short time, will help meet load growth.

Yes and:

“We’ve also made further progress in maximizing the value of existing resources, making them more efficient and able to deliver more electricity to meet near-term growth needs while minimizing costs to customers,” Bowman said.

For example, the company is:

Adding nearly 300 MW of clean capacity to the grid – the equivalent of a new SMR – through power uprate projects at four nuclear stations.

Already upgraded the capacity of Bad Creek pumped storage by another 280 MW and is recommending upgrades to seven other emissions-free hydro plants.

Upgrading its natural gas fleet in a manner that reduces fuel costs and emissions.

As is the case with this two-year update, all resource amounts and target dates will be updated in future filings, allowing Duke Energy to continue adapting to technological advances, federal and state incentives and policy changes, and other factors beneficial to customers.

Flashback:

The plan builds upon the 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan approved by North Carolina and South Carolina regulators in 2024. Since that time, Duke Energy filed plans with regulators to combine its two electric utilities operating in each state, Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and Duke Energy Progress (DEP). If approved, the combination is projected to save customers more than $1 billion in future costs – in large part by needing to build fewer resources to meet growth needs than would be required if DEC and DEP continue as separate utilities.

What’s next:

The North Carolina Utilities Commission will hold hearings on the resource plan in 2026 – dates are still to be determined – and issue an order by Dec. 31, 2026. Later this year, Duke Energy will also file a resource plan update with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, incorporating information from the 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan.

Shares of Lithium Americas spiked more than 33% before the opening bell Wednesday.","The U.S. government is taking a minority stake in Lithium Americas, a company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada.

The Department of Energy will take a 5% equity stake in the miner, which is based in Vancouver. It will also take a 5% stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mining project, a joint venture with General Motors.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial in reducing U.S. reliance on China for lithium, a critical material used to produce the high tech batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and renewable energy. Both Republicans and Democrats support the project and narrowing the production gap. China is the world’s largest lithium processor.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the deal with Lithium Americas “helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars.”

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

The equity stake in Lithium Americas is the latest example of the direct intervention by the Trump administration with private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas said Wednesday that it reached a non-binding agreement in principle with the DOE to advance the first draw of $435 million on the federal loan. The DOE has agreed to defer $182 million of debt service over the first five years of the loan.

The White House and Canada’s Lithium Americas seemed to be moving forward with the deal late last month, as both parties agreed on changes to an approximately $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. GM has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush, called Thacker Pass is a “massive opportunity” for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on China and other foreign adversaries for lithium.

“Despite having some of the largest deposits, the U.S. produced less than 1% of the global lithium supply but this deal helps reduce dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals strengthening domestic supply chains and ensuring better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars with lithium production set to grow exponentially over the coming years,” he wrote.

(F) CEO Jim Farley reportedly stated on Wednesday that buyers in the U.S. prefer a $30,000 electric vehicle over utility vehicles, which cost $75,000 but offer a larger battery.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Farley added that Ford does not want to live under the shadow of Tesla Inc. (TSLA), after having played the “No. 2” role to the latter for three years.

“We've learned ... people are not willing to pay [a] $30,000 premium for that big battery on a [$50,000], $60,000 utility. But they're willing to buy a $30,000 EV if they save $2,000 a year compared to gas costs,” said Farley in the interview.

Ford’s shares were down 0.05% in Wednesday’s premarket trade. Retail sentiment on Stocktwits around the company trended in the ‘bullish’ territory.

Farley added that while Ford is trying to learn its lessons from trailing behind Tesla to better augment its portfolio for what customers are demanding, the company is now benchmarking itself against Chinese giant BYD Co. (BYDDY). “[BYD has] full support from the Chinese government ... they've been at this for 20 years. Ford has to innovate, to catch up with BYD because we're a global company. We're going to compete with them around the world,” he added in the interview.

Ford’s CEO reiterated that the company’s aim is to roll out affordable EVs, pointing to the “Universal EV Platform” announced in August. Ford had announced plans to launch a midsize four-door electric pickup with a targeted starting price of about $30,000, scheduled to reach customers by 2027.

Ford stated that its “Universal EV Platform” reduces parts by 20% compared to a typical vehicle, the assembly line is 15% faster, and the cost of ownership for buyers over five years is less than a three-year-old used Tesla Model Y.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America’s health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump’s second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump’s boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it’s natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA’s furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet’s air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,” Ruckelshaus said. “Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA’s job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. “Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump’s new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,” followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America’s health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency’s shutdown plan

The EPA’s shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren’t funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won’t say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it’s 25% — but the Trump administration’s budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan’s presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency’s shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,” he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,” said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children’s health protection division.

DETROIT — ""A lot of surprises."" That's how Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley described his past five years leading the Detroit automaker, which he believes now has a solid foundation.

For Farley, who marks his fifth anniversary as CEO on Wednesday, there have been industry-wide problems to deal with, as well as Ford-specific issues that the company is still in the process of navigating.

The 63-year-old CEO has been working to make Ford more capital efficient, improve quality to reduce recall and warranty costs, and grow profit margins. That's on top of industry-wide concerns about changing regulations, including tariffs, and shifting dynamics in electric and autonomous vehicle strategies.

""I think there were certainly a lot of surprises,"" Farley told CNBC on the sidelines of a Ford event Wednesday in Detroit. ""I would say what I'm most proud of is the team I built, together with [Ford Chair Bill Ford], as well as the foundation.""

Farley said it's still going to ""take more work,"" but the company has a good base after years of restructuring to perform better than it has under his tenure thus far. He's optimistic about Ford continuing to improve the company's overall performance and grow shareholder value.

""We need to get more capital efficient. We need to have higher margins than 4% or 5%, and we we need to be more resilient to economic cycle,"" Farley said, adding some recent changes in regulations from the Trump administration may be more beneficial than Wall Street expects for Ford.

Investor 'surprise'

Despite the company's ongoing challenges, Ford stock has been a surprising return for investors that have stuck with the automaker, which remains a ""hold"" based on average ratings of Wall Street analysts compiled by FactSet.

While Ford's stock price hasn't increased as much as General Motors , Tesla or the overall S&P 500 index over the past five years, its total shareholder return — including a historically strong dividend — has made it a better investment than many of its peers.

Stock Chart IconStock chart icon

Ford's total shareholder return over the past five years is roughly 134%, according to FactSet. That tops its largest global competitors other than Tesla – at 211% – over that time period.

GM, Ford's closest rival, has a total return of about 113% over that time period — in line with the S&P 500, according to Factset. U.S.-listed shares of Toyota Motor , meanwhile, had a cumulative total return of 61%, while Honda Motor shares had a total return of 51%.

On a per share basis, Ford stock closed Tuesday at $11.96 per share, up roughly 80% since Farley became CEO on Oct. 1, 2020. That compares with Tesla, up 211% to nearly $445; GM increasing 106% to roughly $61; and the overall S&P 500 index with a 99% increase since then.

Farley has managed to woo Wall Street more than his two most recent predecessors — both of whom departed the company after double-digit losses in Ford's stock price.

Farley became the head of Ford amid more than decade lows in the company's stock price following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. He took over from CEO Jim Hackett, who was recruited by Chair Bill Ford to replace longtime executive Mark Fields.

Ford's stock under Hackett, ex-CEO of furniture maker Steelcase, declined roughly 40% during his tenure from May 2017 through September 2020. It was slightly better under Fields' roughly three-year tenure, when the stock declined around 35%.

The stock's best performance in the past 25 years occurred under CEO Alan Mulally, from September 2006 through July 2014, when shares jumped roughly 178%.

Ford's stock saw its lowest point under Farley when he took over the company in 2020. Its high during the past five years was $25.87 per share in January 2022, which occurred during the automaker's push into electric vehicles such as the F-150 Lightning and notable upgrades.

At that time, Ford's market value topped $100 billion for the first time ever. It's now less than half that around $48 billion, with the stock off 54% from that high. That compares to GM's market cap of about $58 billion.

Road ahead

To achieve further upside, the company will need to address several factors, including quality and recall issues as well as costs — areas Farley has tried to combat for years.

Ford has spent billions of dollars on warranty and recall problems in recent years, setting industry-wide records for the number of recalls in 2025.

""To justify further upside for Ford it would require a multiple re-rating, which we believe may be a challenge,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in a Sept. 12 investor note, citing overhangs of structural costs, quality and recalls. ""The ongoing cycle of recalls remains a challenge, and it's unclear when this cycle might end.""

While there have been improvements, the company remains at a disadvantage to its peers when it comes to costs.

In 2023, Ford said it faced an overall cost disadvantage of between $7 billion and $8 billion, including $3 billion to $4 billion in material costs and $3 billion in structural costs, in addition to ongoing recall costs that the company considers ""special items.""

Since then, Ford has been working to trim that figure and improve its product and quality, including closing roughly $1.5 billion in its material cost gap last year. The company, executives said in July, is on track for another $1 billion reduction in costs this year, excluding tariff impacts — increasing that figure to $2.5 billion.

""GM's still better than us on cost, but we made a lot of progress this year,"" Farley said Tuesday. ""First time, without restructuring, we got a billion year-over-year cost down, which is a big deal.""

Rebecca Cook | Reuters

Amid Ford's pullback in costs, the company under Farley has altered its plans for all-electric vehicles, including taking a nearly $2 billion hit last year for delaying and canceling EVs.

Farley on Tuesday said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% in September — which is expected to be a record — to 5% this month after a federal incentive program for electric vehicles ended.

Along with its self-inflicted cost issues, Ford has been managing tariffs, electrification and a volatile regulatory landscape. There have been a slew of federal changes but some, such as the elimination of national emissions penalties, are assisting the automaker in offsetting expected tariff impacts of $3 billion this year.

""We've got to work through a couple of these policy issues that could be a big tailwind for the company,"" Farley said Tuesday, adding its commercial Pro business remains another highlight. ""I don't think the market has understood the benefit of the EPA rule change. It's going to be big for our industry, for companies like Ford.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205855-1759251237159-gettyimages-2237912740-FORD_PRO.jpeg?v=1759251260&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-10-01 08:00:39.645767

Summary

Regulated utilities are some of our favorite picks for rising dividend income.

American Electric Power benefits from economic development and favorable legislation, has a BBB S&P credit rating, and can keep growing its payout.

NextEra Energy's service territory enjoys favorable demographics, the utility has an A-rated balance sheet, and can build on its track record as a Dividend Aristocrat.

H2O America can cash in on massive investment needs for U.S. water infrastructure, possesses an A- S&P credit rating, and has the fundamentals to extend its lengthy dividend growth streak.

Recurring dividend income. In the personal finance realm, this is almost as good as it gets (more on that in a moment).

That's because this is commonly used to reach financial independence (passive income > expenses).

Gov. Josh Stein has tasked a group of experts and working professionals with finding solutions that don’t break the bank.

State regulators, elected officials, researchers, private business leaders and nonprofits held the first meeting of the North Carolina Energy Task Force on Tuesday. They discussed how the state will meet rising energy demand while preserving reliability and low rates.

“There are new users in the state that are consuming energy at previously, frankly, unimaginable rates, whether it’s the large-scale manufacturing [...], or it’s the data centers,” Stein said.

Data centers, in particular, drew attention from several experts who presented during the day’s proceedings. Todd Olinsky-Paul, of the Clean Energy State Alliance, emphasized that these projects are difficult to pin down since companies may place bids in multiple states.

Speakers proposed possible solutions to rising demand, such as large load tariffs and shifting energy demand away from peak hours. A recent study from Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment found that utilities can already handle the demand growth from data centers for most of the year without adding new energy generation.

“If you’re thinking about peak shifting, energy storage is going to be a key technology,” Olinsky-Paul said.

Several members emphasized the value of improving grid efficiency. Sen. Julie Mayfield from Buncombe County said this energy challenge might provide an economic development opportunity in a state with a growing clean energy economy.

“Clean energy, renewable technologies [are going to] be the fastest way to meet the short-term load growth that we’re seeing,” Mayfield said.

Matt Abele, CEO of the N.C. Sustainable Energy Association, emphasized the importance of keeping rates low when considering new energy infrastructure. He said the group should be “thinking about how we can maintain affordability for the individuals who can least afford to manage large rate increases over the next three or four years.”

EV sales in the U.S. could drop from 10–12% to 5% market share after the $7,500 federal tax credit expires.

Q3 EV sales are forecast to hit a record 410,000 units, with many buyers purchasing ahead of the incentive cutoff.

Ford and other automakers face new stress on battery plant and EV capacity planning due to abrupt policy changes.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said he expects demand for electric vehicles in the United States to be slashed in half next month as federal tax incentives expire.

Speaking Tuesday at the company’s Ford Pro Accelerate event in Detroit, Farley said EV sales could fall from a record 10% to 12% market share this month to about 5% in October, following the end of the $7,500 federal credit under the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation removed the old EV purchase incentives but added some perks for U.S.-assembled vehicles regardless of powertrain.

While Cox Automotive has forecast third-quarter EV sales to reach 410,000 units, a 21% increase from last year and the highest quarterly total ever recorded in the U.S., analysts expect several buyers to move up their purchases before the incentives expire.

Farley noted the abrupt policy change will require automakers to adjust battery plant investments and production capacity. He emphasized that while the EV industry will remain active, the market is expected to be smaller than previously anticipated in the near term.

The Ford chief added that hybrids are proving to be an easier entry point for consumers, while expensive all-electric models, such as the F-150 Lightning, which can cost up to $90,000, and the Mustang Mach-E, remain a tougher sell. Customers view EVs as fast and efficient, but they are often seen as too costly, particularly at higher price points.

Additionally, Farley pointed to tariffs as a $2 billion headwind limiting Ford’s future investment flexibility. Despite the challenges, he maintained that the EV industry will remain “vibrant” but smaller than previously expected in the near term.

The German luxury automaker has partnered with Norwegian producer Norsk Hydro to supply the material for its new electric CLA model, which the companies say is manufactured with 40 percent less CO2 emissions than its non-electric predecessor.

""There are, of course, extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium,"" said Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of procurement and supplier quality at Mercedes. ""But sustainability and desirable products, such as the ones we produce, simply go hand in hand.""

(Reuters) -Tesla is set to report its strongest quarter of the year on Thursday thanks to a U.S. rush to secure a $7,500 EV tax credit that expired earlier this week, but analysts expect the boost to be short-lived and European weakness to persist.

The quarterly tally will help gauge how far U.S. subsidies lifted sales, as China leans on Tesla’s expanded six-seater Model Y L launched in September while Europe slumped after the electric-vehicle maker’s aging lineup struggled to compete and CEO Elon Musk’s politics dampened buyer sentiment.

That has set the stage for weaker third-quarter global deliveries than last year and a potential drop in the December quarter.

The expiry of U.S. tax credits likely accelerated purchases that normally would have been made later in the year, rather than attracting new buyers to the brand, analysts said.

Musk had also cautioned in July that Tesla faces “a few rough quarters”, as EV subsidies disappear, before revenue from self-driving software and services accelerate late next year.

The billionaire, who has negotiated a trillion-dollar pay contract that shareholders will vote on in November, has said the future of Tesla is based on self-driving cars and robots, but at the moment, most of its revenue comes from vehicle sales.

Wall Street pegs Tesla’s third‑quarter deliveries at about 441,500 vehicles, with full-year 2025 at roughly 1.6 million, about 10% below last year, according to Visible Alpha estimates. Despite the September quarter set to be the strongest this year, it would still be about 6% lower than the 462,900 delivered in the same quarter last year.

EV makers across the board pulled out the stops with marketing in the United States ahead of the federal tax credit ended on Tuesday.

“The $7,500 credit definitely should have some effect that pulled forward demand this quarter,” said Ken Mahoney, CEO at Tesla shareholder Mahoney Asset Management. Mahoney said the credit’s expiry could leave a U.S. demand gap in the fourth quarter, while price cuts and promotions, especially in China, may keep margins under pressure.

Deutsche Bank analysts, however, expect China could soften the blow in the fourth quarter, especially considering the launch of the Model Y L in September. Musk has said the Y L is unlikely to make a U.S. entry until the end of next year.

The fourth quarter also hinges on whether Tesla will keep to its goal of rolling out a cheaper version of the Model Y before year-end.

Europe is likely to remain a sore point.

In August, Tesla sales in Europe and the UK fell 22.5% from a year ago, cutting its market share to 1.5%, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, as rivals leaned into plug-in hybrids and Chinese brands gained ground.

As U.S. incentives lapse, a broader pullback by other automakers on EV output could also reduce competitive pressure.

“Since Tesla has such strong margins per vehicle, they have more room to play with the pricing dynamic if they needed to,” said Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Tesla investor Zacks Investment Management.

U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Tampa, is the chair of SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project.","By Kathy Castor, U.S. representative

Families and business owners across America deserve the opportunity to grow and thrive. Yet, I keep hearing the same concern: Rising energy costs are squeezing budgets and forcing impossible choices. In Tampa just this summer, residents saw a $50 jump in their monthly electric bill due to rising temperatures and other extreme weather. They’re not alone. According to recent data, three in four Americans are concerned about utility bills rising this year, with most saying they feel powerless to do anything about it.

The facts back up the concerns. Across the country, families are watching their electricity bills rise and wondering how they can skimp on groceries and other necessities to scrape by. Small manufacturers are struggling to stay competitive as energy costs eat into their margins. Farmers watch as economic tools that would have allowed them to keep operations in their family are ripped out of their hands.

On top of all this, new federal policies are pulling us in the wrong direction. Just look at North Carolina, where the administration has ripped away federal funds from organizations that would have lowered household bills through low-cost solar. Earlier this month, uncertainty and misguided federal policies on clean energy led to the abrupt termination of a $1.4 billion investment to manufacture next-generation batteries in a rural community — stripping away more than 1,000 good-paying jobs. Along the East Coast, interference and cancellations of clean energy projects have cost jobs and hurt efforts to keep electricity affordable.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can build a thriving and sustainable economy that empowers working people — not high-dollar political donors. And to do so, we need only look to states and communities that are already building these solutions. While we need to think big, we also have the tools we need to build a better future right in front of us.

That’s why I’m proud that we are coming together to launch SEEC Institute’s Thriving Economy Project, a comprehensive initiative to develop real solutions for the economic challenges facing American families and businesses due to rising energy costs, increasing global economic competition and growing climate disasters. I am proud of this project because it is focused on listening to the people who are already finding ways to thrive, whether with clean energy solutions, creative farming practices or building more resilient neighborhoods. It’s our goal to help them scale their successes.

Right here in the Sunshine State, I see proof that clean energy is key to our next economic boom. Clean investments made possible by expiring federal tax credits have attracted more than $12 billion in investment, leading to more than 12,000 new jobs. Despite headwinds, over 90% of capacity added to our nation’s grid in the past year has been clean energy that can help families save money, create jobs and meet growing demand. This is proof that when we invest in clean, reliable energy infrastructure, we create economic opportunity.

The Thriving Economy Project will focus on four key areas where we can make real progress: helping communities and rural economies flourish, securing America’s affordable energy future, developing innovative financing solutions and building government systems that actually deliver results for the American people. This isn’t about imposing solutions from the top down. It’s about finding what’s already working in communities across America — and finding ways to scale it.

As someone who has spent her career working to solve problems — from my early days as an environmental lawyer in Florida, to my work as chair of the U.S. House Committee on the Climate Crisis — I know that the best policies come from the ground up, not the top down. That’s why this project will spend the next year listening to communities nationwide to see what’s working and what’s not.

We’ll bring together farmers and manufacturers, small business owners and labor leaders, mayors and governors, CEOs and policy experts, researchers and community activists. We’ll look at successful models from red states and blue states, rural areas and urban centers, because good ideas don’t have a party label. The goal is to develop a practical roadmap that Congress, states and local communities can use to create more jobs, lower energy costs, foster American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and build stronger, more resilient local economies.

This project is about building an economy where a small business owner in Tampa doesn’t have to choose between paying her electric bill and giving her employees a raise, where a manufacturing worker in Michigan can be confident that his job will still exist in 10 years, where a farmer in Iowa can invest in new technology knowing it will pay off for his operations and his community.

American communities already are writing the playbook for 21st-century prosperity. With the Thriving Economy Project, our job is to make sure everyone has access to those tools and opportunities. The communities leading this charge have shown us what’s possible. Now it’s time to make it inevitable.

“Here in the North West, we are leaders in the UK’s clean energy transition.","The North West Clean Power Report sets out how the transition to clean energy will create a transformative opportunity for the region’s seven million residents. It predicts a rapid expansion in the clean energy workforce, with 35,000 new roles by 2028, and also forecasts billions of pounds of investment flowing into the region in the next few years as a result of national energy policy.

This investment is expected to position the North West as a global leader in clean energy innovation and industrial decarbonisation, attracting new businesses and developments to supercharge the region’s economic growth.

The report anticipates Great British Energy’s forthcoming Local Power Plan and an expanded role for local government and communities to own and operate local power schemes, unlocking new opportunities for community wealth building and energy resilience. It recommends that local government can enable 1 GW of locally-owned renewables by 2030 – enough energy to power around 750,000 homes.

The report goes on to say that, by working together to realise this opportunity, the North West can deliver economic security, increased business growth, and enhanced health outcomes for everyone in the region.

The Liverpool City Region is already demonstrating national leadership in clean energy and retrofit delivery. Key highlights identified in the Clean Power report include:

The Mersey Tidal Power Scheme – the UK’s most advanced tidal range project, now in the formal planning process, promising jobs, growth, clean energy and flood protection for 120 years, .

Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is leading a subregional consortium to deliver a public building investment programme, combining £35.8 million of national grant funding for heat decarbonisation, matched with local funds and loans, alongside a multi-million-pound rooftop solar programme

Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has earmarked £119 million to invest in new electric buses, depots and infrastructure upgrades as it rolls out bus franchising

Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said:

“For generations, our region has helped power the UK – and today we’re leading the charge again, this time in the race to net zero. The North West Clean Power Report shows just how big the opportunity is for our people: tens of thousands of well-paid jobs, billions in investment, and cheaper, cleaner energy for our communities.

“We’re already proving what’s possible with ambitious projects like Mersey Tidal Power, but this is only the start. By working together as one North West, we can put our region at the heart of the UK’s clean energy future – creating a fairer, greener, and more prosperous place to live and work for generations to come.”

Juergen Maier, Chair of Great British Energy said:

“The move to renewable power in the UK represents the biggest economic opportunity in a generation. This report highlights the significance of what is underway right now. Regions like the North West are seizing this opportunity and demonstrating the very real benefits. Great British Energy fully supports this report in helping multiple regions to create new jobs, stimulate British innovation and manufacturing, and above all deliver secure, cheap, renewable energy for millions of homes and businesses.”

The North West Clean Power Report identifies a major opportunity for industry and private sector partners to lead the UK’s clean energy transition. With billions in potential investment across clean power, heat networks, hydrogen, CCUS, and grid infrastructure, the region is poised to become a hub for green innovation and industrial decarbonisation. Businesses can benefit from lower energy costs, access to clean power, and proximity to emerging supply chains. The report also highlights the role of private capital in scaling up local energy projects, with opportunities for strategic investment in retrofit, renewables, and advanced manufacturing.

Key North Westl project pipelines include:

£2.6 billion investment in onshore clean power projects

£3.6 billion investment in the power distribution networks

£12 billion offshore wind in the Irish Sea

£2.5 billion investment in nuclear R&D

The North West Net Zero Hub, which produced the report, is hosted by the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.

Jane Gaston, Net Zero North West CEO said:

‘We are delighted to see the launch of the North West Clean Power Report.

LONDON (Reuters) -Investors representing more than 4.5 trillion euros ($5.3 trillion) of assets have urged the EU not to water-down its methane emissions law amid concerns the rules may be weakened to ease U.S. LNG imports, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Money managers including Ninety One, Pictet Group, Railpen and Royal London Asset Management urged the EU to stay the course on rules requiring importers of oil and gas to monitor and report the methane emissions of their suppliers.

Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and scientists say it is responsible for about one-third of the warming experienced to date since pre-industrial times.

Investors are concerned the European Union’s methane rules will be brought into the scope of the bloc’s simplification agenda after U.S. energy secretary Chris Wright said recently the current legislation would prevent the United States from exporting liquefied natural gas to Europe.

“The goals are admirable, and we all want to reduce methane emissions, and we will reduce methane emissions. But having laws that will prevent American gas coming here would be completely unproductive from a social cost and environmental perspective. So yes, those laws absolutely need to be fixed,” Wright said in September.

The first phase of the EU methane law is in force and does not appear to have affected U.S. gas exports to Europe – with importers of gas into Europe having to report details of their suppliers’ efforts to reduce methane emissions from May 2025.

A European Commission spokesperson said it was confident EU methane regulation would not pose any barriers to trade.

The EU has pledged to hike its purchases of U.S. energy – including LNG, as well as oil and nuclear fuel – to $250 billion per year, as part of a trade deal struck earlier this year.

The investor group warned that reopening the regulation would introduce unpredictability and undermine companies and investors working towards complying with the rules, as well as slow down efforts to reduce the volume of highly damaging methane gas released into the atmosphere.

“Watering down regulation that companies have already based investment decisions on is counterproductive and risks undermining globally agreed methane reduction efforts,” said Eric Pederson, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management.

Europe has massively increased its imports of U.S. LNG, as it seeks to replace Russian energy after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The U.S. supplied 57% of the EU’s LNG, or 49.2 billion cubic metres, in January-August this year, Commission data show. The U.S. supplied 28% of the EU’s LNG – or 18.9 bcm – in 2021, the year before Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine.

Industries say they are more concerned by a tougher phase of the EU methane law, which will apply from 2027.

But it was only one piece of Biden’s broader push to grow America’s EV industry.
It was an across-the-board strategy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and give America’s EV industry a chance to compete internationally.
Electric vehicles “have become a political football and that’s a shame,” he said in 2023.
Hybrid sales have grown even faster than fully electric vehicles, making up 13 percent of new-vehicle sales as of mid-year.","The next big test for the EV industry begins this week.

Starting Wednesday, U.S. consumers can no longer use a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government to help buy an electric vehicle. The Biden-era incentive is now gone — swept away in the Trump administration’s purge of climate and clean energy programs.

While it lasted, the tax credit juiced domestic EV sales. Before the incentive took effect at the end of 2022, EVs accounted for 6 percent of new U.S. car sales. Now the figure is closer to 10 percent, aided in part by a last-minute rush of buyers trying to take advantage of the funding before it disappeared.

Analysts expect EV sales to decline dramatically in October now that the tax credit and other pro-EV policies are gone. How far sales drop — both this month and in the years ahead — will speak volumes about whether former President Joe Biden did enough to prime the U.S. electric vehicle industry to stand on its own.

“We are going to get, in this Trump administration, a test of whether this technology — EVs and the infrastructure to go with it — really has a momentum of its own,” said Barry Rabe, a professor of environmental policy at the University of Michigan.

The tax credit had been around in one form or another for more than a decade when Biden took office. Congress extended it to $7,500 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, and also restricted it to U.S.-made vehicles assembled from U.S.-made batteries.

But it was only one piece of Biden’s broader push to grow America’s EV industry.

The Inflation Reduction Act also created tax credits for leasing EVs and buying used models. Those tax credits essentially became a discount on each vehicle’s sticker price, since the customers and dealers could apply them at the point of sale.

Other tax credits, loans and direct financial support funneled billions of dollars to help carmakers build mines and factories for the new industry.

Separately, Biden set a goal of building 500,000 EV chargers nationwide. To aid that effort, Congress established a $5 billion federal program to create a national network of high-speed EV chargers.

EPA and the Transportation Department also passed strict regulations on tailpipe pollution during the Biden years that were intended to push carmakers to build EVs. And the administration supported even stricter rules in California and other states that would have phased out most gas-powered cars by the mid-2030s.

It was an across-the-board strategy designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and give America’s EV industry a chance to compete internationally.

Yet despite the efforts, many analysts say the country never got to see the law’s full impact.

Many aspects of the law took months or longer to put into place, and the overarching goal of Biden’s EV efforts — to get more U.S. drivers into electric cars — requires more than one presidential term to execute, as carmakers need years to design new cars, build new factories and convince consumers to buy EVs, observers said.

“You saw a lot of manufacturers announce that they were building EV facilities and battery manufacturing sites in the US., and those only really started to get finalized over the last year,” said Corey Cantor, research director at the Zero Emissions Transportation Association.

Consumers concerned with price, ‘range anxiety’

After Biden signed the IRA in 2022, it took the Treasury Department eight months to publish its first list of vehicles that qualified for the program. And the law’s rules on Chinese-made batteries and materials were so complicated that the list continued to change every few months.

The law also prompted furious pushback from Republicans, backed by the oil industry and then-candidate Donald Trump. A year after the IRA took effect, Ford CEO Jim Farley lamented the “politicization” of EVs.

Electric vehicles “have become a political football and that’s a shame,” he said in 2023.

The opposition took a toll — both politically and with car buyers.

Working with a Republican-led Congress this year, President Donald Trump was able to disassemble most of what he called the “EV mandate” in a matter of months.

And among consumers, the number of drivers considering an electric car or truck dropped to 16 percent this year, down from 25 percent in 2022, according to AAA. Drivers remained concerned about the high up-front cost of the new vehicles as well as the lack of available chargers, the poll showed.

Biden spoke to the “range anxiety” of prospective EV drivers by vowing during the 2020 presidential campaign to build a half-million new charging stations by the end of 2030. He reiterated that goal while in office.

But his administration only got partway to that mark. As of this week, about 228,000 charging ports have been installed at 76,000 locations in the United States — most of them by the private sector, according to the Department of Energy.

Meanwhile, the $5 billion federal program to help with the problem has done little. Though it continues to operate under the Trump administration, it’s helped states open only about 90 charging sites with 402 individual ports.

At the same time, carmakers have yet to solve one of the industry’s biggest challenges — the yawning gap between the sticker price of EVs and conventional cars.

In July, the average cost of an EV was $57,245 while the average cost of an internal-combustion vehicles was $48,179, according to Cox Automotive. The gap is smaller than it was in 2021, but that’s still a significant $9,000 difference.

Some of the price difference is unavoidable, given the cost of batteries. But auto companies also focused on building luxury-model EVs to boost their bottom lines, analysts said.

EV advocates have argued that the cars are cheaper over the long run because of their lower fuel and maintenance cost.

But “the sticker price is still higher,” Cantor said. “So unless you can explain that nuance up front, people may not necessarily … understand why it might make more economic sense in the long run to get an EV.”

One bright spot for the EV market has been an increase in the choices available.

There’s now a wide variety of EV and hybrid models for U.S. consumers to choose from — a trend driven by a mix of market forces, Biden administration policies and the rightward shift of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, which has turned off many prospective Tesla buyers.

At the end of 2022, Tesla sold 58 percent of the EVs in the United States; that number fell to 46 percent in the middle of 2025.

Hybrid sales have grown even faster than fully electric vehicles, making up 13 percent of new-vehicle sales as of mid-year.

While they still burn gasoline, hybrids are far more fuel-efficient than conventional cars and trucks. Experts have said they could help reduce pollution in the interim as the industry continues to electrify.

There are now more than 100 electric and plug-in hybrid models on the market, and many of them sell for $29,000 to $35,000, putting them closer to matching the price of gas-powered cars.

The cost of batteries is dropping too, as carmakers started building them in bulk and researchers are finding new ways to pack more energy into smaller, lighter batteries.

Those trends will help drive electric vehicle sales even after the government support ends, said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association. And despite all the negative publicity about EVs, drivers tend to like them once they try them, and they’re attracted by the lower cost of fuel and maintenance.

“People saying words is not the same as people getting in the car and saying, ‘This works,’ ” she said.

America vs. the world

Whether the industry can maintain momentum is unclear.

Since the IRA was enacted, carmakers have invested $67.5 billion in battery plants and $14.2 billion in EV factories, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

But the end of the tax credits will put a damper on that industrial growth. The nonprofit group Energy Innovation estimates EVs will make up about 30 percent of car sales by 2030 — instead of 40 percent.

Other forecasts are even lower.

If slower growth comes to pass, as much as 100 percent of the planned expansion of assembly plants would become unnecessary, along with half of the existing plants, according to research from Princeton University. And between 29 percent and 72 percent of battery factories would be in the same predicament.

Already, some U.S. carmakers have announced plans to ramp up production of gas-powered cars and trucks, which are more profitable, and slow down their shift to electric vehicles.

Carmakers still expect the transition will happen, but they say they can’t build electric vehicles faster than consumers will buy them.

Farley, the Ford CEO, said he expects the reversal of federal EV policy will cut in half sales of electric vehicles, Bloomberg reported.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5 percent,” he said Tuesday in a speech in Detroit. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

With fewer EVs on the road, American drivers will be stuck driving gasoline-powered cars for longer, which will lead to more air pollution and could also lead to higher prices for drivers, said Shannon Baker-Branstetter at the Center for American Progress.

Gasoline prices have been relatively low, but “if gas goes up again, it’ll leave U.S. consumers in a tight spot,” Baker-Branstetter said.

The tide could turn eventually.

California and other states likely will look for other ways to cut air pollution and promote electric transportation — although they may not be able to do it until Trump leaves office, said Robbie Orvis, an analyst Energy Innovation.

And American car companies are watching closely as the rest of the world goes electric. EVs are projected to make up a fourth of car sales worldwide in 2025, according to the International Energy Agency, and Chinese makers now dominate the industry.

American automakers find themselves in a bind. They want to sell cars in China, Europe and other regions that are rapidly converting to electric vehicles, but their home market is tepid. They’ll need to figure out how to make Americans fall for EVs without a government sweetener.

“They can’t really take their foot off the pedal when it comes to building out new models,” Orvis said, “because they will increasingly be pushed out of the international market.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/f6/34/8ec9b34b4a49be5c5b26bbafd721/ap-poll-electric-vehicles-53524.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 07:00:54.775485

Kentucky ranked 28th in the country for clean energy employment with more than 40,000 jobs; it ranked 11th for “clean vehicle” jobs with more than 9,000.

The report published in September from E2 — which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization advocating for “smart policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment” — analyzed federal data from 2024 finding that clean energy jobs across the country grew by 2.8%, outpacing the growth of the U.S. economy and adding nearly 100,000 jobs.

The annual report found Kentucky’s clean energy jobs grew by 2.4% in 2024, a significantly slower pace than recent years when Kentucky was among the fastest in growth in clean energy jobs. The pace of clean energy job growth nationally was the slowest since 2020, the report said.

E2’s definition of clean energy jobs is broad, including employment connected to renewable energy generation, electricity storage and transmission upgrades, electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades.

E2 stated that policy moves by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress this year are not reflected in federal employment data from 2024, but that the moves threaten “future growth and, increasingly, the health of the U.S. economy at-large.”

The E2 report found Kentucky was among the top 10 states last year for growth in jobs connected to renewable energy generation, energy storage and modernizing the electricity grid.

Renewable energy generation jobs in Kentucky grew by 6.1% with more than 2,200 of the state’s jobs in that category coming from solar energy. Jobs related to energy storage including utility-scale batteries and modernizing the electric grid in Kentucky grew by 11.1%.

Congress accelerated the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production and electric vehicles through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July, despite warnings from the renewable energy industry that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost nationwide.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said as the OBBBA was moving through Congress the legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”

The federal $7,500 tax credit encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles ended at the end of September due to the passage of the OBBBA.

The need for urgent and meaningful action grows every day and we know the path to a cleaner, more sustainable, more affordable energy future begins with one thing – people.

The foundation of the energy transition

The knowledge and capabilities that empower people to create and sustain the clean energy transformation are at the very heart of the energy transition. But why do we, as one of the UK’s leading providers of energy and sustainable solutions for homes, businesses and entire communities, care so deeply about nurturing these green skills?

The UK’s ambitious goal to become a clean energy superpower isn’t just about reaching zero emissions – it’s about creating purposeful jobs that revitalise communities nationwide. Clean energy already supports around 450,000 jobs across Britain with hundreds of thousands more projected by 2030. And as the sector grows, so does the urgent need for a skilled and adaptable green workforce.

Pride, purpose and progress

We recently asked more than 2,000 UK school leavers aged 16 to 18 about their future aspirations1.

One in three (34%) young people told us they’re choosing to forgo the traditional university path, opting instead for apprenticeships or direct entry into the workforce. And nearly half (47%) of these respondents are considering alternative routes specifically because they want to work in a green job today, not tomorrow.

Our research reveals something profound: for many young people, pride and purpose eclipse even earning potential when it comes to choosing a career. The number one reason school leavers are drawn to green jobs is the desire to be proud of their work (44%), closely followed by wanting to help the environment (39%). A significant number (16%) would even accept a lower salary if it meant working in a role that supports the planet.

Another major driver for young people choosing apprenticeships over university is the desire to avoid student debt with almost two-thirds (64%) of our respondents citing this as a key motivator. A similar proportion (67%) believe they’ll pick up workplace skills faster through apprenticeships or jobs than through a university degree.

For us, these stats are a clear signal that the education-to-employment pipeline is evolving, and green careers are at the forefront of that change.

Investing in talent and unlocking opportunity

Investing in green skills is not just good business – it’s a matter of social responsibility. We’re incredibly proud to be recognised by The Sunday Times as the ‘Best Place to Work for Young People’ and to be one of the UK’s leading apprenticeship employers.

Through our partnerships with schools, colleges and local governments, such as our initiatives with Coventry City Council and Dudley College’s Net Zero Solutions Hub, we’re helping communities reduce their carbon footprints, learn new skills and unlock opportunities for generations to come.

In addition, our Net Zero Training Academy educates 800 people every year, and since 2018, we’ve welcomed over 1,000 apprentices across 100 training programmes, from smart meter installation to heat pump engineering.

We view green jobs in the widest possible context – we’d even go so far as to say that every job at E.ON is a green job. That’s why our commitment to green skills extends beyond technical roles, encompassing degree apprenticeships in finance, project management, quantity surveying and digital marketing. We’re building a diverse talent pipeline to ensure that everyone, from data scientists to supply chain experts, can play their part in the energy transition.

And we’re supporting other organisations in the drive for green skills too. Through levy gifting, we’ve invested close to £1.2 million over the last four years to support the creation of roles within small and medium-sized enterprises across the country, helping to remove barriers and address skills gaps.

This is just the beginning. Our ambition is to see that green skills are accessible and attainable for all, irrespective of background.

That sale reduced their total holding by 24% which is hardly insignificant, but far from the worst we've seen.

Hallador Energy Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

Notably, that recent sale by Independent Director David Hardie was not the only time they sold Hallador Energy shares this year. They previously made an even bigger sale of -US$579k worth of shares at a price of US$19.05 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$19.57. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 18% of David Hardie's holding.

Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 39.00k shares worth US$532k. On the other hand they divested 79.95k shares, for US$1.5m. David Hardie sold a total of 79.95k shares over the year at an average price of US$19.22. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.

Insider Ownership

Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Insiders own 7.0% of Hallador Energy shares, worth about US$58m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.

Kentucky ranked 28th in the country for clean energy employment with more than 40,000 jobs; it ranked 11th for “clean vehicle” jobs with more than 9,000.

The report published in September from E2 — which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization advocating for “smart policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment” — analyzed federal data from 2024 finding that clean energy jobs across the country grew by 2.8%, outpacing the growth of the U.S. economy and adding nearly 100,000 jobs.

The annual report found Kentucky’s clean energy jobs grew by 2.4% in 2024, a significantly slower pace than recent years when Kentucky was among the fastest in growth in clean energy jobs. The pace of clean energy job growth nationally was the slowest since 2020, the report said.

E2’s definition of clean energy jobs is broad, including employment connected to renewable energy generation, electricity storage and transmission upgrades, electric and hybrid vehicle manufacturing and energy efficiency upgrades.

E2 stated that policy moves by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress this year are not reflected in federal employment data from 2024, but that the moves threaten “future growth and, increasingly, the health of the U.S. economy at-large.”

The E2 report found Kentucky was among the top 10 states last year for growth in jobs connected to renewable energy generation, energy storage and modernizing the electricity grid.

Renewable energy generation jobs in Kentucky grew by 6.1% with more than 2,200 of the state’s jobs in that category coming from solar energy. Jobs related to energy storage including utility-scale batteries and modernizing the electric grid in Kentucky grew by 11.1%.

Congress accelerated the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production and electric vehicles through the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July, despite warnings from the renewable energy industry that hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost nationwide.

In a Wall Street Journal op-ed earlier this year, Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie said as the OBBBA was moving through Congress the legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”

The federal $7,500 tax credit encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles ended at the end of September due to the passage of the OBBBA.

The Aug. 7 correspondence was sent to the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, an independent financing authority for clean energy projects in the Keystone State.
The same day that Pennsylvania received the news about its funding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cuts on X.
“That means that that funding is official,” said Elowyn Corby, Mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy group.
But, even if Pennsylvania were to succeed and retain its solar funding, the state Legislature remains a stumbling block.","This story was originally published by Capital & Main.

It was a Thursday when Pennsylvania energy regulators received a pair of letters. The first let them know that $156 million in solar grant money they’d received in 2024 had been revoked; the second ordered them to stop any work related to that money.

The Aug. 7 correspondence was sent to the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, an independent financing authority for clean energy projects in the Keystone State. The agency was far from alone.

The Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority was one of 60 recipients, including state agencies, nonprofits and Native American tribes, to receive termination letters from the Environmental Protection Agency alerting them that funds they’d received under Solar for All, a Joe Biden-era initiative to help low-income households access solar energy, would be rescinded. The recipients’ accounts containing the funds won in 2024 were frozen and the money removed, environmental advocates say. Most large fossil fuel-producing states, including California, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, had their funds pulled.

The same day that Pennsylvania received the news about its funding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cuts on X. “What a grift,” he said of the $7 billion program established under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s signature legislation. .

But advocates and many Democrats say that Zeldin and the EPA are acting illegally. The Solar for All program, and the $27 billion funding bucket that underlies it, called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, was “Trump-proofed”before President Joe Biden left office, a move designed to ensure that an incoming Republican administration couldn’t legally claw back that money. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was established with the requirement that the money be “obligated” by Sept. 30, 2024 — before the end of Biden’s term — after which point it could not be revoked.

“That means that that funding is official,” said Elowyn Corby, Mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, a clean energy advocacy group. “It is real. It has gone to the states. Many of the grantees are already pulling down funds.”

Now, congressional Democrats are waging a war against the Trump administration to defend that stance, one supported by numerous environmental groups and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, which sent a letter to the EPA on Aug. 28 asserting that the federal agency “does not have the authority to unilaterally terminate the [award] agreement.”

Zeldin defended the EPA’s right to withdraw the Solar for All funds by invoking language in HR 1, President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was adopted July 4. That bill stipulates that the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will be “repealed” and “the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out” the program “rescinded.”

Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, Democrats from Virginia, urged Zeldin to walk back the move. On Aug. 14, the two senators joined Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and 29 other colleagues, in arguing that freezing or pulling back the money is illegal, and that the line in the “Big Beautiful Bill” is predicated on a falsehood.

“It is not legally possible to claw back funding that has already been obligated,” Whitehouse and his colleagues wrote.

After Solar for All funds were rescinded, Vote Solar organizers launched a letter-writing campaign to 21 state attorneys general urging them to “take swift action” against the EPA to protect the money. “EPA’s attempt to terminate Pennsylvania’s Solar for All program is misguided and unjustified,” says a letter the group, along with 30 other clean energy and conservation groups, sent to Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday.

Olivia Nedd, senior policy director of the group’s access and equity program, said their call was met with promising responses by Colorado and California, both which have substantial investments in solar and other renewable sources of energy. But, she said, she’s not heard back from Sunday, a Republican, or his office.

It’s unclear how far, for his part, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, will go to defend the Solar for All funds. But environmental advocates in the state told Capital & Main that the letter it sent to the federal government on Aug. 28 is a required first step to litigation.

“It does not reflect a commitment on the Shapiro administration’s part to pursue a legal challenge,” said Robert Routh, Pennsylvania policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “But it is a necessary step procedurally in order to allow them to be able to do that in the future.”

A spokesperson for Shapiro did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment. Shapiro sued the Trump administration in February after a Jan. 20 executive orderfroze all Inflation Reduction Act funds, including Solar for All. The funds were later unfrozen, but then thrown into limbo with Zeldin’s announcement. Whether Shapiro will again take action to wrestle back the money is an open question.

But, even if Pennsylvania were to succeed and retain its solar funding, the state Legislature remains a stumbling block. Embroiled in a bitter impasse, the state’s budget has yet to reach Shapiro’s desk nearly three months after the June 30 annual deadline. Though rescinded for now by the EPA, Pennsylvania’s award of Solar for All funds, like many public programs in the state, including Medicaid and education, are also caught in the crossfire of the budget debate.

Three months after Pennsylvania was awarded its Solar for All grant funding, a line was inserted into an omnibus fiscal code bill requiring that the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority, the agency responsible for doling out the dollars, secure approval from the state Legislature in order to spend the funds.

Pennsylvania’s Solar for All funds were earmarked for low-income residents and those who live in environmental justice communities — ones that are disproportionately exposed to pollution. The program promised to provide solar installations to 12,500 households that were guaranteed at least 20% savings on their electricity bills. It promised to thwart climate change-inducing fossil fuel emissions, create green jobs and help build out the state’s solar economy, which is a fraction of that of other fossil fuel-producing states. Pennsylvania currently ranks 49th in the nation for its growth in solar, wind and geothermal generation over the last decade, according to the nonprofit advocacy group PennEnvironment.

“This is taxpayer money that’s out there. It was competitive. It was given to pretty much all the states. We got a share, and we’re turning our back on it,” said Jen Quinn, legislative and political director at the Pennsylvania chapter of the Sierra Club. “It’s just deeply confusing.”

State Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, a progressive Democrat from Philadelphia, introduced a bill in January attempting to secure that legislative approval. But, after advancing out of committee, it was quickly halted by an amendment that critics said amounted to a poison pill, forcing Fiedler to look for other ways to free up the grant money.

“Solar and wind are the cheapest and quickest to build and can offer households savings,” Fiedler told Capital & Main in a statement. “It’s ridiculous to block these new projects at a time when Pennsylvanians are struggling more and more to keep up with rising electricity bills.”

As negotiations over the state budget creep on, it is unclear whether language that would release the state’s allocation of Solar for All funding will make it into a final deal, regardless of whether it is restored by the Trump administration. In June, the Democratic-controlled state House passed a bill that included a line doing just that, but when it reached the Republican-controlled Senate, the line was abruptly removed from the legislation.

“Negotiations are ongoing,” said Elizabeth Rementer, press secretary for House Democratic Majority Leader Matt Bradford, of Montgomery County, in a statement on the status of the Solar for All funding. “Despite the fact that Solar for All remains an important priority for House Democrats, it’s clear Senate Republicans are unwilling to release these funds to help cut utility costs for Pennsylvanians and grow the economy.”

This battle mirrors the one playing out at the federal level — both stemming from arcane language tucked into the pages of mega-bills, both viciously partisan and both with no clear end in sight. Those who are hurt the most by it, advocates say, are low-income homeowners faced with rising energy costs.

“It is hard to find a clear rationale for the politicization of these funds,” said Corby, the Vote Solar regional director. “Especially in a world where legislators on either side of the aisle are hearing from their constituents practically every day about how hard it is to keep up with rising energy costs.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-1747382682-2048x1409.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 09:00:56.451161

As President Trump has continuously threatened to deploy troops to Chicago, Durbin requested a hearing to examine the harms of military deployment to cities. While today’s hearing was politically reframed to blame “blue cities” for Republican refusals to support effective solutions to gun violence and to glamourize the Trump Administration’s illegal and unconstitutional deployment of the military to American cities, Durbin underscored that the President continues to engage in political theater rather than prioritize serious policymaking that would address violent crime.

In his opening statement, Durbin discredited the Trump Administration’s narrative that violent crime is rampant in blue cities. Durbin emphasized that, as crime rates have dropped in cities like Chicago, Republican-led cities like Shreveport, Louisiana, see a higher violent crime rate than Washington, D.C.

After delivering his opening remarks, Durbin introduced the two minority witness – Gregory Jackson, Jr., and Major General William L. Enyart. Mr. Jackson is the President of the Rocket Foundation, an organization founded in 2022 that centers on ending the gun violence epidemic. A gun violence survivor himself, Mr. Jackson previously served as Deputy Director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention under the Biden Administration.

Major General William L. Enyart is a retired member of the U.S. Air Force and Army National Guard. His nearly 36-year military career included active-duty service in the Air Force and nearly 30 years in the Army National Guard. His service culminated as Adjutant General of the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012. He previously served as a Brigadier General and Deputy Commanding General of the Illinois Army National Guard.

Key Quotes:

“This is such a political hearing, and it shouldn’t be. What’s at stake here is something that we all value. That is the safety of our families, homes and neighborhoods. I regret that you have reframed this hearing to focus on ‘blue city chaos.’”

“Violent crime is on the decline, but statistics don’t mean much to victims… Any crime is too much crime, and every American deserves to feel safe. So, we should be working together on a bipartisan basis, which we have done over and over again in this Committee, to continue reducing crime and making our communities safer for all Americans.”

“Let’s look at the reality. For the last two decades, the murder rate in my home state of Illinois has been lower than the murder rates in Missouri, Louisiana, and Alabama—all states represented by Republicans on this Committee.”

“In 2023, Illinois spent $516 per capita on policing – more than the states of Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Missouri, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Alabama.”

“In Chicago, over the first six months of the year, homicide rates are down 32 percent, [and] shootings have dropped 37 percent. We need to build on this success, not ignore it.”

“During my time as Chair, I held more than a dozen hearings on reducing violent crime. We focused on legislation, not lamentation. I reported numerous bills supporting law enforcement that were signed into law by President Biden, including the Protecting America’s First Responders Act and the Recruit and Retain Act. And we passed the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to crack down on gun violence.”

“Instead of political theater and partisan attacks, we should focus on proven efforts like the Heal Initiative, a project I launched in 2018 with ten of Chicago’s largest hospitals to address the root causes of violence in 18 Chicago’s neighborhoods with the highest rates of violence, poverty, and health disparities.”

“Unfortunately, President Trump has done everything he can to undermine efforts like this. He cut $169 million from community safety funding authorized by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He cut $72 million in funding for state and local law enforcement. The 2026 Trump Budget would slash the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program – better known as HIDTA – by more than a third, from about $300 million to $196 million.”

“While President Trump claims to be tough on crime, he granted full and unconditional pardons to nearly 1,600 January 6 rioters, including more than 600 charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.”

“Here’s the reality. President Trump isn’t interested in reducing crime. He is interested in political posturing. 100 troops into the city of Chicago. Did you hear the announcement this morning by the Secretary of Defense? One of the characteristics he insists on when it comes to building a strong military is that it be apolitical. His word – apolitical.”

“The President has deployed thousands of American troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and made disturbing threats to wage war against Chicago, Portland, and other American cities.”

“Let’s be clear: these are illegal, unconstitutional, and un-American power grabs by the President that actually endanger Americans. President Trump is looking for any excuse to send soldiers into American communities so he can play the role of strongman on TV.”

“In Illinois, his misguided mass deportation [scheme] is targeting communities, but it’s not making them safer. Remember the litany that we heard, over and over again, about immigrants to this country? [The President claimed immigrants are] rapists, murderers, terrorists, the criminally insane. Did you know that 70 percent of the immigrants detained so far by the President have no criminal convictions?”

“The Administration’s main focus seems to be photo ops for social media, like these pictures from downtown Chicago of armed masked men, which just happen to feature the Trump Tower in the background. Just yesterday, we learned the Department of Homeland Security requested the deployment of 100 military personnel to Illinois over the objections of the governor. Simply put, despite what the Secretary of Defense said at Quantico this morning, the President’s use of the military to police American streets is political theater staged for his MAGA supporters, not effective law enforcement aimed at making communities safer.”

“Meanwhile, thousands of FBI, DEA, and ATF agents, as well as thousands of service members across this country, have been diverted from critical missions to carry out the President’s immigration agenda. Not surprisingly, federal drug prosecutions this year have dropped to the lowest [level] in decades.”

“We need to support law enforcement and policies that improve—not erode—trust between them and our communities.”

“As Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will not sit idly by while this President tramples the Constitution. And I will use every tool at my disposal to reduce crime and protect our communities—in a lawful way that promotes lasting change.”

Shutdown Leaves Energy Markets on Edge Take away the data, slow the permits, raise the cost of capital, and it goes beyond simply inconveniencing traders.","The U.S. government has now officially shut down after Republicans and Democrats failed to come to an agreement on a stopgap bill to fund operations.

The impact of this shutdown will not stop at furloughed staff or shuttered museums. In energy, a shutdown lands with real force. It deprives markets of the official data that guide trading, erodes confidence in demand signals, lifts financing costs, and slows permits for the projects that underpin future supply. Oil, gas, and power don’t stop moving, but they move in murkier conditions, and that’s when small shocks hit harder.

Energy Statistics Under Pressure

The first casualty is visibility. The U.S. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) sets the weekly rhythm with its petroleum and gas reports. They’ve gone dark before during a government shutdown, but not since 2013. Today, however, the agency’s staffing is already stretched thin after recent departures. As oil trader John Kilduff told Reuters, “The EIA data contributed greatly to price discovery and it leveled the playing field. It would be very damaging to not have that data.” Without it, traders lean harder on private surveys and ship-tracking, which are less reliable and more fragmented. Prices swing wider because a common reference point is missing.

Every Wednesday, the EIA’s petroleum report delivers inventory balances for crude, gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Traders position ahead of it, algorithms react to it, and refiners hedge around it. The report is not perfect, but it is universal. With its disappearance, markets will rely more heavily on the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) private survey, or on data vendors that piece together customs and terminal flows. Those sources are narrower and often contradictory. A small refinery outage in the Midwest or a fog delay on the Gulf Coast can suddenly drive outsized moves because no national dataset arrives to balance it out.

Beyond Energy Statistics

The Bureau of Labor Statistics and BEA have both said they will suspend key reports during this shutdown. That leaves the Fed and markets without employment or inflation numbers. RBC Economics warned in a recent note that “if we have a government shutdown on October 1st, the employment report will not be published.” Without jobs and inflation reports, oil markets cannot calibrate demand growth expectations, and natural gas traders cannot benchmark industrial burn against broader economic momentum.

The economic drag is more than symbolic. Bank of America estimates that each week of shutdown could trim U.S. GDP by 0.1 percentage point. Run that through the International Energy Agency’s elasticity for OECD oil demand, and it works out to 6,000-12,000 barrels per day of lost consumption each week. On a base of 20 million barrels per day, that may sound trivial, but in markets already tight on diesel and leaning on thin gasoline inventories, the psychological effect is magnified. Traders are quick to mark down refinery margins or bid up cracks if they believe consumers are pulling back.

Natural gas markets feel the impact even faster. The EIA’s Thursday storage report is the single number traders lean on to judge whether supply is keeping pace ahead of winter. This spring, a run of 100+ Bcf injections kept volatility in check because the market could see storage was filling. Take that report away, and traders are guessing. Options get repriced, spark spreads start driving the trade, and utilities hedge more cautiously. With U.S. LNG exports running flat out, that storage figure is not only vital for domestic balance sheets but also for European buyers who depend on U.S. cargoes through the cold months.

Financing Feels the Strain

Shutdowns often push Treasury yields higher, which in turn raises borrowing costs for energy producers. For shale independents already under pressure, that can mean tighter credit just as they need it most. With the SEC and CFTC set to furlough staff, capital raises will slow, and Commitments of Traders reports will be delayed, removing another guidepost for futures positioning. Energy debt spreads could widen quickly when investors fear both weaker demand and delayed oversight.

Regulatory Slowdown

Agencies such as FERC and BOEM cannot process environmental reviews or lease sales if their staff are off the clock. That leaves LNG terminals, pipelines, and offshore projects waiting. Developers build their calendars around Washington’s, and every week of delay has a cost. For investors, it is one more reminder that U.S. energy infrastructure cannot move forward without federal signatures. The Biden administration’s efforts to accelerate permitting for clean hydrogen, CCS, and transmission lines could also stall, leaving renewables and low-carbon projects with longer timelines.

International Influence

OPEC+ relies heavily on U.S. stock data to gauge balances. A blackout in Washington forces them to lean more on proprietary flows, which makes quota debates even murkier. Asian refiners, which follow EIA reports closely to track U.S. export flows, would also be left guessing. When the world’s largest consumer of oil and gas cannot publish timely data, it leaves the global system less stable.

Brace for Oil Price Volatility

A shutdown doesn’t change how much oil is in Gulf Coast tanks or how cold Minnesota gets in January. What it changes is the market’s confidence in those numbers. When traders can’t trust the data, they build in extra risk. That usually means crude prices hold firmer at the front of the curve, gasoline and diesel move harder when local supplies tighten, and gas options get more expensive because no one knows where storage really stands.

Timing makes it worse. If jobs and inflation reports are delayed until the Fed’s late October meeting, policymakers are flying blind. They can either cut on the limited evidence in front of them or wait it out. Traders already expect rate cuts by year-end, and the lack of fresh data becomes its own kind of signal that markets have to price in.

Shutdown Leaves Energy Markets on Edge

Take away the data, slow the permits, raise the cost of capital, and it goes beyond simply inconveniencing traders. It changes the way the system functions. Kilduff, RBC, and Bank of America are looking at different pieces of the puzzle, but they all point to the same reality: Politics aside, markets are worried about this shutdown because they can’t trade what they can’t see.

A judicial consensus is forming against climate lawfare, but the U.S. Supreme Court must still end environmental extortion of American energy. In two landmark cases, the court will soon have the opportunity to reassert the federal government’s authority over questions of national energy and environmental policy.

Environmental groups believe that energy use increases global temperatures, causes sea levels to rise and creates more destructive weather. Their campaign to curtail energy has taken many forms — including asking the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to block pipelines and the Interior Department to deny oil and gas leases — but it met a roadblock with the 2024 election and the Trump administration’s subsequent blizzard of executive orders lifting overregulation.

Rather than pursue their interests in Congress or before the electorate, environmental extremists have now allied with bankrupt cities and trial lawyers to use the courts to shake down the energy industry. Blue cities and states have filed tort suits in state courts to extract money for allegedly causing weather-related costs in their jurisdictions.

TRUMP ADMIN SCORES LEGAL WIN IN $16B CLIMATE FIGHT AS FEDERAL APPEALS COURT LIFTS BLOCK ON GRANT TERMINATIONS

The Supreme Court will soon decide whether to take up one of those cases, Boulder County v. Suncor Energy, following a ruling this year from the Colorado Supreme Court that allowed the county’s case to move forward in state court. Borrowing theories of liability from tobacco and opioid litigation, Boulder alleges that energy companies sold their products without disclosing climate risks. Such claims plainly intrude on federal authority over interstate pollution.

Other climate cases are still progressing in lower state courts. In Hawaii, summary judgment motions are pending in a case seeking damages for rising sea levels. Hawaii’s highest court allowed this litigation to move forward in 2023 with Justice Todd Eddins issuing a remarkable concurrence, declaring that litigation would proceed under the ""Aloha Spirit,"" regardless of federal precedent.

In Rhode Island, the state judge presiding over a similar lawsuit against the energy industry compared it to developing nations devastated by natural disasters, citing Kenya, Tanzania and the Seychelles. The suggestion that Rhode Island has suffered comparable ""severe destruction"" is telling: judges are inflating rhetoric to justify climate claims, not grounding them in law.

Meanwhile, other states are effectively trying to replace federal authority over environmental policy. In Louisiana, plaintiffs obtained a $750 million judgment (potentially over $1 billion with interest) against Chevron for coastal erosion that they claimed was caused by oil extraction during World War II. Those companies had been under federal contracts to supply aviation fuel for the war effort. Yet eight decades later, Louisiana claims it can punish those practices retroactively.

The energy firms sought to move the case to federal court because of its genesis in work for the federal government. But a divided 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel refused to allow it. As Judge Andrew Oldham rightly noted in dissent, crude oil extraction plainly ""relates to"" war production. If states can sue private businesses for their wartime work generations later, future cooperation with the federal government will be chilled, raising the costs of national defense. This coming term, the Supreme Court will review the Fifth Circuit's decision.

Despite some disappointing rulings from activist judges, a growing number of state courts are beginning to resist such frivolous claims. A Maryland judge rejected Baltimore’s lawsuit that alleged fossil fuels caused sea rises that have harmed the city; the Maryland Supreme Court will hear the appeal later in October. A South Carolina court dismissed Charleston’s similar claims, which blue city officials will almost certainly appeal as well. Likewise, nearly identical state and municipal lawsuits have been similarly dismissed in Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and New Jersey.

Notwithstanding some recent wins, climate lawfare is like Hydra — new cases are constantly being brought. Even if higher courts ultimately overturn them, simply forcing the industry to defend against these suits imposes enormous litigation costs. That alone is a victory for environmental radicals. At this stage, the Supreme Court must act to reaffirm federal authority over national energy and environmental policy.

If climate change is producing harmful effects nationwide, then the nation should decide how to address it. As the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in a 2021 case rejecting New York City’s lawsuit against Chevron, ""the question before us is whether a nuisance suit seeking to recover damages for the harms caused by global greenhouse gas emissions may proceed under New York law. Our answer is simple: no."" However, they frame their aims, blue cities and states are trying to set nationwide climate policy through litigation — violating federal law and tort principles.

HUGHES: National Clean Energy Week highlighted a variety of energy sources and technologies ranging from hydropower to nuclear power.","Given the deep partisan divides on America’s energy future, heralding the potential of bipartisan action on clean power might seem to some like a fool’s errand.

Since the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump has launched an assault on renewable energy while taking significant steps to boost the fossil fuel industry. The president has made clear his disdain for wind and solar, describing them in one Truth Social post as “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY” while pushing a slew of regulatory actions to curtail their development.

Many congressional Republicans appeared to back that stance in the party’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly accelerating the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects that had been promised federal support under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Some Democrats, in response, have cast doubt on whether they can work in good faith with their Republican colleagues on even technology-neutral legislative priorities for the energy sector amid the administration’s “bad faith” attacks on renewables.

But to one conservative climate advocate, forging a coalition of Republicans and Democrats to support clean power isn’t just possible—it’s the industry’s best chance at averting even worse outcomes.

Heather Reams is the president and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a right-of-center organization promoting conservative solutions to reduce emissions and advance clean energy policy.

She has also served as the chair of National Clean Energy Week since its inception in 2017. The event brings together industry voices and lawmakers from across the political spectrum for rounds of speeches and panel discussions on the industry’s top priorities.

This year’s speakers ranged from one of the leaders of the conservative climate movement, U.S. Sen. John Curtis of Utah, to Democratic U.S. Rep. Scott Peters from California and executives from across the clean energy sector.

From hydropower to permitting reform, the two-day policymakers symposium in mid-September highlighted ways in which industry stakeholders and lawmakers across the political divide could cooperate to advance shared energy goals.

The event wasn’t without controversy. Climate protestors interrupted remarks from the first guest, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, targeting her for voting in favor of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—with one protester holding a sign deriding the entire gathering as “Climate Colonialism Week.”

Michael Greenberg, the leader of activist group Climate Defiance, later told Inside Climate News that the sign was “a reference to the displacement and natural disasters that high-emission/high-impact countries are causing in the Global South.”

“The main reason we were there is to confront Murkowski, and point out the hypocrisy of her being celebrated at a clean energy conference just months after she cast the tie-breaking vote for the ‘Big Evil Bill,’” Greenberg said.

The event’s sponsors also notably included fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil and BP, and many of the symposium’s speakers spotlighted natural gas as a “clean” energy source, despite significant controversy over its true impact on the climate. Although natural gas produces less carbon dioxide when burned than coal, critics say that leaks of the climate super-pollutant methane during extraction and transportation make it just as harmful for the climate as other fossil fuels.

Following this year’s gathering, Reams spoke to Inside Climate News about why she believes her “big tent” approach—both within the energy sector and on Capitol Hill—is still the best path forward for America’s clean energy future.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

AIDAN HUGHES: This has obviously been a challenging year for renewable energy development in the United States, particularly for wind and solar.

Those two technologies have seen significant cuts and efforts to claw back tax credits, permits, approvals, etc., at the federal level. How did those actions affect the planning and tone for this year’s National Clean Energy Week?

HEATHER REAMS: We were talking to our different stakeholders and partners and those that were speaking or sponsoring [National Clean Energy Week], talking to them about their priorities and how they wanted to present them, and making sure it was more in a bipartisan fashion.

And I think everyone we talked to was like, “We really want bipartisanship. We’re not after partisanship.”

And then talking to members of Congress as they were coming to make their comments, I think they were also looking at a “We need every electron,” more of an abundance type of argument—whether they were Republicans or Democrats, talking about the demand for energy.

So I think there was more of a “Let’s reset where we’ve been, post-reconciliation tax credits, and focus on what our country needs to be competitive.” …

I’ll flag, also, that the week before clean energy week, I was at [renewable energy conference] RE+ in Las Vegas. I found that same tone there. … We’re beyond tax credits now, and we’re ready to solve big problems. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that the renewable energy industry, while they have some bumps and bruises, were ready to move forward, are looking towards permitting reform that will help create more business certainty and reduce costs, and we’re prepared to be part of the conversation.

HUGHES: On that note, despite the challenges that the industry has faced this year, there was a significant amount of optimism during the policymakers symposium from both industry voices and lawmakers about the future of clean energy.

So what do you see as the path forward for clean energy to make the case to policymakers at the federal level and at the state level, that it’s a necessary investment for both the environment and the economy?

REAMS: By removing renewable energy, you’re not only reducing choices, but you’re increasing—potentially increasing—prices. So I think that’s one piece.

I think another piece is that it’s the jobs, right? The innovations that renewable energies have brought, have [also] brought good-paying jobs in all parts of the country. … These are jobs that are going to keep our country economically competitive with other nations.

And there’s a lot of talk about competition with China, and how China is producing so much more, but the innovation is on our side. … We are the innovators even though China does manufacture a lot of what we end up inventing.

So I think there’s [an] “all of the above”/abundance piece, and depending which side of the aisle you’re sitting on, it is actually the Venn diagram bringing Republicans and Democrats together to acknowledge that to move forward as a country, we need to be able to keep prices low, and we need all the energy we can get.

HUGHES: You’ve mentioned a couple of times now that emphasis on bipartisanship.

That emphasis was clear through the diverse range of lawmakers that were invited to speak at the event, from [Republican] Congressman Bruce Westerman to [Democratic] Rep. Scott Peters.

The symposium started, though, with a pushback against that. … The group Climate Defiance interrupted Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s speech, in protest against her role in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which made significant cuts to wind and solar.

So what would you say to those who would argue that lawmakers who voted for measures that have had a negative impact on the development of clean energy shouldn’t be getting a platform at National Clean Energy Week?

REAMS: I would consider this group to be a more extreme group, a left group. And then there are extreme groups on the right as well. And they have their role and purpose. We didn’t love having the protesting, but we recognize it can happen.

A couple things on the bill. Lisa Murkowski—first, she was instrumental in helping the reconciliation bill that came out of the Senate not be as bad, and she deserves a lot of credit for that. There are a handful of members in the Senate that were working to remove provisions like an excise tax on renewable energy that would have been detrimental to the industry.

A protest like that doesn’t give her that credit. It only looks at the outcome of the vote versus the process that goes on in developing these bills.

Second, the bill is huge. That bill did a lot for energy, but it also was focused a lot on nutrition, SNAP benefits, defense, immigration. It wasn’t a vote on one singular issue. It was a mega-bill with a lot of GOP priorities and the political pressure was really significant.

We, [a] number of organizations, really, were working just to make the bill better for renewable energy. And we knew that was probably the best we can get based on the political makeup of Congress, and of course the president being Republican.

And then three, there are plenty of members of Congress who have never supported renewable energy on the right—have not been a champion for renewable energy, [haven’t] talked about it, [haven’t] tried to protect it.

And if you’re really going to protest somebody, I think there are just better members to protest than Lisa Murkowski. She’s one of the most productive Republican members on “all the above,” both for renewables and fossil fuels.

So I know it’s convenient to protest an event that’s open to the public and open to the press and speak like that, but in the end, I think she was able to message and show “people can be upset with the outcomes. I’m not entirely happy with the outcome, but this is what we’re going to do moving forward.”

I think she acknowledged the frustration of others, including herself, and is ready to move on.

HUGHES: We’ve seen a significantly shifting landscape for renewable energy across recent administrations.

Just in the past few years, for example, you had this massive boost to the development of new renewable projects through the tax credits and promises made in the Inflation Reduction Act from former President Biden and a Democrat-controlled Congress, only for many of those commitments to be scaled back by the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress.

What would you say to businesses who might be worried that clean energy simply isn’t a safe or reliable investment given the pendulum swing of U.S. policy with each change in administration?

REAMS: I’d say—I wouldn’t actually put this towards clean energy. I would say that any business that wants to invest in the United States is concerned about investing in the United States now.

There’s no research on the amount of capital that’s not being deployed right now because of the uncertainty. But I can imagine it’s a pretty big number, and a frightening number because of the regulatory uncertainty that we see, and that’s a problem for the competitiveness of our country.

It’s not just clean energy. I talked to a lot of energy companies on the fossil fuel side that are concerned. I talked to a lot of multinational companies that do lots of manufacturing that are concerned. And so I think American policy makers, regardless of what letter is next to their name, should be concerned and should be taking measures to create more stability in our regulatory framework.

I think a place to start would be in permitting to create some more certainty. But certainly the volatility in the U.S. is not putting out the welcome mat for companies to come and invest and build. So it’s unfortunately not just clean energy companies that are experiencing this volatility.

HUGHES: National Clean Energy Week highlighted a variety of energy sources and technologies ranging from hydropower to nuclear power.

One of the sources that received a significant amount of attention, though, was natural gas.

There’s obviously some controversy surrounding natural gas as a clean energy source. According to the co-director of the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium, if methane emissions from natural gas are on the high end of current estimates, natural gas may be no cleaner of an energy source than coal.

National Clean Energy Week’s sponsors also included fossil fuel interests, including ExxonMobil, BP and the American Gas Association.

So how would you respond to critics who might argue that these technologies and industries shouldn’t be part of the conversation when it comes to promoting clean energy?

REAMS: I think that’s been one of the problems with talking about the transition from fossil fuels to lowering emissions, right? Whether it’s just transition and getting to a more “all the above,” a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy.

There’s a lot of talk about eventually going to solar and wind, plus peaker plants for gas as a longer-term solution, until we can come up with the next technology that’s going to help lower emissions. So that includes peaker plants with natural gas, right?

I think credit should be given where credit’s due. Displacing coal with natural gas has reduced emissions by 40 percent in the United States. So is that cleaner? Yes. Is it the cleanest? No—but it’s cleaner.

Every technology has its drawbacks, and what we’re seeing is that carbon capture and methane capture, plus natural gas, is going to help reduce emissions.

Normally, energy in our country has been additive. I don’t really see that changing. But what we do see a lot of changes is with the innovations that can help improve this technology. So that’s why we’re looking at natural gas plus carbon capture plus methane capture, and giving those policies a voice at the table. So we did have people talking about carbon capture, for instance, as part of a solution—innovative technologies.

So right now, we believe in a bigger tent—a tent that is going to allow entities to be able to share their perspectives and their solutions.

Another piece that often goes unnoticed is that fossil fuel companies are funding a lot of R&D on lower-carbon technologies. Hydrogen, for instance, or like [carbon capture and storage] and [carbon capture utilization and storage]. So they’re putting a lot of money into this, and they deserve to have a seat at the table, because they are trying to reduce emissions.

I think a bigger tent is going to help us not create the “who can and who shouldn’t be at the table,” but really be a more inclusive place for us to solve big problems together.

That’s one of the problems that I’ve seen with one side of the aisle, the Democratic party, trying to solve climate change. It isn’t working. The policies aren’t durable.

We need left and the right, Republicans and Democrats, trying to solve big problems. And climate change is a very big problem that we need to solve, and we’re not going to do it with just a slice or sliver of the population or the industry trying to solve it.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NCEW-Policymaker-Symposium-2024TTAS5150.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 05:59:36.633696

Officials with the new Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, formerly the state Department of Energy and Natural Resources, say the changes will place it on a more modern and transparent footing to balance ""economic growth and environmental stewardship.""

The changes are also expected, the department's secretary has said, to enhance enforcement of the state's oil and gas sector. It will also streamline permitting, a change welcomed by the industry.

""In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago. Technology, industry and environmental best practices have changed a great deal over those decades, and it’s time this agency caught up,"" Dustin Davidson, secretary of the renamed department, said in a statement earlier this month.

Often at the center of complex disputes in a state rich with energy resources, the department has a large and expanding footprint. It has a hand in regulating oil and gas, pipelines, wind and solar energy, underground injection, carbon capture and sequestration, groundwater use, and development in the coastal zone.

Department officials warned that, though the reorganization would be in effect Wednesday, the full integration from operating under the old structure to the new one could take time.

Among the changes instituted this spring and summer by the Legislature, the reorganization has also done away with a district dating from the mid-1970s that oversaw groundwater use to prevent saltwater intrusion into the Baton Rouge-area's aquifer. Groundwater regulation in Baton Rouge is now fully under the control of the newly reorganized state agency.

Oil and gas groups welcomed the broader reorganization, while one environmental group said it expected to see little difference from what they claimed is an agency that has been an industry ""rubber stamp.""

Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, pointed out that the former department secretary who led the reorganization, Tyler Gray, previously led an industry trade group, the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.

""This agency is designed by the oil industry for its own benefit, and that should scare everyone in this state,"" Rolfes said.

Tommy Faucheux, the current president of LMOGA, countered that his trade group is optimistic the changes will clear up red tape and uncertainty, a shift that is ""essential for the state to prosper.""

""It’s important that our state’s regulatory structure can challenge industry to improve while working productively to foster the economic opportunities in oil and gas that will keep our kids here in Louisiana,"" he said.

Six new offices

Faucheux and Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, also welcomed the arrival of Davidson as the new secretary. Faucheux highlighted his experience with energy policy, while Moncla cited his past work with Davidson, who was previously DENR deputy secretary and a former congressional staffer in Washington.

Gray, Landry's first appointment to the department, led the reorganization until he stepped down last month. The effort followed an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry early in his term.

The new department will go by the acronym ""C&E,"" which had been the Department of Natural Resources for decades before an earlier name change in January 2024 to the Department of Energy and Natural Resources.

Implemented through two regular sessions and one special legislative session, the changes did away with the historical Office of Conservation and shuffled offices within the new department while boosting their number from four to six.

The Office of Conservation was Louisiana's chief oil-and-gas regulator since the early days of the state's petroleum industry. The office's gubernatorially appointed commissioners retained independent regulatory powers through the years even after the office was folded inside DNR.

The Legislature, at department officials' urging, first removed the administrative division between the department and the office. It then did away with the conservation commissioner and vested the commissioner's powers in the secretary of the new department.

In the most recent session, Act 458, sponsored by state Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, was the primary vehicle for the reorganization. Many of its more than 225 pages removed responsibilities from the state commissioner of conservation and handed them to the new C&E secretary.

Among the six new offices, the reorganization consolidated oil, gas and coastal management permitting and compliance, the latter of which affects wetlands development, under one Office of Permitting and Compliance.

A separate division, the Office of Enforcement, will handle inspection and enforcement of permitted oil and gas wells and other activities for which the state has regulatory primacy, such as underground injection and carbon capture.

'Win over the public trust'

In a recent speech to carbon capture executives at LSU, Davidson emphasized the significance of separating permitting from enforcement.

""We saw that as something that needed to change significantly because a lot of times you had folks that were having those relationships with the applicants that then had to turn around and enforce actions against those applicants. Sometimes that can be difficult,"" Davidson said in the Sept. 5 speech.

He added that the department has a ""robust enforcement system that, I would say, in the past has not been used to our advantage the way it should have been.""

Davidson said enforcement is the department's ""biggest tool to win over the public trust.""

Other new offices include the offices of the secretary, administration, state resources and energy.

Other changes took effect last year, including a bill that created the Natural Resources Trust Authority to handle the financial security of state oil and gas wells.

The authority is designed to ensure enough money has been set aside to plug a well if an operator goes out of business, so the well isn't orphaned and becomes the state's responsibility. Louisiana has more than 4,900 orphan wells.

Yet despite its growth, solar still faces efficiency limits and performance bottlenecks. Two emerging technologies, quantum dots and gallium nitride (GaN) promise to redefine the future of photovoltaics, from utility-scale fields to futuristic solar windows.

Nanotechnology Meets Sunlight with Quantum Dots

In a recent interview with Hunter McDaniel, CEO of UbiQD, a detailed explantion of the technology was presented. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanoparticles so small that one dot compared to a golf ball is like a golf ball compared to planet Earth. Their power lies in their ability to manipulate light with extraordinary precision. With the adjustment of their size and composition, QDs can shift light from cooler blue tones to warmer red tones, with photoluminescence efficiencies exceeding 90%.

In solar energy, this means optimizing the sun’s spectrum so panels capture more usable light. UbiQD, working with partners like First Solar, is integrating quantum dots into utility-scale modules to improve spectral response. In other words, improving the spectral response means solar panels can convert a wider range of sunlight colors into usable electricity, raising overall performance. This has the ability to revolutionize the renewable energy sector and by extension, tackle climate change.

The technology requires no disruptive redesign, as it would be acting as a “drop-in” material that leverages existing manufacturing capacity. QDs are also enabling architectural innovations. According to the UbiQD CEO, through WENDOW® technology, solar windows embed QD-doped glass that absorbs sunlight, emits a faint glow, and channels it to the pane’s edges where solar cells convert it into electricity. This allows buildings to generate energy without compromising aesthetics, unlocking entirely new surfaces for renewable generation.

A New Era of Power Electronics With Gallium Nitride

While quantum dots optimize how sunlight is captured, gallium nitride is reshaping how that energy is converted into usable power. Silicon has long been the standard material for inverters, the devices that turn the direct current from solar panels into alternating current for buildings and the grid. However, silicon switches electricity more slowly and generates more heat.

GaN overcomes these barriers by switching much faster and wasting less energy as heat. This allows inverters to be smaller, cooler-running, and more efficient. Enphase’s IQ9N-3P Microinverter pairs one inverter with each solar panel on three-phase systems, the type of electrical setup common in larger commercial sites. This design improves reliability because if one panel has a problem, like shading, dirt, or a fault, it only affects that single panel instead of reducing the output of the entire system.

The system also integrates built-in safety and compliance features. For example the rapid shutdown lets operators cut power instantly in emergencies. Secondly, phase balancing keeps voltage stable across circuits, and fault detection identifies issues before they spread. Remote monitoring reduces the need for on-site visits, lowering operating costs while improving oversight.

In short, GaN enables power electronics that are more compact, reliable, and efficient, an innovation that directly complements quantum dots. Together, these renewable energy technology show how material science is not only making solar panels better at capturing light but also more effective at delivering it to the grid.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68dca36b09e131bcc717063b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-01 09:00:46.264058

Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed.
“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said.
None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes.
“So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”","Last year, San Francisco voters did something exceedingly rare in car-crazy America: They closed two miles of a coastal highway to vehicles, creating a sprawling park for pedestrians, joggers, and cyclists. Of course, furious residents in the neighborhood bordering the erstwhile highway voted last month to recall their representative at City Hall for championing the transformation and, to their minds, creating a traffic nightmare on side streets — even though commute times in the area have grown by just a few minutes since the closure.

The battle in the City by the Bay is emblematic of the inflection point facing cities nationally. As more electric vehicles hit the road, the temptation is to invest heavily in the infrastructure — roads, highways, parking lots — that will preserve the status quo of prioritizing cars over people. Meanwhile, the e-bike market is skyrocketing — and, according to some studies, outpacing electric cars — providing an even more environmentally friendly travel option. The question now is: Do officials double down on deadly car-centric urban design, or do they rethink cities to encourage people to ditch four wheels for two?

Cities and states throughout the country are taking steps to make existing infrastructure more accommodating to those who prefer to pedal. They are lowering vehicle speed limits, building designated bike lanes, providing charging, and ensuring underserved neighborhoods don’t get left behind. All of this has been a big change in just the past few years, given that some locales didn’t regulate e-bikes at all until the late 2010s, said Leigh Ann Von Hagen, director of the Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. “All states have seen the writing on the wall,” she said.

The promise of the e-bike is that it can help people of every age. Parents are carting children around on beefy models with built-in bins. Workers can use them to get to and from their jobs. Shoppers can slap saddle bags over the rear fender to haul groceries. And elderly folks, who may not be confident in their ability to operate a conventional pedaller, can use them in lieu of driving. “I have an uncle in Tennessee who started riding an e-bike when he retired because he just didn’t want to drive to the store anymore,” Von Hagen said.

In addition to that lowering of carbon emissions — how much exactly will depend on the city and the rate of e-bike adoption, but the drop may be somewhere around 12 percent — there’s also the harder-to-quantify health benefits of people exercising more. Plus, fewer cars spewing pollution improves air quality and public health. EVs, too, release their own form of pollution: Because they’re heavier than combustion cars, their tires and brakes produce more microplastics that sully the air and wash out to sea.

Drivers may experience range anxiety about their electric vehicle not having the juice to reach their destination, but the opposite is true for e-bikers. Older people or those with medical conditions might avoid conventional cycling because they worry about having the energy to make it somewhere, especially if there are hills in their way. With e-bike ranges far exceeding the average distance that riders are traveling (around 6 miles), range anxiety can be higher for those providing their own pedalling power. “When we do interviews with people, they will use the e-bike on eco, or even off, when they’re on flat terrain, and as soon as they get to that hill, they consistently report putting it up to the maximum,” said Jessica Bourne, an active travel researcher at the University of Bristol in the UK. “As one participant described it: It’s just flattening their journey.”

You can see the potential for e-bikes to replace cars in how their riders compare to those on conventional bikes. Given that e-bike users have the option to let the motor do all the work, you might assume that they’re burning fewer calories. But research has shown that riders tend to travel significantly farther on e-bikes, meaning they’re getting about as much physical activity as those taking shorter trips on conventional bikes.

Put another way: It’s less exertion, but more time spent exercising and running errands. “Once you account for increased frequency and increased duration and distance traveled, they spend longer on the bike overall, so they’re actually expending more energy on a weekly basis,” Bourne said. “That’s why they have more potential to substitute for motorized vehicles.”

Indeed, several studies have shown that people are already replacing car trips with e-bike rides on a wide scale. And the more bike-friendly cities make themselves, the more people opt for two wheels: Between 2009 and 2014, commuting by conventional bikes and electric versions doubled in New York City and Washington D.C thanks in part to better bicycle infrastructure. E-bike sales in North America doubled between 2018 and 2021. (So too have e-bike and e-scooter related injuries increased, due largely to insufficient and unsafe infrastructure for riders.)

Established cycling havens like the Netherlands — where the average person rides 680 miles a year, despite the chill of winter — show just how much the built environment can influence travel choices. “In the Netherlands, we say there’s no bad weather — there’s only bad clothing,” said Joost de Kruijf, a travel behavior researcher at Dutch Cycling Intelligence. “Once you reach a kind of threshold where you do all your trips by bicycle, then it just becomes a habit.”

The challenge, though, is that e-bikes remain expensive — anywhere from around $1,000 to over ten times that amount — putting them out of reach of the people who could benefit the most. Low-income folks without cars would get access to more employment opportunities if they had e-bikes, Bourne said, because they can travel farther, and often more conveniently. Similarly, young people would have greater access to education opportunities at colleges beyond walking distance or transit routes. That’s especially true if they’re living car-free somewhere with poor public transportation, a problem known to researchers as transport poverty.

The solution, Bourne said, is to subsidize e-bikes. California, for instance, has provided up to $2,000 for low-income residents to buy them, though the program is no longer accepting applications. Denver has offered similar support. “If it’s going to benefit the planet and it’s going to reduce the cars on the road, then why don’t we provide the subsidies for e-bikes, as we do for electric cars?” Bourne asks. “It just seems bananas to me.”

In fact, studies have shown that rebates incentivizing EV purchases and rebates that incentivize e-bikes can be equally effective, both costing about a dollar per ton of avoided carbon dioxide emissions, at least in British Columbia. “The big difference is electric bike incentives come with a whole range of other co-benefits,” said Alex Bigazzi, a researcher in transportation engineering and planning at the University of British Columbia. “Whereas electric car incentives actually have some downsides, because we know it incentivizes even more driving, which makes congestion worse, and leads to more sedentary lifestyles, and leads to higher infrastructure costs.” (Some research has shown what’s called a rebound effect: Because electric vehicles are cheaper to operate, there can be a modest increase in total vehicle miles traveled.)

Indeed, in a report published last week, Bigazzi found that an e-bike rebate program in British Columbia helped recipients increase their cycling by 25 miles per week and reduce their car use by almost 11 miles. That, in turn, reduced emissions from travel by 17 percent per year, and increased physical activity during travel by 13 percent. Denver has said its popular e-bike voucher program has helped eliminate 170,000 vehicle miles traveled each week.

Experts say cities could also start to think about bike share programs as an extension of their public transportation system. “It really is a public benefit to get people from point A to point B without needing to park or drive a car,” said Kendra Ramsey, executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition. “There is an argument that having some sort of public subsidy, like public transit does, could greatly increase the number of folks that are able to use those systems.”

Cities where those programs already exist have seen success. Citi Bike in New York, run by the rideshare company Lyft, can be a model. With over a million riders every year, the program, which provides e-bikes and conventional bikes, is an accessible part of the city’s infrastructure.

Beyond making the bikes accessible, though, lies the challenge of making cities accessible for bikes. “I think the infrastructure needs to be somehow retrofitted for these faster mobility devices,” said Greg Rybarczyk, a professor at the University of Michigan-Flint, who studies e-mobility in the Detroit metro area. Making sure bikers know the rules of the road — and drivers know how to handle bikers — is critical, too. “I think there’s a long way to go in terms of driver education and marketing campaigns,” Rybarczyk said.

Even in Detroit, a historic center of American car manufacturing and car culture, e-bikes are picking up speed. But respondents to an e-bike user survey Rybarczyk conducted say that Detroit’s bike lanes aren’t well-maintained, putting them in unsafe situations. “The street sweepers don’t sweep the bike lanes. They don’t sweep the curbs as much. There’s a lot of debris on a lot of the routes in and around Detroit.” Maintaining – and, potentially, widening – bike lanes could do a great deal for e-bike users outside of the coastal megacities. So, too, could providing accessible charging and storage facilities, according to Amelia Neptune, who coordinates the League of American Bicyclist’s infrastructure evaluation program, Bike Friendly America.

“It’s not just, do you have bike parking, but do you have bike parking that allows for storage of e-bikes and charging of e-bikes?” Neptune said. Some “bike pod” companies are offering a potential solution for those who don’t have garages at home to store their bikes. And some of the colleges and universities that work with Bike Friendly America are beginning to offer e-bike parking options in their dormitories.

None of this is to say that cities have to obliterate car infrastructure to install bike-friendly routes. The gold standard, Bigazzi said, is protected infrastructure for bikes, in which a lane is physically separated from vehicles. Intersections, too, ideally have “protective movements,” when bikes and cars move through at different times.

Now cities face a choice: Invest in relatively cheap improvements to make cycling safer, thus encouraging people to cycle more, or double down on car infrastructure to accommodate EVs, thus encouraging people to drive more and endanger pedestrians and cyclists. “Cities can build out almost their whole bike network for the cost of rebuilding one or two freeway interchanges,” Bigazzi said. “So the cost of cycling infrastructure — even high-quality, protected infrastructure — is really relatively cheap, in terms of providing mobility in cities.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/e-bikes-urban-design-cities-cars-health-benefits-emissions-climate.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-10-01 05:01:56.576146

Guest Columnist

Cars are an undeniable part of Indiana’s identity – from hosting the Indianapolis 500 to employing one of the nation’s largest automotive care and manufacturing workforces.

As Hoosiers, we drive more miles per year than nearly every other U.S. state. Having been in the auto industry for more than 40 years, cars are an important part of my story, too – along with the rest of my Christian Brothers Automotive team in Westfield, Ind.

I’ve always believed in doing right by my customers: fair prices, honest work, and treating people like neighbors. But in recent years, it’s become harder to live up to that promise – not because our technicians lack the skills or know-how, but because car manufacturers are locking us out of the information we need to do our jobs.

Thanks to technology, computers, and data are now just as much a part of auto repairs as a jack or a wrench. Fixing any advanced feature (backup cameras, automatic wipers, automatic braking, blind spot warnings, etc.) or even more basic parts (headlights, bumpers, fenders, etc.) can require access to a car’s repair and maintenance data. Without it, independent shops are out of luck – with more than half of us already sending up to five customer vehicles per month to more expensive, less convenient dealerships because of these repair restrictions.

For example, some models have very limited programming and require a global diagnostic system that manufacturers have ​not made available to the public. Other manufacturer systems prohibit outside users on their servers outright – meaning independent shops cannot program radios, GPS systems, or power windows on affected vehicles. We have to send these types of repairs to the dealer regularly.

These restrictions need to end. Unless Congress requires automakers to share necessary repair information, these issues will continue, and independent shops across the country could disappear from the market in years to come – including more than 112,000 automotive care industry jobs and nearly $42 billion in associated economic output here in Indiana.

In today’s political environment, it’s rare to find an issue that cuts across the aisle. But the growing movement to restore free and fair auto repair access has united lawmakers on both sides who understand what’s at stake for small businesses and working families. The REPAIR Act (H.R. 1566/S. 1379) would require automakers to share the tools and information necessary for modern repairs – leveling the playing field for independent repairers and protecting car owners’ ability to choose where they service their vehicles.

Currently, 29 percent of Hoosiers live in rural areas, which is 42 percent more than the national average. For them, independent repair access isn’t just about preference; it’s about access to critical infrastructure. Many of these families lack nearby dealerships to turn to if their local shop hits a manufacturer’s block or ceases to exist altogether. Restricting auto repairs doesn’t just inconvenience folks; it isolates them.

Passing the REPAIR Act will ensure Hoosiers, not car companies, are in control of how their vehicles are repaired. Building on Sen. Jim Banks’ co-sponsorship of the REPAIR Act last session as a member of the House of Representatives, we urge Sen. Banks, Sen. Todd Young, and the rest of our state’s congressional delegation: put Hoosiers first and support this important legislation.

When small shops are blocked from repairs, the impact is felt in paychecks, apprenticeship pipelines, and on Main Street businesses statewide. Failure to pass the REPAIR Act will be too much of a cost for Indiana drivers.

We encourage Congress to stand up for market competition, consumer choice, and the right to fix what’s ours.

The sources of air pollution are varied and geographically diverse.
According to the World Health Organization, household air pollution alone was responsible for 3.8 million deaths, or 7.7% of the global mortality in 2018.
Dirty Cleaning Products Another source of indoor air pollution are cleaning products.
“Reducing these sources of indoor and outdoor air pollution are part of what is considered mitigation to climate change,” she said.","AMSTERDAM — That air pollution is a primary antagonist to pulmonary health has been known for a long time, but the true extent of its detrimental effects may reach far beyond the lungs. Air pollutants infiltrate the bloodstream, damage multiple organ systems, and contribute significantly to global mortality.

Pulmonary experts and epidemiologists at European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congress 2025 discussed the well-documented dangers of outdoor air pollution and the often-overlooked hazards lurking within our own homes, from traditional cooking fuels to everyday cleaning products.

Air pollution is a multi-faceted global health crisis that demands immediate and comprehensive action, Kristie Ebi, PhD, an environmental epidemiologist and professor of global health and environmental and occupational health sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, said at the Congress. “The literature has expanded significantly over the last several years, moving beyond impacts directly on the pulmonary system,” she said.

She explained that fine particulate matter, specifically PM2.5, is capable of crossing the lung-blood barrier, therefore entering the bloodstream and affecting a wide array of organ systems. This systemic invasion transforms what was once considered a purely respiratory issue into a cardiovascular, neurological, and systemic threat, she said.

According to data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, air pollution is the second leading risk factor for illness and death, and the most vulnerable to it are children and older adults. Low-income countries, such as South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, also bear the biggest burden.

The sources of air pollution are varied and geographically diverse. In regions like East and South Asia, coal combustion remains a significant contributor. In other parts of the world, oil, gas, and biofuels are the primary culprits.

In addition, a growing body of research, triggered by the increase of climate-driven wildfires, has shown that fire-related particulate matter is especially concerning. “Fire-related particulate matter is much more toxic than regular PM2.5,” Ebi said. For instance, in one study, researchers found that underestimating this specific risk could be off by as much as 93%.

The Hidden Dangers in Indian Kitchens

While outdoor pollution sources, such as traffic and industry often dominate public discourse, a significant portion of the global population is exposed to dangerously high levels of pollution within their own homes. Naresh Chandra Gupta, PhD, a professor at the University School of Environment Management in Delhi, India, presented a study on the effects of biomass fuel use in India, where around 41% of the population relies on biomass for cooking and heating, particularly in rural and marginalized communities, according to the India’s Centre for Science and Environment.

The traditional cookstoves, or chulhas, used in these homes are notoriously inefficient, converting a large portion of the fuel into smoke rather than heat, Gupta explained. This smoke contains a toxic cocktail of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1), black carbon (soot), hydrocarbons, and harmful gases like carbon monoxide, which have been associated with a wide range of disease, including respiratory infections and cancers. According to the World Health Organization, household air pollution alone was responsible for 3.8 million deaths, or 7.7% of the global mortality in 2018.

Gupta’s research documented the indoor air quality in homes using biomass vs those using cleaner liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). He found that homes using biomass had PM2.5 levels averaging over 700 μg/m3, with peaks exceeding 1900 during cooking hours, while in the household that used LPG levels were lower.

The health implications are especially severe on women because they are generally the ones who spend hours cooking in these conditions. Gupta’s study found a significantly higher prevalence of chronic cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath among women using biomass fuels. Pulmonary function tests revealed a much higher incidence of obstructive and restrictive patterns, with a pooled odds ratio indicating that biomass exposure increased the risk of developing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by 2.65 times. “The specific contribution of biomass fuel to declining lung function and respiratory diseases in women still remains under-investigated,” Gupta said, hinting that the true burden of disease is likely even higher.

The study also highlighted the important role of ventilation. Homes with poorly ventilated kitchens had exponentially higher pollutant concentrations and their inhabitants suffered from more severe respiratory symptoms.

Dirty Cleaning Products

Another source of indoor air pollution are cleaning products. Sara De Matteis, MD, MPH, PhD, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, said typical household products are a heavily underestimated hazard. “Cleaning products are in every house, in every building, and there has been a striking increase in their use in the last decades, particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. This surge in use means a surge in exposure to a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds, acids, bases, solvents, disinfectants, and even ultrafine particles. And similarly to the Indian case, cleaning products too disproportionately affect women and children, she said.

These chemicals can easily become airborne, especially when used as sprays in poorly ventilated areas. De Matteis explained that these products can be potent respiratory irritants and sensitizers, capable of triggering asthma-like symptoms. A meta-analysis she presented revealed a 50% increased risk for such symptoms associated with exposure to cleaning products. The risk is not limited to professional cleaners but extends to the general population.

Presenting data from a large-scale UK Biobank study revealed that domestic cleaners have a 40% increased risk of developing COPD. “We were confident that this result was true because the huge sample size of UK Biobank allowed me to stratify the analysis among never-asthmatics and never-smokers,” she said. This stratification allowed her to rule out common confounders. Other studies have found that cleaning products are also associated with asthma, chronic cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction, and chronic bronchitis.

The danger not only is direct but also can be generational. A multi-center study found that maternal exposure to cleaning products around the time of conception and during pregnancy was linked to an increased risk for asthma in their children.

One big challenge De Matteis identified is the lack of transparency and regulation around product labeling. Product formulations are constantly changing, and manufacturers are often not required to disclose all ingredients, especially those present at concentrations < 1%, she explained. This makes it difficult for consumers and researchers to assess the real risks.

A Call for Integrated Solutions

The experts called for comprehensive strategies that simultaneously address various pollution sources and acknowledge their deep connections to public health and the global climate.

For household air pollution in developing nations such as India, the answer lies in a transition to cleaner fuels and more efficient, properly ventilated cooking technologies, said Gupta. Government initiatives, like India’s Ujjala Yojana program providing free LPG connections, are ongoing.

While for the hazards posed by cleaning products, De Matteis advocates for greater consumer awareness, improved product labeling, and the use of safer, greener alternatives, such as vinegar and biocarb.

To address outdoor air pollution, Ebi said, any action we take to mitigate climate change — reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, changing our consumption patterns — will have immediate and significant co-benefits for public health. “Reducing these sources of indoor and outdoor air pollution are part of what is considered mitigation to climate change,” she said. “The benefits for health of reducing these emissions will move forward on important agendas to help protect people throughout the world from exposure to air pollution.”

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-10-01 08:19:02+00:00,News From The States,"To power Nebraska, cut federal red tape on energy interconnection | News From The States",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/power-nebraska-cut-federal-red-tape-energy-interconnection,"As a soldier who’d served in places where reliable power wasn’t guaranteed, I understood the fundamental link between energy and prosperity.
But Nebraska’s energy future faces a critical threat: Washington’s broken interconnection process.
In other words: More than 90 percent of proposed energy projects never come online, largely because of delays, compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty, according to the 2024 Advanced Energy Interconnection Scorecard.
But those advantages mean nothing if federal red tape prevents us from connecting new power to the grid.
Christian Mapes is an energy pro, Army veteran, and Nebraska native.","Five years ago, as I prepared to leave my Army uniform behind, I faced two life-defining decisions. First: where to raise my young family. My wife and I knew we wanted our girls to grow up where we had, surrounded by family and Nebraska’s “Good Life.”

The second proved harder: What career would let me serve? In energy work, something clicked. As a soldier who’d served in places where reliable power wasn’t guaranteed, I understood the fundamental link between energy and prosperity.

But Nebraska’s energy future faces a critical threat: Washington’s broken interconnection process. If we want to power our homes and family farms and next-generation AI data centers, we need to drag this decades-old system into the 21st century.

News focuses too much on the sources of our power — natural gas, nuclear and renewables like wind and solar — and not nearly enough on how those power sources actually connect to the grid to send power to the places where it’s needed.

That process is called interconnection. And, as you would expect from something dominated by nearly century-old federal rules and regulations, it’s slow, difficult and expensive — and in need of serious reform.

Consider that the average wait time for new generation projects to connect to the grid has grown from less than 2 years in 2008 to nearly 5 years for projects completed in 2023. As of late 2023, roughly 2.6 terawatts of proposed generation and storage — more than twice the entire current U.S. installed capacity — sits trapped in interconnection queues nationwide.

In our part of the country, the problem is acute. For projects submitted between 2018-2020 across the Southwest Power Pool, completion rates fell below 10 percent. In other words: More than 90 percent of proposed energy projects never come online, largely because of delays, compliance costs and regulatory uncertainty, according to the 2024 Advanced Energy Interconnection Scorecard.

This bottleneck threatens to become catastrophic as demand for electricity climbs faster than it has in decades. Data centers, AI, electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing are reshaping America’s grid.

Here in Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District is planning for roughly 100 megawatts in additional demand each year — an enormous jump from the handful of megawatts we previously added annually.

When we can’t connect new, cheaper power sources quickly enough to meet growing demand, we’re forced to rely on more expensive alternatives, especially during peak times. That’s a key reason why Nebraska families have watched their utility bills tick upwards over the past few years.

While federal regulators have attempted some piecemeal reforms, the backlog remains massive, and the process still moves too slowly for the growth we expect.

Solutions aren’t complicated. First, FERC must ensure its new cluster-study deadlines are met and enforceable. Projects that meet technical requirements deserve timely decisions, not indefinite delays.

Second, American interconnection should transition to a “connect and manage” approach, similar to those used in Europe – where ready projects can connect to the grid while system upgrades proceed in parallel, with clear operating constraints to maintain reliability.

Third, Nebraska should lead a coalition of states to demand prioritization of shovel-ready projects. If a project has secured financing, ensured site control and received local support, it should move forward.

Nebraska enjoys abundant access to diverse energy resources. We have a skilled workforce, and we’re grateful to have something no other state can claim: A 100 percent public power system that puts ratepayers first instead of shareholders.

But those advantages mean nothing if federal red tape prevents us from connecting new power to the grid. It’s time to push back against broken processes and embrace a streamlined, practical approach that ensures lower rates and greater reliability.

My daughters, and every other member of Nebraska’s next generation, deserve nothing less.

In 2024, solar set a six-year high for growth rate in energy generation.
Its investment in its own solar and also in exporting solar panels has helped global installation soar.
Solar panels help create affordable energy that helps save money on energy bills, increasing home value, working year-round, and reducing the need for dirty fuels.
Solar energy can also keep the price of energy down in the face of changing utility prices.","New analysis from Ember shows that solar panel installation has grown by 64% in 2025, Yale Environment 360 reported.

Ember Energy's report looked at the first six months of 2025, determining that, across the globe, 380 gigawatts of new solar energy was installed. That is up from 232 gigawatts in the same period in 2024.

""These latest numbers on solar deployment in 2025 defy gravity,"" said Ember's senior analyst, Nicolas Fulghum, ""with annual solar installations continuing their sharp rise.""

In 2024, solar set a six-year high for growth rate in energy generation. According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, solar power was the fastest-growing electricity source in the U.S. from 2010 to 2020. And it doesn't appear to have slowed down. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, solar accounted for 69% of all new electricity-generating capacity added to the U.S. grid in the first quarter of 2025.

However, the U.S. only accounted for a portion, in part due to federal rollbacks on commercial solar projects. China accounted for much of the global growth of solar.

As of 2024, China accounted for over 80% of the world's solar manufacturing capacity, according to Yale Environment 360. Its investment in its own solar and also in exporting solar panels has helped global installation soar. In 12 months, China's exports of solar panels to Africa rose by 60%, according to Ember.

Solar panels help create affordable energy that helps save money on energy bills, increasing home value, working year-round, and reducing the need for dirty fuels. Dirty fuels, such as oil and natural gas, contribute to warming global temperatures and an increase in climate-driven weather disasters.

Investment in solar also contributes greatly to global economies. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, renewable energy tech, such as solar, employs three times as many employees as traditional energy sources do. It is also a leading job creator in the U.S. Solar energy can also keep the price of energy down in the face of changing utility prices.

""In a world of volatile energy markets, solar offers domestically produced power that can be rolled out at record speed to meet growing demand, independent of global fossil fuel supply chains,"" said Fulghum, per Ember.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QlBGxTTnZTdeJjNBv4VPzA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Nzk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/d858c22e86000eae248d90f9098fc034,N,,2025-10-01 13:03:23.416313

The beauty of community solar is that it allows anyone, even those who can’t put photovoltaic panels on their own properties, to access solar energy via subscriptions to a larger array sited elsewhere.
About 768 megawatts of community solar are already operating statewide, according to a report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group.
In 2025 so far, the utility has received 442 requests for new community solar projects.
The firm has 31 community solar projects operating in ComEd territory and a number of proposals pending in Ameren territory.","Community solar has thrived in Illinois, thanks to clean-energy laws passed by state legislators in 2016 and 2021. Now, though, one major utility’s especially slow process for reviewing applications could jeopardize further progress. Developers stuck in the interconnection queue may not be able to access key federal tax credits that were sent to an early grave by the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The beauty of community solar is that it allows anyone, even those who can’t put photovoltaic panels on their own properties, to access solar energy via subscriptions to a larger array sited elsewhere. Until congressional Republicans passed their budget law this summer, the companies building community solar could tap federal tax credits into the 2030s; now, projects must begin construction by July 2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify.

Before any power-generating project can connect to the grid, it needs to undergo a lengthy review. Utilities must determine the project’s viability and the cost of grid upgrades that it might require, which the developer usually pays for and needs to know ahead of time to secure financing. Though the process is notorious for taking too long, the actual length of time a proposal spends in this interconnection queue can vary greatly depending on the utility.

Advocates are calling out Ameren, which serves central and southern Illinois, for taking longer than the norm. One major reason is that the utility only studies community solar applications one at a time. At that rate, it takes years or even decades for proposals to be reviewed and ready for construction.

By contrast, ComEd, the utility that serves northern Illinois, reviews multiple project proposals concurrently and ​“typically performs hundreds of studies every month,” according to the ComEd team that specializes in interconnection and distributed energy resources.

Ameren currently has over 1,700 projects pending review in its interconnection queue, the vast majority of which are community solar, according to Ameren spokesperson Marcelyn Love.

The utility is moving toward studying proposals concurrently, like ComEd does, but the policy won’t be fully in place until January 2027, said Love. That’s too late for projects depending on the federal tax credit to make their finances work.

“I think we’ll see a lot of projects that can’t meet these deadlines and just fall off,” said Jessica Collingsworth, central policy director for Nexamp, a community solar developer with headquarters in Chicago and Boston. ​“Every developer is trying to start construction on as much as possible.”

How can utilities speed up the interconnection queue?

Illinois currently ranks among the top five states for community solar capacity. Illinois lawmakers kick-started this development in 2016, when they created a state program now called Illinois Shines to incentivize development of the shared arrays.

About 768 megawatts of community solar are already operating statewide, according to a report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie and the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. But far more proposals are pending, meaning Ameren and ComEd have needed to quickly figure out how to add increasing amounts of community solar to their grids.

ComEd now has about 200 community solar projects totaling more than 430 MW of generation in its territory, according to utility spokesperson David O’Dowd. In 2025 so far, the utility has received 442 requests for new community solar projects. It is dealing with about 750 pending applications in all, including around 80 that have interconnection agreements but are awaiting a customer signature, O’Dowd said.

Even with the glut of applications, ComEd said it has managed to complete interconnection studies and agreements in a timely fashion, in part because it studies projects concurrently.

Developers agree with that assessment. Nexamp, for example, ​“has experience in over a dozen markets and finds concurrent studies to be the fastest way to get local solar to the grid,” Collingsworth said. The firm has 31 community solar projects operating in ComEd territory and a number of proposals pending in Ameren territory.

“We need certainty around interconnection costs before we can feel confident beginning construction on projects,” said Collingsworth. ​“Anything that delays getting that certainty is a problem we need to solve quickly.”

Love said that Ameren is increasing its ​“internal and contractor resources” to be able to do multiple studies at the same time — in other words, the utility is bringing on more experts to review proposals.

“These improvements have already helped us advance 20 applications that were second in line, allowing us to both test out the concurrent study process and get more applicants information about their projects,” she said.

But the utility must balance the benefits of hiring more people to do the studies with the costs for those hires, which customers will ultimately pay for in their bills, she added.

Ameren is also working to address other reasons for interconnection delays.

For example, sometimes the utility spends a lot of time reviewing a project, only to ultimately decide it cannot be approved at all. To avoid this unnecessary use of resources, Love said Ameren is ​“studying the limits of what different circuits and substations on the grid can handle, to be able to more quickly predict when an application for connecting community solar in that area will be denied because the grid has reached its maximum capacity.”

The utility is ​“redesigning our approach to identify projects that have a high propensity for approval,” Love added, so that agreements can be signed more quickly, leaving detailed cost analyses until later in the process.

This means that Ameren ​“can get more projects through the pipeline and avoid spending time and resources on applications that are unlikely to move forward, due to high costs or other factors,” Love said.

Collingsworth said that more information and transparency from the utility make developers’ jobs easier, since they know which proposals to prioritize.

Love said Ameren has made maps and queue reports more user-friendly, so that developers will have a better idea of which projects are worth pursuing. The utility is also offering companies ​“a one-time opportunity to reduce the size of their project to help manage anticipated interconnection costs,” Love said, meaning that developers can change their proposal without having to resubmit it and lose their place in line.

While delays have not been a major problem in ComEd territory, according to developers, the utility has also taken steps to reduce interconnection wait times. It is allowing the use of a letter of credit or escrow account instead of cash as the deposit needed before construction can begin, and it is connecting developers seeking to do projects on the same part of the grid, so they can potentially collaborate to reduce costs.

State lawmakers look to ease interconnection

A clean-energy bill that state legislators may consider during an October veto session aims to hasten the interconnection process across Illinois. The legislation would create a working group composed of utilities, developers, and other stakeholders that would report to the Illinois Commerce Commission, the body that regulates energy.

The state’s 2021 clean-energy law called for an interconnection working group, but ​“it hasn’t been a very productive space,” Collingsworth said. The newly proposed committee would be required to study and report to the Commerce Commission on certain issues, including interconnection timelines, cost-sharing between developers, and ways to create more transparency around the process. The Commerce Commission could then codify such concepts as binding rules and policies.

While the bill’s passage likely wouldn’t help projects meet the July 2026 construction-start deadline for federal tax credits, Collingsworth said it is important for the future of community solar in Illinois. Along with establishing the interconnection committee, the legislation would create a virtual power plant program, providing extra revenue to battery-equipped community solar projects that send power to the grid at times of peak demand.

“The tax credit is a key economic driver in Illinois, and without it, there is a much larger need for the incentives in the Illinois Shines program to fill the gaps,” said Nick Theisen, director of business development for TurningPoint Energy, which has more than 40 community solar projects built or in the works in Illinois, all in ComEd territory.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Nexamp-community-solar_2025-09-30-212937_mobc.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=98fdd3612c3c17840dcd5fbf001b6009,N,,2025-10-01 05:59:26.204337

Chan School of Public Health, said the social cost of pollution from EES Coke Battery from 2019-2022 totals $1 billion.
Hindelang said Monday there’s no proof that public health impacts can be traced to EES Coke Battery emissions.","When faced with testimony that Zug Island’s EES Coke Battery is one of Michigan’s worst sulfur dioxide polluters, an attorney for the facility said Monday: “So what?” The DTE Energy-owned facility was “permitted to do so,” said Michael Hindelang, attorney for the utility and its subsidiaries that are defendants in the EPA’s Clean Air Act lawsuit over the emissions.

Hindelang and a U.S. attorney representing the EPA made their closing arguments Monday in a federal bench trial. U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain said each party has until Oct. 9 to submit its findings of fact in the case.

The EPA requested that EES Coke Battery pay a $140 million civil penalty and begin operating with full desulfurization technology within three years.

Hindelang said a $5 million penalty should be assessed against EES Coke Battery, and the facility should continue reasonable environmental reporting requirements until otherwise directed by the state.

The court should decide whether it’s a civil fine or environmental mitigation funding, and the facility is willing to install pollution controls that would reduce at least 33% of sulfur dioxide emissions, he said.

The EPA is asking Drain to order the installation of full desulfurization, including the best available control technology with the lowest achievable emissions rate. EES Coke Battery produces coke, a raw material in the steelmaking process. The facility has contracts of one to five years in length to sell its product to Cleveland-Cliffs and ArcelorMittal, a DTE Vantage executive testified last week.

Drain ruled Aug. 25 that EES Coke Battery violated the Clean Air Act by making a major modification to its operations, instead of a minor modification as its 2014 permit allowed.

U.S. attorney Tom Benson said Monday that EES Coke Battery discovered that blast furnace gas was harming the battery, and chose to switch fuels and apply for a new Clean Air Act permit in 2014.

EPA lawyer on Zug Island pollution: ‘They buried their heads in the sand’

The U.S. government seeks to bring EES Coke Battery back into compliance and secure a penalty, Benson said Monday.

To follow the law, EES Coke Battery needs to obtain New Source Review permits from the state within 90 days, pay $140 million, and begin operating full desulfurization within three years, he said.

New Source Review is a Clean Air Act permitting program that requires facilities to install modern pollution controls when they build new plants or make major modifications.

“This is not a shutdown order. Defendants can afford to comply with the law and keep running the battery,” Benson said.

Hindelang said the government’s proposal amounts to a shutdown order — “a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” he said. The government is asking for an order EES Coke Battery cannot afford or physically accommodate, and it’s on an unfeasible timeline, Hindelang said.

“Benson is saying the quiet part loud: ‘clean up or shut down,’” he said.

EES Coke Battery can either clean up, by installing pollution controls that would cut at least 33% of sulfur dioxide emissions, or shut down, Hindelang said. The desulfurization technology the EPA proposes is “massively expensive” and would not fit on Zug Island, he said.

EES Coke Battery can afford a Claus reactor, a type of desulfurization technology, that could prevent future violations on the island, Hindelang said.

The Claus reactor is “good,” Hindelang said, but the government wants “great,” and “great is a shutdown order,” he said.

Benson said a 33% reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions is “not a solution at all.” Referring to New Source Review permitting, the U.S. attorney said: “You can’t uncrack an egg.

“Once a major modification is done, the law steps in,” Benson said. “The Clean Air Act has spoken, and they have to install the best available control technology and lowest achievable emissions rate.”

Hindelang said EES Coke Battery made good faith efforts to comply with its permits, while Benson said the state never approved emissions increases that it did not know were occurring.

“Closing your eyes is a choice that brought us here today,” he said.

Clean Air Act penalties factor in the duration of a violation, which is seven years in this case, Benson said; prior payments, of which he said there are none; and the seriousness of the violation based on health impacts.

“They buried their heads in the sand and hoped the court wouldn’t notice. They already harmed thousands of people downwind,” Benson said.

“The community didn’t choose to roll the dice, but they lost nonetheless. Some had heart attacks, some died earlier than they should have.”

Hindelang said installing desulfurization technology takes six years, not the three the government is requesting, “if everything goes smoothly.”

Permitting would take two years, installation of desulfurization technology would take three, and engineering design would take more than a year, he said.

The waterfall effect of a shutdown order would include a loss of $450 million in economic output from EES Coke Battery, a $900 million overall loss to Michigan, and 2,700 job losses across the state, Hindelang said.

A shutdown order would eliminate the coke that supports the production of 2.5 million tons of steel a year, he said.

EPA, DTE on Zug Island facility’s public health impact

Twenty-six premature deaths, 3.8 nonfatal heart attacks, 8,000 acute respiratory symptom days, 14.5 new asthma cases, and additional Alzheimer’s cases are modeled to have occurred in 2019 due to sulfur dioxide and particulate matter pollution from the coke battery, an epidemiologist testified in federal court earlier in the trial.

Joel Schwartz, professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the social cost of pollution from EES Coke Battery from 2019-2022 totals $1 billion.

An air quality expert with 40 years of experience testified Sept. 17 that EES Coke Battery’s excess particulate matter emissions are “one of the largest sources I’ve ever seen.”

Pollution from the coke battery reached Maine, Missouri, and North Carolina’s coast, according to Lyle Chinkin, an air quality expert and CEO and chief scientist of Sonoma Technology.

Hindelang said Monday there’s no proof that public health impacts can be traced to EES Coke Battery emissions.

“We understand the concerns of the Sierra Club witnesses,” Hindelang said. Some of the witnesses called to testify were lifelong residents of 48217, the highly polluted zip code near Zug Island. Their stories of red-orange skies are from long before the coke battery opened, Hindelang said. The Sierra Club intervened in the lawsuit, which was filed by the EPA in 2022.

The biggest harm to public health occurs at EES Coke Battery’s fenceline and is from fugitive sources like door leaks — when a worker opens the oven door to shovel coal in — and there’s no technology to fix that, Hindelang said.

Project Factsheet: NextStar / ANC Battery Plant

Developer / Partners NextStar Energy (Stellantis + LG Energy Solution)

Project Type Large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing

Capacity approximately 49.5 GWh annually

Size approx. 4.23 million sq ft of facility footprint

Location Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Construction Duration Began August 2022, Completed September 2025

Workforce 3,200 trades & installation staff

Economic Impact Thousands of jobs; major boost to local EV supply chain

Strategic Significance & Market Context

With this plant complete, Canada secures its first large-scale domestic EV battery manufacturing facility. Indeed, NextStar’s facility will supply around 40 % of Stellantis’s electric vehicle needs in North America.

Furthermore, the project supports the auto industry’s shift toward electrification. As more automakers plan EV lineups, stable local battery supply reduces reliance on distant overseas sources. Hence, NextStar’s plant strengthens resilience in North American supply chains, much like the Louisiana EV battery plant that recently broke ground as a first-of-its-kind facility in the United States.

Teams, Timing & Execution

Construction of this facility began in August 2022 with site clearing and foundation work. Over succeeding years, the project advanced steadily, marked by topping-out ceremonies and structural milestones.

Project leadership reports that work proceeded with adherence to safety protocols and schedule benchmarks. As a result, the building envelope, mechanical systems, and installation phases were completed on time. Now, the transition is toward testing and startup.

The plant’s workforce included up to 3,200 trades and installers. Of these, a large share were local and Canadian, reinforcing regional industrial capacity.

Challenges & Mitigations

Although the project achieved completion, it faced typical risks: supply chain constraints, labor availability, and cost inflation. To mitigate these, the joint venture applied rigorous procurement protocols and phased staging. In addition, close coordination among Stellantis, LG, and contractors helped streamline operations.

Moreover, contingency planning allowed flexibility in schedule buffers. The project’s success underscores the value of proactive risk management in big-ticket EV infrastructure builds.

Next Steps & Outlook

With construction now done, the plant enters the commissioning and start-up phase. Over coming months, equipment will be tested, systems calibrated, and production ramped. Once operational, the plant will begin delivering modules and cells to EV assembly lines.

The broader implication is clear: this facility positions Windsor, and Canada, as a strategic hub for EV battery manufacturing. As demand for electric vehicles grows, the NextStar plant becomes a cornerstone for regional energy transition and auto growth.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/project-3.avif,N,,2025-10-01 03:59:04.793839

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

RPC’s first project, Miss Kitty, leveraged an ideal site adjacent to Stakeholder Midstream’s 30-30 Gas Treating and Processing Plant in Yoakum County.
Natural gas from Riley’s wells flows to the nearby Stakeholder 30-30 processing plant, where it undergoes treatment to meet MTU’s stringent composition requirements.
“That is honestly one of the largest challenges we have right now, because we’re so close to the natural gas facility,” she explained.
The company is developing similar 10-MW blocks for other potential Riley locations while operating a 5-MW facility for natural gas compression in West Texas.","Like its Gunsmoke namesake, Miss Kitty—a Plains, Texas behind-the-meter microgrid project—is tough, pragmatic, and distinctly Western. Faced with a hard ceiling on utility power and years-long waits in the interconnection queue, developers Conduit Power and Riley Exploration Permian turned stranded Permian gas into 24/7 electricity, bypassing the Texas grid’s bottlenecks and giving the project the reliability Riley needed to keep drilling and growing.

The Permian Basin’s paradox is that energy abundance often collides with infrastructure scarcity. Natural gas production exceeds pipeline and processing capacity, forcing producers to flare what they can’t move, while interconnection queues, which can stretch for years, bottleneck new loads and limit growth. But for independent oil and gas producer Riley Exploration Permian, that challenge became an opportunity through a collaboration with Conduit Power, a Houston-based commercial and industrial power firm. The companies transformed low-value, stranded gas into reliable onsite generation, creating an island microgrid that empowers drilling expansion. The approach exemplifies how infrastructure limitations can catalyze industry-leading sustainable solutions.

Conduit, founded in 2022 with backing from Grey Rock Investment Partners’ decarbonization fund, was built to resolve a fundamental problem: oil and gas operators often sit on low-value natural gas while transmission bottlenecks and diesel dependence limit their growth. “The fund that we’re tied into is a decarbonization fund, so [we focus on] legacy places where diesel is heavily utilized and convert that into more of a lower emissions type profile of the natural gas engines and work through ways that we can add value operationally,” explained Monet Maxwell, Conduit’s senior director of Asset Management. That mission has more recently taken into account speed-to-market imperatives, she noted. According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)’s 2024 Permian Basin Reliability Plan, peak demand in the region is projected to rise from 3.4 GW in 2022 to 26.4 GW by 2038, mainly driven by oil and gas electrification and data center development.

For Riley, the dilemma has held high stakes. While its oilfield operations in Plains, Texas, required nearly 23,000 horsepower of load, only half to two-thirds of that capacity was consistently available. A utility contract capped expansion, leaving Riley unable to bring on new wells or pumps without breaching its limit. “They’ve got to plan their production around the power that they have in that area,” Maxwell said. Given the congested interconnected queues and hurdles constraining transmission expansion and land acquisition, “Being able to self-generate gave them fewer limitations on what that looks like for their growth profile,” she said.

In 2023, Riley established a 50-50 joint venture with Conduit Power to form RPC Power, an entity designed to own and operate dedicated generation assets. The partnership crystallized around Riley’s existing private-use network, a 25-kV overhead line system originally strung to individual wells, which became a backbone for a new model of behind-the-meter power. RPC’s first project, Miss Kitty, leveraged an ideal site adjacent to Stakeholder Midstream’s 30-30 Gas Treating and Processing Plant in Yoakum County. The completely islanded 20.8-MWe microgrid, completed in October 2024, has since become a flagship project for RPC Power.

Miss Kitty: Inside the Saloon

Miss Kitty comprises eight MTU 20V4000L64FNER reciprocating engines, each delivering 2.6 MW of nameplate output. The engines’ configuration optimizes reliability over maximum throughput, consuming approximately 1,500 to 1,600 thousand cubic feet (MCF) per day of natural gas to generate consistent industrial power for Riley’s operations, Maxwell said. The project’s fuel pathway also illustrates sophisticated integration with existing infrastructure. Natural gas from Riley’s wells flows to the nearby Stakeholder 30-30 processing plant, where it undergoes treatment to meet MTU’s stringent composition requirements. These include heating values between 8-11 kWh/m³, methane number stability within±5 MN/min, and heating value deviation of±5%. After processing, the gas returns at approximately 100 PSI through a dedicated pipeline equipped with emergency shutoffs, gas chromatography, knockout drums, and filtration systems. At the generation site, pressure drops to 3 PSI before combustion (Figure 1)

The electrical design evolved in two phases: Gen Site 1, brought online in April 2024, operates at 600 V with 600-V auxiliaries, and Gen Site 2, commissioned in October 2024, operates at 13.8 kV with 480-V auxiliaries. Both tie into Riley’s 24.9 kV private-use network, stepping up power via transformers and enabling seamless integration with field operations. Load sharing across eight units ensures dynamic response to pump and compressor demands, albeit with some frequency and rpm variability as engines adjust to real-time loads.

Conduit Power managed engineering and oversaw Summit Industrial as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. Although supply chain constraints delayed the planned 4.5-month site prep-to-commissioning, construction began in April 2023 and concluded in late 2024. Equipment shortages prompted a temporary turbine solution—initially an SMT 60, then a Taurus 60—running alongside two commissioned reciprocating engines. Mixed-generation load sharing, however, proved complex. “Because of their different sizes and different OEMs they were not able to load share together making the power plant control complicated,” Maxwell explained. However, the experience informed future deployment strategies and reinforced the value of standardized equipment selection for operational simplicity.

The project’s modular design also eased maintenance at the remote site. When a generator bearing failed, the entire skid-mounted unit was wheeled to the factory for repair. Maxwell noted that local workforce integration bolstered community impact. Contractors from Hobbs, New Mexico, two Plains-based operators, and an operations manager joined the project team. Permitting followed a swift Texas Commission on Environmental Quality standard pathway—3–4 weeks for air permits and concurrent Title V applications—far faster than ERCOT and SPP’s multi-year interconnection queues.

A Test of Grit: Reliability in the Field

Today, Miss Kitty’s operational performance demonstrates the viability of behind-the-meter natural gas generation for critical industrial applications. The facility has achieved 99.5% site availability and 98.5% power delivery reliability. The difference reflects gas composition issues and field-related interruptions—challenges inherent to operating in proximity to active gas processing facilities, Maxwell noted. “That is honestly one of the largest challenges we have right now, because we’re so close to the natural gas facility,” she explained. “If the natural gas plant has an issue, they’ll switch to the pipeline gas that’s in the area, and that can have a 10% deviation and composition, which is outside of the threshold of the engines.” Manual gas composition adjustments—five to seven per month—are required when fuel quality shifts mid-stream, she noted.

Still, the project operates with meaningful environmental benefits. Its 2024 operations generated a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, which stems from converting previously stranded gas into useful energy. The economic model, meanwhile, reflects the project’s dual value proposition of fixed cost leverage and operational flexibility. “Most of the costs are fixed, so as more load comes on, there is a reduction in the kWh cost,” Maxwell said. “This allows for operational flexibility as more load growth can be brought online.” In addition, the project has shown resilience during severe weather events, which has validated the concept of island operation.

RPC is now looking to further bolster these benefits with battery system integration designed to enable higher capacity utilization while maintaining reliability standards. Engineering is underway to add BYD Cube Pro battery storage—two 1,089-kW containers per phase, totaling 4,356 kilowatt-hours of storage capacity—across both sites. “Right now, we’re maintaining it by having a lower load,” Maxwell said. The next step is to increase the amount of load in the area while maintaining the same sort of reliability and resiliency that we have in place. By adding the battery system, we’ll be able to run each individual engine at a higher rate, and if we have a single component failure, that load would be taken instantly by the battery and then distributed out across the engines that are running.”

Maxwell added that the project’s underlying electrical backbone has been equally important in enabling growth. “The private use network has given us so much flexibility,” she said. “As we’re bringing on more load, the switching that they’re able to do with the way that the network is set up has been really great in being able to grow this organically.”

For now, the project’s replicability extends across multiple market configurations and geographic regions. Built in two 10-MW phases, Miss Kitty established the modular block design that Conduit is now deploying elsewhere. The company is developing similar 10-MW blocks for other potential Riley locations while operating a 5-MW facility for natural gas compression in West Texas. Maxwell noted that these standardized units can be configured as behind-the-meter installations or merchant plants connected to ERCOT, demonstrating design flexibility across market structures. Current expansion includes three merchant sites under construction using the same engineering design, plus pre-engineering and permitting for a potential island-mode site for Riley in New Mexico.

But Miss Kitty’s legacy—like its iconic Gunsmoke namesake Miss Kitty Russell—will perhaps more prominently remain a model of pragmatism and resilience, distinguishing itself through the successful convergence of multiple industry trends into a single operational reality. The project’s name, derived from a nearby well, captures the frontier pragmatism driving distributed energy innovation across the Permian Basin: reliability without compromise and growth without waiting for the grid.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig1-saskpower-great-plains-power-station-moose-jaw-cmyk.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 03:58:55.851971

And the EV tax credit doesn't apply to all models.","Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1. But where prices go is less certain.

The tax credit, passed by the Biden administration in 2022 to support EVs, is going away Wednesday as part of President Donald Trump's broad spending and tax bill. The loss will cut into demand for EVs, which means prices in real terms will immediately rise - a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September.

That surge could result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year. As a result, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain demand, which could lead to lower EV prices. But it's not clear how much total savings the changes will provide, and likely won't make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn't respond to CNN's request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), more than three times as fast as the 2% for non-electric passenger vehicles.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% during the first six months, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

""If you already can't sell the vehicles at current prices, there's no way you are going to sell them at today's prices with this credit going by the wayside,"" he said.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms and cash-back offers for buyers.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

""I think we'll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,"" Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won't kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they'll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey reports that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment were all more important factors to buyers than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn't apply to all models. It's not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won't necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a ""moving target,"" said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

""I think there's going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,"" Green said.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead “the worst polluters” to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

“Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,” said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

“This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,” Symons said. “Whittling away at EPA’s ability to do its job.”

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they “significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.” Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an “environmental ethic” in his first speech.

“Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.”

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.

EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what’s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth’s police officer if it isn’t.

“Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country’s overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.”

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to “restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the “endangerment” finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won’t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

“Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,” Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. “So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

“The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

The credits, which have been in place in various forms for more than a decade and were expanded in the Democrat-passed 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, were set to expire Tuesday under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed on July 4 and slashed hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits.

Until Tuesday, consumers received up to $7,500 for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for a used one as a means of encouraging consumers to buy battery-powered vehicles rather than gas-powered cars.

“A key contributor to sales in recent months has been an increase in EV sales, as buyers rush to market before the $7,500 tax credits expire at the end of September,” Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox Automotive, said in a statement.

Since taking office, Trump has moved to roll back policies and incentives that promote the electric vehicle industry, arguing they are costly and coercive. Trump has vowed to end the national “EV mandate,” which includes measures like emissions limits or requirements for automakers to produce a certain number of EVs.

“We will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers,” Trump said in his inauguration speech. “In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.”

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said in a statement that the tax credit was a “powerful demand signal” that helped move battery and mineral supply chains out of China and encouraged investment in U.S. battery production.

“The end of this credit removes one of the most effective levers we have seen in onshoring jobs, creating new economic opportunities for Americans, and making the United States more globally competitive,” he added.

Loren McDonald, CEO and chief analyst at EV charging data firm Chargeonomics, said via email that EV sales will “clearly be down” over the next few quarters, thanks to the lack of incentives and deals.

Still, McDonald said, affordable EVs like the updated Nissan LEAF and Chevrolet Bolt will continue to be available at dealerships in the coming years.

“Between the end of the federal tax credit and shifting strategies from many automakers, 2026 in the U.S. is clearly going to be a down and transitional year for EV sales, but with dozens of compelling new EV coming to market in the next two years, 2027 should start the next growth phase for the rest of the decade,” McDonald said.

And buyers who purchased an EV before Tuesday have received some flexibility from the Internal Revenue Service.

In August, the IRS modified the phase-out of the electric vehicle tax credits, stating that if a consumer has a written binding contract in place and payment has been made on or before the expiration date, then the buyer may still claim the credit. That means buyers will be able to receive the tax credit even if the car is delivered after the Sept. 30 deadline.

The change could benefit automakers who cannot increase production quickly to meet demand. Under the new rules, they can continue building and selling qualifying vehicles after the deadline, as long as the contract was in place before the cutoff. The IRS has not set a specific deadline for when these vehicles must be delivered.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25217714107949.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-10-01 07:01:16.775852

Maryland opened the door Tuesday to a program that could fast-track energy projects through the state’s regulatory process in hopes of boosting the amount of power generated in the state.

For the next 30 days, the Public Service Commission will accept applications for large-scale power projects or “dispatchable” generation, which can provide energy quickly during periods of peak demand.

Selected applicants will get an expedited PSC review that could lead to a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity — a green light for construction — in 295 days, or nine to 10 months.

Lawmakers, utilities and energy companies are expected to watch the 30-day application window closely, with Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) at an event last week calling it a litmus test for the future of energy generation in Maryland.

“That will be very indicative as to what the market may look like for domestic generation here in Maryland,” Ferguson said. “We will learn a lot from that open auction to see what merchant generators will put forward.”

But few, if any, said they are expecting major new projects to enter the fray, such as a gas-fired power plant, in part because the new law does little to change the challenging economic conditions for the industry.

“It doesn’t change the fundamental economics of building a power plant, right?” said Maryland People’s Counsel David Lapp. “And those economics are probably not good in Maryland, because we’re not near big sources of gas, like in Pennsylvania.”

Trump administration asks court to revoke Ocean City wind project approval

The expedited review is one part of the energy legislation, called the Next Generation Energy Act, developed by Democratic leadership and pushed through the General Assembly this year in response to high gas and electric bills, amid intense concern from consumers.

Leading lawmakers and Gov. Wes Moore (D) have said they believe that Maryland must generate more energy in-state in hopes of reducing consumers’ bills, as power demand is projected to soar in the 13-state electric grid that includes Maryland — chiefly because of artificial intelligence and data centers.

PSC Chairman Frederick H. Hoover said in a news release Tuesday that the fast-track procedure “provides a pathway to encourage new generation development and improve resource adequacy in Maryland without the State or ratepayers making a financial commitment.”

Moore said in June that he felt the Next Generation Energy Act “didn’t go far enough” to attract new power generation, calling on lawmakers to further incentivize nuclear power in particular. More recently, he has softened his tone.

“I do think the Next Generation [Act] that the General Assembly worked on and passed was an important piece of legislation,” Moore said. “And I do know that we are going to be working together, not just in this next upcoming session, but in this session going forward, to ensure greater relief for our ratepayers.”

Only certain types of power generators are eligible for the expedited review, under the Next Generation Energy Act.

One criterion is Effective Load Carrying Capacity, which measures a resource’s ability to contribute energy to the grid during peak demand periods. Projects seeking fast-track approval must have an ELCC rating at or above 65%, according to the most recent ratings developed by PJM Interconnection, the power grid operator for Maryland and 12 other states. And they also must have greenhouse gas emissions lower than coal or oil.

That list includes nuclear, various types of natural gas-fired power plants, offshore wind, steam and certain types of battery energy storage. The list excludes solar and onshore wind, among other power projects.

But all large-capacity projects — at least 20 megawatts — are eligible, so long as they have also applied to connect to the PJM grid.

Lapp, who represents utility ratepayers, has expressed skepticism that more in-state generation is needed, adding that planned transmission upgrades will ease some of the burden. He argues that most of the projected demand increase from data centers comes from outside Maryland, calling into question the need to impact Marylanders with power plant development.

Eligible projects currently in PJM’s queue include a large amount of solar projects coupled with battery storage, in addition to a gas plant upgrade, said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, a coalition of utility-scale solar, wind, and battery storage developers in the mid-Atlantic.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if there isn’t a lot of response to this procurement, because we know which projects would be reasonably positioned to respond to it, and I can say on behalf of my members that, generally speaking, the CPCN process has been relatively time-efficient,” Vaughan said. “Utility-scale solar developers are not seeing the CPCN process as the primary barrier to deployment in Maryland.”

Vaughan said some of his members may prefer to apply to a separate solicitation created by the General Assembly, for front-of-the-meter transmission energy storage devices, to be issued by January 2026.

And since state lawmakers gave final approval to the energy package in April, Ferguson noted, the market for renewable energy generators has changed, with passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” which eliminated substantial Biden-era tax credits for clean-energy projects.

“The evisceration of credits for renewable energy projects has changed the landscape dramatically,” Ferguson said.

Ferguson said that large renewable energy projects are in a “near-halt” position because of the new law, which may force the General Assembly to adjust its strategy.

“That’s something we’re going to have to take into consideration as we approach next session,” Ferguson said. “Now we’re working in a different financial landscape, where half of the energy projects that are the cheapest to build have been taken off the table.”

There could be a short-term increase in the pace of development, Vaughan said, as companies race to begin construction before July 4, 2026, when the tax credits lapse. It’s possible that some developers could try to use the fast-track before the PSC to try and meet that deadline, he said.

“This accelerated CPCN fast-track really could provide a make or break opportunity for those projects to get their CPCN if they feel that they’re at risk,” Vaughan said.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/maryland_matters_articles_501/dd7ea51a92748f8e897002286e761df8,N,,2025-10-01 02:00:57.913522

Oxford Utilities anticipates that the second round of UCMR 5 testing will also reveal PFAS levels above MCLs.","For more than 100 years, the city of Oxford and Oxford Utilities have provided safe drinking water and that mission continues.

That is accomplished by being in compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Mississippi Department of Health, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in industrial and consumer products for decades due to their resistance to water, stains, and heat. They are commonly found in non-stick cookware; stain- and water-resistant fabrics, furniture, and carpeting; firefighting foam and gear; and even in personal items such as dental floss, deodorant, and toilet paper.

Because PFAS break down very slowly over time, they are found in air, dust, water, fish and soil both nationally and globally. Research suggests that they may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. Approximately 80% or more of a person’s PFAS exposure comes from consumer products, while about 20% comes from drinking water.

Oxford Utilities does not produce or use PFAS in its water treatment processes.

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA has the authority to set legal limits on contaminants in drinking water. In April 2024, under the Biden administration, the EPA finalized national drinking water standards—known as Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs)—for six PFAS. The agency also introduced a Hazard Index for a mixture of five PFAS and gave water utilities until mid-2029 to comply with the new standards.

In May 2025, under the Trump administration, the EPA, announced major changes to those standards. While the MCLs for two PFAS —PFOA and PFOS — were maintained, the compliance deadline was extended to mid-2031. The agency also rescinded the MCLs for the other four PFAS and eliminated the Hazard Index.

What does this mean?

The original 2024 rule was stricter (six PFAS + hazard index, compliance by 2029). The 2025 changes scaled it back to just two PFAS, removed the hazard index and gave utilities two extra years (until 2031) to comply.

Debate continues over whether these changes can be made without a new rulemaking process. Regardless, Oxford Utilities is continuing preparations to ensure regulatory compliance.

More information about the EPA’s drinking water standards for PFAS can be found at: https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas.

Although the PFAS standards will not take effect until 2031, Oxford Utilities is proactively sharing information with customers about the EPA’s actions and the levels detected during required testing.

The EPA’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule requires most water utilities nationwide to test for suspected contaminants that do not yet have health-based standards under the SDWA. Data from these efforts helps the EPA determine which contaminants may require regulation in the future.

Under the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 5), utilities are required to test for 29 PFAS, as well as lithium, between 2023 and 2025.

In March 2025, Oxford Utilities was notified by the EPA to begin its first of two testing rounds. Results from the first round showed concentrations of PFOA and PFOS higher than the MCLs outlined in the EPA’s new 2031 standards.

Following these results, Oxford Utilities conducted independent testing of individual wells at the Anderson and Bramlett water plants. Elevated PFAS levels were confirmed at the Anderson plant, while levels near the MCLs were found at the Bramlett plant. The well at the Anderson plant with PFAS concentrations above MCLs was shut down immediately after confirmation.

Oxford Utilities anticipates that the second round of UCMR 5 testing will also reveal PFAS levels above MCLs. In preparation, the utility is consulting experts to replace water production from the Anderson plant and is evaluating the installation of a temporary well near the Bramlett facility to measure PFAS concentrations in a planned supply well.

Oxford Utilities is exploring the development of a new water source near mTrade Park. Testing will be conducted before investing in new wells and a treatment facility, and the utility is evaluating whether the timeline for this project can be accelerated.",https://oxfordeagle.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2024/02/2.21-high-bills.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 02:00:50.002224

The initiative, unveiled by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the Global Citizen Festival alongside the United Nations General Assembly, forms part of the EU’s Global Gateway investment plan.

The investment targets regional power infrastructure and rural access to renewable electricity, with a view to strengthening Africa’s energy sovereignty and contributing to global climate goals. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewables investment could generate up to 38 million green jobs across the continent by 2030, reflecting both the scale of Africa’s demographic growth and the continent’s abundant natural resources.

The allocation of funds spans diverse contexts. Côte d’Ivoire will receive €359.4 million to finance a high-voltage power project aimed at bolstering regional energy distribution, while Cameroon has been allocated €59.1 million to expand rural electrification. In Somalia, €45.5 million will support efforts to increase access to affordable renewable energy, and the Republic of Congo is set to receive €3.5 million to diversify electricity generation from solar, wind and hydropower sources.

Further allocations include €25.9 million for Lesotho under its Renewable Lesotho programme, designed to unlock potential in wind and hydro power, and €2 million for Ghana to establish groundwork for a solar park and facilitate regional energy trade. Madagascar has been assigned €33.2 million to extend rural electrification through mini-grids, while Mozambique will benefit from €13 million in support of a low-emission energy transition and greater private sector involvement.

Despite Africa’s vast renewable energy potential, challenges persist. More than 600 million people on the continent remain without access to electricity, particularly in rural areas. Experts note that financing models, infrastructure gaps, and the geopolitics of global energy partnerships influence how transitions are shaped. Scholars argue that narratives of Africa’s energy future must remain attuned to the continent’s diverse needs rather than projecting singular pathways rooted in external priorities.

Von der Leyen emphasised the significance of Africa’s choices for the global energy landscape, stating that the continent’s clean energy transition has implications for employment, growth, and climate stability worldwide. While the EU’s commitment reflects broader efforts to expand renewable deployment, African policymakers continue to stress the importance of ensuring that such partnerships align with regional development strategies, including the African Union’s Agenda 2063.

As Africa navigates the complexities of a just energy transition, the EU’s financial package represents both an opportunity and a test of how international collaboration can be mobilised without reinforcing dependency. The coming decade will determine how effectively such investments translate into tangible improvements in electrification, economic resilience, and climate adaptation across the continent.",https://southernafricantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0066.jpeg,N,,2025-10-01 02:57:49.586670

They're becoming an increasingly practical option for small and midsize businesses in Michigan. From delivery vans to fleet vehicles, EV adoption offers benefits like reduced fuel costs, lower maintenance needs, and a smaller environmental footprint. On top of that, state and federal tax incentives can help offset the up-front investment.

But taking advantage of these credits can be complex. If you're starting a business in Michigan and considering an electric vehicle for company use, here are six ways to ensure you're maximizing your benefits and staying compliant with Michigan and federal guidelines.

1. Understand the Federal EV Tax Credit for Commercial Use

The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a commercial clean vehicle credit that applies to businesses purchasing qualified EVs. For small business owners, this can mean up to $7,500 in federal tax credits per eligible vehicle, or more for heavy-duty models. Unlike consumer credit, the commercial credit is not subject to income caps or manufacturer restrictions.

To qualify, your business must use the vehicle primarily within the United States and must not purchase it for resale. The credit can be applied to either leased or purchased EVs, offering flexibility based on your financial strategy. It's also worth noting that leasing may allow you to benefit from the credit indirectly if the lessor passes the savings along. A strategic review of your transportation needs—paired with expert tax guidance—can help determine if the commercial EV credit makes financial sense for your business.

2. Take Advantage of Michigan-Specific Incentives

Michigan is one of the country's leaders in clean vehicle technology, and the state offers several programs designed to encourage EV adoption. While Michigan doesn't currently offer a state-level EV tax credit, businesses may be eligible for utility-based incentives, such as rebates for charging equipment or discounted electricity rates during off-peak hours.

It's a good idea to explore local initiatives available through your utility provider or regional economic development offices. These programs may provide financial support for the infrastructure needed to operate EVs efficiently, such as installing commercial charging stations.

Staying informed on Michigan-specific programs ensures you're stacking every possible benefit on top of the federal credit. As policies continue to evolve, a regular review of these opportunities can lead to substantial savings over time.

3. Work with a Michigan-Based Tax Adviser

Navigating both state and federal incentives can be challenging, especially when programs change or overlap. That's why it's essential to work with a local professional who understands Michigan's business landscape and tax environment. A Michigan EIN accountant can help you track eligibility, file the correct forms, and make sure your records support your claims.

Filing for EV-related credits often involves more than submitting a standard deduction. There may be manufacturer documentation, business use certifications, and timing requirements that must be followed precisely. Missing a single detail could delay or disqualify your credit.

To get reliable help, consider reaching out through this accountant directory and finding someone with experience supporting Michigan-based small businesses. The right advisor can make the difference between a missed opportunity and a strategic win.

4. Integrate EV Costs into Long-Term Financial Planning

Even with tax credits, EVs represent a significant up-front investment. To make the most of the switch, it's important to integrate EV-related costs—like vehicle purchases, charging stations, and maintenance savings—into your long-term business budget. Doing so helps you project ROI more accurately and identify funding needs before they become urgent.

For many businesses, transitioning to EVs is a multi-year process. Planning ahead allows you to align vehicle purchases with funding cycles or growth milestones, ensuring the move supports your larger business goals.

Having a solid financial model in place also helps justify the investment to partners or stakeholders. Showing how EV adoption fits into your business plan—complete with tax incentives and cost savings—can strengthen your case for expansion or financing.

5. Maintain Proper Documentation for IRS Compliance

To claim federal EV tax credits, you must maintain thorough documentation on each qualifying vehicle. This includes purchase receipts, manufacturer certificates, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), and records showing how the vehicle is used in your business operations. The IRS may request these documents during a routine audit or if a credit is flagged for review.

Beyond federal requirements, keeping organized records helps support state or utility incentive claims as well. Some rebates or discounts require pre-approval, post-installation inspections, or follow-up documentation that must be submitted on time.

Maintaining strong documentation not only protects your business, but it also makes the filing process more efficient. If you're managing this alone or want help staying organized, a quick search for a ""reliable accountant near me"" can streamline everything from recordkeeping to credit application.

6. Explore Leasing Options and Secondary Market Benefits

Not every Michigan SMB needs to buy EVs outright to benefit from incentives. Leasing is a smart alternative, especially since the federal commercial clean vehicle credit can be claimed by the lessor. Some leasing companies pass these savings on to lessees in the form of lower monthly payments, reducing your initial investment.

Additionally, as more EVs enter the secondary market, there are growing opportunities to purchase used electric vehicles at lower prices. While used commercial EVs aren't currently eligible for federal credits, they may still offer cost savings on fuel, maintenance, and state-level benefits.

Leasing or buying a used EV also helps smaller businesses stay flexible. If you're still testing the viability of EVs for your fleet, starting small through these channels can provide value without locking you into long-term ownership costs.

Charging Toward a Smarter Future

Adopting electric vehicles is more than an environmental decision—it's a financial opportunity when done strategically. By leveraging federal and state incentives, working with a local adviser, and planning ahead, Michigan SMBs can navigate EV tax credits with confidence. With the right approach, you'll not only reduce your tax burden but also position your business at the forefront of a cleaner, more efficient future.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4624775/6-ways-michigan-smbs-can-navigate-ev-tax-credits.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 00:58:07.572041

Camila Domonoske, NPR News.","AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Drivers have been rushing to snag electric vehicles this month. That's because a hefty tax credit for buying clean vehicles expires today. As NPR's Camila Domonoske reports, EV sales have been supercharged.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: The federal tax credit for electric vehicles is worth up to $7,500 or up to four grand on a used car, and it's available as a rebate at the time of purchase. The Republican tax and spend law this summer ended that credit on September 30. Anyone planning to buy an EV suddenly had a four-figure reason to hurry. Matt Jones is with the car buying site, TrueCar.

MATT JONES: Yeah. The past couple of weeks, even, like, in the past several days, EV sales have just exploded. It's been bonkers.

DOMONOSKE: The deadline is today. And to be more precise, buyers need to have a binding contract by midnight. It's OK if the actual car doesn't get delivered until later. The Tesla website has a countdown clock ticking away the seconds until the end of the day. Jeff Aiosa says his Mercedes dealership in Connecticut has been cleaned out of EVs as the deadline approaches.

JEFF AIOSA: I don't have any vehicles left that I could lease to someone that's interested in taking advantage of this incentive.

DOMONOSKE: The tax credit comes with strict eligibility requirements for purchased vehicles - things like where the car is built or making sure the buyer's income is not over a certain limit. But on leases, anything goes. Every leased EV can get it. That loophole outraged critics of this credit because rich people could benefit. And it also created huge demand for EV leases. Aiosa's got some cars he could sell without the tax credit, but everybody wants that discount. And after the tax credit goes away, EV sales, well, here's Aiosa's prediction.

AIOSA: It's kind of going off a cliff, right?

DOMONOSKE: All those people who raced to buy an EV early won't be buying one in, say, October. So just like the deadline inflated sales recently, it's going to deflate them in the weeks ahead. EV sales are still expected to grow long term. Tax credit or no, there's a market for a car that's fun to drive and never needs a fill-up. But that growth is projected to be slower than it would have been if the subsidy stuck around. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

The most tangible way we have done this was by passing the Working Families Tax Cut package.
It implements President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, serving as yet another example of “promises-made, promises-kept” from this administration and congressional Republicans.","WASHINGTON, DC — Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11), a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, penned an op-ed in The Washington Times, blasting the Biden-Harris Administration for their egregious energy policies and outlining the energy wins included in the Working Families Tax Cuts bill that Republicans passed and President Trump signed into law earlier this year.

Read the op-ed, in part, from Rep. Pfluger below:

Energy fuels every aspect of modern life. It powers our homes, fuels our vehicles, and drives our innovation. From the most routine parts of our daily lives to the backbone of our economy, affordable and abundant energy is essential.

As the representative for America’s most prolific oil and gas producing region, I’ve seen firsthand the importance of policies that bolster American energy independence and dominance. Our region’s success is built on the hard work of energy workers, our unique resources, and the companies powering it all. Without these, American energy dominance is not possible. That’s why we must cut red tape, foster a pro-energy economy, and pass commonsense legislation that strengthens our energy future.

In stark contrast to these goals, the Biden-Harris Administration spent four years implementing disastrous energy policies that pandered to woke environmental extremists over the needs of everyday American families and workers. These policies drove up energy prices and led to a weakened electric grid that has jeopardized Americans’ safety and security. Thankfully, with President Donald Trump back in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress, we’ve hit the ground running to reverse these catastrophic energy policies.

The most tangible way we have done this was by passing the Working Families Tax Cut package. This transformational legislation is a massive win for hardworking Texans back home in my state and all across the country.It supports a pro-growth, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-business, and pro-energy economy. It implements President Trump’s energy dominance agenda, serving as yet another example of “promises-made, promises-kept” from this administration and congressional Republicans.

A government shutdown can have wide-ranging impacts on our communities—from delays in federal services to uncertainty for federal workers, small businesses, and military families.

As your representative in Congress, my top priority is making sure you and your family have the resources and information you need to navigate this moment.

While many federal operations may pause, my Sacramento and Washington, D.C. offices will remain open and ready to assist you. If you need help with time-sensitive issues such as Social Security, Medicare, the IRS, veterans' benefits, immigration, or passports, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

I also encourage you to contact my office to share how the shutdown is affecting you or your family. Below, you’ll find answers to frequently asked questions about a potential government shutdown and what it could mean for you.

Why does the government shut down?

A government shutdown occurs when Congress is unable to pass the funding bills—known as appropriations—that keep federal agencies running into the next fiscal year, which begins on October 1. If no agreement is reached by 11:59 PM on September 30, 2025, a partial shutdown will begin at 12:01 AM ET on October 1. While some essential services continue during a shutdown, others may be disrupted or delayed.

What does a government shutdown mean for Sacramento County?

It’s difficult to fully quantify the immediate effects of a government shutdown on Sacramento County. Our Congressional District is home to nearly 5,000 federal employees. At this time, it remains unclear how many of these employees would be temporarily furloughed, required to work without pay, or subject to layoffs as part of Reduction in Force (RIF) initiatives by the Trump Administration.

What government services and programs are impacted during a government shutdown and what effect does this have on the public?

A government shutdown, whether partial or full, impacts a variety of services and programs. During the 2018-2019 partial shutdown, the Food and Drug Administration suspended routine inspections, increasing public health risks. The National Park Service stopped trash collection and road repairs, creating unsanitary conditions and unsafe roads, while some national parks and museums closed entirely. Additionally, over 86,000 immigration court hearings were canceled, exacerbating existing backlogs. The shutdown also threatened the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program in some states, putting low-income families and children at risk. These disruptions illustrate how shutdowns can detrimentally affect public services and society's most vulnerable members.

What government services and programs remain uninterrupted during a shutdown?

During a government shutdown, essential services related to national security and public safety, like inpatient and emergency medical care, air traffic control, law enforcement, border security, disaster aid, and power grid maintenance, continue, though they may face disruptions. For instance, during the 2018-2019 shutdown, air traffic controllers worked without pay, causing widespread delays and even a temporary halt(link is external) of incoming flights at LaGuardia airport. Services independent of annual appropriations bills, such as the U.S. Postal Service and programs like Social Security and Medicare, also continue, but may experience interruptions. For example, during the Fiscal Year 1996 shutdown, most Social Security Administration staff were initially furloughed, leading to delays in services like public inquiries and benefit claims processing, even though Social Security benefits remained funded.

What happens to federal employees during a shutdown?

Federal employees from shut-down agencies are either furloughed—prohibited from work and unpaid—or required to work without pay if their roles are deemed essential to public safety. While Congress has traditionally approved retroactive payment for these employees once the government reopens, this does not prevent the immediate financial difficulties they face.

Following the 2019 Shutdown, Congress passed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which provides immediate retroactive back pay to federal employees after a shutdown ends. During the 2018-2019 partial government shutdown, around 2 million people were employed by the federal government; 380,000 of them were furloughed and 420,000 worked without pay. Many delayed mortgage or credit card payments, risking late fees or loan defaults. In 2013, there were over 2 million federal employees, with about 850,000 furloughed during the shutdown. Government contractors, unlike direct federal employees, typically do not receive back pay after shutdowns. In the 2018-2019 shutdown, it's estimated that 4.1 million people worked under government contracts, though the exact number of those furloughed is unclear.

At this time, it remains unclear how many of federal employees would be temporarily furloughed, required to work without pay, or subject to layoffs as part of Reduction in Force (RIF) initiatives by the Trump Administration.

What is the process to end a government shutdown, and can the President unilaterally end it?

To end a government shutdown, Congress needs to pass, and the President must sign appropriations bills to fund the departments and agencies that have been shut down. The President does not have the power to end a shutdown unilaterally. The funding bills follow the same legislative process as any other bill, requiring approval from both the House and Senate before the President can sign them into law.

What is the impact of a government shutdown on the public and the U.S. economy?

Shutdowns are detrimental to both the public, who face service and program disruptions, and federal employees, who are either furloughed or required to work without pay. Moreover, they pose a significant strain on government resources. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and federal agencies need to develop and implement shutdown plans, a process that requires substantial staff time and resources, potentially detracting from public services. Shutdowns also cause revenue losses, such as those from visitor fees or gift store sales when national parks close. Additionally, shutdowns negatively impact the economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimated(link is external) that the 2018-2019 shutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, mainly due to federal workers reducing their spending in response to lost pay. Notably, this decrease in spending may not rebound even after workers receive their back pay.

Which federal facilities will be impacted by this government shutdown?

Among others, the following federal facilities may be affected in the event of a government shutdown:

Military bases, arsenals, depots, and federal armories

Veterans’ Affairs medical facilities

Federal prisons and courthouses

National laboratories

National Park System facilities, National Forests, and other federally owned or managed lands

Ports including seaports, airports, and intermodal terminals that may host federal customs processing facilities or law enforcement

IRS facilities

Law enforcement agencies like the FBI, ATF, DEA, or CBP

General federal office buildings

What happens if I have an issue with a federal agency during the shutdown?

My office will remain open and continue processing federal agency casework. Please note that some agencies may be slower to respond due to furloughs and staffing shortages.

If you need assistance with a federal agency, please call my office at (916) 635-0505 or send us an email. My staff and I are here to help open a case on your behalf. See here for more details.

I have a trip planned to DC, will tours still operate?

During a government shutdown, all tours of federal sites will be suspended. This includes the Smithsonian Museums, the U.S. Capitol, the White House, FBI Headquarters, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, and the U.S. Botanic Garden.

If you previously booked a tour through our office, a member of my team will reach out to reschedule your tour once normal operations resume.

Will my travel plans be impacted?

Many TSA and FAA employees are classified as essential workers and will continue typical operations. However, due to staffing shortages caused by furloughs, air travelers should anticipate longer wait times, delays, and possible cancellations. We encourage everyone to exercise patience and kindness with these employees, many of whom are continuing to serve the public without pay.

Visa and passport services are not expected to be directly affected by a government shutdown, as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs are primarily funded through processing fees. However, if a funding shortfall were to occur, these agencies could experience disruptions in operations.

Will I still receive my SNAP or WIC benefits?

SNAP benefits are considered mandatory spending by the federal government, which means they continue even if the government shuts down. You should expect to keep receiving your benefits during a shutdown. However, if a shutdown exceeds 30 days, there could be potential disruption to the program. At this time of writing, it is unclear how the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would address extended funding needs.

Unfortunately, during a government shutdown, funding for the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program will quickly run out, leaving many families and children who rely on this vital support without access to federal assistance.

How will my Medicare & Medicaid benefits be affected?

Medicare and Medicaid payments will continue as normal. However, routine interactions with the agencies may take longer if staffing levels are reduced.

I’m a veteran, will I still be receiving my benefits?

The Department of Veterans Affairs will continue to provide health care services, and benefits will still be processed and delivered. This includes compensation, pension, education, housing, suicide prevention programs, homelessness services, caregiver support, and primary call center operations.

Student Loan Payments

Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans should continue to be obligated and disbursed during a federal shutdown, but only as long as carryover and mandatory appropriations last. The department staff needed to carry out these functions are significantly reduced during a shutdown. Free Applications for Student Aid (FAFSA), Pell Grant, and Federal Direct Student Loans, and servicing of federal student loans should continue for a “very limited time” under a shutdown. If a shutdown continues for an extended period of time, school districts, colleges, and universities may begin to experience funding shortages due to lapsed federal funding.",https://bera.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 02:00:45.660341

Data from the Solar Energy Industries Association shows the country generated over 750,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity from solar and wind last year. That's enough to power more than 70 million homes.

The industry is facing changes, however, from President Donald Trump's new federal tax and spending policies. Some for the better, some for the worse.

Trump signed what he calls “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July.

Part of that bill changed policies and placed restrictions on energy tax credits for the solar energy industry and its customers.

The Solar Energy Industries Association said the industry will no longer have access to an investment and production tax credit after 2027 under the new law.

These two credits are financial incentives to encourage clean energy investment and innovation.

It might be a shock to some, but Vice President and Director of Sales for N.C. Solar Now Jesse Solomon said he’s witnessed funding cuts before.

“We’ve seen a lot of turbulence over the past 15 years, and we’ve always been able to adapt. Right?” Solomon said. “We’ve lost the state tax credit in 2015, and then we’ve lost some of our metering subsidies as well. But we’ve always been able to overcome that adversity up to this point.”

The residential clean energy credit is also at risk and will be cut at the end of the year.

This non-refundable tax incentive is for homeowners who installed systems, such as solar panels, batteries and geothermal heat pumps.

The association said this credit allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the system’s cost from their taxes.

But Solomon said with North Carolina’s population growth and the demand for power increasing, the solar industry will continue to boom.

“You know, there are data centers that are going to be built here over the next five years, and we’re in a perfect situation to provide functional power and reliable energy to the grid as well as the centers,” Solomon said.

Solomon said one thing is for sure — solar energy isn’t going anywhere.

“I think because the price of power just continues to rise, and as it does, you know, our business allows people to hedge themselves against that power price increase each year,” he explained. “So, we’ll continue to see demand.”

Solomon said N.C. Solar Now is a small, privately owned business with about 100 employees.

He says they are “working hard to minimize any layoffs and are cautiously optimistic.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/nc_solar_now,N,,2025-10-01 02:58:11.077789

INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

Springfield, Ill. – Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acting director James Jennings today announced the dates for the next EV Rebate Program application cycle, as well as updates to the program that reflect legislation passed by the Illinois General Assembly in 2025. Program requirements are included on theIllinois EPA’s EV Rebate Program webpage. The next application cycle for the EV Rebate Program will open Tuesday, October 28, 2025, and run through Saturday, January 31, 2026.

Change to the definition of low-income applicant: A “low-income applicant” is defined as “persons and families whose income does not exceed 80% of the regional or county median income for the current State fiscal year, as established by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Illinois Income Limits by metropolitan area and county.”

Median income can be found on the HUD website at Illinois Low Income Limits by County.

Longer time to apply from the date of vehicle purchase: Applicants now have 180 days from the date of purchase to apply (up from 90 days previously). Applications must be submitted during an open application period. Applications postmarked prior to October 28, 2025, will be rejected.

The Illinois General Assembly has appropriated $14 million to the Illinois EPA for the current fiscal year (FY26), which ends on June 30, 2026. Actual funding amounts will be determined by the amount of money available in the Electric Vehicle Rebate Fund. Rebates will be issued to eligible individuals as funding is available.

Historically, this has been a popular program and Illinois EPA anticipates available funds being depleted before the close of the application window on January 31, 2026. Individuals are encouraged to submit applications as soon as possible to increase the chance of receiving a rebate.

Full eligibility requirements are found in the EV Rebate Act and associated Illinois EPA program rules. These requirements include, but are not limited to:

The vehicle must be a new or used all-electric vehicle and legally permitted to drive on all public roadways, including interstate highways.

The vehicle must be purchased (not rented or leased) from a dealership licensed by the Illinois Secretary of State.

The vehicle cannot have been the subject of a previous EV rebate under this program.

Only individuals that are Illinois residents can receive a rebate, and an individual can only receive one EV rebate under this program.

The purchaser must retain ownership of the vehicle for a minimum of 12 consecutive months immediately after the vehicle purchase date.

The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit and softening of emissions rules will sharply curtail EV demand in the US, according to Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley. He predicted the share of zero-emission vehicles — currently around 10% of the domestic market — could fall by half.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” he said Tuesday in a speech in Detroit at a conference Ford is hosting on blue-collar jobs. The EV market will be “way smaller than we thought.”

The blunt assessment underscored the rapidly changing dynamics for the auto industry under Trump, with many major manufacturers delaying EV production plans and redeploying investment dollars to internal-combustion-engine and hybrid vehicles. Ford has emphasized consumer choice in fuel types while shifting its EV strategy to one around lower-cost vehicles.

Ford’s electric vehicle unit, Model-e, lost about $1.3 billion in the second quarter and the company has forecast that it could lose as much as $5.5 billion on EVs this year. Its US EV sales plunged 31% in the quarter, hurt by aging models and a temporary halt in sales of the electric Mustang Mach-e due to a safety recall.

Farley on Tuesday said he sees more opportunity in “partial electrification,” such as gas-electric hybrids. He believes pure EVs are best suited for commuter vehicles that make “short runs” and account for only 5% to 7% of the market.

He said Ford is looking to add hybrid production to its battery and EV plants.

“We have to make these partial electric vehicles in the factories that would have been EVs,” Farley said. “What do we do with all these battery plants? And we will fill them, but it will be more stress” because of policy changes from the Trump administration.

What's happening?

Canary Media reported on a court motion filed by the Department of the Interior, which asked a district judge to cancel approval for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project.

The project, slated to be the state's first offshore wind farm, was approved by the Biden administration, but Interior Department lawyers argued that approval was given erroneously and didn't properly account for the project's impact on other activities in that part of the ocean.

Developers purchased a lease for the area in 2014, and the 114-turbine farm was expected to power more than 700,000 homes, according to the news outlet.

But even before this court battle, the project was facing an uphill battle.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, it moved the end date for wind turbine tax credits way up, only making projects eligible if they begin construction before July 2026 or get placed in service by the end of 2027. This wind farm is unlikely to meet the former date, making it challenging to meet the latter date as well. That means it likely wouldn't be able to offset 30% of its costs, potentially making it financially unviable.

Why is this concerning?

This farm is just one of many wind projects on the chopping block as the Trump administration prioritizes fossil fuels over many clean energy sources, such as wind and solar.

In August, the Department of Transportation announced it would cancel $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects. In New Jersey and elsewhere on the East Coast, several proposed wind farms likely won't come to fruition — or have at least been challenged. In New Hampshire, a new law restructured the state's energy office, putting less of a focus on wind projects.

These moves all mean less renewable energy produced for millions of Americans and that energy prices will likely continue to rise as utilities put more focus on dirty fuel sources — which come with the added cost of impacts from heat-trapping pollution.

What can I do about this?

It's not just commercial tax credits that will expire soon. Many federal tax credits for eco-friendly home upgrades — which reduce energy bills and environmental impacts — are also on the chopping block. This means that now is the best time to act and lock in savings before they're gone.

The federal tax credit for electric vehicles isn't available as of Oct. 1. The tax credit for residential solar systems expires at the end of this year, meaning solar panel projects must be underway by then.

Fortunately, other federal, state, or utility incentives will continue, including rebates for energy-efficient appliances such as heat pumps.

Numerous studies and real-world examples from other states demonstrate that provisions in CRGA will provide both immediate and long-term energy savings for Illinois.

Energy bills for Illinois businesses and families have skyrocketed this summer – as much as $46 per month for the average Ameren homeowner – because the state does not have enough electricity supply to meet demand. Without action from state leaders, energy prices for businesses and families will climb higher year after year, as recent energy auctions set energy supply prices at another record high for 2026.

Further, the Illinois Environmental Council projects the recent federal action that revokes clean energy incentives, cancels permits, and adds barriers for clean energy will increase Illinois household energy costs by an additional $400 per year and commercial and industrial power costs by 21%, underscoring the need for state-level action to reduce costs. In a time when over 1 in 3 people have sacrificed needs such as food or medicine to pay an energy bill, lawmakers must immediately provide relief to residents before power costs increase further.

How CRGA Will Help:

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will save consumers $34 billion. It reduces costs by increasing energy supply in the near- and long-term.

CRGA will expand Illinois’ energy supply by supporting development of energy storage, which absorbs excess electricity when prices are low to deliver it when demand and costs are higher.

CRGA would also create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program to deliver immediate savings by aggregating power from already-built distributed energy sources at homes, businesses, organizations, and elsewhere, and sending that energy to the grid to bolster supply. A VPP can be established in as little as six months. VPPs and energy storage are proven solutions to lower energy costs:

CRGA creates $34 billion in net savings on Illinois energy bills over 20 years, according to an analysis by The Power Bureau. This would mitigate the price spikes that have hit businesses and families hard this summer – and will again next summer.

The Illinois Power Agency projects that the CRGA would lower household energy bills by up to $20.54 by 2035 and its energy storage program would save two to four times its cost.

Energy storage, solar, and wind are by far the fastest and most affordable energy sources to build and activate – nearly three times less expensive and twice as fast as gas; three times faster than coal; and seven times faster than nuclear.

CRGA will save consumers money and prevent an economic disaster for Illinois by supporting the state’s growing clean energy economy. Illinois ranked fourth in the nation for solar energy growth in 2024 and sixth in the nation for total wind energy, but this impressive growth – and the jobs clean energy has created – is at risk.

If nothing changes, the Illinois Environmental Council projects this summer’s federal action will have sweeping economic impacts across the state, including:

52,000 lost clean energy and manufacturing jobs

$16.8 billion in lost public and private investments

105 facilities put at risk of closure

21% higher commercial and industrial energy bills, making Illinois a less attractive state for business investments

These devastating blows dealt by federal action can be softened through CRGA, which creates family-supporting clean energy jobs and helps lower bills through building energy capacity and optimizing existing energy infrastructure and policies.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will use proven solutions to counteract rising electric bills. It will save Illinois residents and businesses money now and in the future, and it will protect thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity put at risk by federal action.

Quotes from Experts and Advocates:Lesley McCain, Executive Director, Illinois Solar Energy and Storage Association: “Families and businesses across Illinois are struggling with higher energy costs, and the state is at risk of losing hundreds of small businesses and thousands of jobs. Illinois simply cannot afford to delay action. Lawmakers must pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act this veto session to protect our neighbors and economy.”

Andrew Linhares, Central Regional Senior Manager, Solar Energy Industries Association: “Illinois has long been a leader among the states in solar and storage deployment, and now is the time to build on that legacy by passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act this veto session. The Illinois grid’s reliability – and ratepayers’ electric bills – depend on it. Solar and storage and virtual power plants are the fastest, most cost-effective solutions to strengthen the grid and prevent costs from skyrocketing for years to come. Other states like Texas and California are embracing these commonsense technologies to help lower energy bills, and Illinois should too.”

Stephanie Burgos-Veras, Senior Manager of Equity Programs, Coalition for Community Solar Access: “Our most vulnerable neighbors rely on affordable, dependable energy, but the trend is headed in the wrong direction in Illinois. Community solar and storage benefit communities that cannot otherwise access clean energy. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will provide critical support for low-income communities by ensuring storage is deployed equitably across Illinois. The General Assembly must pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act this fall to protect our most in-need neighbors.”

Jeff Danielson, VP of Advocacy, Clean Grid Alliance: “Now is the opportunity for Illinois legislators to meet this critical moment with the tried-and-true policies we know will protect ratepayers, modernize the grid, and grow business opportunities up and down the state. Passing the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act will provide consumers with significant relief and ensure our grid is stable, with cost-effective and quick-to-deploy technology.”

Samarth Medakkar, Policy Principal, Advanced Energy United: “After two decades of stability, Illinois is entering an era of fast-rising electricity demand. Meanwhile, federal government policies are worsening the supply crunch by making it harder to build the electricity resources that are cheapest and fastest to develop: wind, solar, and storage. While this is out of state lawmakers’ hands, the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act allows Illinois’ leaders to signal to the advanced energy sectors that the state welcomes investments to prepare the grid by building more electricity supply and thereby lower costs for consumers.”

Katie Maloney, Deputy Director, Midwest State Affairs, American Clean Power Association: “To support consumers and economic growth amid skyrocketing electricity prices and rising demand, Illinois must invest in new energy resources. Energy storage systems deploy quickly and provide affordable, reliable power by better utilizing energy from existing generation sources. Illinois can lead in energy storage and gain cost and reliability benefits already seen across the nation. We must seize this opportunity to address infrastructure challenges while other resources are constrained—or risk losing our competitive edge.”

Kavi Chintham, of Vote Solar on behalf of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition: “While grid operators PJM and MISO are slow to connect cost-effective clean energy to the grid to help meet growing demand, and the Trump administration tries to bail out the fossil fuel industry at ratepayers’ expense, Illinois lawmakers can step up to the plate this fall and pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act. This legislation will protect families from utility bill spikes, preserve and grow our clean energy workforce, and maintain our leadership on climate action, regardless of regional and national upheaval.”

CPS Energy entered into a storage capacity agreement for Padua 1 with Eolian in 2023.
“Padua 1 is a major step forward for our utility and our community,” said Rudy Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy.
“It’s the first energy storage project as part of our diverse generation plan to come online, and it sets the tone for what’s ahead.","Texas public power utility CPS Energy on Sept. 30 announced the beginning of operations of Padua 1, a 50-megawatt, two-hour duration Battery Energy Storage System in Bexar County.

Padua 1, owned and operated by Eolian, L.P., was part of an RFP seeking 50 MW of battery storage that the utility launched in 2020. CPS Energy entered into a storage capacity agreement for Padua 1 with Eolian in 2023.

This project advances the utility’s Vision 2027 strategy, which emphasizes delivering reliable, resilient, and cleaner energy solutions to meet the needs of San Antonio’s growing population.

Padua 1 connects directly to the CPS Energy grid and is designed to charge during periods of excess electricity supply to provide capacity that would be readily available to deploy during the hours of highest system cost and needs.

""This added flexibility to both absorb and discharge electricity within seconds helps strengthen grid reliability, improves system operations during peak usage, and supports the integration of cleaner energy resources, especially during extreme weather and high energy demand days,"" CPS Energy noted.

“Padua 1 is a major step forward for our utility and our community,” said Rudy Garza, President and CEO of CPS Energy. “It’s the first energy storage project as part of our diverse generation plan to come online, and it sets the tone for what’s ahead. Battery storage strengthens our ability to continue to serve our customers reliably now and in the future.”

“The overall Padua Grid battery energy storage complex, which will total 400 MW and nearly 2 GWh when completed in early 2026, will be the largest battery energy storage deployment in Texas when completed,” added Aaron Zubaty, CEO of Eolian. “Padua Grid was sited years ago at a critical substation adjacent to the JK Spruce and retiring Braunig power plants and was specifically designed to reduce overloads on key transmission lines serving San Antonio. Battery energy storage projects of this scale enable the efficient utilization of existing transmission resources and are the lowest-cost and fastest solution to meeting the nation’s strategic need to grow electricity production by allowing baseload power plants to operate better.”

The completion of Padua 1 follows CPS Energy’s 2024 announcement of agreements for an additional 350 MW of battery energy storage capacity, which includes Padua 2, a 150 MW 4-hour system, and Ferdinand, a 200 MW 4-hour system; both projects were also developed by Eolian. Padua 2, also located in Bexar County, is expected to be completed in Spring 2026.

As part of a related community benefits agreement, the project entities will contribute at least $175,000 each year to CPS Energy-sponsored activities and scholarships within the Greater San Antonio area for a five-year period once the projects are fully operational.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-01 02:01:39.696850

SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MAXN), a global leader in solar innovation and channels, together with its Preferred Partner, Chicago-based Hardt Electric, have announced a successful new solar energy installation to help power the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) headquarters in Glenview, Illinois.

CHEST's solar system is projected to generate approximately 341,000 kWh annually, offsetting nearly 30% of the facility's electricity use. That translates into avoiding about 242 metric tons of CO₂ emissions each year—the equivalent of taking 54 cars off the road, eliminating the burning of 27,000 gallons of gasoline, or planting 4,000 tree seedlings and growing them for a decade. Beyond reducing carbon, this shift lessens harmful pollutants that contribute to asthma and other respiratory conditions, directly supporting CHEST's mission to advance lung health and improve air quality for the Chicagoland community.

""The solar installation at CHEST headquarters reflects our continued commitment to social responsibility and to advancing lung health,"" said Robert Musacchio, PhD, CEO of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST). ""By lessening our reliance on conventional energy sources, we are addressing one of the leading contributors to air pollution, which is closely linked to respiratory disease.""

Hardt Electric, serving as the project's EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) contractor, designed and installed a roof-mounted PV system tailored to CHEST's facility and energy goals, consisting of over 560 highly efficient and exceptionally reliable solar panels from renewable energy innovator Maxeon.

""Maxeon solar technology has been developed through over four decades of research and innovation, delivering industry-leading efficiency and durability,"" said Michael Hynes, Business Development Manager at Maxeon. ""Our panels capture more sun in low light conditions—creating more energy earlier in the morning, on cloudy days, and later in the evening. And Maxeon panels maintain their power advantage over time with the industry's lowest degradation rate. This technology allows Maxeon to have an industry-leading, 40-year warranty that important installations like CHEST can depend on to produce clean energy for decades.""

For Hardt Electric, the CHEST project represents more than a technical achievement—it reflects shared values. Both organizations are committed to sustainability, health, and building a cleaner future for communities in Chicago and beyond.

""CHEST is a leader in advocating for lung health, and this project demonstrates that their values extend beyond clinical care into environmental stewardship,"" said Peter Hardt, President of Hardt Electric. ""We're proud to deliver an energy solution that supports their mission, supports a healthy environment, and offers an R.O.I that will help this organization focus funding that advances pulmonary health.""

The energy demands of generative AI are expected to continue increasing dramatically over the next decade.

For instance, an April 2025 report from the International Energy Agency predicts that the global electricity demand from data centers, which house the computing infrastructure to train and deploy AI models, will more than double by 2030, to around 945 terawatt-hours. While not all operations performed in a data center are AI-related, this total amount is slightly more than the energy consumption of Japan.

Moreover, an August 2025 analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing global carbon emissions by about 220 million tons. In comparison, driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles produces about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.

These statistics are staggering, but at the same time, scientists and engineers at MIT and around the world are studying innovations and interventions to mitigate AI’s ballooning carbon footprint, from boosting the efficiency of algorithms to rethinking the design of data centers.

Considering carbon emissions

Talk of reducing generative AI’s carbon footprint is typically centered on “operational carbon” — the emissions used by the powerful processors, known as GPUs, inside a data center. It often ignores “embodied carbon,” which are emissions created by building the data center in the first place, says Vijay Gadepally, senior scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who leads research projects in the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.

Constructing and retrofitting a data center, built from tons of steel and concrete and filled with air conditioning units, computing hardware, and miles of cable, consumes a huge amount of carbon. In fact, the environmental impact of building data centers is one reason companies like Meta and Google are exploring more sustainable building materials. (Cost is another factor.)

Plus, data centers are enormous buildings — the world’s largest, the China Telecomm-Inner Mongolia Information Park, engulfs roughly 10 million square feet — with about 10 to 50 times the energy density of a normal office building, Gadepally adds.

“The operational side is only part of the story. Some things we are working on to reduce operational emissions may lend themselves to reducing embodied carbon, too, but we need to do more on that front in the future,” he says.

Reducing operational carbon emissions

When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures. For one, we can simply turn down the lights.

“Even if you have the worst lightbulbs in your house from an efficiency standpoint, turning them off or dimming them will always use less energy than leaving them running at full blast,” Gadepally says.

In the same fashion, research from the Supercomputing Center has shown that “turning down” the GPUs in a data center so they consume about three-tenths the energy has minimal impacts on the performance of AI models, while also making the hardware easier to cool.

Another strategy is to use less energy-intensive computing hardware.

Demanding generative AI workloads, such as training new reasoning models like GPT-5, usually need many GPUs working simultaneously. The Goldman Sachs analysis estimates that a state-of-the-art system could soon have as many as 576 connected GPUs operating at once.

But engineers can sometimes achieve similar results by reducing the precision of computing hardware, perhaps by switching to less powerful processors that have been tuned to handle a specific AI workload.

There are also measures that boost the efficiency of training power-hungry deep-learning models before they are deployed.

Gadepally’s group found that about half the electricity used for training an AI model is spent to get the last 2 or 3 percentage points in accuracy. Stopping the training process early can save a lot of that energy.

“There might be cases where 70 percent accuracy is good enough for one particular application, like a recommender system for e-commerce,” he says.

Researchers can also take advantage of efficiency-boosting measures.

For instance, a postdoc in the Supercomputing Center realized the group might run a thousand simulations during the training process to pick the two or three best AI models for their project.

By building a tool that allowed them to avoid about 80 percent of those wasted computing cycles, they dramatically reduced the energy demands of training with no reduction in model accuracy, Gadepally says.

Leveraging efficiency improvements

Constant innovation in computing hardware, such as denser arrays of transistors on semiconductor chips, is still enabling dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of AI models.

Even though energy efficiency improvements have been slowing for most chips since about 2005, the amount of computation that GPUs can do per joule of energy has been improving by 50 to 60 percent each year, says Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a principal investigator at MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy.

“The still-ongoing ‘Moore’s Law’ trend of getting more and more transistors on chip still matters for a lot of these AI systems, since running operations in parallel is still very valuable for improving efficiency,” says Thomspon.

Even more significant, his group’s research indicates that efficiency gains from new model architectures that can solve complex problems faster, consuming less energy to achieve the same or better results, is doubling every eight or nine months.

Thompson coined the term “negaflop” to describe this effect. The same way a “negawatt” represents electricity saved due to energy-saving measures, a “negaflop” is a computing operation that doesn’t need to be performed due to algorithmic improvements.

These could be things like “pruning” away unnecessary components of a neural network or employing compression techniques that enable users to do more with less computation.

“If you need to use a really powerful model today to complete your task, in just a few years, you might be able to use a significantly smaller model to do the same thing, which would carry much less environmental burden. Making these models more efficient is the single-most important thing you can do to reduce the environmental costs of AI,” Thompson says.

Maximizing energy savings

While reducing the overall energy use of AI algorithms and computing hardware will cut greenhouse gas emissions, not all energy is the same, Gadepally adds.

“The amount of carbon emissions in 1 kilowatt hour varies quite significantly, even just during the day, as well as over the month and year,” he says.

Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions. For instance, some generative AI workloads don’t need to be performed in their entirety at the same time.

Splitting computing operations so some are performed later, when more of the electricity fed into the grid is from renewable sources like solar and wind, can go a long way toward reducing a data center’s carbon footprint, says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in the MIT Energy Initiative.

Deka and his team are also studying “smarter” data centers where the AI workloads of multiple companies using the same computing equipment are flexibly adjusted to improve energy efficiency.

“By looking at the system as a whole, our hope is to minimize energy use as well as dependence on fossil fuels, while still maintaining reliability standards for AI companies and users,” Deka says.

He and others at MITEI are building a flexibility model of a data center that considers the differing energy demands of training a deep-learning model versus deploying that model. Their hope is to uncover the best strategies for scheduling and streamlining computing operations to improve energy efficiency.

The researchers are also exploring the use of long-duration energy storage units at data centers, which store excess energy for times when it is needed.

With these systems in place, a data center could use stored energy that was generated by renewable sources during a high-demand period, or avoid the use of diesel backup generators if there are fluctuations in the grid.

“Long-duration energy storage could be a game-changer here because we can design operations that really change the emission mix of the system to rely more on renewable energy,” Deka says.

In addition, researchers at MIT and Princeton University are developing a software tool for investment planning in the power sector, called GenX, which could be used to help companies determine the ideal place to locate a data center to minimize environmental impacts and costs.

Location can have a big impact on reducing a data center’s carbon footprint. For instance, Meta operates a data center in Lulea, a city on the coast of northern Sweden where cooler temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed to cool computing hardware.

Thinking farther outside the box (way farther), some governments are even exploring the construction of data centers on the moon where they could potentially be operated with nearly all renewable energy.

AI-based solutions

Currently, the expansion of renewable energy generation here on Earth isn’t keeping pace with the rapid growth of AI, which is one major roadblock to reducing its carbon footprint, says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, a short-term lecturer, former Sloan Fellow, and former practice leader of climate and energy AI at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.

The local, state, and federal review processes required for a new renewable energy projects can take years.

Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are exploring the use of AI to speed up the process of connecting new renewable energy systems to the power grid.

For instance, a generative AI model could streamline interconnection studies that determine how a new project will impact the power grid, a step that often takes years to complete.

And when it comes to accelerating the development and implementation of clean energy technologies, AI could play a major role.

“Machine learning is great for tackling complex situations, and the electrical grid is said to be one of the largest and most complex machines in the world,” Turliuk adds.

For instance, AI could help optimize the prediction of solar and wind energy generation or identify ideal locations for new facilities.

It could also be used to perform predictive maintenance and fault detection for solar panels or other green energy infrastructure, or to monitor the capacity of transmission wires to maximize efficiency.

By helping researchers gather and analyze huge amounts of data, AI could also inform targeted policy interventions aimed at getting the biggest “bang for the buck” from areas such as renewable energy, Turliuk says.

To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.

The score is a framework that can be used to help determine the net climate impact of AI projects, considering emissions and other environmental costs along with potential environmental benefits in the future.

At the end of the day, the most effective solutions will likely result from collaborations among companies, regulators, and researchers, with academia leading the way, Turliuk adds.

“Every day counts. We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense,” she says.",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202509/MIT_AI-Climate-01.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 21:59:42.004405

Aidala,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/looming-government-shutdown-could-disrupt-chemical-regulation-under-tsca/,"A shutdown would likely halt or at the least slow many of these activities, creating ripple effects that extend well beyond the duration of the funding lapse.
During that 34-day lapse, EPA’s chemical program ground to a near halt, creating a backlog that took months to resolve.
The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) may be able to operate for some period of time past the funding lapse.
Funding is likely limited, however, and if a shutdown is prolonged, EPA’s TSCA activities will likely cease.
As Congress negotiates over funding, stakeholders in the chemical regulatory space will be watching closely — and planning for potential delays.","As Congress edges closer to another potential government shutdown, questions loom large about how federal agencies will manage critical regulatory responsibilities. For the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), even a short lapse in appropriations and critical staffing could have significant consequences for the implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).

TSCA is built around statutory deadlines. For example, there are strict timelines for new chemical reviews under Section 5 and for ongoing risk evaluations and risk management rules under Section 6. EPA is also subject to several court ordered deadlines as a result of settled lawsuits. A shutdown would likely halt or at the least slow many of these activities, creating ripple effects that extend well beyond the duration of the funding lapse. Unlike discretionary programs, many of EPA’s core chemical safety functions cannot simply be paused without consequence.

Perhaps the most immediate impact would be on the processing of premanufacture notices (PMN) and other new chemical submissions under TSCA Section 5. EPA will stop reviewing all cases when it runs out of operating funds. While the Central Data Exchange (CDX) will remain open and cases can still be submitted, nothing will move forward until funding is restored and employees are back at their jobs. In prior shutdowns, EPA has issued Federal Register notices extending review periods, but even if review periods expire, it is highly unlikely fees would be refunded. Importantly, companies may not proceed to market until EPA’s review is complete. For readers seeking to calculate what damage a delay will cause, a useful rule of thumb is that however long the shutdown lasts, restarting EPA’s processes will take at least as long as the shutdown. If the shutdown is brief, a rule of thumb is to expect about half the time to get back to full strength. For example, a two-week shutdown could mean an additional week to restart normal operations as returning staff sift through backlogged e-mails as well as catching up on new submissions.

During past shutdowns, EPA furloughed most enforcement staff. For the chemical sector, this meant fewer inspections, reduced oversight, and uncertainty about how compliance obligations would be treated. While statutory requirements remain in force, a reduction in enforcement presence can create ambiguity for regulated entities and frustration for communities seeking accountability. Regulated entities should recognize that EPA can allege violations up to five years after an infraction and strive to comply with applicable regulations at all times.

The 2018–2019 shutdown provides a telling precedent, as the only other shutdown during the first Trump Administration, and the longest government shutdown in American history, for a total of 34 days. During that 34-day lapse, EPA’s chemical program ground to a near halt, creating a backlog that took months to resolve. Even shorter shutdowns have been disruptive, illustrating how quickly TSCA’s tight timelines can fall out of sync when staff are furloughed and processes are paused. The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) may be able to operate for some period of time past the funding lapse. Funding is likely limited, however, and if a shutdown is prolonged, EPA’s TSCA activities will likely cease.

States that administer their own chemical safety statutes or enforcement programs may continue operating, but without federal coordination causing the landscape to become uneven. This patchwork could exacerbate compliance challenges, particularly for companies that operate across multiple jurisdictions.

For chemical manufacturers, importers, and downstream users, shutdown-related delays can translate into lost time, higher costs, and competitive disadvantages. Companies awaiting EPA approvals may face production slowdowns or missed opportunities, while other stakeholders may raise concerns about stalled progress on addressing existing chemical risks.

The prospect of another government shutdown underscores a fundamental tension in TSCA implementation: industry and communities alike rely on timely, predictable regulatory decisions. When appropriations lapse, that certainty evaporates, leaving companies, regulators, and the public health community in limbo. As Congress negotiates over funding, stakeholders in the chemical regulatory space will be watching closely — and planning for potential delays.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/fed01-e1757631055521.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 20:03:31.429620

“Together we are writing the next chapter of EM, one that not only benefits all the Department of Energy but the entire nation,” said Alicia Stetin, EM chief of staff, as she kicked off the panel session. Stetin shared her deep appreciation for the EM mission and the cleanup program’s role in unleashing American energy and driving economic growth in communities surrounding EM sites.

Edwin Deshong, Savannah River Operations Office manager, teamed up with Johney Green, SRNL director, to give an update on the recently completed Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative facility at the University of South Carolina-Aiken.

Dealers predict EV sales will plummet without subsidy

Ford and General Motors are racing to sign up car dealers for programs that would effectively extend the use of a $7,500 USD tax credit on leases of electric vehicles beyond the Tuesday expiration of the federal subsidy, according to dealers and documents.

Each company in recent days has rolled out programs to their retailers under which the automaker's financing arm would initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers' inventory by making down payments on them, according to dealers briefed on the previously unreported programs and documents from the companies.

Those down payments will qualify the lending arms for the federal $7,500 USD tax credit on those vehicles, according to the documents and dealers.

From there, dealers would offer leases on those cars to retail customers as usual for several more months, with the $7,500 subsidy factored into the lease rate.

The programs are aimed at softening the impact of the disappearance of the tax credit, which has been in place for more than 15 years to encourage EV adoption.

""We worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases of EVs,"" GM said in a statement to Reuters on Monday.

Ford said it was working to provide Ford EV customers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until December 31.

Dealers, auto executives and analysts have predicted that EV sales and leasing would plummet following Tuesday's expiration of the tax credit, after a rush on EVs in recent months from buyers seeking to beat the deadline.

U.S. President Donald Trump's massive tax bill, signed in July, set the September 30 end date for the subsidy.

It was unclear if other automakers were pursuing similar tactics to extend the period through which they can take advantage of the tax credit to sell their EVs.

Ford and GM devised their programs after discussions with officials at the Internal Revenue Service, according to three people familiar with the discussions. An IRS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In August, the IRS said vehicles must be purchased by September 30 to qualify for the $7,500 USD tax credit.

""You can demonstrate acquisition by entering into a binding written contract and making a payment on the vehicle on or before Sept. 30,"" the agency said.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-30 19:03:06.054856

This year’s class of Business North Carolina’s Trailblazers includes individuals who wanted to prove they could succeed where they grew up, and others who saw opportunities in their adopted hometowns.

This year, we received more than 60 nominations for trailblazers who live from the coast to western North Carolina. They work in hospitality, healthcare, construction, manufacturing and other industries.

Several found inspiration in unexpected places. One started his business as a side hustle in his NC State dorm while studying biomedical engineering and now manufactures wood products in a former textile mill. Another opened a hotel in Washington in Beaufort County after serving in the Army.

Their paths weren’t always easy. One had to ask for her old job back when a bank loan fell through, then took an even bigger risk to get her now successful business started.

This marks the eighth yearBusiness North Carolina has created a list of thriving business owners and professionals under the age of 40 who work in cities and towns with fewer than 100,000 residents.

North Carolina’s population has trended urban for decades. From July 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024, the 14-county Charlotte metro area, which includes four counties in South Carolina, experienced a net gain of 57,300 residents through migration, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That represents an average of 157 people moving to the urban region every day, according to the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance.

Still, about 3.6 million people, or 36% of the state’s population resides in 78 rural counties, defined by trails only Texas among the 50 states. About 35% of the state’s population resides in 78 rural counties, defined by 250 or fewer people per square mile. North Carolina’s six urban counties (750 people or more per square mile) had about 75,000 more residents than 78 rural counterparts, as of 2020.

Most trailblazers also work behind the scenes to improve their communities. They coach youth sports teams, serve warm meals to the needy or help encourage young entrepreneurs. They believe that creating business opportunities in North Carolina’s smaller towns can make a big difference. ■

He completed medical school at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, then had a neurosurgery fellowship at Yale School of Medicine.

His trajectory toward a career as a neurosurgeon was interrupted by what he calls a “come to Jesus” moment in 2022.

“I was like, if I didn’t have all this momentum for neurosurgery, what would I actually want to be? And in my heart, it was I’d go back to the 1800s and I’d be a community doctor and just care for my community, for whatever they needed.”

SEVEN PEAKS FAMILY MEDICINE [FEATURE STORY] WEST JEFFERSON

Age 30

Knox has a personal connection to Ashe County because her grandmother is a native of its Grassy Creek community. She would visit her extended family in Ashe County to participate

in the annual tradition of decorating family gravesites.

Knox grew up in Boones Mill, Virginia, a town of about 250 people that is 15 miles south of Roanoke. She was inspired to practice rural medicine because of her life experience.

“We had the same problems a lot of rural communities have,” she says, “where doctors would come, they’d be there for a little while and then they’d leave. So there was no continuity, somebody who really knew you.”

She earned a bachelor’s degree at Virginia Tech University and remained in Blacksburg to attend Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine. She expected to return to practice in Virginia, but felt drawn to Ashe County during her residency.

“Family medicine made the most sense for me because I wanted to see the whole family,” says Knox. “I wanted to be able to do a lot of procedures, but I also wanted to be able to do counseling, give them an injection and also take care of their grandma and their baby.”

Under the Biden administration, the standards were changed to accommodate its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the mass adoption of EVs.
“We’re going to focus on what standards are actually realistic for internal combustion engines in gas-powered and diesel-powered vehicles,” he continued.
The credits for used and new clean vehicles were originally set to expire by the end of 2032.
“Automakers should be able to make [electric vehicles] if there’s demand in the market to support it, but we shouldn’t use regulation to force artificial changes in the market,” the DOT deputy said.","Bradbury, citing the Biden-era update to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, spoke on the current administration’s move away from mandatory clean fuel standards.

“In the previous administration, those standards were used as a regulatory lever, as coercion to force the auto industry to convert more of their production to all electric vehicles,” he said at a Politico event on transportation policy at Union Station in Washington, D.C. He added that the Department of Transportation believes the large-scale transition to EVs “is not consistent with what Congress intended for the fuel economy program.”

First enacted by Congress in 1975, the CAFE standards originally sought to regulate the amount of fuel consumption by gas-powered vehicles in order to make the nation’s vehicle fleet more efficient.

Under the Biden administration, the standards were changed to accommodate its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the mass adoption of EVs.

The CAFE regulations will still be enforced, Bradbury said, but they will be “reset” in a way that the standards are “actually realistic to be met” and more in line with Congress’s original intent.

“We’re going to focus on what standards are actually realistic for internal combustion engines in gas-powered and diesel-powered vehicles,” he continued. “This Congress made it clear we’re not supposed to take into account the fuel economy of electric vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles when we set those standards.”

In July, Congress passed the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act to roll back civil penalties for auto manufacturers that fail to meet some of the more stringent CAFE standards. The move encourages automakers to continue producing gas-powered cars and trucks.

The bill also sought to eliminate the green energy tax incentives for the purchase of EVs by Sept. 30. The credits for used and new clean vehicles were originally set to expire by the end of 2032.

“Automakers should be able to make [electric vehicles] if there’s demand in the market to support it, but we shouldn’t use regulation to force artificial changes in the market,” the DOT deputy said.

While not inherently opposed to EVs, the Trump administration is not prioritizing EV adoption. It’s instead focused on tapping into the nation’s natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, for more reliable energy.

Meanwhile, China is dominating 90% of the global production and supply of lithium-ion batteries for EVs.

When asked by Politico whether the United States is ceding the EV market to China, an executive in the oil refining industry said the U.S. should play to its strengths by focusing on natural resources.

“Let China do their thing. Since when does the United States follow China at anything? It makes no sense,” said Chet Thompson, president and CEO of American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.

He went on to say that federal subsidies are not the way to make the EV industry thrive.

“Why are we subsidizing wealthy Americans to buy EVs that they were going to buy anyways?” Thompson asked rhetorically. “The way to win this war [with China] is to have the best car.”

He also said new emissions standards should be set by the DOT and the Environmental Protection Agency, not individual states such as California.

TESLA OPPOSES EPA PROPOSAL TO RESCIND ENDANGERMENT FINDING ON GREENHOUSE GASES

Bradbury also spoke on the nation’s prior dependence on China for lithium-ion batteries and other technologies that require critical minerals, noting U.S. energy independence is a top priority.

“We are just so dependent on China,” he said, “and I think the president sees very clearly that this is a national security chokehold that China has over us in terms of dependency on these minerals to help support these new technologies.”","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP24124484237334.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-30 22:00:34.095095

While Washington sweats an imminent government shutdown, the EV tax credit faces its demise. The credit — a centerpiece of former President Joe Biden’s effort to get Americans into EVs — expires at midnight tonight after Republicans killed it in the “big beautiful” bill.

Now, the auto industry and the car-buying public will learn what a subsidy-free market looks like, for the first time since Washington started offering some kind of tax break for plug-in vehicles during the George W. Bush era. Will automakers build EVs if the government doesn’t encourage them? Will Americans buy them?

“We are going to get, in this Trump administration, a test of whether this technology — EVs and the infrastructure to go with it — really has a momentum of its own,” said Barry Rabe, a professor of environmental policy at the University of Michigan.

Booming — for now

On this side of the divide, EVs have flown off dealer lots in the last few months. As buyers rushed to claim the subsidy before it sunsets, electric vehicle sales rose 20 percent in the third quarter compared with last year, reaching a new record, according to Cox Automotive.

Meanwhile, the federal government is still funding EV-charging stations. At least 30 states will soon benefit from the Biden era’s $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, after the Trump administration acquiesced to a legal challenge and lifted its funding freeze.

But good times for EVs themselves may be at an end, at least for now.

Analysts expect that EV sales will immediately fall and that a slower adoption curve will follow. EVs will make up about 30 percent of car sales by 2030, instead of the previously expected 40 percent, the climate policy think tank Energy Innovation estimates.

Automakers seem to be bracing for a slowdown. Many are paring down their EV offerings and emphasizing hybrids that reflect the customer mood. Ram, for example, this month killed its planned electric truck, while continuing to develop a hybrid that pairs an electric drivetrain with a backup gasoline engine.

In Detroit, Ford CEO Jim Farley turned heads today by concluding that the end of the tax credit — combined with Republicans’ neutering of emissions credits — will cause the EV market to be “way smaller than we thought.”

According to Bloomberg, he said, “I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5 percent.” At the moment, EVs’ share of the U.S. market stands at 10 percent.

Sticker shock

The end of the tax credit means that carmakers will have no help in overcoming one of their biggest challenges: the yawning gap between the sticker price of EVs and conventional autos. The average unsubsidized price of an EV in July was $57,246. That is $9,000 more than its gasoline-powered counterpart, according to Cox.

American automakers find themselves in a bind. They want to sell cars in China, Europe and other regions that are rapidly converting to electric vehicles, but their home market is tepid. They’ll need to figure out how to make Americans switch to EVs without a government sweetener.

“They can’t really take their foot off the pedal when it comes to building out new models,” said Robbie Orvis, an analyst at Energy Innovation, “because they will increasingly be pushed out of the international market.”

Trump threatens to fire ‘a lot’ of feds

President Donald Trump said he may fire “a lot” of federal employees if the government shuts down at midnight tonight, writes Robin Bravender.

The White House budget office has directed agencies to consider a reduction in force for employees in areas whose funding lapses and whose activities are “not consistent” with the president’s priorities. But details on the potential firings — and on agency shutdown plans — are scarce.

As Jennifer Yachnin writes, the Interior Department offered an email blast to employees today that largely focused on blaming Democrats for the imminent shutdown and offered nearly no details on potential furloughs or mass firings. (However, department employees “who process drilling permits and focus on oil and critical minerals” will stay on the job as essential workers, Ben Lefebvre writes.) The Department of Energy’s shutdown plan, meanwhile, dates from the Biden administration.

EPA has posted shutdown plans this week that involve furloughing nearly 90 percent of its employees, as Kevin Bogardus reports, but it’s still unclear whether they will be subject to layoffs.

Trump’s threat to fire feds appears to be an effort to pressure Democrats to sign off on a GOP short-term funding bill. Democrats are pushing for guardrails on White House spending and the renewal of soon-to-expire health care subsidies.

A renewable twist to ‘all of the above’

Democrats are borrowing a phrase from the Republican playbook as they try to pin rising energy costs on the GOP and Trump, Nico Portuondo writes.

“All of the above” is seen by some as a way to fight back against the Trump administration’s repeated attacks on wind and solar energy. But the phrase bears the weight of fossil fuels that other Democrats and environmental advocates are eager to discard.

“We have an energy crisis, electricity prices for homeowners and businesses have gone up over 20 percent in New Jersey,” Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) told Nico. “The only answer is all of the above.”

High stakes for AI hyperscalers

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has remained silent on a much-anticipated electricity regulation that would guide the way big tech companies power their data centers, Francisco “A.J.” Camacho reports.

Large tech companies building AI infrastructure have sought clearer federal guidelines for “co-locating” power plants with data centers — the warehouses of computers that Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among others, are building to generate new artificial intelligence models.

FERC is wrestling with electric reliability and consumer costs. Last fall, commissioners shot down a request from regional grid operator PJM to allow an Amazon data center in Pennsylvania to increase the power load it would take from the nearby Susquehanna nuclear plant.

Tim Tarpley, EWTC President, underscored the scale of the challenge ahead. Citing EIA projections, he noted that demand is rising across industrial, transportation, commercial and residential sectors—even as With U.S. LNG positioned as the supply bridge, Tarpley highlighted Secretary Wright’s recent call for 100 gigawatts of firm power capacity within five years—a requirement that renewables alone cannot meet. Natural gas-fired generation, he argued, must play the central role.

efficiency gains slow. “Power demand is going way up,” he said, framing it as a “huge opportunity” for North America, Europe, and Asia alike.

Texas, at the epicenter of both power growth and LNG infrastructure, is facing demand projections “off the charts.” But Tarpley stressed that delays in permitting pose the single greatest obstacle. “It takes over five years, sometimes six, to build a gas pipeline in the United States,” he said. “We can’t meet this demand without permitting reform.”

Policy hurdles: Permitting and tariffs

Tarpley detailed EWTC’s dual policy priorities:

Permitting reform—fixing and narrowing NEPA reviews, limiting judicial challenges, and accelerating approvals for critical infrastructure.

Trade and tariffs—addressing IEEPA tariffs and Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, which he said raise costs for U.S. manufacturers and, ultimately, consumers.

While both political parties broadly agree on the need for reform, Tarpley cautioned that partisan gridlock and election-year dynamics threaten progress. He noted that industry has only a short window—“really the next three months”—to advance permitting legislation before 2026 campaign pressures set in.

Strength in workforce numbers

EWTC President Molly Determan emphasized that none of these priorities can advance without a strong workforce. She reported that U.S. oilfield services employment stood at 628,000 jobs as of August 2025, but retirements continue to outpace new entrants, keeping skilled technical positions highly competitive.

Determan highlighted several workforce trends:

Workforce stability since 2023, supported by industry capital discipline.

State policy challenges, with restrictive states like California limiting growth potential.

Employer initiatives to improve retention and attraction, including flexible field scheduling, transparent succession planning, and empowering frontline supervisors in decision-making.

She also pointed to EWTC’s committee-led initiatives, from well servicing and stimulation to international trade and supply chain, where members are drafting guidelines and certification programs that “raise the bar” through self-regulation. The council’s international chapters in the Middle East and Latin America are increasingly providing platforms for suppliers to connect directly with E&P operators, strengthening global partnerships.

Bottom line

With AI-driven data center growth driving energy demand, EWTC leaders said natural gas-fired power generation is poised to meet the continuous needs. It's just a matter of whether the industry can overcome permitting delays, tariff burdens and workforce challenges, and build the necessary energy infrastructure. “Permitting reform and tariffs are our two biggest priorities,” Tarpley concluded, ""and the time to act is now.""",https://www.worldoil.com/media/5albf3rx/pipeline-stock-sunset.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 19:03:30.533737

You can still get significant rebates in some states.

If you qualify, you could save up to $7,500 of a new EV in some states.

The U.S. auto industry is approaching an inflection point. The Trump administration has killed the $7,500 federal clean vehicle credit, which had unlocked the rapid growth of electric vehicle sales nationwide over the past few years.

With the Sept. 30 end date in mind, buyers rushed to claim the credit in its final days, helping automakers sell a record 410,000 EVs in the third quarter, which accounted for 11% of overall sales, according to Cox Automotive. Now EVs will have to sell without the credit, and we’re about to find out what organic growth looks like.

However, a small number of U.S. states will continue to offer their own regional tax credits, rebates, and incentives, allowing their residents to continue offsetting the high cost of EVs compared to gasoline vehicles.

The number of states continuing to offer rebates as of Oct. 1 is really small, about 15. That's less than less than half of the country. California’s famous Clean Vehicle Rebate Project ended in 2023, and talks of reviving the same after the end of the federal tax credit have so far failed.

Other pro-EV states, such as Minnesota, Washington and Vermont have run out of funding for their local EV rebate programs. Some of these states may resume their rebates next year, but that’s uncertain and could require local legislative actions.

The states where EV rebate or tax credit allocation is not yet exhausted include New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Oregon, Illinois, Delaware,Colorado and a few others (See the complete list below). Similar to the federal tax credit, these states have specific eligibility criteria.

They mainly prioritize low- and moderate-income families. But the conditions also vary depending on tax liabilities, vehicle price, battery size, model year and, in some cases, even the gross vehicle weight rating and driving range.

No state will hand out a flat rebate for your battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle. Hence, the numbers listed below represent the maximum possible rebate or tax credit, as listed on the state government websites as of the time of writing. Note, too, that these rebates apply only to residents, so you can't just drive to another state with a rebate to score a deal.

Some states also cover the full or partial cost and installation of Level 2 home chargers, which is the preferred way of charging in the vast majority of the U.S. If the state governments don’t offer incentives on chargers, dozens of utility companies do.

So do your homework and claim all the possible rebates and discounts from the automaker, local governments and utility companies. Additionally, note that the incentives listed below are intended for individuals. Some state governments offer separate rebates to commercial fleets, businesses and multi-unit housing complexes.

And finally, states don’t have strict critical materials sourcing requirements for EV batteries, unlike the federal government, so even the Japanese-made Toyota bZ and the Belgian-made Volvo EX30 will likely qualify for the local programs. This is a plus, as it won’t limit your options to only the U.S.-made EVs. Click the hyperlinks below for eligibility requirements for each state.

Actions by the Energy and Interior departments and the Environmental Protection Agency follow executive orders Trump issued in April to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Environmental groups denounced the actions, which come as the Trump administration has clamped down on renewable energy, including freezing permits for offshore wind projects, ending clean energy tax credits and blocking wind and solar projects on federal lands.

Under Trump’s orders, the Energy Department has required fossil-fueled power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep operating past their retirement dates to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The latest announcement would allow those efforts to expand as a precaution against possible electricity shortfalls.

Trump also has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands. A sweeping tax bill approved by Republicans and signed by Trump reduces royalty rates for coal mining from 12.5% to 7%, a significant decrease that officials said will help ensure U.S. coal producers can compete in global markets.

‘Mine, baby, mine’

The new law also mandates increased availability for coal mining on federal lands and streamlines federal reviews of coal leases.

“Everybody likes to say, ‘drill, baby, drill.’ I know that President Trump has another initiative for us, which is ‘mine, baby, mine,'” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at a news conference Monday at Interior headquarters. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Energy Undersecretary Wells Griffith also spoke at the event. All three agencies signed orders boosting coal.

“By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,” Burgum said.

Zeldin called coal a reliable energy source that has supported American communities and economic growth for generations.

“Americans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable,” he said.

Trump has clamped down on renewable energy

Environmental groups said Trump was wasting federal tax dollars by handing them to owners of the oldest, most expensive and dirtiest source of electricity.

“Subsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century — and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.”

Solar, wind and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to bring new power to the grid, Kelly and other advocates said. “It makes no sense to cut off your best, most affordable options while doubling down on the most expensive ones,” Kelly said.

EPA eases pollution rules

The EPA said Monday it will delay seven deadlines related to wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The industry has complained that regulations imposed under the Biden administration were costly and designed to speed the closure of coal plants.

Coal ash, the waste from burning coal, can leach into groundwater and spread toxins. The Biden administration said the rules were aimed at keeping arsenic and lead out of well water, lowering cancer rates and avoiding disastrous spills.

“Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,” said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to “protect America’s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.”

Coal production has dropped steeply

Burgum, who also chairs Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure “abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.”

The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there’s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Coal-Mining.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 20:04:07.609150

Reform will “betray” every young person and future generations by waging a war on clean energy, Ed Miliband is expected to say.

The Energy Secretary will announce a host of initiatives aimed at bringing energy bills down and boosting green jobs during his speech at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool on Wednesday.

But he will also use his speech to attack Reform leaders who said they would “declare war” on green energy projects, which are being championed nationwide by the Labour Government.

It comes as Labour have been drawing battle lines at the conference to take on Reform, who they are trailing in the polls.

Mr Miliband is expected to say: “What is so exciting about clean energy is that it can answer that call for a different kind of economy … run for working people.

“It offers the biggest opportunity for job creation for decades. Skilled jobs in proud professions.

“And behind these statistics is the potential for each and every one of these jobs to change the lives of working people and their communities,” he will add.

“Reform would wreck everything we are doing. They’ve said they would ‘wage war’ on clean energy.

“Let’s spell out what this war means. A war on the workers at the Siemens wind turbine factory in Hull. A war on the construction workers building carbon capture and storage in Teesside. A war on the working people of Britain.

“Reform’s war on the future would betray every young person in our country and every person yet to be born.”

During his speech, the Energy Secretary will also announce the expansion of a scheme providing funding to install solar panels on schools and hospitals.

The initiative, led by Great British Energy, has seen around 200 schools and 200 NHS sites funded to have solar panels installed, with some starting to save money on their bills.

Its expansion will mean another 50 schools and 70 NHS sites will also get support, Mr Miliband will reveal.

Ahead of the speech, he said: “This is the common-sense, patriotic case for clean energy that you get with a Labour Government.

“Clean power cutting bills to help pupils and patients.

“This is the difference a Labour Government makes; fighting for working people through our clean energy mission.”

The Energy Secretary is also set to announce a new initiative to help cut bills for military sites and unveil details on the Government’s clean energy jobs plan, which will aim to double jobs in the sector from 430,000 to 830,000 by 2030.

Within this, the Government aims to boost engineering and research jobs by 25,000, welder and electrician jobs by 26,000, and construction jobs by 36,000, he will say.

Elsewhere, Mr Miliband is expected to launch a workers’ rights initiative, which will include the introduction of a fair work charter to ensure clean energy jobs are fairly paid with strong workers’ rights.

This will include plans to close loopholes that give offshore renewable energy workers fewer rights at work than oil and gas workers and ensure worker representation on the boards of publicly owned bodies like Great British Energy.

Currently, offshore renewable and low-carbon employees working more than 12 miles offshore are not covered by the national minimum wage, whereas offshore workers in oil and gas are covered in all territorial waters.

Ami McCarthy, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “Delivering lower bills through cheaper wind and solar is the best way to silence the likes of Reform UK.

“It is right for Miliband to call out these climate deniers bankrolled by fossil fuel interests for what they are – snake oil salespeople who want to keep us dependent on expensive imports and locked into high bills.

“The Government’s quest for lower energy bills for the public sector, households and businesses could and should go further by ending the rigged system that enables gas to set electricity prices. That way cheaper, more stable wind and solar can lower our bills for good.”

Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: “It’s great news that even more NHS sites will get funding to install solar panels to help them cut their energy bills.

“Spiralling energy costs have landed hospitals with huge bills – more than £1.4 billion since 2019.

“Supporting NHS trusts to generate their own solar power and to invest savings going back into local NHS services is good for patients, good for the environment and good for taxpayers.”",https://www.perspectivemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/httpsimage.assets.pressassociation.iov2imageproduction66ef92968825f88c704eb4677afb9e15Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5MzMxNTUy2.79437681.jpgrect667035393539ext.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 22:58:27.974116

Valley Station Apartments are a 144-unit property put forward by Real Estate Equities on a 3.1-acre site at the southwest corner of 155th Street West and Gaslight Drive formerly owned by the Apple Valley Economic Development Authority. The units would spread across five floors and be affordable to residents making 60% of the area median income.

The council approved the project at its Sept. 25 meeting after receiving an update on the changes made to the project since a July informational hearing at the planning commission. Since then, the project moved from 148 units to 144 units, while the number of parking stalls increased from 240 stalls to 250.

Real Estate Equities also decreased the number of floors on the northeast corner of the building from five to four to “provide a smoother transition to the two-story townhomes in the east,” according to planning documents.

With the reduction in units, the density of the project moves from 48 units per acre to 46.45 units per acre, according to planning notes.

The project also appeared before the council with a handful of zoning amendments. One allows for a change in setbacks, another would allow for an increase in density and increase in building height and another allowed the project to have a flat roof.

The project will have 35 one-bedroom units, 72 two-bedroom units and 37 three-bedroom units. The rents for the property will be between $1,406 and $1,941, staff told the City Council. Blaine Barker of Real Estate Equities told the council during the meeting that the cost of parking will be included in the rent, which he said is not normally something Real Estate Equities does.

NRDC will present PJM with a simple alternative: Starting in 2027, PJM ratepayers should stop buying capacity for new data centers.
Our proposal puts risk where it belongs—on the data centers that are driving the need for large amounts of new generation.
Thanks to this advantage, data centers can meet BYOC requirements by installing enough batteries to run their facility for about eight hours.
Instead, PJM should require data centers to make the investments they need to support themselves.","How we got here has been widely reported. To maintain a reliable grid, PJM arranges for power supply in advance. In July 2024, when PJM was securing capacity for June 2025 through May 2026, its markets were already growing tight and prices were poised to rise. Then, forecasts for data center growth shot up, raising costs by $9.3 billion. The trend continued in July of this year, when PJM purchased capacity for 2026–2027 and discovered that it will have the amount of supply it needs to keep the system reliable but with little to spare. PJM’s markets are designed so prices go up as supply gets tight, leading to the $16 billion bill for 2026–2027. Again, this increase was almost entirely due to forecasted data center expansion.

Where things go from here comes down to a race between data centers and new power supply. If data centers are built faster than power plants, prices will keep rising and reliability will be reduced. Reverse that, and prices go down. Right now, the race doesn’t even look close: PJM forecasts adding 5 to 7 gigawatts (GW) of data centers but only 2 to 3 GW of new supply every year from 2027 through 2032. And demand forecasts keep growing. Recently, PJM utilities doubled their forecasts of new large loads to 12 to 14 GW per year through 2032. Those new forecasts aren’t final yet, so this analysis still uses the current official forecast of 5 to 7 GW per year.

PJM must do better. We can protect affordability and improve grid reliability with the simple, commonsense approach that data centers should pay their own way. NRDC will present PJM with a simple alternative: Starting in 2027, PJM ratepayers should stop buying capacity for new data centers. Instead, data centers must bring their own capacity (BYOC). This could include new generation, resources such as battery storage, or demand response. NRDC estimates that with this approach, capacity costs will fall to $7 billion annually by 2030, with a total bill of $60 billion through 2032.

Power plant owners argue that prices need to remain high to provide a signal to build new power plants. This ignores the basic fact that there are huge barriers to new entry in PJM. Since new supply won’t be available for many years, high prices only serve to enrich the incumbent generators. Our proposal does not blunt needed economic signals but rather limits the deadweight loss from supply being unable to react to demand.

Our proposal puts risk where it belongs—on the data centers that are driving the need for large amounts of new generation. Data centers and utilities currently have little incentive to correctly forecast their needs, since any over-forecasting risk is paid for by the public. Once data centers have to BYOC, the forecast problem disappears entirely: Data center developers who need more power would have to build it without exposing anyone but themselves to the risk of unnecessary investment.

Data centers that don’t BYOC could still connect to the grid but might not be guaranteed power when supply is tight. Given the breakneck pace of data center demand, this is unavoidable. On the current path, PJM will have more demand than supply at some point in the next few years. That means that on challenging days (mostly during winter storms and summer heat waves), power cuts may be necessary. PJM understands this. It’s not a feature of our proposal; it’s a consequence of the laws of physics. Our proposal doesn’t change that reality—we wish it could—but it clarifies exactly how much power is at risk. Since states are ultimately in charge of deciding who gets shut off during emergencies, our proposal will let states plan in advance, helping them decide fairly if supply should be cut to data centers or the general public.

The BYOC concept not only protects regular consumers from rate hikes but also creates incentives for data center flexibility and gives them a clear and potentially fast path to firm service. The “capacity” in BYOC isn’t limited to new large power plants, which take years to construct. It also includes demand response programs that reduce energy during times when the grid is stressed; fast-to-construct distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar and batteries located closer to end-use customers; and imported power from neighboring power grids. Flexibility—the ability to reduce consumption at key times—could allow the grid to support many more data centers quickly. Under our proposal, data centers can monetize their flexibility by providing demand response to PJM, partially or fully satisfying their BYOC requirements at the same time. The proposal also opens the door to creative solutions: Data center owners could build new transmission lines to bring in power from other regions or fund energy efficiency in homes to free up power for their own use.

DERs, especially battery storage, can quickly meet data center needs while transforming PJM’s grid for the better. DERs have a critical advantage: They don’t have to go through PJM’s multiyear process to connect to the grid, so they can come online quickly enough to keep pace with data center construction. Using DERs, data centers could receive firm power supply three to five years sooner than building new gas-fired generation at a net cost that’s as little as 20–30 percent higher. Since DERs are still connected to a larger grid, battery storage would be used to support the overall system, not run the data center directly. Thanks to this advantage, data centers can meet BYOC requirements by installing enough batteries to run their facility for about eight hours. Most important, storage is a critical component of a low-carbon grid. If data centers build storage now, they create a clear path to zero-carbon energy for themselves and for substantial carbon reductions and reliability benefits for PJM as a whole.

The choice is clear: Ratepayers are on a path to spend more than $100 billion, unjustly enriching owners of old power plants while still facing blackouts, and not getting a system that supports new data centers. Instead, PJM should require data centers to make the investments they need to support themselves. This will discipline speculation, save the public vast amounts of money, and ultimately improve reliability for the data centers that need it while rewarding the ones that can be flexible.

Governor Shapiro called 2025 capacity prices “the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.” If we don’t reform how PJM supports new data centers, that will unfortunately be just the beginning.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-09/data-center-berwick-pennsylvania-25160495945570-rm.jpg?h=5da5b092&itok=gCuxmf7V,N,,2025-09-30 19:02:28.923349

Meanwhile, Trump’s ICE raid of a Hyundai EV battery plant under construction has delayed the project by up to three months.","Ford’s top boss is sounding the alarm on electric vehicles, warning that President Donald Trump’s policies are hurting the industry.

Speaking at the Ford Pro Accelerate conference in Detroit on Tuesday, CEO Jim Farley said he expects U.S. demand for EVs to shrink far more than automakers anticipated.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the US go down to 5%,” Farley told the audience, according to Bloomberg. Sales of EVs currently account for nearly 10% of the broader domestic market.

Farley’s warning comes as Trump, in his second term, has rolled out a string of policies aimed at the EV market. The biggest blow being the end of the federal $7,500 EV tax credit, which officially expired today. That incentive was scrapped under the administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that the looming deadline boosted sales temporarily. Jalopnik reports that 146,332 electric cars were sold in August, the highest monthly tally in U.S. history.

But the end of this subsidy isn’t the industry’s only hurdle. Earlier this year, Trump rolled back federal emissions standards and stripped states of the ability to set their own stricter rules. That move wiped out California and other states’ rules that would have required automakers to sell more zero-emission vehicles.

The EV industry isn’t just dealing with policy headwinds, either. Elon Musk’s growing unpopularity has turned off some buyers, potentially dragging down demand not only for Tesla but for EVs in general.

Meanwhile, Trump’s ICE raid of a Hyundai EV battery plant under construction has delayed the project by up to three months.

All of this turbulence has automakers rethinking their strategies. Some are delaying launches, while others are quietly shifting money back into internal combustion vehicles.

Nissan said in August it would further delay production of three new all-electric SUVs at its Mississippi facility, pushing the debut from 2025 all the way to 2028.

Honda also shelved plans for a large electric SUV that had been slated for 2027.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/F-150-Lightning_Mustang-Mach-E_3-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 18:03:05.164705

Founded in 1919, ENFRA is recognized for leading the EaaS (Energy-as-a-Service) revolution – a unique business model centered around exceptional asset management and collaborative client relationships. From operational management to maintenance, engineering, fabrication, and construction, ENFRA offers the full package, delivered with unparalleled customer satisfaction.

Today, ENFRA proudly holds a leading position within the EaaS and energy infrastructure sphere. With almost 3000 projects active at any given time and more than 20 long-term partnerships nationwide, ENFRA has guaranteed over $87 million in utility savings for customers each year and has no intention of slowing down. New Energy Today sits down with Rob Guthrie, ENFRA’s Chief Executive Officer, who provides a deep dive into the company’s history and heritage, as well as discussing the value of its unique EaaS model in terms of thought leadership, client satisfaction and the company’s role in the wider energy transition.

“ENFRA is one of the largest privately-owned energy infrastructure firms in North America. We started in southern Louisiana in 1919 as a plumbing contractor, so we’re now in our 106th year,” Rob begins. “We think of our story in chapters. The first chapter runs over the course of 95 years, from 1919 to 2014. We had different operating companies that formed at different points over those 95 years. Our electrical group was founded in 1945 in New Iberia, Louisiana, our mechanical group in 1957 in New Orleans, and our engineering group in 1995 in Little Rock, Arkansas. We eventually had five independently managed companies until we combined those entities in 2014, with the express intention of becoming the only vertically integrated energy service provider in North America.

“Chapter two involved proving our EaaS model to the market. Luckily for us, we had 95 years of operating history and a lot of deep relationships with previous customers, for whom we felt the model would make a lot of sense. We think of chapter two as a seven-year period ending when CVC DIF Capital Partners acquired a majority position in the company at the very end of 2021, which marked the beginning of our current chapter. We proved the EaaS concept in chapter two and the focus for chapter three is to scale. We’re now scaling this model from coast to coast, standardizing our processes and growing the concept.”

Whilst the company boasts an illustrious history full of innovation, experience, and expertise, the ‘ENFRA’ name is still quite new; up until May of this year, ENFRA’s customers and partners would’ve known the company as Bernhard. Marking a fresh new chapter for the company, the rebrand presents a bold new identity, one that’s representative of its continued market leadership in sustainable energy infrastructure solutions. Alongside the new name comes a new visual identity, a new logo and a new tagline: ‘Create. Sustain. Empower’.

Rob comments: “Our rebrand was completed on May 1st of 2025. The rebrand wasn’t a reaction to anything in our past; we did it more as a way of embracing the identity into which we’ve evolved. It was a future-facing decision, and the fact of the matter is that we’ve undergone more growth in the last ten years than most companies our age. To the outside world, it may have seemed like a sudden move, but for us, it was in the works for 18 months. I would say that it was executed seamlessly from our side; our team did a great job of bringing the rebrand to life.”

Though a relatively new business model, ENFRA is already proving the benefits of EaaS through its vast scope of capabilities and solutions. ENFRA’s services are driven by its ability to develop and optimize its customers’ assets by providing a fully integrated, turnkey solution that leverages all facets of the company’s diverse realm of expertise. The company delivers its mechanical, structural, and energy engineering services to the highest quality, sustaining the functionality of customers’ assets through dedicated management and maintenance. Rob elaborates on the structure of ENFRA’s EaaS model and the extra value added through its client-centric approach.

“EaaS is a broad term. Fundamentally, you’re transferring risk away from the customer to the vendor, and you’re generally converting CapEx to OpEx. You’re relieving the customer of the CapEx obligation by providing them access to assets 24/7, but it’s your responsibility to maintain those assets; it’s an opportunity for the customer to shed risk that many view as non-core,” he explains. “Our transaction has the same sort of skeleton that any service offering would have, but we bring to it the ability to monetize our customers’ infrastructure. That allows the customer to unlock the value of their assets, catalyzing design-build improvements and often lifting the customer’s liquidity metrics.

“We always guarantee that our improvements are going to yield a certain reduction in our customers’ energy demand and consumption, and it becomes our job to operate and maintain that infrastructure. We make sure to provide a tailored solution for our customers based on their own business conditions. Once we developed a unique solution that resonated with our customers, the next question was how to build the internal capacity to scale it effectively. We’re now landing on the other side of that journey. We’re continuing to grow and it’s really exciting.”

Aside from its comprehensive model, what truly sets ENFRA apart is its passion for customer service. Its expert team is on call 24/7 to keep customers’ assets protected, optimized and running at peak performance. Over the course of its 100-year tenure, one of the qualities that has helped ENFRA to triumph is its ability to continuously adapt to customer needs. A key component of this has been constant investment in new technologies and innovations; one of the most notable being its proprietary software, ENFRA Connect®.

“We pride ourselves on being relentless about the customer experience. It’s very ingrained in our culture that when the customer needs something, we’re responsive – no matter what time it is,” Rob says. “We have a software tool called ENFRA Connect® that is deployed across every plant. It produces regular reports on energy performance and detects faults, so customers know if anything in the plant needs to be repaired or optimized.”

With the global pursuit for clean energy solutions well underway, it’s clear that ENFRA will continue to play a vital role in the wider energy transition. Building on its existing legacy and stellar reputation, the company will remain a powerhouse for environmental good – all whilst empowering its customers in their own sustainability missions.

“We’re in the midst of a company-wide digital transformation, with a focus on building the right team and leveraging AI to strengthen our management foundation. At the same time, our top priority remains filling key positions and maintaining the capacity to deliver exceptional customer experiences. We’ve had tremendous success in recruiting new talent to ENFRA and we’re ahead of schedule in terms of our capacity planning,” Rob concludes.

“As the market leader in the US healthcare industry, our EaaS business is anchored by a loyal base of subscribers and continues to gain momentum. It’s becoming the centerpiece of our business, unlocking new opportunities for our legacy and more traditional business lines. Today, we’re in an aggressive growth phase, focused on strengthening customer relationships and expanding our reach, laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. It’s a very exciting time.”",https://energy-oil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/MAIN-12.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 18:03:29.623036

DETROIT, Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Prestone, the global leader in automotive fluids and an iconic brand under the PFX Group, has announced it will exhibit its Prestone EVX™ collection of electrified vehicle (EV and hybrid) thermal management fluids that meet newly implemented industry standards at The Battery Show North America, taking place October 6–9, 2025 in Detroit.

Engineered to help vehicle OEMs address the ever-increasing demands of EV charging time, driving range, safety and overall performance, Prestone's EVX™ formulations offer low conductivity, extended corrosion protection and excellent chemical stability for light-and-heavy-duty EVs. Having undergone rigorous real-world testing to ensure low-current levels for safety in high voltage applications, the fluids serve as the next generation of thermal management for electrified transportation.

Accelerated Standards Highlight Industry Impact

Prestone's EVX™ fluids were industry pioneers in being formulated to meet EV coolant specifications that are currently going into effect in China. Previously expected to take effect in 2026, the GB29743.2 standard will now begin starting October 1, 2025. The standard, which will likely be implemented globally within the next few years, is aimed at enhancing safety in EVs by reducing the electrical conductivity of coolants.

Prestone's EVX™ fluids not only meet the requirements for the GB29743.2 standard but also for the ASTM D8566 standard – which focuses on low electrical conductivity to minimize potential harm caused by coolant contacting batteries – helping automakers comply with and be prepared for vital requirements now, strengthening the company's role as a critical partner in the EV supply chain.

""Our technologies are designed not only to meet today's EV demands but to anticipate tomorrow's,"" said Tom Corrigan, Director of EV and Electrification Technology, Prestone. ""With China accelerating its adoption timeline, Prestone is prepared and well-positioned as an innovator and legacy supplier to provide solutions that enable our customers to achieve compliance, maintain performance and address the industry's biggest challenges.""

No Compromise on Safety with Proprietary Testing

EVs store a large amount of energy and operate at high voltages, ranging from 400 to 1000 volts. Managing this energy safely is critical to prevent short circuits and thermal runaway. To validate the performance of its EVX™ fluids, Prestone partnered with Exoes, a leading electromobility thermal management testing firm, to create a proprietary test that mimics real-world, high-voltage conditions to replicate extreme operating environments.

During the test, an 800-volt current is passed through fluid coolants. Conventional coolants, like those currently used in most North American EVs, combusted in less than one second. By contrast, Prestone EVX™ fluids maintained low current and prevented combustion entirely, leading to a safer fluid with a lower risk of shorting and thermal runaway.

Supporting Global EV Transition

As a factory-fill supplier of choice and frontrunner in automotive fluid research and development, Prestone currently supplies more than three million gallons per year of its current EV thermal management fluids to global vehicle OEMs. Using its ""Products, Production, Protection"" process, the company can support customers from formula technology to manufacturing to warranty service. The PFX Group as a whole, via its portfolio of brands, produces over one billion liters of industrial and mobility fluids annually, with a presence in more than 100 countries via its 20 production facilities, 14 warehouses, and seven innovation centers.

In addition to the automotive market, Prestone also supports the electrification of other markets such as mining, construction, and agriculture through its heavy duty focused Prestone Command EVX™ fluids.

The Investment and Policy Landscape Energy storage is no longer a niche sector.
According to Wood Mackenzie, the global storage market is expected to grow tenfold by 2030, representing hundreds of billions in new capital.
Storage isn’t just about enabling renewables—it’s about energy security.
Storage is the battlefield where the future of clean energy will be decided.","The story of energy in the Industrial Age has largely been about access to resources—first coal, then oil and gas. Today, that story is evolving. The next chapter isn’t about drilling fields, but about mastering the batteries and storage systems that can turn renewables into reliable power.

Wind and solar are now the fastest-growing sources of electricity on the planet. But their fundamental weakness is intermittency: the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. Without storage, a grid built on renewables risks volatility, blackouts, and underutilized assets. That’s why storage has become an essential enabler of the clean energy puzzle—and why a new kind of global arms race is underway.

Lithium-Ion’s Reign—and Its Limits

Lithium-ion batteries have powered most of the storage revolution to date. They dominate everything from home storage units to massive utility-scale projects, thanks to rapidly falling costs and widespread deployment. According to BloombergNEF, global battery storage capacity doubled in 2023, and most of that growth came from lithium-ion technology. Companies like Tesla, LG Energy Solution, and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) in China have driven this expansion.

But lithium-ion isn’t the endgame. The technology struggles to compete in ultra-long-duration applications, such as storing power for several days or weeks. The supply chain is heavily dependent on lithium, cobalt, and nickel, creating exposure to geopolitical risks and price volatility. Safety is another concern: lithium-ion carries fire risk, and recycling remains a challenge.

In short, lithium-ion remains indispensable, but it won’t be the sole solution to the storage challenge.

The Next Generation of Storage

The race is on to develop technologies that can go where lithium-ion cannot—delivering longer-duration, lower-cost, or safer performance. A few contenders stand out:

Flow Batteries. These systems store energy in liquid electrolytes housed in external tanks, making them easily scalable for long discharge times. Invinity Energy Systems and ESS Tech are at the forefront, developing vanadium flow batteries that can last for decades with minimal degradation.

Gravity-Based Systems. Energy Vault Holdingsis pioneering systems that use surplus electricity to hoist heavy blocks, then release them to generate power when demand rises. Gravitricity, a private UK-based company, is exploring underground shafts as an alternative. While still in early deployment, these projects are attracting significant investment as a potential long-duration solution.

Thermal Storage. Startups like Kraftblock are experimenting with storing energy as heat in materials like sand or molten salt. This approach could double as a source of industrial or residential heat, making it versatile for markets that need both electricity and thermal energy. On the utility scale, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is funding thermal storage projects tied to renewables in Europe.

Sodium-Ion Batteries. Sodium is abundant, cheap, and safe compared to lithium. China’s CATL has already unveiled a commercial sodium-ion battery. These batteries won’t replace lithium in EVs due to lower energy density, but they may be well-suited for stationary storage where size and weight matter less. But the path to commercialization is fraught with risk. Natron Energy, once a leading U.S. sodium-ion developer, entered liquidation this year after failing to secure UL certification and running out of cash—despite a $1.4 billion factory plan and $25 million in customer orders. It’s a stark reminder that technical promise doesn’t guarantee financial viability.

Each of these technologies is still in early stages, but the pace of innovation—and the capital flowing into it—suggests multiple winners could emerge.

The Investment and Policy Landscape

Energy storage is no longer a niche sector. It has become a magnet for global investment. According to Wood Mackenzie, the global storage market is expected to grow tenfold by 2030, representing hundreds of billions in new capital.

Governments are accelerating the race. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act created tax credits for storage deployment and domestic production, while the Department of Energy is funding demonstration projects for long-duration storage. Europe has rolled out similar incentives, and China remains the world’s largest backer of both lithium-ion and emerging chemistries.

This competition carries geopolitical weight. Just as the oil age was shaped by control over drilling rights and shipping lanes, the storage era will be influenced by who dominates mineral supply chains, manufacturing capacity, and intellectual property. The U.S. is striving to catch up with China, which today controls much of the global battery supply chain.

The Future Grid

The likely outcome isn’t one technology replacing another, but rather a hybrid grid. Lithium-ion batteries will continue to dominate short-duration storage. Flow batteries, thermal storage, and gravity systems could carve out niches in long-duration applications. Sodium-ion may become a middle ground for cheap, safe storage in stationary settings.

The stakes are high. Storage isn’t just about enabling renewables—it’s about energy security. Nations that can balance their grids without relying on imported fuels will enjoy a new degree of resilience. For investors, the payoff lies in identifying the technologies and companies that can scale economically while navigating policy support and supply chain risks.

Storage is the battlefield where the future of clean energy will be decided. It won’t be about who controls oil wells or gas pipelines, but about who can master the technologies that keep the lights on when the sun goes down and the wind stops blowing.

From boosting domestic energy production to cutting red tape and expanding access to natural resources, the BLM is ensuring that public lands support jobs, economic growth, and American Energy Dominance. Here’s a look at what the BLM accomplished in just the first nine months.

Policy

The BLM ended preferential treatment for wind and solar energy; implemented the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to boost U.S. energy production, timber development, and regulatory reforms; moved to update sage grouse plan amendments to balance habitat stewardship with expanded access for energy and mining development; advanced efforts to restore sensible multiple-use management by proposing to rescind the Public Lands Rule; and adopted 102 categorical exclusions from other agencies to streamline management of minerals, realty, forests, fire, wild horses and burros, recreation, wildlife, resource protection, and address emergencies.

Deregulation

To reduce red tape, promote mineral development, and support American energy independence, the BLM rolled back outdated rules that made it harder to develop resources on public lands. These changes helped cut costs, speed up permitting, and encourage job growth in energy and mining. By simplifying regulations, the BLM made it easier for businesses to operate while still protecting public lands.

Coal

The BLM administers coal leasing across 570 million acres of public lands which currently includes 273 federal coal leases encompassing 404,847 acres in 11 states. On September 29, the bureau announced the opening of 13.1 million more acres of federal land for coal leasing, tripling benchmarks set by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and delivering on President Trump’s directive to restore American Energy Dominance. Between Jan. 20 – Sept. 30, 2025, the BLM generated $47,002,288 during four sales offering 82.6 million tons of available federal coal across 15,920 acres at Freedom and Falkirk mines in North Dakota and two Warrior Met mines in Alabama; advanced coal lease sales offering a total of nearly 609 million tons of federal coal across 4,882 acres in Montana, Utah, and Wyoming; is considering potential updates to coal leasing in Montana and Wyoming’s Powder River Basin; announced the West Antelope III coal lease sale for 365 million tons of recoverable federal coal across 3,508 acres in Wyoming; proposed the BLM’s first coal exploration project nationally since 2019 at Muddy Creek Canyon in Utah; increased economic viability at five mines by approving royalty rate reductions in Colorado, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming; and rescinded former Interior Secretary Jewell's 2016 coal leasing moratorium; all in support of Secretary Doug Burgum’s efforts to restore the coal industry and President Trump’s executive orders to strengthen U.S. energy production and reinvigorate the coal industry.

Oil and Gas

Currently, there are more than 22.2 million acres of BLM-managed lands under lease for oil and gas development and production. Between Jan. 20 – Sept. 30, 2025, the BLM held 16 lease sales and generated over $187 million by leasing 206 parcels totaling 165,681 acres across 10 states (Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming). The BLM also took steps to unleash Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential and expand oil and gas development in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve; ended the requirement to prepare environmental impact statements for approximately 3,224 oil and gas leases across 3.5 million acres in seven Western states; streamlined the oil and gas leasing process on public lands; and updated rules for commingling, or combining oil or gas from multiple sources for more efficient measurement and processing, to align with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The BLM also approved 4,595 new oil and gas permits and has approved more Applications for Permits to Drill since January 20 than in any other fiscal year over the past 15 years.

Pipelines

In Montana, the BLM approved the 74-mile, 16-inch buried Helena to Three Forks natural gas pipeline. In Nevada, the BLM approved the 16-mile, 24-inch buried Pinyon Pipeline and associated facilities connecting the Ruby Pipeline to the Valmy Power Plant. In Idaho, the BLM approved the relocation and burial of a 1,500 foot, 6-inch natural gas pipeline beneath the Snake River near American Falls to meet increased industrial demand. In Utah, the BLM approved two, less than 1 mile, 12-inch surface Randlett to Aurora interconnect natural gas pipelines connecting existing wells to the Timberline Compressor Station; the 3.5-mile, 12-inch buried Park Mountain natural gas pipeline connecting existing pipelines to the Park Canyon Compressor; and the less than 1 mile, 16-inch buried Chapita Wells natural gas pipeline, a six-inch liquids pipeline, and a fiber optic line from the planned Green River Slug Catcher Facility to the existing Chipeta Processing Plant.

Transmission Lines

The BLM approved the 40-acre, 230-kilovolt Sapphire gen-tie in Chuckwalla Valley to deliver up to 117 megawatts of energy daily to Riverside County, California, and the 21-mile, 120-kilovolt New York Canyon gen-tie near Lovelock to deliver up to 20 megawatts of energy daily to Pershing County, Nevada.

Geothermal

The BLM generated $13,240,974 million by leasing 38 parcels totaling 103,236 acres in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Utah geothermal lease sales; implemented emergency permitting procedures; approved the 30-megawatt Crescent Valley geothermal project in Nevada and 20-megawatt Newcastle geothermal project in Utah; and approved expedited permitting for the McGinness Hills upgrade and expansion, and Diamond Flat and Pinto resource confirmation geothermal projects in Nevada.

Minerals

The BLM advanced five of the Trump Administration’s first FAST-41 critical mineral production projects. In Arizona, the BLM approved gold mining at Rogers Wash and mineral exploration at Copper Creek. In California, the BLM approved expanded limestone mining facilities at Chubbuck Mine; the Mesa Gold mining operation in Kern County; clinoptilolite exploration near Death Valley Junction; and recognized that the Colosseum Mine, on National Park Service managed lands, America’s second rare earth elements mine, can continue operations. In Idaho, the BLM approved expansion of the PDZ and Teague zeolite mines. In Missouri, the BLM approved 36 lease renewals for five active mines at Doe Run producing lead, zinc, and copper. In Montana, the BLM approved sapphire mining at McCune Bar near Hauser Lake. In Nevada, the BLM approved lithium exploration in Nye, Elko, and Esmeralda counties; gold mining at County Line, Ruby Hill, and Spring Valley; and gold exploration at Smoky Valley and for Gemfield Resources and Kinross Gold to explore near Goldfield. In Utah, BLM approved uranium and vanadium mining at Velvet-Wood and potash mining at Sevier Playa. In Wyoming, the BLM approved trona mining at Dry Creek and bentonite mining at Greasewood Creek.

Timber

More than 20 percent of BLM-managed lands are forest and woodland ecosystems, including 2.4 million acres in western Oregon of some of the most productive forests in the world. Between Jan. 20 – Sept. 30, 2025, the BLM held 44 sales offering 218,974 million board feet of timber across 13,277 public acres in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Wyoming. These advertised timber sales generated a total of $56,803,367; which was $9,088,566 above the cumulative appraised values. The BLM is also developing plans for additional timber sales to meet volume target increases of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Land Sales/Conveyances/Transfers

In Alaska, the BLM conveyed nearly 28,000 public acres to NANA Regional Corporation, bringing NANA’s total ANCSA entitlement to over 713,000 acres—now 96% complete. In Colorado, the BLM sold 31 public acres to Clifton County at fair market value under the Clifton Opportunities Now for Vibrant Economic Yields Act. In Nevada, the BLM sold eight parcels totaling about 42 acres in the Las Vegas Valley for $16,575,000 ($1,240,000 above fair market value) under SNPLMA. In Utah, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined state leaders to finalize the Emery County Land Exchange under the Dingell Act to transfer 47 water rights, 83,000 acres of sub-surface mineral estate, 4,000 surface-only acres, and 5,000 acres of mineral, oil, gas, and coal-only estate from the BLM to the state. The BLM also exchanged 929 public acres for 89 public acres in Washington County to support future water management.

Securing the Border

The BLM protected resources along the U.S.-Mexico border through withdrawals and transferred the lands for three years to the U.S. military for security operations. In April the BLM transferred 109,651 acres in New Mexico to the U.S. Army; and in Arizona the BLM transferred 285 acres in July and 203 acres in September to the U.S. Navy.

Recreation & Public Access

The BLM transferred 618 acres of small, isolated parcels within state parks to the State of Utah, consolidating ownership to improve visitor experience through more consistent management. BLM collaborated with the Foundation for America’s Public Lands(link is external) to fund 10 recreation and access projects in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming totaling $1 million of direct investments bringing in $4 million in matching funds from state recreation offices and similar partnerships. Projects include shooting ranges, campgrounds, trail heads, and accessibility improvements to enhance outdoor recreation for the American public. The BLM began implementing the EXPLORE Act in February, launching efforts across directorates and expanding staff to support the work. A dedicated “core team” was established to lead, coordinate, and track progress on each section of the act. Guidance for field offices and streamlined procedures are currently under review for key areas such as range access and special recreation permits, among others, to ensure the BLM meets upcoming legislative deadlines.

Fire

As DOI’s largest and most complex fire program, BLM Fire is responsible for fire protection on approximately 650 million acres. Since January 20, BLM has managed 2,093 fires across 910,000 acres burned. The BLM also treated 928,000 acres to reduce wildfire risk on America's public lands. Working alongside partners and in local communities, BLM firefighters tackle treatment projects using chemical, biological, manual, and mechanical methods, along with prescribed fire.

The Bureau of Land Management remains committed to delivering results that streamline processes, expand access, and ensures America’s public lands continue to serve the nation’s energy, economic, and strategic needs. With more work ahead, the BLM stands ready to continue implementing President Trump and Secretary Burgum’s multiple use agenda by managing public lands in a way that supports prosperity and security.",https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/2025-09/bentonite.jpg?h=5c2f2c4c&itok=1_QdlneV,N,,2025-09-30 17:04:09.491847

The Detroit News

(TNS)

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley on Tuesday said he wouldn’t be surprised if electric vehicle sales in the United States fall by half after the expiration of the federal tax credit for plug-in vehicles.

Tuesday is the last day consumers could take advantage of the up-to-$7,500 tax credit, though Ford and General Motors Co. have found a workaround to continue offering taxpayer-funded discounts beyond the deadline. But that won’t last forever, Farley said, and the impact of the end of the tax credit will be significant, especially with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered to roll back greenhouse gas emissions targets — opening opportunities for Ford in the mix of vehicles the automaker can sell.

“Customers are pesky,” Farley said at the Ford Pro Accelerate conference at Michigan Central promoting skilled trades, manufacturing and other “essential economy” jobs and sectors. “They surprise you. They definitely surprised us. Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. … I wouldn’t be surprised if the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5% of our industry from probably this month, 10%, 12%.”

Still, Farley confirmed a Reuters report that the company will transition consumers away from government support. GM and Ford rolled out programs to their dealers that had the companies’ financing arms purchase EVs in dealers’ inventory by making down payments on them, according to the report, which also was confirmed by spokespersons for the companies and documents provided to dealers. That means the discount can be offered on EV leases of existing stock into the fourth quarter.

“I don’t want to imply at all that those kind of programs, they’re going to last forever,” said Farley, who is particularly looking at where prices go moving forward. “No, it’s a transition.”

In a statement, Ford said it’s working to provide EV shoppers with competitive payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31.

Village Ford dealer Jim Seavitt in Dearborn, Michigan, said the program that runs through the end of the year will limit increases on leases of vehicles already in stock or in transit to $50 per month on the Mustang Mach-E and $60 to $70 per month on the F-150 Lightning.

“It’ll help me sell cars and prevents the payment from going through the roof,” said Seavitt, who sold nine Mach-Es on Monday alone.

Longer term, EVs still will have a market for short-run commuter vehicles, but that’s 5% to 7% of the market, Farley said. Dealer services company Cox Automotive Inc. forecasts sales of EVs during the third quarter will be up more than 21% from the same period a year ago. That would represent roughly 10% of U.S. sales, a record.

Although the halving of EVs sales is likely, Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at auto communications agency Telemetry, said it’s unlikely to endure. Upcoming launches like the Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt and Kia EV3 and EV4 will bring more affordable options to the market that haven’t been present, spurring demand.

“They’re going to be in that $30,000-ish, mid-$30,000 price range,” Abuelsamid said. “As we get those more affordable EV models that still have good, strong range, I think a lot of EV intenders will be taking a hard look at those vehicles.”

In contrast to EVs, Farley pointed to demand for hybrid F-150s that represent a third of the truck’s U.S. sales, offering consumers advantages like the the ability to power their home or equipment on a job site with their vehicle’s onboard generator.

“We have to make these partially electric vehicles in the factories that would have been EVs,” Farley said. “What we do with all the battery plants — we’ll fill them — but it will be more stress, because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy changed.”

Ford, however, hasn’t abandoned EVs. The company in August announced a $2 billion investment in Kentucky’s Louisville Assembly Plant to make a $30,000 midsize electric truck set to launch in 2027. Farley added that the U.S. market is in isolation, and Ford as a global company still must compete with EVs globally.

Farley’s remarks came as he was emphasizing the role of manufacturing, construction and other blue-collar industries in the economy. Ford and its charitable arm plan to invest more than $5 million for workforce development in skilled trades, manufacturing and other “essential economy” sectors.

Three hundred industry and government leaders gathered at Michigan Central to discuss policies and actions to address workforce shortages, regulations and a lack of productivity and innovation compared to other sectors. The challenges, presenters said, hinder infrastructure development and the ability to lower costs of goods and services — and Ford’s ability to sell its cash-cow pickup trucks and other commercial vehicles.

“We hear every day from our Pro customers that they are suffering from staffing issues, bureaucracy and lack of productivity,” Farley said. “It’s affecting Ford and our dealers; today, this morning, there’ll be 6,000 empty stalls in our dealerships — no technicians to work at them.”

As a part of the solutions offered, Ford and Ford Philanthropy said they will infuse funds for 2025-2026 to benefit more than 100,000 students and educators. That includes 15 Ford Future Builders Labs in Michigan and Tennessee to bring hands-on learning to K-12 students and a new partnership with SkillsUSA to expand advanced manufacturing and automotive programs to high school students.

A new Ford Philanthropy Advanced Manufacturing & Trade Scholarship also will cover training, tools and expenses for students pursuing careers in the skilled trades. In addition, the company will expand its Auto Tech Scholarship with TechForce Foundation, which has provided $7 million in financial support to 1,400 students since 2023.

Ford also is exploring with Bloomberg Philanthropies how to expand its model for encouraging skilled trades in high schools.

The Ford Essential Workforce Initiative also includes existing programs like the United Auto Workers-FordJoint Apprentice Program, nationwide auto tech recruiting and training partnerships, and FordPro services that emphasize productivity, including a new collaboration with software firm ServiceTitan.

“We have a lot of resources, but no single company, no organization (is) going to solve these issues alone,” Farley said.

Based on a report released last year with the Aspen Institute, Ford emphasized that there is a shortage of 600,000 workers in manufacturing and 500,000 unfilled construction jobs. Approval times for power-connection requests have more than doubled since the early 2000s, it noted. Additionally, it raised concerns about cut federal spending on workforce services and research and development.

But Farley said the real solution is going to happen at more local levels: within states, counties and school districts in partnership with business. Farley said other countries have invested to a greater extent for these positions. He recalled a trip to Germany where an apprentice had been learning skills at Ford since middle school.

“Ultimately, this is about the success of our country,” Farley said. “The problems in the essential economy are problems for all of us. They lead to inflation, higher housing costs, delays in projects, lack of opportunity.”

The challenges in the essential economy resulted in an “epiphany” for Farley in 2023 during the United Auto Workers strike, he said. He heard about entry-level workers having to work three jobs to support their families.

“The old timers in our plants were saying, ‘It’s no longer a career, Mr. Farley,’ ” he said. “ ‘Working at Ford is no longer a career.’ ”

The record contract that resulted from the walkout moved temporary workers to full-time within 90 days, and created a three-year path to top pay. That’s a package that puts UAW members at the “top of the pyramid,” Farley said, but the conference sought to address problems for small businesses that don’t have those kinds of opportunities and resources.

Other business leaders also addressed how they are navigating the challenges as well as how their size eases their ability to accomplish projects. U.S. Steel Corp. CEO David Burritt discussed how Nippon Steel Corp.’s acquisition of the manufacturer is infusing it with almost $11 billion to be invested by 2028.

“We’ve got to work to make sure this essential economy is elevated and make sure that we have the people ready to do the work,” Burritt said. “And that happens when we get the permitting process done very quickly. And we now have governors coming to us, competing for this $4 billion mini-mill that we’ll be developing, telling us they will fast-track the permits that we’re going through right now.”

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer highlighted efforts in her administration to make college more affordable and increase career and technical education programs in high schools. In particular, she noted the Future for Frontliners program that came from the COVID-19 pandemic and sought to help essential workers return to school

“I’ve met techs that hospitals have taken advantage of it, grocery store stockers have taken advantage of it,” she said.

Roger Penske, chairman of logistics company Penske Corp., said internal hiring has been an important way for the company to minimize turnover.

“We fill the funnel from the bottom, and I would say that 95% of our management upgrade come from internally,” he said. “We bring in people that maybe worked in a drugstore, and two years later, they’ve got a technician job in our place, making $70,000 because of the training where we bring them in. It’s been very, very productive for us.”",https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/electric-vehicle-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 17:02:32.961138

Frozen Funding

The funding was originally authorized as part of a sweeping infrastructure spending bill passed in 2021. In the early weeks of the Trump administration, however, federal transportation officials halted the allocation of that money.

A group of states sued over that move, and a federal judge this summer ordered the White House to release the congressionally approved funds. The Transportation Department announced in August that it would begin dispersing the money.

Covering Up to 80% of Costs

Kentucky officials said that the funding would cover up to 80% of the costs of constructing and operating EV fast-chargers. The state was originally set to receive nearly $70 million under the infrastructure bill; it will instead receive $17.8 million of the more than $32 million that was frozen.

Expanding Chargers to ""Priority Corridors”

Kentucky intends to use the money for the second and third phases of its EV plan, which aim to bolster charging infrastructure at popular destinations, in communities, and along “priority corridors.”

The state has opened five of 46 planned fast-chargers to date and has three more under construction.

Stella Qiu gives us a look at what the future holds for European and global markets. The U.S. Government has now entered its 15th government shutdown since 1981, and second under Donald Trump. He took the opportunity to threaten dismissal of more federal employees. The biggest federal exodus since 1980 is about to happen this week. Over 150,000 employees will be leaving the payroll after a buyout. The FAA will furlough about a quarter its staff during the shutdown, so if you are planning to fly in the U.S. soon, be aware. Trump's new tariffs will also go into effect on Wednesday. These include the tariffs on big trucks and patented drugs. The administration has stated that tariffs will be collected even if the government shuts off. All of this is set to increase concerns at the Federal Reserve over a slowing labour market. Investors bet that the Fed will cut rates this month despite the lack of economic information. Prices are 96% higher than they were just one day ago. S&P futures and Nasdaq Futures both fell 0.5% today - a small move given the rally in share markets this year. S&P 500 futures have averaged 12 gains, 9 losses and a median increase of 0.1% during the 21 previous shutdowns. This uncertainty has provided gold bulls with a good excuse to promote the idea of purchasing assets outside the control of the government, causing the metal to reach a new record of $3.875 per ounce. Silver and platinum have also been on an upswing. The Asian session has been mixed, as Chinese markets are closed for the National Day holiday. Japan's Nikkei fell 1% but Taiwan rose 1% and South Korea gained 0.8%. Investors are not frightened by the lack of data due to the shutdown, but they do worry about the data vacuum. There's no payrolls report for you to bet on. The ADP National Employment Report will be released later today. The forecasts predict a modest increase of 50,000 jobs in the private sector as the labour markets continues to cool. The JOLTS report released on Tuesday showed that hiring was weak. It is not clear whether this weakness is due to AI or tariffs, but it could be something longer-lasting. The euro zone's inflation data for September is expected to show an increase in inflation to 2.2%, up from the previous 2%. The risks could be on the upside, after German inflation was higher than expected. The hot number could indicate that the European Central Bank has likely finished easing in this cycle, and give a reason for going long on euros. The following are key developments that may influence the markets on Wednesday. Eurozone HICP Flash Inflation Readings for September -- ISM US Manufacturing survey ADP Private Payrolls

Gold hits record highs as US shutdown begins, stocks fall and stock prices decline

Wall Street futures fell, gold reached a record-high and Asian stocks wilted on Wednesday as the deadline for the U.S. Government shutdown passed. This is expected to delay release of important jobs data and cloud the interest rate outlook. The government shutdown has no way out. Agencies warned that there was no clear solution. It would prevent the release of an employment report for September, which is closely watched. This would also lead to the furloughing of 750,000 federal employees at a cost of $400,000,000 per day. S&P 500 and Nasdaq Futures both fell by 0.5%. Gold prices rose to $3,875 per ounce in the third consecutive session, reaching a new record high. European futures were largely unchanged. Investors may give greater weight to the ADP National Employment Report, due later today. Forecasts predict a modest increase of 50,000 jobs in the private sector. ""Typically, a shut down is not important for the markets. The 2018-2019 shutdown lasted over a full month and actually led to a rise in Wall Street, according to Kyle Rodda. Rodda said that the markets face two issues. The first is the delayed release of non-farm payroll data. He said that the other issue is that ""U.S. president Trump has also threatened permanently to lay-off employees, which could turn this shutdown into a small labour market shock."" The Federal Reserve is now expected to cut rates in October by 96%, up from 90% a day ago, and there's a 74% chance that they will do so again in December. Anthony Saglimbene is the chief market strategist for Ameriprise. He said that if shutdown continues, inflation reports from September could be affected by mid-October. He said that a prolonged period in which the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics was not fully operational could impact data collection efforts and the quality of data for other reports. The Nikkei 225 index of Japan fell over 1% on Wednesday after a 11% increase in the previous quarter. South Korean shares increased by 0.6% to add to the 11.5% gains in the previous quarter. Data showed that exports in September rose at their fastest rate in 14 months. Taiwan's stocks gained 1.3%. The island's chief tariff negotiator stated on Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept a deal to have half of all semiconductor production take place in Washington. Chinese markets are closed, including Hong Kong. Overnight Wall Street closed the quarter in a positive way, with a higher closing price. The data showed that U.S. employment declined in August, while job openings were marginally higher. Consumer confidence also fell more than expected. The dollar index on the foreign exchange market held steady at 97.84 after three consecutive days of losses. It was unchanged at 147.98, with little reaction to a Bank of Japan report showing that Japanese companies expect prices to increase by an average of 2.4% per year in the future, which is above the 2% central bank target. Asia's Treasury yields remained stable. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield in the U.S. was unchanged at 4,1561% after rising 1 basis point overnight. After two days of declines, oil prices stabilized on Wednesday as investors weighed the possibility of OPEC+ plans to increase output next month with the shrinking U.S. inventories. U.S. crude climbed 0.1% to $62.46 per barrel while Brent rose 0.2% to $66.16.

Fears of sanctions stymie Russian panda bond sales in China

Sources said that Russian companies' plans for low-cost financing through China's massive bond market are not working because Chinese investors and banks avoid them due to concerns over Western sanctions. The conundrum shows how difficult it is for Russian companies to raise capital in a country which has been an ally since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine over three years ago. Beijing, which is seeking a deal with Washington while also forging a partnership with Russia - a relationship that is said to have no limits - is being put to the test. Last month, sources at top Russian companies including the state-owned nuclear corporation Rosatom, and the giant gas concern Gazprom reported that they were exploring the sale of ""panda bonds"" denominated in yuan. The announcement came shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to China in early September. Since the Ukraine invasion, Russian companies are no longer able to access the capital markets of the West. Chinese investors and bankers, however, dismissed the prospect of a panda bond issue by Russian companies in the near future. A person with knowledge of the situation said that banks and regulators were concerned about secondary sanctions. The person said, ""Preparation is always underway, but it's just impossible to push the project ahead,"" citing the lack of progress in the panda bonds issuance by Rosatom and Russian aluminum producer Rusal over the last year. Rusal declined comment. Rosatom declined to comment, despite the fact that its top management was sanctioned by the U.S. Gazprom did not reply to a comment request. The company cannot raise finance in the U.S., Europe, or Canada, but it has not been subjected to U.S. blockade sanctions, known as SDN List. The official of a Chinese securities exchange said that he did not know of any concrete plans for issuance by Russian companies. Several Chinese bond investors also said they were wary about buying such debt because of the geopolitical risk. The five sources that were interviewed for this article declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the subject. First source: China's state owned brokerages, such as Galaxy Securities, have stopped doing deals with Russia after 2022. The ""Big Four"" banks of the state are also unwilling to do such deals due to geopolitical issues. Galaxy has not responded to a request for comment sent via email. Zhan Kai of Yuanda China Law Offices in Shanghai said that there was no legal barrier to Russian companies issuing panda bond as long as they were not listed on the U.S. sanction list. Zhan, a Chinese company advisor who helps Chinese firms avoid sanctions and manage risks, said: ""It is clear that local traders and bankers are concerned about acting as underwriters and buyers."" He said that the market will ultimately determine whether or not a Russian bond is sold. ""I don't anticipate a lot appetite in China"" to buy Russian bonds, he added. Requests for comments were not responded to by the China Securities Regulatory Commission or the People's Bank of China. YUAN BORROWINGS ARE CHEAPER S&P Global reported that 35 offshore companies raised 116 billion Yuan ($16.3 billion), after raising 194.8 billion yuan last year. This was the highest volume since the data began to be available in 2015. Since the conflict in Ukraine 2022, no Russian companies have issued debt on China's panda bond markets of 342 billion yuan. Rusal was the only Russian company to sell panda bond in China before Russia's troops invaded Ukraine in 2016. The Chinese rating agency CSCI Pengyuan assigned to Gazprom a ""triple A"" rating in early September, indicating a very low default risk and paving its way for its yuan bonds issuance. According to a Moscow fund manager who declined his name, the Russian rouble's borrowing rates are high. They range from 15%-16% per year. So issuing Yuan bonds would be a good way to obtain cheap capital. Comparatively, in July a Chinese BMW unit sold a panda-bond with a coupon of 1.73%. According to a Russian official, there's nothing stopping Russian companies issuing panda bonds as long as demand exists. ""Large corporations work with their own placements."" ""We only assist them with infrastructure and solutions,"" said the official. He added that the question is now who will purchase them in China where banks fear secondary sanctions. A manager at a Chinese state owned company, who declined to give his name, revealed that some Russian companies are desperate to find low-cost financing and are willing to restructure their loans through a commodities deal. Kirill Lysenko of the Russian rating agency Expert RA said that issuing panda bond by Russian companies could take many years. Geopolitical risks exist even within the framework of a ""friendly nation"". He said that if sanctions were to impact China's financial infrastructure, debt servicing would become more complicated. $1 = 7.1979 Chinese Yuan Renminbi (Reporting from Shanghai and Hong Kong Newsrooms, Anastasia Lyrchikova in Moscow, Oksana Kobieva in Singapore and Rae Wee at Rae Wee; Editing done by Sumeet Chatterjee & Muralikumar Aantharaman).

Bankers: Vedanta Resources unit priced $500 mln bond below initial guidance

Two merchant bankers reported on Wednesday that a Vedanta subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vedanta Resource, has accepted bids for bonds with a seven-year maturity in U.S. dollars worth $500 million. The bankers said that Vedanta Resource Finance II would pay an annual coupon below its initial price guide of 9.50% after receiving bids totaling over $2.2 billion. CreditSights, however, sees the fair price of the bond as 9.22%. This is based on a relative value comparison of existing debt from December 2031 and March 2033 with similar bond structures and comparable returns. The issue will include a call option after two years. Proceeds will be used to pay off a private loan facility. The remaining funds will be used for other debts as well as general corporate purposes. Moody's has rated the offering B2 and Fitch Ratings B+. The company didn't respond to an email asking for comment. Bankers asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak with the media. The company has issued a second dollar bond in 2025. In January, it raised $1.10 billion through five-year-and-six-months bonds at 9.4750% and eight-year-and-three-months bonds at 9.85%. The demand for dollar bonds issued by Indian companies has increased in recent weeks, following the rating upgrade of mid-August by S&P Global. This upgrade helped to improve the credit profile of the country. The State Bank of India's bond sale of $500 million dollars attracted favorable pricing, which encouraged more companies to tap the international market. Vedanta will guarantee the latest issue. The issue will be unconditionally guaranteed by other subsidiaries including Twin Star Holdings and Vedanta Holdings Maritius II. (Reporting and editing by Ronojoy Mazumdar; Dharamraj Dhutia)

Gold reaches record highs on US shutdown fears and rate-cut betting

Gold reached a new record on Wednesday, as investors flocked to safe-haven investments amid growing concerns about a U.S. shutdown. Meanwhile, weaker labour statistics boosted expectations for further Federal Reserve interest rate reductions. By 0206 GMT, spot gold had risen 0.4% to $3872.87 an ounce. U.S. Gold Futures for December Delivery gained 0.7%, reaching $3,901.40. Dollar-priced Gold is now more affordable to overseas buyers thanks to the dollar index. Nicholas Frappell is the global head of institutional market at ABC Refinery. He said that gold was benefitting from ""concerns about a weaker US dollar and the political situation in the U.S. with the standoff over a government shut down and also the general geopolitical uncertainties"". The U.S. Senate has failed to pass legislation extending funding for the government, pushing it closer to a possible shutdown. President Donald Trump also threatened further federal staff cuts. The shutdown may delay the release Friday of important economic data including the non-farm employment report. The JOLTS report released on Tuesday showed a marginal increase in U.S. jobs openings for August. This was accompanied by a decrease in hiring. These results indicate softer labour market conditions. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, traders priced in a 97% probability of a 25 basis-point cut this month, and a 76% likelihood in December. ADP's National Employment Report is due to be released later today and should provide more insight into the labour markets. Michael Hsueh of Deutsche Bank, precious metals analyst said that it was difficult to predict an end to the gold rally. Due to its low-interest rate nature, gold, which is a traditional hedge for economic and political uncertainties, thrives. It has risen by more than 47% in the past year. Silver spot also rose 1.5%, to $47.39 an ounce. This is a record high for more than 14 years. Palladium rose 0.9% to $1,267.75, while platinum gained 1.4% at $1,595.85.

In a ruling from the bench today, Judge Mustafa Kasubhai granted a motion for summary judgment Raoul and a multistate coalition filed, concluding that the DOE’s policy violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The policy would have slashed reimbursements for staffing and administrative costs and threatened millions of dollars for essential energy programs.

“Improving energy efficiency by increasing clean energy is good for the environment, state economies and our workers,” Raoul said. “The Department of Energy’s cap on indirect and employee benefit costs would severely jeopardize programs that are essential to states’ efforts to modernize and improve energy grid efficiency, and I appreciate the judge finding that the cap is unlawful.”

Article continues after sponsor message

Last month, Attorney General Raoul joined a coalition of 18 states in a lawsuit to block the DOE’s attempt to cap reimbursement for basic administrative and staffing costs of federally funded, state-run programs. The DOE’s policy attempted to cap these “indirect” costs at 10% of a project’s budget, regardless of previously negotiated rates. Indirect costs have never been subject to a cap, and Raoul and the states argued that DOE’s cap violated federal law, disregarded states’ negotiated rates, and would undermine staffing and operations at state energy agencies. Today, Judge Kasubhai sided with the states, finding the funding cap to be illegal and a violation of the reimbursement regulations for DOE grants.

In Illinois, the new cost cap would have endangered long-running programs promoting energy resiliency and efficiency. These programs include the Public Water Infrastructure Energy Efficiency Assessment Program, which helps publicly held water treatment facilities conserve energy and reduce costs for customers, and energy code training for homebuilders, contractors, architects and others in the construction industry to ensure that renovations and new building projects meet the newest efficiency standards. It would have also jeopardized the state’s ability to invest in the Illinois Clean Energy Innovation Fund, a revolving loan fund that supports the development of emerging technologies that enhance grid reliability, resilience and modernization.

By financing lighting replacements, the PPLEEF on-bill financing program can help women-owned businesses lower their costs and become more competitive.
Financing Lighting Replacements in Senegal The PPLEEF program became a reality thanks to a loan from the African Development Bank and the Canada-African Development Bank Climate Fund.","At the 2024 UN Climate Change Conference (COP29), the African Union, which encompasses most of Africa’s nations, embraced energy efficiency with vigor. It launched the African Energy Efficiency Programme and the African Energy Efficiency Alliance, and certified the African Energy Efficiency Strategy (AfEES) to promote energy-efficient practices across the continent in multiple sectors, including buildings, transportation, and cooking. These practices have the potential to reduce energy poverty and lower greenhouse gas emissions significantly.

As the African population continues to grow, urbanize, and gain increased access to electricity, energy consumption on the continent could double by 2050. Implementing energy efficiency measures in households and businesses can help reduce energy consumption and prevent the need for new power plants. By implementing building energy upgrades (e.g., efficient appliances, lighting, and cooling systems), African countries could collectively save as much as 175 terawatt-hours and avoid building over 80 new 500-megawatt power plants by 2040. Building fewer power plants would save money and keep carbon emissions in check, as approximately 75% of electricity generation in Africa currently comes from fossil fuels.

As part of these energy-saving efforts and to increase access to affordable energy, the African Development Bank launched the Programme to Promote Efficient Lighting Lamps (PPLEEF) in Senegal, the westernmost country in West Africa, to spur the replacement of incandescent lights with high-efficiency LED lights. The bank is helping Senegal implement the African Union’s energy efficiency strategy. While Senegal has committed to phasing out incandescent lights and has banned imports and production of such bulbs since 2020, many are still being used by families and businesses. By replacing outdated and inefficient incandescent lighting with more efficient LED lighting on a massive scale, Senegal aims to reduce its electricity consumption by 126.8 MW by 2030.

A key element of the PPLEEF program is its on-bill financing mechanism, which allows households and participants to repay the replacement costs of their bulbs on their utility bills over time, without incurring upfront costs. On-bill financing is an innovative approach to financing energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades over time, using the energy savings generated by the upgrades to offset the costs. Cost-effective energy upgrades can save households money, even after the repayment costs are deducted.

Additionally, on-bill financing programs can expand access for women, who often have limited access to commercial financing and credit, hindering their ability to install energy-efficient technologies and reduce energy consumption for their small businesses. By financing lighting replacements, the PPLEEF on-bill financing program can help women-owned businesses lower their costs and become more competitive.

“We believe that the on-bill financing scheme is one of the best options to secure wider participation in the program, reach the maximum number of end users, bring more comfort for investors through a ‘secured repayment,’ and provide better financing conditions, notably monthly settlements where the savings will pay the initial investment,” said Jalel Chabchoub, chief investment officer at the African Development Bank.

Financing Lighting Replacements in Senegal

The PPLEEF program became a reality thanks to a loan from the African Development Bank and the Canada-African Development Bank Climate Fund. The African Development Bank funded the program with an investment of 8.51 million euros ($10.1 million), marking the first time the bank has made a financial commitment to energy efficiency upgrades and invested in a demand-side energy efficiency program. By leveraging additional funds from Senegal’s government, the PPLEEF program will procure 4.3 million LEDs. Total costs for the program are estimated at €12.7 million ($13.37 million), which includes marketing costs, labor, and setting up a recycling facility for disposing of used incandescent lights.

The program is available to more than 700,000 households and 80,000 small businesses in the Dakar, Thiès, and Diourbel regions. Starting the program in these regions makes sense as they are the most populated—with 8 million inhabitants—and industrialized (the region of Dakar is home to Senegal’s capital of the same name).

Investing in energy efficiency helps Senegal meet its international and national climate commitments, as outlined in its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement on combating climate change. The energy-efficient lighting program also contributes to several international sustainability goals, including increasing access to affordable and sustainable energy (Sustainable Development Goal 7), achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls (Sustainable Development Goal 5), and urgently combating climate change (Sustainable Development Goal 13).

“Establishing the on-bill financing program for lighting equipment is the initial step toward expanding to other efficient appliances, notably refrigerators, air conditioners, fans, solar water heaters, and solar panels,” said Chabchoub. “We expect to receive additional funding to include other energy-efficient appliances and to expand this program to other countries across Africa.”",,N,,2025-09-30 17:01:55.149775

The failure to avoid a shutdown creates an unstable environment for businesses, threatening everything from daily operations to long-term investment.

A shutdown would trigger immediate challenges across several key sectors. Michigan’s health care providers face a potential telehealth cliff, as the pandemic-era rules that expanded virtual care could lapse, disrupting services for Medicare beneficiaries, especially in rural areas. The real estate market could see significant delays, with a potential lapse in the National Flood Insurance Program threatening to halt approximately 1,300 property closings nationwide each day. Furthermore, a shutdown would furlough the vast majority of Environmental Protection Agency employees, halting environmental permit processing and stalling projects across the state.

Beyond the immediate disruptions, the proposed funding bills include provisions that are inherently counterproductive to business interests and economic development. The proposed 30% reduction to the Department of Labor’s budget would halve the funding for the Job Corps, severely impacting workforce development programs that businesses rely on for skilled talent. Similarly, a proposed $264 million cut to the Commerce Department would limit resources for the International Trade Administration and the Economic Development Administration, which are crucial for helping Michigan businesses expand and attracting new investment.

These cuts, combined with a proposed $12 billion reduction for the Department of Education, threaten to undermine the educational foundation necessary for a robust, long-term talent pipeline.

A shutdown’s impact on consumer confidence could slow spending and create a ripple effect across the entire economy. Michigan businesses need stability and predictability from the federal government to invest, hire, and grow.

Like mission control at a space launch, a Zap operator checks with her teammates one-by-one to ensure the systems are ready. One engineer oversees capacitors stored in black shipping containers that charge from the grid and send a massive energy surge to the fusion reactor. Another verifies the silvery liquid metal cooling the reactor core is circulating properly. Each component must play its role on cue.

“Starting sequence, and three, two, one.”

“Charging.”

Outside the room one hears the successful “thump” of the plasma firing, followed by a flash of purple-hued light.

Zap is one of four fusion companies in the Pacific Northwest and roughly 45 worldwide that are doggedly working to do what’s never been done before: replicate on Earth the reactions that power the sun and the stars in pursuit of clean, nearly limitless electricity.

Earlier this year, the Everett, Wash.-based company hit a new milestone, creating more than 1,000 consecutive plasmas — the state of matter required for fusion — over three hours. Since then, Zap’s Century system has delivered more than 10,000 plasma-forming shots under different configurations. On a recent tour of the site, the engineers demonstrated the technology for a small group of journalists.

Each run provides a little more data, nudging the science another step closer to the goal of capturing “a star in a jar,” as Ben Levitt, Zap’s vice president of R&D, describes the reaction.

‘A tame lightning bolt’

The concept of fusion energy is simple enough. Reactors generate ion-containing plasmas that are sufficiently hot, dense, and long lasting to create conditions in which atoms that don’t want to combine are forced together and release energy. But physicists have spent decades trying to create fusion and produce more power than is required to run the devices, and no one knows if or when it will be accomplished.

Despite the long-standing uncertainty, skyrocketing demand for electricity to fuel data centers and AI operations has stoked interest in the clean power source and billions of dollars have flowed into the sector in recent years.

Fusion has attracted investments from deep pockets in the tech sector, including Chris Sacca’s Lowercarbon Capital and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures investing in Zap, while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is backing Helion Energy, also located in Everett.

Physicists are chasing fusion with different kinds of reactors using high-powered magnets and lasers to create and hold plasmas. Zap’s solution is to run a super high current through the plasma in its reactor, which produces a magnetic field that compresses the matter.

“This is literally a tame lightning bolt,” said Matthew Thompson, Zap’s vice president of systems engineering.

In truth, it’s even more intense — the current inside the plasma is cranked up 20 times higher than a bolt of lightning.

The Zap team touts its approach as more affordable and scalable than other strategies given that it has a much smaller footprint than most. Its reactor chamber is about the size of a hot water heater and doesn’t require ultra-complex magnets and lasers.

“It’s this so-called self-organized plasma structure which confines itself with its own magnetic field,” Levitt said. “And it makes its own magnetic field just when it needs it, for those few microseconds, and then it goes away.”

Parallel tracks for progress

Zap launched in 2017 with research out of the University of Washington. It has raised $330 million from investors and $13 million in U.S. Department of Energy grants. Zap’s headcount totals 150.

Its R&D approach is two-pronged, with part of the team working on improving the plasma and fusion reactors while the other works on integrating the other components needed to produce the power for the reactors and capture the energy generated by fusion to put it on the grid.

“These are parallel efforts,” said Levitt. “It’s getting the plant technology ready while we perfect the plasma performance.”

The company commissioned Century in 2024 and has already increased 20-fold the average power it can deliver to the system for plasma creation, reaching 39 kilowatts. The next target is 100 kilowatts, then 1 megawatt, with a commercial-scale system requiring 10 megawatts.

Speed is another challenge. Century initially fired one plasma shot every 10 seconds, and has since doubled that rate. But the progress needs to be exponential, not linear.

“Ultimately, for a power plant, you’re going to need to do that [shot] 10 times a second, so much faster,” Levitt said. “But we’re not worrying about that right now.”",https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PXL_20250925_221744467-1260x945.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 17:01:58.758602

At the time, Republicans said that ending the subsidies would save taxpayers money and force these industries to stand on their own without government help.

The Southeast, in particular, has attracted many EV and battery manufacturing projects with companies announcing billions in investment and thousands of proposed jobs in the Carolinas in the wake of the incentives promised in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

With many of those incentives set to sunset earlier than initially anticipated, a report from Atlas Public Policy and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy shows a mixed bag when it comes to the future of industry.

Projects, including the Toyota battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina, are up and running and the massive Scout Motors facility in Blythewood, South Carolina, is still on schedule for 2027 operations but is adding a hybrid option along with its EV models.

Other projects, including the VinFast battery facility in Chatham County, have been delayed and a Gigafactory in Florence has been canceled. This means thousands of anticipated jobs are either in limbo or will never come to fruition.

""We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-Revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America’s going to fall in love with.","September 30 is the last day for the $7,500 EV tax credit in the United States, though some car companies have found a loophole to use it a bit longer. This also happens to be the day of Ford's Accelerate conference taking place in Detroit. Spearheaded by Ford, the conference features a who's who of business leaders basically talking shop about how to help the so-called essential economy – tradespeople and blue-collar workers primarily – survive and thrive for the future.

Ford sells a lot of vehicles to this segment, but company CEO Jim Farley's comments on electrification caught our attention. He opened the event, then sat down for an interview with David Westin from Bloomberg, during which he discussed everything from tariffs to the company's initial steps with EVs and a brief take on the future of electrification.

Surprise: People Don't Want Expensive EVs

Farley has previously stated that big, heavy, expensive EVs don't make sense. But it was apparently a lesson the company learned a bit late in the game. Noting that customers can be ""pesky"" when it comes to technology, he admitted that Ford vastly overestimated the EV market.

""They definitely surprised us. Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting; they’re fast, they’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.""

– Jim Farley, Ford CEO

What they are interested in, according to Farley, are smaller EVs aimed at urban and suburban life where commutes are relatively short. Such vehicles don't need big batteries compared to large pickup trucks and SUVs, thus lowering the sticker price considerably. But, considering full-size pickup trucks are the best-selling vehicles in America by far, it means the EV market won't be nearly as robust as Ford initially envisioned.

""That’s maybe five, six, seven percent of the new vehicle industry,"" explained Farley. ""So I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought.""

Ford Is Betting Big On Hybrids And Extended-Range EVs

While EVs aren't hitting like Ford hoped, Farley believes hybrids will roll in to save the day.

""We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-Revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America’s going to fall in love with. Or already is falling in love with. ""

– Jim Farley

There's some terrific irony in his statement, however. Presently, Ford is very light when it comes to hybrid vehicles. The Maverick and Escape are offered with standard hybrid powertrains, and the Escape is also available as a plug-in hybrid. However, the Escape is headed out the door – it will end production in 2026, and it's already not available in some locations. The company has no other plug-in options, leaving the Maverick and the F-150 its sole hybrid vehicles for the US. Ford doesn't break out its F-Series truck sales by trim, but Farley says the F-150 hybrid is extremely popular.

Planning For The Future Isn't Easy

Getting more hybrids in the lineup means revamping previous EV plans and retooling those factories for hybrid production. In August, Ford announced its plan to build a new $30,000 electric pickup with a scheduled debut for 2027. Details weren't revealed, but it rides on a new universal EV platform that we expect will offer some kind of range-extended engine as an option at least. Ford has said the truck will have more interior space than a Toyota RAV4 and be as fast as an EcoBoost Mustang. But as we've seen in recent months, plans can change almost overnight depending on tariffs, emissions, and political posturing.

""We got rid of $7,500, the EPA rules are completely different than they were six months ago, it looks like,"" said Farley. ""And that will put more pressure on the essential economy. What I mean by that is, we have to make these partial electric vehicles in the factories that would’ve been EVs. We’re going to have to find a place; what we do with all the battery plants. And we’ll fill them. But it will be more stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy changed. It means Ford, our construction companies, we all have to make adjustments. And it’s going to be good for the country, I believe. But it will be one more stress on the supply side.""",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ford-f-150-lightning-platinum.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-30 16:03:10.851684

The estimate is based on the 45Q tax credit, a federal program that pays companies $85 per metric ton of carbon dioxide captured and stored from industrial and power facilities.

According to project data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project, at least 17 announced projects in Louisiana’s chemical, refining, and liquified natural gas sectors would qualify under the “industry and power” and ""direct air capture"" category of the credit.

In total, those 17 projects are estimating that some 42 million tons of carbon dioxide would be captured, either for storage or to be reused in other industrial projects.

The data lists a total of 43 carbon capture and storage projects and 10 pipelines that will function to transport captured carbon. Twenty-two of the projects listed include regional “hubs,” an infrastructural network that “takes carbon dioxide from several emitting sources, such as heavy industries and power, and then transports and stores it using common infrastructure,” according to the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative.

The 45Q incentive applies once a qualifying project either locks captured carbon underground in approved geological sites – such as saline formations or depleted oil and gas reservoirs – or puts the carbon to work as an input for making low-carbon fuels, chemicals, or construction materials.

The 45Q credit was strengthened in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and reaffirmed this summer in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump. Prior to the act, the maximum tax credit available for carbon oxides that were permanently sequestered through EOR projects or other utilization methods was $60 per ton.

Some of the largest projects carry the biggest potential payouts.

For the Ascension Clean Energy Facility in Ascension Parish, a projected capacity to capture 12 million tons annually could generate over $1 billion per year in tax credits.

For the Air Products Darrow Blue Energy Facility in Ascension Parish and the St. Rose Blue Ammonia Facility in St. Charles Parish, each could receive about $425 million annually.

G2 Net-Zero Energy Complex in Cameron Parish would be eligible for roughly $340 million per year.

Several other ammonia, methanol, and LNG facilities – including Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex, Cameron LNG Facility, and CF Industries/Mitsui Gulf Coast Blue Ammonia Plant – would qualify for between $85 million and $170 million annually.

The Blazer brings the total number of EVs in the City’s entire fleet to 16. Data maintained by the City's Equipment Division shows EVs are cheaper to operate and maintain than their gas-powered equivalents and, with no tailpipe emissions, are beneficial to the City's air quality.

The City’s Climate Action and Adaptation Plan calls for expanding the use of EVs as a key strategy in lowering greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. A study of the City’s fleet of municipal vehicles completed in 2024 identified suitable EV models that could be incorporated in the Police Department fleet, including patrol vehicles.

Kircher said a lot of that extra energy demand comes from heating homes — especially in colder parts of the country like the Midwest.
Indiana residents can apply for money from the state to help make their homes more energy efficient through Indiana's home energy rebate program.
Electric utilities could install software to better coordinate when their customers charge EVs or pre-heat their homes — offering incentives for people who participate in the program.
""Utilities make money, contrary to popular belief, not primarily by selling energy but actually by building infrastructure,"" he said.","Switching to electric home appliances and cars can reduce pollution and help you save money over time. But all of that new electricity demand could strain the power grid — leading to blackouts or the need for expensive power lines and other infrastructure.

A study by Purdue University looked into strategies that can help. Kevin Kircher is an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue. He said if we don’t address the energy demand from electrification now, it could limit how many people go electric in the future.

“Utilities build more and more power lines and transformers — and that costs a lot of money — and they pass those costs on to ratepayers. And then that basically reduces the incentive, the economic case for continuing to electrify because electricity gets more expensive,"" Kircher said.

Kircher said a lot of that extra energy demand comes from heating homes — especially in colder parts of the country like the Midwest. Homeowners looking to switch to electric heating can help lower demand by buying a more efficient geothermal heat pump, instead of an air-source heat pump.

“Rather than absorbing energy from the outdoor air, it absorbs energy from the ground. So if you go down even maybe 10 feet underground, you find that the temperatures are much more stable and much higher, even in the middle of winter, than they are in the outdoor air,"" Kircher said.

Indiana residents can apply for money from the state to help make their homes more energy efficient through Indiana's home energy rebate program.

Cities could also build more multi-family homes — like apartments and townhouses — that don’t take as much energy to heat.

Coordinating appliances to run at times when the electricity demand is lower can also help. For residents, that might look like waiting to do laundry until later in the evening or scheduling their electric vehicles to charge overnight.

Electric utilities could install software to better coordinate when their customers charge EVs or pre-heat their homes — offering incentives for people who participate in the program.

Kircher said right now there isn't much incentive for utilities to make energy efficiency improvements.

""Utilities make money, contrary to popular belief, not primarily by selling energy but actually by building infrastructure,"" he said. ""So if utility spends a million dollars putting in new transformers and power lines, then they're able to take essentially $100,000 of additional profit every year for many years to come. So their kind of inherent incentive is to build stuff and energy efficiency really flies in the face of that incentive.""

Kircher said that's why it's important for the public to get involved with their utility and utility regulators like the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

The New Clean Vehicle Credit, Previously-Owned Clean Vehicle Credit, and Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit are not available for vehicles acquired after Sept. 30, 2025.

According to the IRS, taxpayers can demonstrate acquisition by entering into a binding written contract and making a payment on the vehicle on or before Sept. 30, 2025. A vehicle is placed in service when you take possession of the vehicle.

""With the EV tax credit deadline today, consumers are hurrying to buy eligible vehicles to lock in the savings, dealerships are working hard to move inventory and manage this temporary surge in demand,"" said Mike Mader, Baker Tilly's dealership industry practice leader. ""After Sept. 30, we expect a drop in activity before the market normalizes again. For the long term, though, this isn't the end of the EV story — technology will keep improving, charging infrastructure will expand and interest in EVs will continue to grow well beyond this deadline.""",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/402a90f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+247/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F70%2Ff9%2F5e315ceb4e1cbb8b62906fe2f1ae%2F309722074-1-8.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:03:02.846828

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, delivered opening remarks in today’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on reducing crime and making communities safer for all Americans. As President Trump has continuously threatened to deploy troops to Chicago, Durbin requested a hearing to examine the harms of military deployment to cities. While today’s hearing was politically reframed to blame “blue cities” for Republican refusals to support effective solutions to gun violence and to glamourize the Trump Administration’s illegal and unconstitutional deployment of the military to American cities, Durbin underscored that the President continues to engage in political theater rather than prioritize serious policymaking that would address violent crime.

In his opening statement, Durbin discredited the Trump Administration’s narrative that violent crime is rampant in blue cities. Durbin emphasized that, as crime rates have dropped in cities like Chicago, Republican-led cities like Shreveport, Louisiana, see a higher violent crime rate than Washington, D.C.

After delivering his opening remarks, Durbin introduced the two minority witness – Gregory Jackson, Jr., and Major General William L. Enyart. Mr. Jackson is the President of the Rocket Foundation, an organization founded in 2022 that centers on ending the gun violence epidemic. A gun violence survivor himself, Mr. Jackson previously served as Deputy Director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention under the Biden Administration.

Major General William L. Enyart is a retired member of the U.S. Air Force and Army National Guard. His nearly 36-year military career included active-duty service in the Air Force and nearly 30 years in the Army National Guard. His service culminated as Adjutant General of the Illinois National Guard from 2007 to 2012. He previously served as a Brigadier General and Deputy Commanding General of the Illinois Army National Guard.

Key Quotes:

“This is such a political hearing, and it shouldn’t be. What’s at stake here is something that we all value. That is the safety of our families, homes and neighborhoods. I regret that you have reframed this hearing to focus on ‘blue city chaos.’”

“Violent crime is on the decline, but statistics don’t mean much to victims… Any crime is too much crime, and every American deserves to feel safe. So, we should be working together on a bipartisan basis, which we have done over and over again in this Committee, to continue reducing crime and making our communities safer for all Americans.”

“Let’s look at the reality. For the last two decades, the murder rate in my home state of Illinois has been lower than the murder rates in Missouri, Louisiana, and Alabama—all states represented by Republicans on this Committee.”

“In 2023, Illinois spent $516 per capita on policing – more than the states of Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Missouri, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Alabama.”

“In Chicago, over the first six months of the year, homicide rates are down 32 percent, [and] shootings have dropped 37 percent. We need to build on this success, not ignore it.”

“During my time as Chair, I held more than a dozen hearings on reducing violent crime. We focused on legislation, not lamentation. I reported numerous bills supporting law enforcement that were signed into law by President Biden, including the Protecting America’s First Responders Act and the Recruit and Retain Act. And we passed the historic Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to crack down on gun violence.”

“Instead of political theater and partisan attacks, we should focus on proven efforts like the Heal Initiative, a project I launched in 2018 with ten of Chicago’s largest hospitals to address the root causes of violence in 18 Chicago’s neighborhoods with the highest rates of violence, poverty, and health disparities.”

“Unfortunately, President Trump has done everything he can to undermine efforts like this. He cut $169 million from community safety funding authorized by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He cut $72 million in funding for state and local law enforcement. The 2026 Trump Budget would slash the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program – better known as HIDTA – by more than a third, from about $300 million to $196 million.”

“While President Trump claims to be tough on crime, he granted full and unconditional pardons to nearly 1,600 January 6 rioters, including more than 600 charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.”

“Here’s the reality. President Trump isn’t interested in reducing crime. He is interested in political posturing. 100 troops into the city of Chicago. Did you hear the announcement this morning by the Secretary of Defense? One of the characteristics he insists on when it comes to building a strong military is that it be apolitical. His word – apolitical.”

“The President has deployed thousands of American troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and made disturbing threats to wage war against Chicago, Portland, and other American cities.”

“Let’s be clear: these are illegal, unconstitutional, and un-American power grabs by the President that actually endanger Americans. President Trump is looking for any excuse to send soldiers into American communities so he can play the role of strongman on TV.”

“In Illinois, his misguided mass deportation [scheme] is targeting communities, but it’s not making them safer. Remember the litany that we heard, over and over again, about immigrants to this country? [The President claimed immigrants are] rapists, murderers, terrorists, the criminally insane. Did you know that 70 percent of the immigrants detained so far by the President have no criminal convictions?”

“The Administration’s main focus seems to be photo ops for social media, like these pictures from downtown Chicago of armed masked men, which just happen to feature the Trump Tower in the background. Just yesterday, we learned the Department of Homeland Security requested the deployment of 100 military personnel to Illinois over the objections of the governor. Simply put, despite what the Secretary of Defense said at Quantico this morning, the President’s use of the military to police American streets is political theater staged for his MAGA supporters, not effective law enforcement aimed at making communities safer.”

“Meanwhile, thousands of FBI, DEA, and ATF agents, as well as thousands of service members across this country, have been diverted from critical missions to carry out the President’s immigration agenda. Not surprisingly, federal drug prosecutions this year have dropped to the lowest [level] in decades.”

“We need to support law enforcement and policies that improve—not erode—trust between them and our communities.”

“As Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will not sit idly by while this President tramples the Constitution. And I will use every tool at my disposal to reduce crime and protect our communities—in a lawful way that promotes lasting change.”

Daniel Raimi: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I'm your host, Daniel Raimi. Today, we talk with Tom Moerenhout, a professor at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and leader of the critical minerals initiative at Columbia's Center on Global Energy Policy.

Recently, the US Department of Defense announced a major investment into a private company to increase production, processing, and manufacturing related to domestic rare earth elements. Building up domestic supply chains for these elements (which are crucial for defense, energy, and other sectors) has been a bipartisan goal for years. But this move marks a new and unprecedented approach for how the US government is looking to secure rare earth supply chains in the years and decades ahead.

In today's conversation, Tom will help us understand the rationale for the investment, its potential benefits and risks, and whether it's a one-off or the beginning of something bigger. Stay with us.

All right, Tom Moerenhout from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, welcome to Resources Radio.

Tom Moerenhout: Thank you for having me.

Daniel Raimi: We're thrilled to have you. I'm really excited about this conversation. It's a topic that we've never really dug into before because I don't know if it's really ever happened before—which is the US Department of Defense investing directly in a mine in the United States. I'll ask you about the precedence of this action, but before we get into the details, Can you let us know just how you became interested in working on energy or environmental topics?

Tom Moerenhout: Yeah, sure. So very early on, I got interested in environmental issues. I'm from a small village in Belgium, where there was a big factory historically linked to a lot of asbestos and pollution, and which was very energy intensive, as well.

So, in that classic village, and I think the United States knows these types of stories, where a lot of labor in the village is linked to the factory, but there are environmental consequences there. And from there on, I just ended up working a lot on hard-to-abate sectors. This is what I was interested in as a very nerdy teenager.

And then, later on, I went to study energy and environment and spent quite a bit of time in resource-rich countries. That's how I ultimately tumbled into the critical minerals, extractive sectors, and sustainability issues around them.

Daniel Raimi: That's really interesting. What did the factory produce?

Tom Moerenhout: They produced building materials. They were very much linked to asbestos in the past. Even today, they still produce building materials.

Daniel Raimi: Interesting. So, the factory is still running?

Tom Moerenhout: It's still operational. Yeah, absolutely. Right next to the canal where I swam in as a kid and came out with some weird-colored skin and so forth, so really that type of story.

A lot of empathy for the difficulty that some of those manufacturing sectors are going through, but at the same time an understanding (or a feasible understanding) of some of the environmental consequences that go with manufacturing.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, that's really interesting. Well, I feel like I could interview you just about your childhood and the factory, but we'll move along and get into our main conversation about rare earths.

We've talked about rare earth elements before on the show, but can you just remind us briefly, What are they? How are they distinct from this broader concept of critical minerals? And then help us understand how rare earths specifically are used in the energy and defense sectors.

Tom Moerenhout: Yeah, absolutely. So, rare earths is a combination term. It's actually 17 different elements that are rare earth elements. What those rare earths are most important for are magnets.

That's sort of the application that they're most known for, especially permanent magnets. If you want to create permanent magnets that are highly important for whatever kinetic energy you want to translate into electrical energy, or vice versa.

So, wind turbines producing electricity, or batteries producing movement in electric vehicles, that's what rare earth elements are very important for—to improve their efficiency and to improve their resistance to demagnetization. Imagine you just want a really, really good magnet, that's what you need rare earths for. In the defense sector, they're also often used within missiles, airplane technology, fighter jets, and so forth. And these rare earths, they really improve your product.

Again, they improve the electrical and magnetic properties, but also others. Without them, you just don't get as solid a product. What's often interesting, and I think sometimes maybe a bit misunderstood of rare earths, is you don't need a lot of them. You actually need a very small amount, but that small amount. So it's not even that costly, but that small amount is hyper-, hyper-important to the efficiency in the performance of your final products. So, it can be wind turbines, electric vehicles, missiles, missile defense systems, and so forth.

Daniel Raimi: That's really interesting. Maybe this is getting beyond your area of expertise, but when you say improve the performance of the product (I'm imagining a missile that's going to shoot somewhere), What is the aspect of performance that the rare earths would play a particularly important role in? Would it be like the precision of the guidance system? Would it be something else?

Tom Moerenhout: It's definitely the precision system, and often they can also be used as sort of catalysts. So, specific rare earths applications where they're used as catalysts for different things can be auto refinery and defense systems, to improve the efficiency of a process that is going on within these systems.

Imagine you have a missile, and you have magnets that are operating within that missile. Missiles get very, very warm. They are exposed to the elements, and there are other magnetic influences happening around them, such as lots of electricity and lots of high temperatures going on. So the ability to screw up your magnet is very high, and this is what rare earths protect against.

Daniel Raimi: That's really interesting. Many of our listeners probably have a sense of the answer to this question, but can you give us just a quick reminder, Where do most of the rare earths that get used in the United States—where do they come from? And why does that raise concerns for policymakers?

Tom Moerenhout: Basically, the United States is a very heavy importer of rare earths, and it's not just the United States of America; it's the whole world. We import most of them from China right now, and within rare earths—and I don't want to go too technical, but basically—you have two types of rare earths: You've got the heavy rare earths, and you've got the light rare earths.

In both, China is absolutely dominant, period. But for the heavy rare earths, which is the stuff that you need more for defense applications, China just has basically a 100 percent monopoly. So, for heavy rare earths, the United States is fully reliant on China.

For some of the other ones, the lighter rare earths, it's a little bit different. The United States is also a producer itself—the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine is something we can talk about later on. But in addition to that, the United States also imports lighter rare earths from China and other countries abroad, but especially China.

To understand that import reliance, you need to sort of understand how the rare earths supply chain works. And I'm at risk now of boring your listeners too much, but it's kind of interesting.

Daniel Raimi: No, this is great. Let us know.

Tom Moerenhout: You get them out of the ground, and they're all kind of stuck together. As I mentioned, they're sort of 17 compounds and you can kind of distinguish them into big groups—these heavy and these light rare earths.

They come out stuck together. So it's not just about extracting them, which is already—number one—is difficult to do. And, number two, you get a lot of waste involved, as well, so there are challenges there.

But once you get them out of the ground, you need to separate them, so that you have every element of those 17 rare earths separately. Because if you're going to put it into a specific magnet, or if you're going to put it into a missile system, or whatever it is, you need to have a very specific combination of rare earths. So, you need to be able to separate them. And that separation process—that is very complicated to do, that's actually high-tech stuff.

Daniel Raimi: And that separation process leads to lots of waste, right?

Tom Moerenhout: A lot of waste, yeah. And we are talking about the worst type of waste, including radioactive waste and so forth.

And this is something that China currently has a monopoly over. That's not only because it's dirty, but because it is quite a complicated process, and they're just better at it than any other country right now in the world.

Daniel Raimi: Really interesting. You just mentioned the Mountain Pass mine in California. Tell us a little bit more about the Mountain Pass mine. And specifically, the reason that we wanted to talk to you on the show is because the Department of Defense in the United States has made this major investment into the mine itself. So, tell us about the mine and what the Department of Defense is trying to accomplish by investing in it.

Tom Moerenhout: Yeah, absolutely. So basically, the Mountain Pass mine is the only operational rare earth mine in the United States of America. It used to produce rare earths a long time ago. And then, in the 1990s and the 2000s, a lot of that activity was outsourced to China. And eventually, that mine went bankrupt. It was restarted a couple of years ago, and they're the only producer of rare earths—mostly those light rare earths—in the United States.

So, the stuff that you can use for permanent magnets, but more in the direction of wind turbines and electric vehicles and maybe a little bit less the defense applications where you have these super-high temperatures that require a bit more of heavy rare earths. Anyway, Mountain Pass produces that.

Now, as we just mentioned, in the rare earth supply chain, what often happened with Mountain Pass was that they extracted the rare earths and then they actually sent them to China for separation, and for processing, and refining, and so forth.Then, the United States would reimport these processed elements, or magnets, from China.

Now, one of the things that the United States wanted to do, of course, was become more self-reliant, and I think that's a very good objective to have.

So, what we have is the United States actually exports the rare earths to China, where they are separated and where they are processed, and refined, and sometimes they're already turned into magnets. And then, the United States reimports that material, either the final magnets or the refined rare earths.

The goal here of the administration was, “No, we want to do that more domestically.” And the timing of the deal is interesting because the timing of the deal comes at a moment when two things overlap.

The first one is the Trump administration and the Biden administration before that wanting more self-reliance for rare earths, which is a good thing.

The second thing was the Trump tariffs and China’s retaliation during that trade war meant that the Mountain Pass was not really able to export to China anymore. This brought the Mountain Pass facility into very difficult waters as they just lost their biggest client.

Those two things together meant that something had to happen. And so the Trump administration saw a very good moment where a deal was both good to achieve that self-reliance, and at the same time necessary because here there was a threat of potentially Mountain Pass going bankrupt again. And the government clearly said, “We're not going to let it come that far.” That was smart.

So in response to those two drivers, the government made a deal that we haven't seen before. It includes an equity investment, it includes an offtake agreement for the rare earths, it includes an offtake agreement for the final magnet. So, it's really a deal that focuses on trying to create a homegrown United States mine-to-magnet supply chain.

Daniel Raimi: Does that mean that this investment will enable the company to build some of those separation and processing facilities? Or will they still need to export the kind of raw material somewhere to get it processed?

Tom Moerenhout: An excellent question.The goal for the separation is indeed that it would start happening in the United States as well.

So basically there were four big deals in the MP [Materials] deal.

The first one was critically important as sort of an equity investment. The government decided they were going to put 400 million into shares and stocks, and were going to become a co-owner of MP Materials—the company operating the Mountain Pass mine.

The second one was the price floor for rare earths oxides. And so that already shows it has been mined and it has gone through the first stages of processing.Today, the price is very low because China produces so much, and so many people have said China produces so much to actually lower the competitiveness of other countries. And so the government here said, “Actually, we're going to offer a floor price for 10 years to the rare earths that are produced at Mountain Pass.” So, very good.

The third one, which is kind of similar, is kind of an off-take guarantee. The government is going to be buying your magnets at the end of the supply chain.

And then part of the deal, which we'll still need to see more details on, is that this loan also supports the expansion of that separation process we were talking about.

Daniel Raimi: Interesting. Do we know yet whether those facilities would be built sort of at the mine site? Or could they be built in some other place?

Tom Moerenhout: So, part of that is being built at the mine site. A big magnet facility is actually being built in Texas, but the mine site is in California. So some of the separation will be done there, and the magnet production will be done in Texas.

Daniel Raimi: Really interesting. So, we've talked about this a little bit, Is there precedent for this sort of public investment in the mining sector? We've been talking about industrial strategy a lot over the last four to six years in the United States, but this seems to me to be really taking it a step further. Do you see it that way?

Tom Moerenhout: Oh, it's absolutely a step further. Now, there's two things that I think are very important to highlight here.

Number one, this is as ambitious as industrial policy can get. This is the government coming in (actually more coming out swinging) and saying to China, “We're going to protect this. This is going to work, and we are offering all of these four different elements.” It's sort of maximalist in scope. Each one of those would've gotten a crazy amount of attention as well, because each one of those would've almost been unprecedented in the last 10 to 20 years. And now all four of them came together.

The size of this deal was just something that you see and you're just impressed by since it's going to be expensive. Maybe it wasn't all necessary, but it very clearly shows the US government standing up and saying, “This is going to work, period.” And so, in terms of precedent, we hadn't seen this in the last couple of years.

Now, the second thing that I think is important to point out is that this was not born out of nowhere. Some officials in the Biden administration were already looking at how to put something like this, sort of that floor price and contracts for difference, together. We're not going to go in on specifics, but they were already trying to investigate what type of legal authorities they could use to have a system like this.

And what the Trump administration did was kind of turn it on its head. They said, “We need this. We're committing to it, to MP Materials, and then we'll figure out afterwards how we are exactly going to fund this, and where the legal authority is going to come from.”

So Biden’s folks were already very interested in and were looking at this. I'm not saying it would be the same deal, but part of this deal might've been happening with the Biden administration as well.

To Trump’s folks, their prioritization of their objectives is very sound with respect to rare earths. And they just said, “Look, let's just get this done, period.” The moment is here, and it is necessary for MP Materials to survive as well. It is happening right now, and it's happening big.

Daniel Raimi: Really interesting. This kind of fits a pattern with the Trump administration, which is that, in some cases, they take a major step and then worry about the legalities of the action later. Is there any sort of legal risk to this strategy where someone could sue them and say, “No, US government, you don't have the authority to do this,” and it could put some kind of wrench in the works?

Tom Moerenhout: So, it's a good question. I think you're asking the wrong guy, I do not have exactly much of a legal background here. What I will say is that the move had tremendous bipartisan support.

There are several critical minerals where realities are more difficult than rare earths. Rare earths are hyper-important, they're not that costly, and China is just monopolizing that sector. All the elements are there to basically have broad-based public and political support. I think that's why the deal was generally praised, even though some people have rightly asked the question, “Was all of this necessary?” since it seems very expensive.

If you're going to do this for several other critical minerals, there's going to be questions about cost efficiency. And these are good questions, we need to engage with them, but with respect to whether the agreement could be challenged legally, I'm not a hundred percent sure.

Daniel Raimi: That makes sense. So, you've mentioned a couple of times this distinction between lighter rare earths and heavier rare earths, and that the Mountain Pass mine is primarily a producer of the lighter kind.

Does that mean that the United States, regardless of what happens with this Mountain Pass effort, will remain heavily reliant on China for those heavier rare earths? Or do you think this is the first step into a multipronged effort where the United States is trying to take control of the full spectrum of rare earths supply chains?

Tom Moerenhout: I'll give my own opinion, which is probably somewhat limited as well, but whether you have light rare earths or heavy rare earths actually depends on the type of rock you have.

In East Asia, you have a lot of very good deposits with a lot of heavy rare earths. We have that less in the United States, but we have much more light rare earths concentrations.

It's kind of funny, rare earths are not called rare earths because they're rare—ou have them absolutely everywhere. Rare earths are called rare because the concentrations are low. If you want to extract something economically, you need a higher concentration because you need to make money. And so the United States has that for light rare earths, just much less for heavy rare earths. What we have seen with the deal, and now with MP Materials saying this as well, they are going to work on their ability to produce heavy rare earths.

There's some other companies in the United States that are working on heavy rare earth supply as well. I think that is very good, but the truth is that the rock that you're working with is just less good than the rock that China has to extract rare earths from.

The good element is that China is not the only one who's got access to heavy rare earth deposits, Brazil has that as well. So, Brazil could be a very interesting partner for the United States because it could help us secure a greater supply chain of all types of rare earths—including both light and heavy rare earths.

Right now, Trump’s administration is threatening to slap a very hefty tariff on Brazil because they don't like what's happening with former President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, and these are not exactly the type of conversations or political dynamics that encourage collaboration.

But in time, the United States will realize that there is a cost curve, and that it's going to be very expensive and difficult to produce heavy rare earths at scale. The United States will probably be starting to cooperate with other countries around the world, and I think Brazil is going to be an important one of them.

Daniel Raimi: That's really interesting. It makes me wonder about the extent to which we actually understand the subsurface resources for rare earths in the United States.

I remember when Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum was in his early days in office, one of the things he said was that, “We’re going to map, baby, map,” which I kind of liked. It suggested to me that there were maybe opportunities for economical resources that we just aren't aware of yet, and that new mapping technologies (maybe using generative AI or other technologies) could actually help us discover stuff that we didn't know we have. Do you think there's much possibility there?

Tom Moerenhout: Oh, you're hitting the nail on the head. I think there's a whole lot of possibilities out there with respect to exploration. I think what people often get wrong about exploration is that it sounds so self-evident. Okay, you're going to explore, check what's under the ground to know what concentrations you have, and so forth. But it's not self-evident at all, and exploration is basically losing money.

You lose money because the only time you can make up money is if you hit a good deposit and develop it. But some companies, especially western mining companies right now, are in a difficult moment. Prices are quite low and there’s heavy competition from China, so they are struggling. The first thing that they are going to do is not drop a ton of money in exploration because, again, exploration is a sector (or part of the sector) where you just lose money.

So you need public support, which I think is very evident in China, for example. For the last couple of years, they have spent billions and billions of dollars on public investment in critical mineral exploration from the government. We don't do investment at that level yet.

So when we say “Map, baby, map,” this is absolutely what we need to do. And as a society, and as sort of a political system as well, we need to accept that we're going to invest and not make back all of that money. Some of that is going to be lost forever, but you have to be willing to do that to actually get to the deposits that allow you to diversify your supply chains.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, that’s really interesting. So obviously the US Department of Defense is taking a financial risk here, the US government is taking a risk. If everything goes well, the government will presumably earn some kind of return, gain access to more domestic rare earths, and enhance supply chain resiliency. What are some of the big downside risks you see? Is it just the money we're talking about, or are there other downside risks?

Tom Moerenhout: I think there's two. So yes, there is the financial risk. They're putting in money and a price floor for the minerals, and I think that's a good thing. Actually, it's more than the price floor—it’s a contract for difference, meaning that if the price goes above what the government has offered, the government is going to recuperate part of that money.

So that's actually a good thing since they're really helping the financial position of MP Materials here by managing that risk. I think they've done that well, though they're paying a lot and are taking a risk.

For example, MP Materials wants to do mine-to-magnet production, but the company actually has very little experience in magnet manufacturing. Within the United States, they're definitely a very important company doing and working on that, but they're still constructing their first big facility for magnet production.

The deal is already helping to set up a second facility. Normally, if the private market operates the way it does, you would actually first check the results of that first facility and see if they have the appropriate personnel, economics, and so forth before investing in more facilities. I, for one, actually think it's good that the government is taking that risk, I'll be honest about that. I think we need that, and we really need a diversification of supply chains with respect to magnets. However, there is a financial risk.

The second part (which worries me a little bit more) is that if something does not work out, there could be huge political backlash. That's exactly what we had with Solyndra, which was a solar panel manufacturer that the Obama administration armed with some subsidies, and then it went bankrupt.

Now, we learned a lot from Solyndra. There were some things that went wrong with Solyndra, but it was also politically abused and used to undermine any type of public investment into renewable energy manufacturing. And 10 years later, I think we are regretting that because China is dominating all of the supply chains, and the United States’ position has gone from bad to worse every other year.

Let’s say this MP deal does not work out, or they struggle to actually reach their operational targets and so forth. I hope that, politically speaking, we have the conversation of how we should rethink industrial policy rather than thinking we should have never done this in the first place. That's the second risk, which I hope both political parties have a more mature conversation about than they have had about this type of issue in the last 20 years.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking with Solyndra and solar. There's clearly not equal levels of support for the solar industry across the different parties, whereas for rare earths supply chains, there seems to be more agreement that this is a goal that the government should be investing in.

Tom Moerenhout: I think so too. They could have done one of those four parts in the deal, but they did it all. So they really came out strong, and I think the goal is to really make this work at whatever cost, which is maybe not the worst way of thinking about rare earths. I actually think it's a pretty sound strategy.

Daniel Raimi: Really interesting. Well, Tom Moerenhout, again from Columbia University and the Center on Global Energy Policy. It's been a fascinating conversation. I've learned a ton, and I'm sure our listeners have too.

I'd love to ask you now the same question we ask all of our guests at the end of each episode, which is to recommend something that you think is great. It could be related to rare earths, energy, or something else entirely. It could be something you've read, watched, or heard. So Tom, What's at the top of your literal or your metaphorical reading stack?

Tom Moerenhout: What I would recommend to anybody is to look into two cases that I think are sort of indicative of why we need to do industrial policy better, and why we need to think about critical minerals in maybe a different way.

The first one that I want to say is A123. A123 was a company that was working on a specific battery chemistry that, back in the day, was novel and created in the United States. There were some problems with it, and it wasn't the best battery chemistry. The government thought of supporting it, but decided not to. Eventually, A123 patents were brought (or the control over those were brought) to China, and currently it's the biggest and second most important battery chemistry in the world. This is a result of a failure in our industrial policy.So, I think that's a very interesting standpoint.

The second one that I think would be good for people to read about a little bit more is a critical minerals case study. There's one paper, and I think it's very good. It's by one of our competitors—the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies— and it looks specifically at how China developed its industrial policy around critical materials over the years, which I think is absolutely fantastic as well.

Daniel Raimi: Really interesting. Well one more time, Tom Moerenhout from the Center on Global Energy Policy, thank you so much for joining us on Resources Radio. It's been a great conversation.

Tom Moerenhout: Super. Thank you very much.

Farley predicted the share of zero-emission vehicles could decline by half, according to a Bloomberg report. ZEVs currently account for 10% of the domestic market.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%,” Farley said at a conference in Detroit, as reported by Bloomberg. The CEO, however, said the company is looking to add hybrid production to its battery and EV plants, the report noted.

Ford shares traded 1% lower on Tuesday afternoon at the time of writing. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around the stock stayed within the ‘bullish’ territory, while message volume stayed at ‘high’ levels.

In the second quarter, Ford’s EV segment, known as Model e, saw its operating loss widen to $1.3 billion, pressured by tariffs and ramp-up costs at its new battery plant in Marshall, Michigan.

Ford’s current EV lineup in the U.S. is comprised of just three vehicles: the F-150 Lightning pickup truck, the Mustang Mach-E SUV, and the E-Transit van. This year, through the end of August, the company sold a cumulative 57,888 units of the three models, marking a drop of about 6% from the corresponding period last year, despite a 5.5% increase in internal combustion engine vehicles.

Ford stated last month that it plans to introduce a new group of affordable electric vehicles starting in 2027 to expand its EV lineup. The first in line would be a midsize pickup truck assembled at Ford’s Louisville Assembly Plant with an expected starting price of $30,000, the company added.

F stock is up by about 21% this year and by about 13% over the past 12 months.

Image for illustrative purposes

Belgium, Brussels: The European Union has launched a $638 M (€545 M) funding package aimed at expanding electricity access and accelerating Africa’s clean energy transition. The support will go to projects in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique and Somalia.

Currently, 600 million people across Africa still lack access to electricity. The EU says investments in renewables could help create up to 38 million green jobs by 2030.

In Côte d’Ivoire, $422 M (€359.4 M) will finance a high-voltage transmission project to strengthen regional energy distribution. Cameroon will receive $69.3 M (€59.1 M) for rural electrification, while $53.4 M (€45.5 M) in Somalia will support affordable renewable access. Smaller allocations include $4.1 M (€3.5 M) for the Republic of Congo, aimed at expanding solar, wind and hydropower.

Lesotho’s Renewable Lesotho initiative will benefit from $30.4 M (€25.9 M) to develop hydro and wind resources. Ghana is set to receive $2.3 M (€2 M) to prepare a large-scale solar park and improve energy trade, while Madagascar will use $38.9 M (€33.2 M) to extend rural electrification through mini-grids. In Mozambique, $15.2 M (€13 M) will back a low-emission transition and encourage private sector participation.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the package in a video message to the Global Citizen Festival, held alongside the UN General Assembly.

Previous research from 2024 found the IRA reduced electricity prices by 6% nationwide in 2030.
However, for the eight clean energy leadership states, the household savings from the IRA were estimated to be an average $55.
“A clean energy pathway results in other economic changes, including an employment profile that differs from fossil fuel dependence,” the authors said.
In addition, electricity prices from clean energy also face less uncertainty from exposure to volatile fossil gas prices.","States that lack clean energy leadership and policies such as renewable energy portfolio standards are expected to see the highest electricity hikes resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) early removal, modeling from the Resources for the Future found.

Resources for the Future explored the potential introduction of a price on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the electricity sector at the state level via a cap or limit on power sector emissions sources, and coupling that price with a policy to direct program revenues to reduce residential electricity rates. They then examined implementing this policy in eight states that are clean energy leaders and have previously pursued clean energy policies such as renewable portfolio standards, but do not currently have carbon pricing in place. These states included Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Carolina.

In the eight states they modeled, Resources for the Future found a 3% reduction in electricity prices in 2030 if the IRA were fully in place. Comparatively, other states with a heavier fossil fuel portfolio would have realized overall greater reductions in electricity prices had the IRA been fully implemented instead of reversed. Previous research from 2024 found the IRA reduced electricity prices by 6% nationwide in 2030.

In the absence of the IRA and without using any of the revenue for rebates, or investments in renewable energy or energy efficiency, Resources for the Future found electricity prices in all states to increase by an average of 9%.

Resources for the Future found that returning the revenue collected across the sector to residential ratepayers to address electricity affordability concerns for households would reduce electricity prices by an average of 6%.

“This reduction equates to twice the savings that would have been realized on average by full implementation of the IRA in this set of states,” Resources of the Future said.

However, Resources for the Future said while using carbon proceeds to directly reduce electricity rates clearly addressees household affordability concerns, it might not be the best option.

Instead, Resources for the Future said states could consider returning a portion of the revenue to consumers as a climate credit, perhaps even targeting low-income customers, while using revenues left over to reinvest in clean energy and resilience.

If the IRA had been fully implemented, the modeling estimated that the average electricity bill nationwide would have been reduced by $101 in 2030. However, for the eight clean energy leadership states, the household savings from the IRA were estimated to be an average $55.

Introducing a carbon price without reinvesting any of the revenue into new investments that decrease energy demand, or returning the proceeds to consumers, would increase 2030 electricity bills in the eight states by $145.

Notably, the authors said that even with the IRA, returning the carbon revenues to reduce residential electricity prices would result in a net reduction of $92 on electricity bills, which is greater than what anticipated from the full implementation of the IRA.

The authors suggested using a portfolio approach to pursue remedies that accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy should they implement a carbon tax.

,EVs,2025-09-30 18:41:25+00:00,Detroit Free Press,"Ford, GM find way to temporarily keep EV tax credit alive for leases - Detroit Free Press","Jackie Charniga, Liam Rappleye",,,,,https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2025/09/30/ford-electric-vehicle-tax-credits/86438300007/,"Tax credit eligibility applies to retail leases only, according to documents outlining Ford's program obtained by the Detroit Free Press.
When a customer leases an EV through the program, their payment reflects application of the tax credit and the finance company gets reimbursed.
Both Ford and GM offered dealers $1,000 per vehicle in dealer cash to participate, according to GM spokesman Jim Cain.
When the dealer actually writes the lease for the customer, the customer gets the value of the tax credit in the lease calculation.
“The whole idea here is, it’s business as usual for the customer,” according to the GM spokesman.","The move allows certain electric vehicles to qualify for the tax incentive beyond the Sept. 30 expiration.

Ford and GM spokespeople confirmed the programs to the Detroit Free Press.

Ford Motor Co. and General Motors have developed a method through the IRS guidance to extend use of the electric vehicle tax credits, at least for leases, into the fourth quarter.

The Detroit automakers used their financing arms, called captive finance companies, to make down payments on EVs before finding customers, a move that allows those vehicles to qualify for the incentives beyond the Sept. 30 expiration.

Ford and GM spokespeople confirmed the programs to the Detroit Free Press.

Stellantis has not publicly announced a similar program and did not respond to requests for comment on this story.

Tax credit eligibility applies to retail leases only, according to documents outlining Ford's program obtained by the Detroit Free Press. Electric vehicle purchases and fleet vehicles do not apply.

Ford CEO Jim Farley told reporters at a media event Sept. 30 that automaker worked to implement the program because he believes the EV owner base is important for the automaker's future.

“We don't want to have a hole in our owner base because we have a lot of customers that are driving our electric vehicles,” he said. “So I think there's a period of time when we'll have to transition consumers out of the government's support. But as far as how long we do that, and how deep we do it, you know, we'll see.”

GM's program is similarly structured to Ford's, according to a GM spokesman. When a customer leases an EV through the program, their payment reflects application of the tax credit and the finance company gets reimbursed.

Both Ford and GM offered dealers $1,000 per vehicle in dealer cash to participate, according to GM spokesman Jim Cain. The credit will be available as long as there is inventory covered by the program, the GM spokesman said.

President Donald Trump’s July legislation, called the “Big Beautiful Bill,” eliminated the Biden-era federal $7,500 tax credit on new EV sales and leases that originated after Sept. 30.

The credit remained viable, the IRS said last month, if a vehicle is “placed in service” after Sept. 30, so long as a payment has been made on the vehicle.

“If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” per the guidance.

The IRS clarified a payment may include “a nominal downpayment or a vehicle trade-in” and that the guidance applies to the federal commercial clean vehicle tax credit, which permitted automakers to pass on the $7,500 incentive to car buyers through a lease.

How it works:

Dealers opting in to the program received a $1,000 incentive per vehicle.

The automakers' financing arms selected vehicles with VIN numbers, meaning on participating dealer lots or in transit, and applied a payment toward them before the deadline. That payment is a percentage of the MSRP, but a spokesman would not provide specifics.

When the dealer actually writes the lease for the customer, the customer gets the value of the tax credit in the lease calculation.

The credit company gets paid back for its rebate, or down payment.

“The whole idea here is, it’s business as usual for the customer,” according to the GM spokesman. “Hypothetically, they can walk in on Oct. 1 or Oct. 31 and lease an EV and get the benefit of the credit if the dealer is participating in the program and still has inventory. It’s while supplies last.”

The GM spokesman also would not break out inventory, except to say, “We’ll be able to meet customer demand well into the fourth quarter.”

Ford and General Motors are signing their respective dealers up for an ambitious plan that would — in effect — extend the $7,500 tax credit on leased EVs beyond the September 30 deadline, and the methodology is pretty wild.

Basically, each automaker's financial arm is going to initiate the purchase of a dealership's entire EV inventory by making the down payment on each car. That down payment qualifies the lending arm for the $7,500 federal tax credit since the deal would have gone through before the September 30 deadline, according to Reuters. From there, the dealerships will offer leases on those cars to retail customers — business as usual — for several months, and the $7,500 subsidy would be factored into the lease rate. This has got to be one of the more creative ways to give your customers a deal, as far as I've ever heard.

Here's more from Reuters:

""We worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases"" of EVs, GM said in a statement to Reuters on Monday.

Ford said it was working to provide Ford EV customers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until December 31.

GM gave its dealers until September 30 to participate, while Ford set a September 26 deadline, according to Automotive News. To sweeten the deal, Ford is offering its dealers a $1,000 incentive for each EV it leases through the program through the end of the year.

Both Ford and General Motors say they devised their programs in discussions with officials at the Internal Revenue Service, according to three people familiar with the discussions who spoke with Reuters. So, while it might sound a little screwy on its face, I suppose the program is completely kosher. It's not immediately clear if other automakers are following suit on this plan, but time is running out, and from the looks of it, they'd be fools not to.

Back in August, the IRS said vehicles must be purchased by September 30 to qualify for the $7,500 tax credit, so I guess that's what's happening here. It'll be interesting to see who is marked down as the first owner of these cars. Is it Ford and GM or is it the lessee? I suppose we shall see. In a lot of ways, it sounds like a less nefarious version of that scheme some Chinese automakers were pulling with their sales numbers.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/ford-gm-are-buying-their-own-cars-to-get-customers-the-7500-tax-credit/l-intro-1759244871.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:03:27.519960

“Implementing key sections of the Big Beautiful Bill underscores the Trump administration’s drive to unleash American energy,” Governor Gordon said. “Putting these policies into play grants balanced federal land management and multi-use access, along with greater local decision making. The President continues to take bold actions to reaffirm the reliability and affordability of clean coal for American energy security.”

The Governor emphasized coal producers in Wyoming and nationwide now have the potential to better help meet the nation’s energy demand by extending production in plants previously scheduled for closure.

“Extending the life of coal fired power plants is good for consumers, grid reliability, and coal communities,” Governor Gordon said. “Wyoming is poised for a win-win-win with these new policies. Our production is strong and will get stronger — at the same time as national and international consumers clamor for clean energy, our product best meets those needs.”

The Gordon administration has consistently worked on behalf of Wyoming’s coal-producing communities, alongside industry partners, such as the Wyoming Energy Authority (WEA), and the University of Wyoming’s School of Energy Resources (SER) to market Wyoming’s clean coal and coal products.",https://sheridanmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image000000-4-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 17:02:59.216869

The program that helped incentivize the purchase or lease of a new or used EV for hundreds of thousands of buyers over the course of more than a decade has been phased out by the Trump administration, and it’s left many wondering what comes now for both consumers and manufacturers.

We had a look at the state of the American car market to see what shoppers should know right now, what they should do right now, what comes after that deadline, and what vehicles and automakers might be most affected by what comes after the tax credit ends.

What You Should Do Now if You Missed the Tax Credit Deadline

Key takeaway: The federal tax credit is done, but there may still be state and local incentives available, depending on where you live, and some automakers will also likely be using incentives to clear out old model-year inventory in the coming weeks.

Getting a $7,500 discount in the form of a tax rebate (often included in the sale price of the vehicle thanks to some crafty financing moves by dealerships) is no more, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still deals to be had on EVs. Sales of EVs in August and September 2025 went at record paces, but that doesn’t mean dealers are sold out. There are likely some models still available, and while federal incentives might not be part of the picture, some state and local government incentives might be. It’s worth checking with your local dealership to find out.

Automakers are also still eager to clear out their inventory, so it’s likely that brands might also have deals for a while, too. Acura, for instance, is attempting to clear out the last remaining 2024 ZDX SUVs with a quiet $4,000 incentive through Nov. 3, 2025, for returning customers, new conquest buyers and returning lessees. As for other automakers, it will depend on just how much inventory is left on dealer lots this month as to whether or not additional incentives to clear out old model year inventory will be needed.

What Happens to the EV Market Now That the Federal Tax Credit Is Gone?

Key takeaway: With the expiration of the federal tax credit, automakers are reevaluating their pricing, production and future models, and future incentives will depend on inventory levels.

Where the EV market goes from here is a bit of a gray area. With the federal incentives done, automakers are going to be left with some difficult choices on pricing, supply and future models, but what they do in the coming months will likely depend on just how many EVs are left on dealer lots and in the shipping pipeline. If dealerships sold a lot of their inventory last month, we’re not likely to see many automaker incentives on the hood of remaining vehicles. There may be some as end-of-year sales pushes start to happen, but nothing approaching what the federal tax credit could employ. However, discounts could be employed to clean out the rest of the stock in October and November, especially as the model year comes to a close.

But we’re also already starting to see automakers adjust production, slowing new EV assembly, canceling some models and reducing imports (partly for the disappearance of the credit, partly for the institution of tariffs). For instance, GM has partially idled its factory that makes its big electric trucks, affecting the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ, Mercedes-Benz has stopped taking orders for some of its EQ line of vehicles, and Acura has announced the discontinuation of its joint-venture electric SUV, the ZDX.

While new EVs are likely to see their transaction prices increase due to the loss of the credit, used-EV prices (which have been declining steadily thanks to high inventory and a plethora of affordable models under $25,000) are selling quickly, too, according to Cars.com data. As the depreciation on new EVs is pretty hefty, used offerings make for an interesting, cost-effective option for a lot of EV intenders and used-car buyers in general.

Here’s the interesting part: The federal tax credit helped the industry get a lot of EVs into consumer hands at prices that they otherwise would not have been able to afford. Over the last decade, the biggest factor in driving down overall EV cost has been battery cost, which has been reduced to nearly $100 per kilowatt-hour and is continuing to fall quickly, mostly thanks to Chinese efforts in new battery technology and economies of scale. But the electric car market isn’t going away anytime soon, especially in foreign markets, meaning there will still be EVs to buy here in the U.S.. What the end of the EV tax credit is doing, however, is forcing automakers to reevaluate their overall strategy for bringing the next generation of EVs to market.

“But what is even more worrying is that Secretary Wright is also illegally freezing and cancelling programs that fund advanced research into solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies.
“President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science.
Reflecting that commitment, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright regularly engages on these issues.” Wright railed against climate policy at the United Nations general assembly last week.
“Countries are on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda,” he said.","Employees in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, which is the government’s largest funder of carbon-slashing technologies, were told to avoid using the terms in both internal dealings and public-facing work.

“Whether you work directly on communications or not, this email applies to you,” says the email, which was first obtained by Politico.

It’s a continuation of the anti-environmental agenda Trump has pushed since entering the White House, said one anonymous agency staffer. It follows a move by Trump to gut EERE’s funding of green technologies.

“My reaction was: same shit, different day,” the worker said.

In addition to “climate change”, the banned terms include “decarbonization”, “sustainable”, “emissions” and “green”. Also on the list are “energy transition”, “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy” and “carbon/CO2 ‘Footprint’”.

Another set of words to be avoided: “Tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies”, probably because of the terms’ association with Joe Biden’s efforts to subsidize green technologies, which the administration is clawing back.

“Banning the use of these words would silence key elements of DOE’s mission,” another anonymous current agency staffer told the Guardian. “But what is even more worrying is that Secretary Wright is also illegally freezing and cancelling programs that fund advanced research into solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies. DOE leadership can choose to stick their heads in the sand, but that won’t make the climate crisis go away or stop super storms and wildfires from destroying more homes.”

The Trump administration has this year asked agency leaders to avoid some 200 terms – a list that also includes words like “activism” and “injustice”.

“Welcome to the Donald Trump post-truth world,” Dr Ali Khan, a retired US assistant surgeon general and a former director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote on social media.

The Department of Energy’s press secretary denies that it has instructed employees to avoid the use of specific terms.

“There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as ‘climate change’ or ‘emissions,’” Ben Dietderich, the agency’s press secretary, said in an emailed statement. “President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science. Reflecting that commitment, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright regularly engages on these issues.”

Wright railed against climate policy at the United Nations general assembly last week.

“The more people have gotten into so-called climate action, the more expensive their energy has become,” he told reporters. “That lowers people’s quality of lives and reduces their life opportunities.”

He went on to defend a July climate report produced by the energy department that experts say is riddled with misinformation, and announce the cancellation of $13bn of funding for renewable energy projects.

The recommendations are the latest attempt by the Trump administration to minimize or silence discussions about the threats posed by the climate crisis. Upon retaking the White House in January, Trump stripped mentions of climate change and global heating from government websites and ended a slew of climate-focused government programs.

In a speech at the United Nations last week, the president also called the crisis “the greatest con job ever perpetrated upon the world”.

During that same period, productivity in much of the essential economy declined.
“At Ford, we believe honoring these essential workers means equipping them to win.
The work we begin today is about ensuring America’s Essential Economy is strong and fit for the future.” Other national business leaders echoed Ford’s urgency message.
Recognizing that action must come from both the public and private sectors, Ford says it’s leading through its Ford Essential Workforce Initiative.","The Ford Pro division of Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn today convened 300 leaders from across the essential economy – critical industries like manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, and energy, among others – for a national forum at Michigan Central Station in Detroit to accelerate productivity in these critical sectors.

The summit, called Ford Pro Accelerate: The Essential Economy, comes at what the automaker is calling “an urgent moment for America,” which is grappling with a “yawning productivity divide.”

From 2015 to 2023, productivity in the knowledge economy rose 28 percent, powered by innovation in software and cloud services. During that same period, productivity in much of the essential economy declined.

“This summit addresses a fundamental challenge to America’s prosperity — a growing productivity divide that holds back the very people who build, move, and fix our country,” says Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford.

“At Ford, we believe honoring these essential workers means equipping them to win. This is a call to action for business, technology, and government to break down the barriers of bureaucracy and underinvestment. The work we begin today is about ensuring America’s Essential Economy is strong and fit for the future.”

Other national business leaders echoed Ford’s urgency message.

“I would put this in the category of critically important right now,” says Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase. “America has one of the best and most prosperous economies the world has ever seen.

“But we’ve gotten bogged down by crippling bureaucracy that slows down growth, job creation, and innovation. Too often, it can take longer to get permits than to build something. We can grow our economy for the benefit of all Americans, and I believe meetings like this will help us do that.”

John May, chairman and CEO of Deere & Co., says, “We need to do a better job helping people understand how critical our industries are. We need to demonstrate our purpose — to provide the food and critical infrastructure the world needs with equipment that allows our customers to do it in a more productive way and more profitably so they can continue to reinvest in their business and reinvest in their community.”

Linda Hubbard, president and CEO of Carhartt Inc. in Dearborn, says, “More than a million skilled trade jobs are going unfilled today, a number that’s only projected to rise. Skilled trade jobs are too often overlooked as pathways to meaningful careers, yet these workers are the backbone of our economy.

“Elevating and investing in this workforce is critical to our physical infrastructure, industrial production and community development—everything that supports our society and helps it advance.”

In partnership with the Aspen Institute, Ford says it identified three evidence-based paths to address these productivity challenges:

Bolstering Human Capital: As the U.S. faces major workforce shortages — including 600,000 workers in manufacturing and 500,000 unfilled jobs in construction — federal spending on workforce services has dropped by two-thirds in inflation-adjusted terms since 1979.

Streamlining Regulatory Procedures: The average time for approval of a power-connection request has more than doubled since the early 2000s, and the U.S. now adds only one-eighth the annual miles of high-voltage transmission lines compared to 20 years ago.

Fostering Innovation Where It’s Needed Most: Federal spending on R&D is at its lowest point as a percentage of GDP since 1953, with innovation shifting away from industrial sectors. The manufacturing industry’s share of new patents fell from 78 percent in 1970 to 30 percent in 2010.

Recognizing that action must come from both the public and private sectors, Ford says it’s leading through its Ford Essential Workforce Initiative. This includes programs like the UAW-Ford Joint Apprentice Program; nationwide auto tech recruiting and training partnerships; and Ford Pro services that make customers more productive, including a new collaboration with ServiceTitan.

Building on this commitment, Ford and Ford Philanthropy today announced new workforce development investments totaling more than $5 million for 2025-2026, which is projected to benefit more than 100,000 students and educators through:

15 Ford Future Builders Labs in Michigan and Tennessee to bring hands-on learning to K-12 students.

A new partnership with SkillsUSA to expand advanced manufacturing and automotive programs for high school students.

The creation of the Ford Philanthropy Advanced Manufacturing & Trades Scholarship to cover training, tools, and expenses for students pursuing careers in the skilled trades.

The expansion of Ford’s Auto Tech Scholarship with TechForce Foundation, which has already provided $7 million in financial support to 1,400 students since 2023.

As part of these efforts, Ford is also exploring with Bloomberg Philanthropies how to expand its innovative model for career-focused high schools to the skilled trades.",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/09/FordConvenes800.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 15:03:29.007603

As a result, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain demand, which could lead to lower EV prices.
EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars.
With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.
And the EV tax credit doesn't apply to all models.","Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1. But where prices go is less certain.

The tax credit, passed by the Biden administration in 2022 to support EVs, is going away Wednesday as part of President Donald Trump's broad spending and tax bill. The loss will cut into demand for EVs, which means prices in real terms will immediately rise - a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September.

That surge could result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year. As a result, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain demand, which could lead to lower EV prices. But it's not clear how much total savings the changes will provide, and likely won't make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn't respond to CNN's request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), more than three times as fast as the 2% for non-electric passenger vehicles.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% during the first six months, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

""If you already can't sell the vehicles at current prices, there's no way you are going to sell them at today's prices with this credit going by the wayside,"" he said.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms and cash-back offers for buyers.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

""I think we'll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,"" Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won't kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they'll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey reports that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment were all more important factors to buyers than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn't apply to all models. It's not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won't necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a ""moving target,"" said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

""I think there's going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,"" Green said.

“Welcome to the Donald Trump post-truth world,” Dr Ali Khan, a retired US assistant surgeon general and a former director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote on social media.

The Department of Energy’s press secretary denies that it has instructed employees to avoid the use of specific terms.

“There is no directive at the Energy Department instructing employees to avoid using phrases such as ‘climate change’ or ‘emissions,’” Ben Dietderich, the agency’s press secretary, said in an emailed statement. “President Trump and Secretary Wright remain committed to transparency and fostering an open, honest dialogue about climate science. Reflecting that commitment, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright regularly engages on these issues.”

Wright railed against climate policy at the United Nations general assembly last week.

“The more people have gotten into so-called climate action, the more expensive their energy has become,” he told reporters. “That lowers people’s quality of lives and reduces their life opportunities.”

He went on to defend a July climate report produced by the energy department that experts say is riddled with misinformation, and announce the cancellation of $13bn of funding for renewable energy projects.

The recommendations are the latest attempt by the Trump administration to minimize or silence discussions about the threats posed by the climate crisis. Upon retaking the White House in January, Trump stripped mentions of climate change and global heating from government websites and ended a slew of climate-focused government programs.

In a speech at the United Nations last week, the president also called the crisis “the greatest con job ever perpetrated upon the world”.

“Countries are on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/033855aa7d9d7648495c8422434913cf86b22223/359_0_3321_2656/master/3321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1fcd55594263009a7adbc9d96a46b170",N,,2025-09-30 15:04:25.633794

MPSC commissioners voted to approve a total rate increase of about $157.5 million that goes into effect Nov. 1. The new rates mean a typical Consumers customer who uses 75 ccf (hundred cubic feet) of natural gas per month will see an increase of $4.44 on their monthly bill.

Jackson-based Consumers Energy is one of Michigan's largest utility companies and provides natural gas service to 1.8 million residents in the state's lower peninsula. In regulatory filings, Consumers officials said the rate increase was necessary to cover the costs of replacing the company's aging pipeline infrastructure and to ensure adequate natural gas supply.

Brian Wheeler, a Consumers spokesperson, said over email the company buys the bulk of its natural gas during the summer months when costs are cheaper.

""This strategy avoided over $120 million in natural gas supply purchases last winter,"" Wheeler said. ""That strategy, combined with continued system investments while controlling costs, is helping reduce increases and keep rates as competitive as possible while also providing assurance for our customers that our system will be safe and keep stoves on, water hot and homes warm.""

Consumers had initially sought a $248 million rate increase, before amending their request to $217 million. Intervenors, which included Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's office and environmental advocacy groups, argued against the rate increase.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on Monday launched a program to help low-income families install solar panels and battery storage at their houses or apartment buildings — with 100% of the cost covered.

Residents or apartment owners must apply with an approved solar developer, who generally submits the application.

The state-funded “self-generation incentive program” was launched in June. A total of $280 million is being dispersed across the state, with more than $32 million allotted for the DWP. Customers can choose to do battery storage only, or solar plus a battery system.

Why it matters

The goal is to help low-income DWP customers save money on their electricity bills, while also boosting the power grid’s resilience. By now, California has a lot of solar, but not enough batteries to use all of that energy when the sun goes down. Batteries also help homes keep the lights and air conditioning on during power outages.

The biggest utilities in Southern California — Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric — also launched this program in June, with slightly different eligibility requirements.

LADWP was not subject to recent state-level cuts to rooftop solar incentives, called net energy metering, so customers will still get paid back for electricity they generate or store on their new systems at the full rates they pay.

Despite that, rooftop solar adoption has declined substantially in the city in recent years.

David Jacot, LADWP’s director of distributed energy solutions, said rooftop solar supplies about 7% of the city’s power. But the utility is now prioritizing boosting battery storage.

“We really need to start getting more storage online so that we can have that resource when the solar panels aren't generating,” Jacot said. “That period is in the early evening when the sun starts to go down — we call it the solar cliff.”

How to apply

Single-family households making 80% or less than the area median income are eligible for LADWP’s new solar plus battery storage program. That means a family of four in L.A. making $121,150 or less would qualify.

For apartment buildings, at least five of the units must be low-income and located in a pollution-burdened community, or at least 80% of the households in the building have incomes at or below 60% of the area median income.

Solar developers will generally submit the application, so interested customers should first identify an approved contractor. (A searchable list is below.) Applications will remain open until funding runs out.

The new program will fully cover the cost of installation. Solar systems alone cost around $30,000, and adding a battery can tack about $15,000 onto that price, before federal tax credits, which can cover 30% of the cost. The Trump administration is ending those incentives at the end of the year.

The nation has plans to construct several key projects that aim to alleviate the pressure on the environment by promoting the advancement of the renewable energy sector via a significantly large nuclear project. China has some of the worst air quality in the world, second only to India. One can understand that the unprecedented expansion of the Chinese economy through a variety of sectors has resulted in extreme air pollution in its biggest and most densely populated cities.

The China National Nuclear Corporation has big plans for the Xuwei site

In August of last year, China’s State Council gave its approval for 11 nuclear reactors, of which the Xuwei Phae 1 site was one. The site in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, will feature two 1208 MWe (net) Hualong One units and one 660 MWe high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR). The Chinese government has awarded the contract for the construction of the three reactors that will comprise the first phase of the Xuwei nuclear power project.

China is among the worst polluters in the world, and as such, needs to invest significantly in the renewable energy sector in order to meet the ever-increasing energy demands while rolling back reliance on the fossil fuel sector. Beijing has some of the worst levels of air pollution anywhere in the world, no doubt due to the intense economic boom the country has experienced over the last thirty to forty years.

There is a clear and present need for the nation of China to innovate its energy sector, which, to its credit, has done so in a variety of ways.

“The impetus for nuclear power in China is due to air pollution from coal-fired plants, as well as climate commitments and energy security.” – the World Nuclear Association

The Xuwei site is a culmination of China’s new approach to the energy sector

The China National Nuclear Corporation, or CNNC, describes the project as “the world’s first dual-coupling demonstration project combining a third-generation nuclear PWR and a fourth-generation nuclear HTGR”. The site will feature a steam heat exchange station, which will implement the heat-to-electricity operation mode for the first time.

The Xuwei site will heat demineralised water by the primary steam of the Hualong One units to produce saturated steam, and the primary steam of the HTGR will be used to heat the saturated steam for the second time. The $594 million contract will enable Jiangsu Electric Power Construction No.3 Company to build the three conventional island power plants, their ancillary facilities, and the construction and installation of some ‘balance of plant’ components.

Once construction has been completed and operations begin, the site in Lianyungang will supply 32.5 million tonnes of industrial steam every year, with a maximum power generation of more than 11.5 billion kilowatt-hours, reducing the use of standard coal by 7.26 million tonnes as well as reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 19.6 million tonnes each year. The site represents the new approach to the nuclear sector being led by the two largest economies in the world.

Two main approaches are proposed: a 100% reallocation that would fully incorporate all exempted volumes in 2023–2025, and a 50% reallocation that would offset half of the exempted volumes.
In implementing this proposal for 2026, the EPA would reallocate all of the RINs exempted in 2023 plus half of the RINs exempted in 2024.
The additional SRE reallocation volumes would be phased in across 2026 and 2027 to avoid market disruption.
The EPA’s objectives in managing this process are to (1) maintain the intended renewable fuel use in 2026 and 2027, thus preventing the surplus RINs from reducing demand for new renewable fuel; and (2) avoid increasing actual renewable fuel production above previously proposed levels, but instead to keep production at the intended targets.","The EPA’s September announcement proposes reallocating the volumes of fuel that were waived in the August 2025 SRE decisions (the “SRE Volumes”) as additional volumes in the Set 2 volumetric standards.1 How the EPA proposes to allocate these SRE volumes is a bellwether for the future of the program, as this approach will likely serve as a template moving forward. Moreover, the stakes for this decision are significant for the RFS program and the biofuels industry it supports, as well as for the refining industry and the pivotal economic factor of gas prices. The EPA must navigate important, yet conflicting, objectives with this policy, maintaining incentives for renewable fuels production to further the goals of energy security and sustainability on one hand while avoiding costly burdens on obligated refineries that could ultimately be passed down to impact fuel prices at the pump on the other. As a sign of the EPA’s interest in obtaining feedback on its proposal from the various stakeholders, the agency is scheduling a public hearing for October 1, 2025, and is currently accepting written comments until October 31, 2025.

Why Is the Allocation of the SRE Volumes So Important for the RFS Program?

The RFS program requires that a certain volume of renewable fuel be blended into transportation fuel, and the EPA sets these volumetric standards on an annual basis. The EPA tracks compliance with this obligation using RINs, which are generated when renewable fuel is produced or imported. Obligated parties, such as refiners and importers, must acquire and retire enough RINs each year to meet their Renewable Volume Obligations (“RVOs”).

The SRE Volumes, which the EPA estimates to number in the billions of gallon equivalents of renewable fuels, will result in significant portion of RINs not being retired, thereby creating a surplus of carryover RINs that could be used in future years. While an obligated party can only satisfy up to 20 percent of its RVO with carryover RINs, the concern is that the use of, for example, 2023 carryover RINs for compliance year 2024 will lead to a glut of 2024 RINs being carried over into 2025. Thus, a RIN surplus could lower demand for new RINs in several subsequent years, thereby lessening the need to blend new renewable fuel. Ultimately, biofuels producers fear that the impacts of the SRE Volumes, diminished RIN prices and lower demand for renewable fuel, could cause lasting damage to the biofuels industry and undermine the purpose and objectives of the RFS program.

How Is the EPA Proposing to Allocate the SRE Volumes?

The EPA is proposing to adjust the 2026 and 2027 Set 2 volumetric requirements to account for the surplus RINs created by the SRE Volumes. The EPA proposes that a new “SRE reallocation volume” factor will be added to the annual percentage standard equations used to calculate RFS volume standards. Two main approaches are proposed: a 100% reallocation that would fully incorporate all exempted volumes in 2023–2025, and a 50% reallocation that would offset half of the exempted volumes. In implementing this proposal for 2026, the EPA would reallocate all of the RINs exempted in 2023 plus half of the RINs exempted in 2024. For 2027, the EPA would reallocate the other half of the RINs exempted in 2024 plus all of the RINs projected to be exempted in 2025. The EPA is also seeking comment on other percentages (e.g., 25 percent or 75 percent) or not reallocating at all.

The additional SRE reallocation volumes would be phased in across 2026 and 2027 to avoid market disruption. This reallocation would apply across all four RFS categories: cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel. The EPA’s objectives in managing this process are to (1) maintain the intended renewable fuel use in 2026 and 2027, thus preventing the surplus RINs from reducing demand for new renewable fuel; and (2) avoid increasing actual renewable fuel production above previously proposed levels, but instead to keep production at the intended targets.

On What Questions is the EPA Seeking Comment?

The EPA is chiefly seeking input on its proposals for reallocation of SRE-exempted renewable fuels volumes, both the co-proposed 100 percent and 50 percent reallocation plans and the other reallocation possibilities: 25 percent, 75 percent or 0 percent reallocation. The EPA is also seeking comment on whether cellulosic biofuel volumes specifically should be incorporated into the SRE reallocation volumes or, if not, whether the advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel reallocation volumes should be otherwise reduced “given the nested nature of the standards.” The EPA has set a date for a virtual public hearing for stakeholder engagement of October 1, 2025. The agency is also accepting written comments until October 31, 2025, providing stakeholders with an opportunity to improve the rule by providing additional data or raising concerns that were not considered in the rule proposal. Submitting comments can also preserve issues for future legal challenges. As we have previously reported, participation in these comment processes is vital for ensuring that the regulator has a balanced perspective as it finalizes its actions.

Conclusion

The EPA has proposed to adjust its 2026 and 2027 RFS standards to account for volumes exempted through the small refinery exemption and to manage the impacts to the renewable fuels market from the RINs carried over due to recently issued SREs. In some sense, the EPA’s SRE reallocation proposal is a necessary product of the interaction between the agency’s Set 2 volume standards and its August SRE decisions. But it is also the product of the competing interests between the refining and biofuels industries. By seeking public input on a range of reallocation options, the agency is attempting to balance the program’s core objectives — supporting renewable fuel production, ensuring energy security, and protecting consumers from undue cost increases.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16004_4824.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 14:01:08.775572

Data from the Solar Energy Industries Association shows the country generated over 750,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity from solar and wind last year. That's enough to power more than 70 million homes.

The industry is facing changes, however, from President Donald Trump's new federal tax and spending policies. Some for the better, some for the worse.

Trump signed what he calls “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July.

Part of that bill changed policies and placed restrictions on energy tax credits for the solar energy industry and its customers.

The Solar Energy Industries Association said the industry will no longer have access to an investment and production tax credit after 2027 under the new law.

These two credits are financial incentives to encourage clean energy investment and innovation.

It might be a shock to some, but Vice President and Director of Sales for N.C. Solar Now Jesse Solomon said he’s witnessed funding cuts before.

“We’ve seen a lot of turbulence over the past 15 years, and we’ve always been able to adapt. Right?” Solomon said. “We’ve lost the state tax credit in 2015, and then we’ve lost some of our metering subsidies as well. But we’ve always been able to overcome that adversity up to this point.”

The residential clean energy credit is also at risk and will be cut at the end of the year.

This non-refundable tax incentive is for homeowners who installed systems, such as solar panels, batteries and geothermal heat pumps.

The association said this credit allows homeowners to deduct 30% of the system’s cost from their taxes.

But Solomon said with North Carolina’s population growth and the demand for power increasing, the solar industry will continue to boom.

“You know, there are data centers that are going to be built here over the next five years, and we’re in a perfect situation to provide functional power and reliable energy to the grid as well as the centers,” Solomon said.

Solomon said one thing is for sure — solar energy isn’t going anywhere.

“I think because the price of power just continues to rise, and as it does, you know, our business allows people to hedge themselves against that power price increase each year,” he explained. “So, we’ll continue to see demand.”

Solomon said N.C. Solar Now is a small, privately owned business with about 100 employees.

He says they are “working hard to minimize any layoffs and are cautiously optimistic.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/nc_solar_now,N,,2025-09-30 14:02:17.634607

""I’m thrilled to introduce the first-ever bill exclusively promoting Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). BECCS is a novel technology uniquely positioned to promote wildfire mitigation, bolster economic development in rural America, and deliver much-needed baseload power as energy demand for data centers and artificial intelligence continues to grow,"" Rep. Moore said.

“From our farms to our forests, the San Joaquin Valley is on the frontlines of both climate challenges and clean energy solutions. This legislation will help us harness new technology to reduce wildfire risks, create good-paying jobs, and keep rural economies like ours growing,” Rep. Costa said.

“The Utah Biomass Resources Group (UBRG) strongly supports forest management initiatives that promote healthy ecosystems, mitigate wildfire risk, and enhance carbon sequestration. In addition, UBRG endorses the establishment of a commission dedicated to advancing biomass energy and carbon storage solutions derived from forestlands across the United States. Forest managers are in urgent need of reliable offtake options for hazardous fuels. The Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) Advancement Commission Act represents a positive step toward addressing this need by facilitating the development of sustainable pathways for biomass utilization and carbon removal,” said Darren McAvoy, Chair of Utah Biomass Resources Group at Utah State University.

“At Arbor, we believe BECCS has a potential to add over 200GW of baseload power to the electric grid, all while improving forestry health and agricultural waste management,” said Sutton Guldner, Head of Business Development and Policy at Arbor Energy. “This firming power is perfect tool to support the energy dominance required for America to execute on its AI ambitions, all while bringing a huge benefits to rural and WUI economies. While there are a host of exciting new technologies at the plate to execute on this vision, there are key governmental signals that need to be clear to unlock the excited private capital required to deploy these projects. This commission brings together thinking required to make sure this can be achieved quickly and efficiently.”

“We commend Congressman Blake Moore and Congressman Jim Costa for introducing bipartisan legislation to promote American leadership on BECCS and provide baseload power to help meet America’s energy demands. This legislation will be critical in enabling efficient federal coordination for accelerated action to support the deployment of BECCS projects across the United States. BECCS will play an integral role in advancing American energy dominance, wildfire mitigation, and economic opportunities in rural communities,” said Will Gardiner, Executive Chair of Elimini.

""Bioenergy with carbon capture is an incredibly underutilized resource that, when fully realized, will reduce atmospheric carbon. Making BECCS more accessible to new and existing biomass power facilities will also incentivize biomass utilization, providing much-needed baseload renewable power, reducing wildfire risk and supporting the forestry supply chain. We are grateful to Rep. Moore and Rep. Costa for introducing this bill, and we look forward to it becoming law,"" said Carrie Annand, Executive Director of American Biomass Energy Association.

“We thank Representatives Moore and Costa for their commitment to supporting bioenergy technology and its use in U.S. manufacturing. Wood product mills are leaders in producing low embodied carbon products that are often manufactured using bioenergy produced from mill residuals. Further enhancing these practices could further improve the sector’s already strong efficiency and sustainability profile. As a sector, we look forward to working with the commission and Congress to understand how BECCS can support rural economies, forest health, U.S. wood products manufacturers, and further reduce carbon emissions,” said Will Layden, Vice President of Government Affairs at American Wood Council

“Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage can provide multiple benefits across the United States, from economic development in rural communities to wildfire mitigation. Creating a commission of leaders from the public and private sector is an important step to deliver on these benefits with maximum impact and to minimize any potential risks,” said Ben Rubin, Executive Director of Carbon Business Council. “The Carbon Business Council is grateful for the leadership of Congressman Costa and Congressman Moore for introducing the BECCS Advancement Commission Act to help accelerate progress on carbon removal.”

“CRES applauds this common sense and practical approach as part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Heather Reams, President and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions. “Expanding BECCS will strengthen America’s energy security, help meet rising energy demand and promote both healthier forests and safer communities. Rep. Moore’s legislation ensures Congress receives the expert guidance needed to unlock the full potential of BECCS, delivering clean energy for our future.”

“Substantially increasing active forest management and wildfire mitigation across all landscapes and ownership boundaries – federal, state, and private – remains a national challenge, and our shared success requires existing as well as new forest markets,” said Jason Hartman, President of the National Association of State Foresters and Kansas State Forester. “State Foresters applaud the bipartisan efforts of Representatives Moore and Costa to bring the right people together to explore innovative technology and its potential to deliver markets that help keep our communities safe, local economies prosperous, and forested landscapes thriving.”

“We applaud the bipartisan leadership of Representatives Moore and Costa to advance tools and technologies that support forest health, wildfire mitigation, and rural economic prosperity,” said Dave Tenny, President and CEO of National Alliance of Forest Owners. “As private working forest owners, we know that the challenges facing our forests don’t stop at property lines – and neither should the solutions. We stand with all those working to advance the environmental and economic benefits of sustainable forest management. Together, we can create stronger markets, healthier forests, and a more resilient future for the communities that depend on them.”

""RCRC members have been profoundly impacted by wildfire in the past two decades. The biggest hurdle for land managers to treat their lands for fire resilience continues to be lack of infrastructure to process woody byproducts. The BECCS Advancement Commission Act of 2025 would help create opportunities for siting BECCS facilities and provide a valuable tool in the toolbox for forest managers,"" said Geri Byrne, Chair of Rural County Representatives of California.

""The lack of infrastructure to use woody byproducts is continually a barrier to increasing the pace and scale of fuels treatment on California’s forest land. Land managers cannot improve the health of our forests and prevent wildfires without advancing wood utilization,"" said Michael Kobseff, Chair of Golden State Natural Resources. ""The BECCS Advancement Commission Act of 2025 is an important step in building capacity and diversifying how we use the unusable wood from our forest lands.""

Background:

BECCS is a technology that converts biomass into heat, electricity, or fuel, while capturing and storing carbon emissions produced during the process. The captured CO2 can be stored in geological formations or embedded in long-lasting products. BECCS supports the American forestry industry, healthy forest management, and wildfire mitigation by providing offtake options for hazardous fuels that accumulate and too often result in catastrophic wildfires posing environmental and health risks.

The commission would be responsible for providing a report to Congress that:

Analyzes the benefits of BECCS on domestic forest health, wildfire mitigation, economic development in rural America and the forestry sector, and the production of firm, clean energy.

Provides legislative and regulatory recommendations to advance BECCS deployment—including how to further the use of biomass from federal lands.",https://blakemoore.house.gov/themes/moore/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 15:03:16.041138

In a world where everyone is yelling, so many are working quietly, tending the garden.

Here is what I did last weekend: I drove my all-electric crossover 303 miles. They were not easy ones. They involved dirt roads and mountains and hundreds of miles on the highway.

They included a razorback section where I gained 4,600 miles of elevation over just 16 miles with a 55-mph posted limit. It’s enough to boil an old gas car’s coolant on the way up and boil its brake fluid on the way down. My Chevrolet Blazer EV—which I leased for less than it would have cost to lease a Honda Civic—careened up to the top silently. Then, I drove it 12 miles on dirt, and camped in the back. If the weather hadn’t been so perfect, I could have done it with the heater on.

I crawled down a rocky, sandy road 36 hours after a monsoon. When I rejoined pavement, I went down the mountain. Blasting downhill at 55 mph on a twisty road and never once touching my friction brakes, I got to the bottom of the mountain having regenerated 4% of my battery. I got down in half the time it'd have taken me in my lumbering gas truck, and had more fun, too.

This technology is here. EVs are imperfect, but they work, and they are getting continually better. They are not exactly like gas cars; they are novel, with a few new compromises, but far more possibilities.

It’s a world with overlanding trails where you can actually hear the birds. It’s no oil changes, it’s 100,000-mile battery warranties, it’s commuting in silence and waking up every day with a full tank of fuel. It's city centers that don't smell like soot and varnish.

Are you really worried about not having 300 miles of range on the coldest day in January? That is a problem that the best EVs have already solved. Even the worst ones offer something more valuable in return. They can preheat in your closed garage, and if you jump in a cold one, you wait 30 seconds, not five minutes, for your heater to kick in. The first five minutes of your winter-time commute don’t have to be painful.

In a million tiny ways, electric cars are easier to live with. They are gentler on the ears and the air and the mind. Your foot and the throttle are connected, one to one. They feel how you imagined a car would have felt as a kid, before you drove one: perfectly linear, perfectly instant.

They do not have the compromises of an internal-combustion engine, which—through tireless engineering—have become almost invisible to most of us.

Consider this: Your car weighs a couple of tons. What is the safe thing for a 4,000-pound object to do when you remove all inputs, and fall limp? If you are the owner of a gas vehicle with an automatic transmission, I hope your answer is “roll forward at 3-5 mph until it runs into something.” That’s what your car is going to do.

Mine stops. It does so without brakes that turn precious energy into purely wasted heat. It snatches that energy back from the void, returning it to the battery and slowing you down at the same time. It is indistinguishable from magic, except it feels so ordinary. Gas cars remain relevant for many buyers because they are cheaper, and that is important. But EVs certainly make them feel archaic.

My 2001 Chevy Tahoe’s 5.3-liter V-8 is charming and potent, but when it roars, it is the cry of something that knows it’s going to battle for the last time. It’s palpably on the way out as a piece of technology. Trucks like mine served their purpose. They got us here. I love ‘em for it.

But the future is brighter. Electric cars are improving so much quicker than their internal-combustion counterparts. Already, they contain thoughtful, common-sense features that show promise. Camp mode gives you budget van life. Dog Mode means you no longer need to choose between keeping your dog alive and keeping your vehicle from being stolen. The smartphone you already have with you can just be your key. Once you solve these problems for a customer, you win them over for life. The experience is just plain better.

Because the electric vehicle is just a less compromised beginning point. They are simpler. They use the one source of energy that everything else that you own uses, and the one that is the easiest to convert into useful work. Electric cars are over 90% efficient; for gas cars, the number is closer to 35%. Almost all of the money you spend on gas goes not to moving your car forward, but towards creating waste heat.

EVs waste less. They work better. You fuel them at home, not at the dirtiest place in town.

EVs have only one substantive problem: They are expensive. Like all new technologies, it takes time to drive costs down.

Recall that the 2007 iPhone was a revelation, but it wasn’t for everyone. I remember the first one I saw, and it seemed impossibly unattainable. Five years later, I had one. Cars move slower than that. Redesigning one takes 4-6 years for most companies. The same story is playing out here: EVs are rapidly getting cheaper and better. It is just taking some time.

But while tomorrow’s electric cars will be more affordable and even more compelling, you don’t have to wait. If you have the means to charge one at home or at work, the modern EV ownership experience has already surpassed the gasoline ownership experience in many segments. Have you spoken to a Tesla owner recently? It’s like the iPhone. It’s like a religion.

The reason is simple. Once you find a charging solution that works for you, and an option you can afford, EVs are just lovely. They are quiet, and they are smooth, but they’re also more than that. They’re a necessary reminder that we can still build something better for tomorrow.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22553114/why-my-ev-gives-me-hope.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 14:03:08.785671

As water circulates within the system, it collects heat from the hot rocks below and brings it to the surface, where the heat produces steam that drives electric turbines.

A leap forward for closed-loop geothermal?

What sets XGS apart from its closed-loop competitors, such as Canadian startup Eavor, is the ​“thermally conductive” cement alternative that the company places between the hot rock and pipe system. XGS claims its proprietary material, which includes a naturally occurring mineral, can increase the total amount of heat it pulls from the subsurface by 30% to 50%, allowing the company to use simpler and cheaper well designs to access hotter rocks with existing drilling technologies.

XGS completed its first pilot project in late 2024 with a 100-meter-deep well in central Texas. Earlier this year, the startup began operating a full-scale prototype using an idled well at the Coso geothermal field in the Western Mojave Desert region of California. The well runs more than 1,000 meters deep — a standard depth for commercial geothermal wells — and reaches subsurface temperatures of around 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit).

Can Canada be a clean energy superpower? Not without tax credits.

For 3,000 hours, or 125 days, XGS continuously ran its closed-loop system while adjusting key variables, such as the rate at which liquid flows and the amount of heat extracted at the surface. The idea was to simulate how the technology performs in different operating conditions, in order to prove it can withstand various types of stress while also demonstrating the company can accurately predict the system’s performance.

The startup claims the prototype’s actual performance fell within 2% of its predictions, results that XGS later verified with independent engineers, Prueher said. Being able to accurately predict how a project will perform – and for how long – is an essential step for the company to be able to raise the many millions of dollars in debt financing it needs to build its first geothermal power plants, he added.

“This unlocks a huge commercial pipeline that has been accumulating in parallel,” Prueher said of the test results. Along with the 150 MW it’s developing with Meta, the startup has lined up over 3 gigawatts of projects ​“mostly in the Western United States, where water sensitivity is a huge issue, and where there’s a strong demand signal from data centers and other types of clean energy consumers to build this as quickly as we can.”

XGS has raised $55 million so far from private investors to develop its heat-harvesting technology. One of its biggest backers is VoLo Earth Ventures, which focuses on early-stage climatetech companies.

Joe Goodman, a managing partner for VoLo, said his firm identified XGS ​“as one of the leading geothermal solutions” about a year and a half ago after reviewing its experimental lab data, and Goodman later joined XGS’s board of directors.

By boosting the system’s overall energy output, XGS’s thermally conductive materials could be the key to making closed-loop geothermal more economically viable, he said, adding that the technology also sidesteps the concerns around water-supply constraints facing enhanced geothermal systems.

“We’re quite optimistic about what we’ve seen,” Goodman said.

We’re on pace to invest more than $2 billion, and contribute millions more in taxes, all across this region, and it’s been incredibly gratifying to witness how our investments are bringing a much-needed economic shot in the arm to many rural communities throughout the Valley.

As proud as I am of the meaningful work we do every day to invest in rural communities and supply affordable, clean, and reliable energy to our utility partners to serve homes and businesses across the region, I’m equally proud of the agribusiness we’ve built over the past several years to care for our land and to create opportunities for aspiring farmers.

Through our agribusiness Regenerative Energy®, we employ farmers and shepherds to graze livestock on the land that we own, enabling them to produce grassfed meats while we improve the health of our soil, care for our land and generate clean, renewable energy, all on the same piece of property.

Given our deep commitment to agriculture, Silicon Ranch naturally supports a wide range of agricultural groups and causes, including Future Farmers of America (FFA). We were again proud to serve as a title sponsor of this year’s Future Farmers of America Ham Breakfast held at the Tennessee State Fair in Lebanon on August 18, where to my surprise and disappointment, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins devoted her entire keynote address to criticize the solar industry for “wasting and replacing” farmland.

U.S. Agriculture secretary backs Tennessee higher ed grant cuts

Unfortunately, this claim — that solar energy presents a legitimate threat to agriculture — has become a deeply politicized talking point, but I believe it’s important for folks to have access to facts based in reality, not rhetoric from Washington.

As part of her statement, Rollins noted that “within the last 30 years, Tennessee alone has lost over 1.2 million acres of farmland and is expected to lose 2 million acres by 2027,” implying that solar energy is the culprit for this loss of farmland and the biggest threat the agricultural community faces today. While the loss of farmland in our state is indeed concerning to us all, the claim that this loss is the result of solar development is flagrantly misleading.

The figure Rollins quoted can also be found in a 2023 study commissioned by the Tennessee General Assembly and conducted by the Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (TACIR). TACIR found that between 1997 and 2017, Tennessee lost 1.1 million acres, or 9.3%, of the state’s farmland. Contrary to Rollins’s suggestion, however, the commission revealed that this loss did not result from solar energy projects, but rather from other forms of development such as shopping centers, subdivisions, and warehouses.

In fact, the TACIR study concluded that even at the most ambitious deployment of solar to meet TVA’s target of securing 10 gigawatts by 2035 (as documented in its Integrated Resource Plan), solar would still occupy far less than 1% of Tennessee’s farmland.

The TACIR report goes on to state that for land used to site solar projects, agrivoltaics — the practice of combining energy generation and agricultural production on the same piece of property, a practice pioneered by Silicon Ranch in 2018 — provides a viable way to develop solar “without taking farmland out of production.”

My team and I share Rollins’s dedication to Tennessee’s agricultural past, present and future. After all, Tennessee is our home. That’s why we’ve worked to create an industry-leading brand of agrivoltaics that enable us to generate both critically needed energy and agricultural opportunity, in the form of both healthier pastures and career possibilities for aspiring farmers who lack access to land.

Despite the rhetoric from Washington, we at Silicon Ranch remain steadfast in our mission: to create new opportunities for farmers, to steward the land we own, and to prove that American energy dominance and productive agriculture are not competing priorities, but complementary pursuits.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Silicon-Ranch-Jackson-Solar-Farm-TN-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 17:03:21.602249

The answer, increasingly, lies not in prediction but in preparation: flexible production systems that can pivot between powertrains as swiftly as markets shift between preferences.

Consider the paradox confronting vehicle manufacturers as we speak. EV sales are indeed growing, yet not at the meteoric pace once forecast. Geopolitical tensions threaten production and supply chains. Tariffs loom unpredictably, and consumer incentives fluctuate by both region, and political cycle.

Traditional automotive manufacturing, built on the economies of scale that Ford perfected a century ago, suddenly looks dangerously rigid. Fixed production lines optimised for a single model now represent not efficiency, but vulnerability.

The industry's response has been to resurrect an old industrial concept - flexibility - and reimagine it for an era of uncertainty that would have been unthinkable even a mere decade ago. Where manufacturers once changed over entire production lines at considerable expense and downtime, they now aspire to build combustion, hybrid and EVs on the same assembly line, switching between them not by the month, but by the hour.

The unavoidable architecture of adaptability

Honda's billion-dollar retooling of its Ohio facilities illustrates the technical gymnastics this requires. The company's Marysville, East Liberty and Anna Engine Plants now form what Honda terms an ""EV Hub"" - though the name undersells the ambition. These plants produce internal combustion, hybrid-electric and battery electric vehicles on identical lines, a feat that demands rethinking manufacturing from first principles.

Bob Schwyn, senior vice president of Honda Development & Manufacturing of America, frames the challenge plainly: ""The Honda EV Hub provides us with the adaptability to produce ICE, hybrid-electric, and EV models on the same lines, allowing us to react swiftly to changing customer needs and market trends.""

The statement sounds deceptively unremarkable until one considers what it entails: body shops reconfigured to accommodate structural battery cases, welding systems that can secure components unique to EVs, and dedicated areas where battery packs can be installed into EVs while combustion vehicles flow past uninterrupted.

The Anna Engine Plant exemplifies this complexity. Six 6,000-ton high-pressure die-cast machines now produce aluminium battery cases using megacasting technology - except Honda has deliberately chosen not to follow Tesla's monolithic approach.

Instead, the carmaker manufactures cases in two parts, allowing different sizes for midsize and large EVs with one half common to both. These sections are then joined using friction stir welding, a solid-state process that Honda has refined to eliminate several machining steps. Photogrammetry systems equipped with up to 120 cameras inspect each case, ensuring mountability before it reaches the assembly plant.

This is flexibility as an engineering challenge: standardised positioning points, universal carriers, adaptive grippers, servo-controlled framing stations that adjust in real time. BMW's Regensburg plant - honoured as Factory of the Year in 2024 - rolls out up to 1,400 BMW X1 and X2 models daily in combustion, plug-in hybrid and battery electric variants, all from the same flexible line. The technical achievement is considerable; the strategic imperative is greater still.

Digital orchestration and the invisible factory

Yet hardware flexibility alone proves insufficient. The modern flexible factory increasingly depends on a digital shadow that orchestrates, optimises and anticipates. This represents the second dimension of manufacturing adaptability: the ability to simulate, manage and reconfigure production systems not in weeks but in milliseconds.

Regensburg operates what it describes as a cloud traffic-control system managing more than 500 automated guided vehicles. These publish position and battery-health data every 100 milliseconds, enabling swarm optimisation that has reduced in-plant material lead-time by up to 30%.

Armin Ebner, head of Plant Regensburg, explains the application: ""We are using AI for quality control in vehicle assembly. In this way, we are optimising our production processes and creating added value for our products and, ultimately, for our customers.""

The plant produces a new vehicle every 57 seconds, each configured uniquely. An AI-powered inspection system analyses real-time production data and generates individualised quality control checklists for every vehicle. This is flexibility as cognitive capability: systems that ‘comprehend’ what they are building and adjust verification protocols accordingly.

Honda's battery pack assembly line at Marysville operates 75 production cells supported by digital twin models. These enable simulation of different product flows and real-time performance monitoring, providing the agility to expand, contract or modify operations based on vehicle variants and demand.

Mike Fischer, project lead at Honda North America, articulates the strategic calculus: ""When you think about flexibility [ICE, hybrid, EV] and for us to be able to do this and scale it from an existing facility, then ultimately you can pass that positioning onto the customer to say we can build any of these vehicles in these existing facilities based on what's happening in the market.""

The shift is consequential. Where production control was once static planning, it has now become continuous real-time orchestration. AI-powered scheduling engines, industrial IoT-enabled equipment telemetry and centralised data architectures allow plants to re-sequence workflows, reallocate resources and anticipate bottlenecks before they impact throughput. This transforms flexibility from hardware reconfigurability to systemic responsiveness.

The human variable of flexible production

Automation, as we know, attracts headlines; workforce adaptability however, often receives less attention, although it proves equally critical. Chris Glover, former executive vice president of Volkswagen Group of America's Chattanooga operations, reduced labour attrition at the Tennessee plant from 35% to 10% within just two years. His observation carries weight: ""Labour retention creates stability in your process. It's a great enabler of flexibility because you retain knowledge and skills.""

At Chattanooga, the decision to integrate EV and ICE production on the same line emerged as what Glover terms ""one of the best decisions we made early on."" The facility created adaptable infrastructure in its body shop, with pre-installed flexibility capabilities allowing seamless integration of new derivatives over time. Yet in the fine-balancing act between people and production tech, Glover acknowledges a fundamental truth: ""The key to flexibility comes down to training and manpower development.""

Volkswagen has hired 3,500 new employees over two years, implementing training programmes spanning basic skills, industry-specific professional training and on-the-job learning. The OEM recognises that while automation handles complexity, humans provide adaptability - particularly in mixed-model environments where timing and variant alignment remain critical.

Jamie Moore, senior principal engineer at Toyota North America, describes how engineering roles themselves have transformed: ""Engineers now have to adopt a flexible mindset. We need to build up a bigger skill set to meet the growing scope of needs. Engineers must now consider not only the feasibility of designs but also their manufacturability, logistical requirements, and lifecycle impacts.""

To state it rigidly: traditional silos are dissolving. Toyota has implemented rotational programmes to expose employees to different organisational areas, creating a more versatile workforce. This reflects broader industry trends, with the World Economic Forum estimating that 54% of manufacturing employees will need significant reskilling by 2025 to keep pace with technological advancement.

Calculating the cost of flexibility - or rigidity

Flexibility carries costs that manufacturers are only beginning to fully comprehend. According to the survey carried out by ABB and AMS, 54% of industry respondents cite high initial capital expenditure as the primary barrier to smart factory development, whilst 35% identify technical integration challenges. These figures suggest that flexibility, whilst strategically essential, remains economically fraught.

The AMS/ABB Automotive Manufacturing Outlook Survey 2025

Whether you’re navigating supply chain disruption, rising costs, tariffs, and labour shortages—or seeing growth through electrification, sustainability, and automation – this survey will provide automakers everywhere with value.

The investment required for advanced automation, modular cells and digital systems must be justified by projected efficiency gains and long-term utilisation improvements. Honda's billion-dollar Ohio commitment, VW's extensive Chattanooga retooling, BMW's continuous upgrading across its global network - these represent not discretionary enhancements but existential requirements. Yet the return on investment calculations grow increasingly complex as manufacturers balance flexibility against productivity.

Highly adaptable lines designed for mixed-model production may struggle to match the efficiency of dedicated, single-model mass lines. Optimising layout, changeover protocols and predictive scheduling becomes essential to avoid diluting output potential. As Glover acknowledged regarding automation complexity, manufacturers walk a tightrope: sophisticated systems can handle variation, but at a cost.

System integration complexity compounds the challenge. Flexible factories demand seamless interoperability between software systems - manufacturing execution, product lifecycle management, enterprise resource planning - and physical assets: robots, conveyors, sensors. The architecture is intricate while the failure modes are numerous.

Change management adds another dimension. Workers must be trained on new roles, tools and digital interfaces, often whilst production continues. Honda addressed this through ergonomic redesigns and digital instructions to ease transitions. Yet the underlying tension persists - flexibility requires workforce adaptability, which requires training investment, which requires labour stability in an industry where retention grows increasingly difficult.

The strategic imperative for increased flexibility

Moore and Glover's conversation at the AMS Evolution North America 2024 conference returns repeatedly to a central theme: uncertainty has become the only certainty. ""The only constant in our industry right now is change,"" Glover noted. From navigating regulations to addressing supply chain vulnerabilities, the industry's ability to adapt quickly has evolved from competitive advantage to survival requirement.

The pandemic and subsequent geopolitical shocks exposed the fragility of global value chains, and automotive manufacturers now lean towards localisation, regionalisation and just-in-case inventory models - all dependent on flexible capacity that can pivot when upstream disruptions materialise. Honda's joint venture with LG Energy Solution for battery production in Jeffersonville, Ohio, exemplifies this approach, with the deployment of a secure, scalable battery cell supply aligned with production needs - across multiple plants.

Market volatility, particularly around EV adoption patterns, reinforces the imperative. Consumer incentives, tariff regimes and purchasing power remain fluid across regions. Fixed, single-model production lines have become both inefficient and unsustainable. As EV sales volumes track below earlier forecasts whilst energy, materials and labour costs climb, manufacturers must extract more value from existing assets or risk losing to lower-priced competition - particularly from Chinese manufacturers who have built flexibility into their DNA.

The technological shift to electrified and software-defined vehicles demands retooling speed that traditional manufacturing models cannot provide. Over-the-air updates, zonal architectures and rapidly iterating battery chemistries require flexibility not only in hardware but in software integration across the factory floor. Regulatory and sustainability pressures - stricter emissions targets, lifecycle carbon assessments, circular-economy mandates - push manufacturers towards adaptable systems capable of scaling recycling and closed-loop materials operations.

An emerging paradigm of increased flexibility

What emerges from this transformation is not simply flexible manufacturing but a fundamentally different industrial model. The convergence of automation, artificial intelligence and industrial IoT creates what BMW and others term ""smart, self-optimising factories"" - systems that continuously learn, adapt and reconfigure with minimal human intervention.

To add to this, digital twins are becoming more sophisticated and widespread, allowing manufacturers to simulate and scale new production setups across global facilities with limited disruption. Automotive supply chains are evolving towards what industry observers call ""leagile"" networks - hybrid systems combining lean efficiency with agile responsiveness.

Configuration lifecycle management enables mass customisation by synchronising design, production and logistics from the earliest development stages. Emerging technologies - gigacasting, microfactories, modular production islands - promise reduced part complexity, faster changeovers and decentralised production closer to demand centres.

Yet perhaps the most significant shift is psychological. Flexibility has evolved from an operational capability to a defensive asset. In markets facing mounting geopolitical tension, trade volatility and rapid technological change, flexible operations offer a hedge against disruption. They allow manufacturers to pivot with speed, preserve profitability and sustain competitive advantage in an unpredictable environment.

Moore captured this mindset shift: ""You have to embrace change and be willing to innovate. If you're not, you're falling behind."" Glover's formulation is equally direct: ""Flexibility is a competitive edge, but it's also a mindset. It requires constant learning, adaptation, and a willingness to embrace change.""

The automotive industry spent a century perfecting the economics of scale, building ever-larger factories to produce ever-greater volumes of increasingly similar vehicles. That model delivered extraordinary prosperity and transformed global mobility. Its obsolescence is now arriving with similar speed. The question facing manufacturers is no longer whether to become flexible, but whether they can do so quickly enough - and whether flexibility itself will prove sufficient in an industry where the only reliable forecast is continued disruption.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/675672.jpg?imageId=675672&x=0&y=7.57&cropw=100&croph=84.87&panox=0&panoy=7.57&panow=100&panoh=84.87&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-09-30 14:01:22.446495

Dive Brief:

Utility-scale battery energy storage deployments hit 4.9 GW/15 GWh during the April to June quarter, rising 63% year over year and smashing the second-quarter record set in 2024, Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association said in their quarterly joint report on the U.S. energy storage business.

Total U.S. energy deployments across the utility, residential and commercial and industrial segments hit 5.6 GW/17.8 GWh, WoodMac and ACP said — a record for any quarter.

While 2025 is shaping up to be a banner year for energy storage, utility-scale deployments are set to decline in 2026 and likely won’t regain this year’s levels until 2029, the report said. WoodMac and ACP placed the blame on unfavorable federal policy changes, particularly around foreign battery material sourcing.

Dive Insight:

Though the U.S. energy storage market is slowly diversifying beyond the sun-drenched southern and western United States, it remains concentrated in a few key markets. California, Texas and Arizona accounted for 75% of utility-scale capacity installed during the second quarter, WoodMac and ACP said.

Chris Taylor, founder and CEO of utility-scale storage developer GridStor, says the addition of Arizona to what was once a California-Texas storage duopoly, reflects the Grand Canyon State’s accommodating attitude toward storage.

“Arizona is more constructive [on storage] … they are looking for a way to say yes” to big projects like the 100 MW/400 MWh White Tank battery storage project GridStor acquired this month from Strata Clean Energy. GridStor aims to commission White Tank in early 2027, Taylor said.

Bullish fundamentals help, he added. Arizona is rapidly adding residents and has some of the country’s biggest announced manufacturing projects in the pipeline. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing broke ground earlier this year on its third semiconductor facility in Arizona.

“Projections for load growth are not the same across the country,” Taylor said. “Arizona is toward the top.”

At the national level, WoodMac and ACP expect energy storage installations to reach 19 GW/52.5 GWh this year, then fall 12% in 2026. The groups blamed “new restrictions on equipment sourcing and ongoing global trade uncertainty” for the expected downturn.

The Republican megabill that passed in July expanded restrictions on components sourced from “foreign entities of concern” in ways that have serious implications for battery storage, analysts say. The Trump administration has also pursued an aggressive, shifting policy on tariffs.

However, demand for storage is likely to continue as the U.S. power grid faces rising load forecasts for the first time in decades. WoodMac and ACP said states with “favorable storage policy combined with expected high load growth” would be among the strongest markets for utility-scale storage over the near term.

Despite the expected downturn, the latest WoodMac/ACP forecast is clearer than the groups’ Q1 2025 outlook, which they released before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act became law.

That forecast included “high” and “low” deployment cases separated by 27 GW over five years, a nod to the major policy questions that remained unresolved at the time.

The groups’ latest report also included two sets of predictions — a “base case” and “low case” separated by 16.5 GW. The gap is due largely to lingering uncertainty over foreign sourcing requirements, broader supply-chain bottlenecks and tightening restrictions on local solar and storage permitting.

Despite those headwinds, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s comparatively favorable treatment for third-party owned solar and storage systems could give the residential market a lift through 2027, WoodMac and ACP said. Through 2029, their forecast calls for a 96% increase in residential storage capacity and a 41% boost in the number of installations.

Emerging ownership and financing models could support the continued growth of residential solar and storage over the next few years, investment bank Jefferies said in a Monday research note.

Jefferies nodded to Enphase’s expected rollout this fall of prepaid lease financing, which the electrical equipment manufacturer said could significantly boost uptake beginning next year. Sunrun, the United States’ largest residential solar and storage installer, has also called non-ownership financing models key to growth in a post-OBBBA world.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/XJoZ9r0seuc0O_eZdRxXWU_LfQoOWL-HonOSqffqtm4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BcmV2b25fU29sYXItcGx1cy1TdG9yYWdlXy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-30 14:02:10.382593

In formal comments submitted on Thursday, Sept. 25, OOIDA supports the EPA’s proposal to disapprove of California’s Heavy-Duty Inspection and Maintenance Regulation to the extent it applies to out-of-state vehicles.

“The flexibility that Congress gave California to experiment with new emission rules did not give the state the authority to impose unreasonable burdens on interstate commerce,” OOIDA wrote in comments signed by President Todd Spencer. “OOIDA has supported efforts from Congress that have reigned in CARB’s overreaching regulatory framework.”

In August, the EPA issued a proposed rule relating to California’s control of emission from non-gasoline combustion vehicles over 14,000 pounds. Under the EPA proposal, California’s Clean Truck Check program would not apply to vehicles registered in another state or country.

The EPA gave the public 30 days to comment on the proposal.

“In recent years, Congress has approved various legislative measures revoking CARB waivers that were granted under the previous administration,” OOIDA wrote. “However, more action is necessary from EPA to ensure California does not violate the principles of the Commerce Clause. We applaud EPA for disapproving the Clean Truck Check program to the extent it applies to vehicles registered out-of-state and urge the agency to take further action against other similarly structured CARB regulations.”

The Association added that the rule was costly to out-of-state truckers.

“OOIDA members who are not residents of California have been forced to pay excessive registration fees and fines since CARB implemented the Clean Truck Check program,” OOIDA wrote. “Practically all users of commercial vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating over 14,000 pounds that operate on California roads must pay a $30 compliance fee, regardless if they are registered in California or not.”

Even more, there are additional expenses for completing inspections twice a year. And if a motor carrier is found in violation of the Clean Truck Check emission standards, it can be subject to thousands of dollars in fines. Attempts for an out-of-state trucker to challenge those violations can be expensive and difficult logistically.

Too many people think that ""reality, goodness and truth"" can spontaneously emerge from technology and the economy, he said. ""This model tends to place the human being in the place of God, making man the greatest danger to himself.""

This marks an increase in planned retirements from last year’s survey, when 21.3% of North American respondents said they intend to retire within five years.

North Americans also reported more skepticism about their infrastructure. In response to the question, “do you think your local electric grid can handle everyone switching from gas to electric heating, as well as from gasoline to electric cars, within the next 10 years?” the number of respondents who said “no” was 83%, up from 79% last year.

Globally, changes in hiring plans depended on sector, with only 19% of manufacturing respondents saying their firm has plans to hire, down from 39% in 2024.

The technology sector, in contrast, looks set to expand. This year, 40% of respondents said their company plans to hire, compared with 34% last year.

“[Energy service companies] and utilities report highest hiring rates at 64% and 57% respectively, while manufacturing and institutional sectors show limited expansion plans below 25%,” AEE said. “Hiring patterns reflect operational realities across sector types.”

Service companies, including utilities and consultants, consistently “report higher hiring intentions, likely driven by project-based workloads and client demand,” AEE said. “Manufacturing and institutional sectors show constrained hiring, potentially reflecting budget limitations and existing workforce adequacy.”

AEE added that the “20-30% ‘unsure’ responses across most sectors indicate ongoing uncertainty in workforce planning decisions.”

AEE’s data was based on 1,016 completed surveys this year, and 1,383 completed surveys in 2024.

Sable Offshore Corp. announced Monday that it has started to pursue an option that would utilize an “offshore floating and treatment vessel” to treat and transport crude oil, instead of relying on a network of pipelines for which the company still needs some key approvals to operate.

The pivot would mark a major shift in Sable’s push to bring the pipelines back online. The lines have sat idle since 2015, when a corroded section ruptured near Refugio State Beach, creating one of the state’s worst oil spills. State officials and local environmentalists have repeatedly raised concerns about the pipes’ capacity to run safely, as well as the process the company has taken to try to fast-track their revitalization over the last year.

Sable’s announcement comes roughly a week after Santa Barbara County prosecutors filed criminal charges against the company, alleging it knowingly violated state environmental laws while completing pipeline repairs, and months after the California Coastal Commission found that the company failed to adhere to the state’s Coastal Act despite repeated warnings, and fined it $18 million.

Sable continues to contend it has followed all necessary protocols and met all legal requirements. Both issues remain tied up in court.

Sable notes that use of a floating treatment vessel would dramatically extend the project’s timeline and likely increase costs for the company, which has already reported funding difficulties after repeated setbacks. Switching to a floating vessel to treat and transport the oil produced offshore would push back a potential start for oil sales by at least a year, to the end of 2026, the company estimated.

The company still says that it could begin oil sales by the end of this year if California regulators OK the pipeline restart. Sable reported it is still pursuing that option “in parallel” with the floating vessel.

But the remaining approvals face uncertainty, especially after California officials targeted offshore projects in a legislative package that could complicate the Sable pipeline project.

In a letter to the U.S. Department of the Interior this week requesting “expedited support” for its floating vessel plan, Sable said the new state law is “creating barriers which necessitate our need for an alternative offshore solution.”

It also pointed out that its project “aligned with President’s Trump’s directive” to increase U.S. energy production, mostly through a renewed focus on oil.

In its announcement, the company also appeared to threaten what this move could mean for California, which has been hurting for gasoline as more and more refineries close. Sable said switching to the floating vessel method for treatment and transport would give the company the freedom to “to market its production outside of the state of California.” It’s not clear, however, if this would be any different for how the company could market oil processed onshore.

Sable is working to restart the Santa Ynez Unit, a complex of three offshore platforms in federal waters, as well as onshore processing facilities and pipelines — all of which have remained shuttered since the 2015 spill. The operation was owned by a different company at the time.

While the floating vessel would provide a workaround for the onshore processing facilities and pipelines under California oversight, some environmental groups and state officials worry the plan would only expand the footprint of a company they say has failed to operate responsibly.

“Sable’s dangerous pivot to a floating processing plant appears to be a ‘hail Mary’ from a company that, for good reason, has failed to win necessary approvals at the state and local levels,” said Alex Katz, executive director of the Environmental Defense Center, a Santa Barbara-based nonprofit that has been one of Sable’s most vocal opponents. “It should be abundantly clear that this is not a company we can trust to operate safely or responsibly, especially when we are talking about the risk of another environmental disaster on the California coast.”

State Sen. Monique Limón (D-Santa Barbara), who spearheaded the legislation focused on increasing offshore regulations, agreed.

“In the time Sable Offshore has owned the pipeline, they’ve broken the law, shirked multiple cease and desist orders, and have yet to pay the $18 million fine for defying stop work orders,” Limón said in a statement. “Whether they intend to use the Las Flores [onshore] pipeline or proceed with offshore storage and treating vessels, the threat surrounding public health and well-being is still present.”

Offshore oil vessels are less common than pipelines, according to industry experts, and some have been associated with large oil spills.

Andrew Lipow, president of Houston-based consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, said the large vessels are typically used in operations where installing pipelines doesn’t make sense.

“These are not uncommon,” Lipow said. “You do it in areas of the world where you simply don’t have the pipelines infrastructure.”

He said it may not be as economical as utilizing a pipeline — especially with one already in place — but said the price of oil could make up for that, depending on the details of a specific project and the market.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95b1e21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F71%2F94e5cf134bb5b5056a62ccde9c30%2F1501692-me-coastal-commission-hearing-26.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 13:06:54.800467

Farley pointed to Ford’s own experiences, noting that while models like the F-150 Lightning have garnered interest, broader market penetration remains elusive without subsidies. Industry data supports this view, with EV sales growth slowing in recent quarters despite aggressive pricing.

Shifting Consumer Preferences

Farley emphasized that “partial electrification,” such as hybrid vehicles, has proven more palatable to buyers wary of full EVs’ limitations. According to a report from CNBC, he cited internal analyses showing hybrids outselling pure EVs by significant margins, a trend that could accelerate post-incentive era. This shift underscores a consumer base still prioritizing range and convenience over zero-emission purity.

Ford’s pivot reflects this reality; the company has ramped up hybrid production while scaling back some EV ambitions. Recent earnings calls revealed losses in the billions on EV divisions, prompting Farley to advocate for more affordable models. As detailed in Newsweek, Ford is investing in low-cost battery tech and new platforms to compete with overseas rivals.

Competitive Pressures from Abroad

The CEO’s comments also touched on global dynamics, particularly the threat from Chinese manufacturers like BYD, which offer feature-rich EVs at lower prices. Farley warned that without protective tariffs, U.S. automakers could be outpaced, a sentiment echoed in posts on X where industry watchers debate the impact of recent U.S. trade policies. Drawing from Fortune, he expressed optimism about Ford’s next-generation EVs becoming profitable within years, but only if incentives bridge the gap.

This international angle is crucial, as Chinese firms dominate battery supply chains. Farley called for domestic innovation, including partnerships for cheaper components, to level the playing field. Recent news on X highlights how tariffs on Chinese imports, announced earlier this year, might buy time for American companies, though skeptics argue it’s insufficient without broader policy support.

Strategic Adjustments at Ford

In response, Ford is accelerating development of smaller, more affordable EVs, targeting prices around $30,000. As reported by Road & Track, Farley noted weak demand for large electric trucks, prompting a focus on compact models like a forthcoming mid-size pickup with rear-wheel drive options. This aligns with consumer feedback favoring versatile, cost-effective vehicles over premium behemoths.

Compensation adjustments for executives, including Farley himself, underscore the stakes. A piece in CBT News detailed how missed EV targets led to reduced pay, signaling accountability amid financial pressures. Ford’s strategy now includes doubling down on hybrid tech as a bridge to full electrification.

Industry-Wide Implications

The end of tax credits, set for January 2026 under current law, could ripple across Detroit’s Big Three. General Motors and Stellantis have extended leasing incentives into the fourth quarter, per Automotive News, in a bid to soften the blow. Yet Farley’s candidness—framed by some as “Ford telling the truth”—exposes vulnerabilities in the push toward sustainability.

Analysts on X are buzzing about potential lobbying for incentive extensions, with posts suggesting political maneuvering ahead of elections. Farley’s vision positions Ford as a pragmatic player, betting on hybrids to sustain momentum while EVs mature. This approach could redefine success in an era of policy uncertainty.

Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities

Broader economic factors, including inflation and interest rates, compound the incentive cliff. Farley stressed the need for realistic timelines, warning against overhyping EVs without addressing pain points like charging deserts in rural areas. Insights from Detroit Free Press highlight his repeated calls for affordable, profitable EVs to counter Chinese dominance.

Ultimately, Farley’s remarks serve as a wake-up call for policymakers and competitors alike. As EV adoption hinges on affordability, the industry must innovate beyond subsidies. Ford’s roadmap, blending caution with ambition, may chart a path forward, but only time will tell if it’s enough to electrify America’s roads without fiscal crutches.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-a7c2b250-47b7-4093-a09c-84224d607dbe.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 15:04:21.290196

Whether it’s a complicated Euro-style thinker about creating a galactic empire via diplomacy, or simply a card game that involves growing the most beans, I love spending my free time around the dining room table.

Morning Dump readers are used to my long windups to a post, but I’ll try to keep this one a little simpler after yesterday’s extended ice age metaphor. Where I’m going with this is that, for all the different games I’ve played, I still haven’t found a more satisfying and powerful card than the simple Uno Reverse card. Whether you’re 5 or 50, there’s just something about being able to shift the entire direction of a game like that.

Did Ford and GM just play an Uno Reverse on the federal government? I think they just did, by exploiting a loophole in order to continue the tax credit just a little longer. Ford is also somewhat reversing the position of its own lobbying group when it comes to greenhouse gases. Volkswagen, for its part, thought it had dealt with a big Dieselgate settlement, only to have a court in Germany toss up its own reverse card, sending the settlement back to the automaker.

Do you want a wildcard for the potentially most interesting electric car you can’t currently buy in the United States? It’s the Alpine A290 Rallye, which is getting its own racing series next year.

Ford And GM’s Clever Plan To Extend The IRA Tax Credit Through The End Of The Year

When I found out the Trump administration and Congress were going to kill the IRA electric vehicle tax credit, I was a bit bummed. It was imperfect, of course, but all laws are. My views have shifted a little lately, and now I’m a bit more mixed on the overall effectiveness of the project.

Either way, automakers and consumers were told they’d have this tax credit for this year, but the latest law essentially rescinds the credit and makes it no longer effective after today… with one big caveat. If you’ve started paperwork and put some money down, then you have until the end of the year to complete the transaction.

Because of another quirk in the law, leased EVs have basically none of the regular requirements under the IRA because they’re considered commercial vehicles. It’s not the consumer who owns the car, it’s the company leasing the car. You can probably see where this is going.

Automotive News (and others) found out that both General Motors and Ford are encouraging dealers to take advantage of this loophole:

The automakers are using their financing arms to offer the incentive beyond its Sept. 30 expiration by making down payments on the vehicles before finding customers to lease them. The programs were confirmed in documents obtained by Automotive News and by people with knowledge of the automakers’ plans.

GM dealers need to sign up by Sept. 30 to participate, while Ford gave dealers a Sept. 26 deadline.

GM confirmed its program in a statement saying the automaker “worked with our GM dealers on an extended offer for customers to benefit from the tax credit for leases on select inventory of our broad portfolio of Cadillac, Chevy and GMC EVs.”

I’m guessing the “select inventory” may not include the Celestiq or other super high-dollar vehicles, but I’m sure the company will be happy to be able to collect another $7,500 on a bunch of Lyriqs and Equinox EVs, et cetera. Even if Ford and GM have to put a couple of grand into this program, it’s still financially worth it. Ford reportedly offered $1,000 per vehicle to dealers who are participating.

Assuming automakers like Volkswagen and Tesla didn’t do the same, then there will be a brief window here where GM and Ford leases are still way cheaper than the competition. I’m curious if anyone else did this.

Uno Reverse indeed.

Ford Still Thinks ‘Modest’ Greenhouse Rules Need To Exist To Help Fight China

As previously mentioned, Ford is part of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (AAI), which is really just the policy and lobbying group for most major automakers and suppliers in the United States. Unsurprisingly and disappointingly, the AAI came out in support of the EPA rescinding its previous finding that greenhouse gases (GHGs) are bad for the environment.

While the AAI was careful not to say that climate change isn’t real, the group seems to be implying that the business case was worse than the potential environmental impact. Curiously, Ford has posted its own response (first noticed by The Detroit News), and it argues for keeping the GHG finding, even if the company wants more ‘modest’ targets.

A lot of its argument comes down to trying to find a stable target, which is important! If the EPA Uno Reverses this decision, then Democrats take back the White House and Uno Reverses it again, it’s going to be tough, as Ford says:

Ours is also a global business. And today, the U.S. automotive industry has only one true competitor—China. The ascendancy of Chinese automakers in the global market is perhaps the most significant business trend in the world, and they are especially strong on plug-in vehicles.

America needs to meet this moment—to find common ground, work like we’re on the same team, and focus on winning global markets. Stable emissions standards are an essential element of a portfolio of policy that America sorely needs to compete.

But we don’t have a single or stable standard today. Instead, over many decades, federal GHG emissions standards have been written, reversed, revised, repealed, rewritten, and litigated ad nauseum, with one administration overcorrecting for its predecessor. We also have a second federal agency, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, writing fuel economy standards that are wholly duplicative of GHG standards and add needless complexity and cost.

With emission standards swinging from extreme to extreme, American manufacturers have been unable to allocate efficiently the capital needed to compete. It’s been messy, and bad for business, especially for domestic auto companies that are most tied to the regulatory seesaw.

Meanwhile, our global competitors grow stronger.

EPA proposes to eliminate all vehicle GHG emissions standards. To be sure, current

standards are not aligned with customer choice and market realities. They need to be eased, and we therefore welcome the EPA’s important efforts in this direction. But pragmatically, eliminating standards altogether is not likely to provide the industry with the long-term stability we need to make historic investments in America and compete globally.

This is super thoughtful, and I think it’s worth reading the whole thing because it’s absolutely correct. While there’s only a passing discussion of this from an environmental standpoint (merely stating that the standard “should align with science and customer choice”), the business case is sound. The bit about China is also absolutely true. Long-term, American automakers are going to eventually get wrecked if they exist only in a regulatory environment that doesn’t encourage them to build better hybrids, EREVs, and even EVs to compete with China, which has a huge head start.

And, you know, we all have to live on this planet.

VW Dieselgate Settlement Partially Struck Down

This month marked the 10th anniversary of Dieselgate, and it seems like Dieselgate never ends. A settlement that involved former CEO Martin Winterkorn and a board member was struck down by a court, which said shareholders essentially lacked information when approving a deal.

From Bloomberg:

The approval of the 2021 pact may be void because VW hadn’t allowed shareholders to ask questions about the assets of Winterkorn and ex-board member Rupert Stadler, the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe ruled on Tuesday, sending that part of the case back to a lower court. Under the agreement, Winterkorn had to pay €11.2 million and Stadler agreed to pay €4.1 million.

The judges struck down the approval of the part of the deal that made the Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance cover €270 million. VW failed to tell shareholders beforehand that the settlement freed most other executives from liability over the affair, the court said. The settlement hinged on the shareholder approval.

The specifics of this are less important than the reminder that these court cases drag on for what feels like forever.

The A290 Rally Trophy Sounds Awesome

Electric cars still have a range issue that makes them not ideal for various forms of racing, but rallying (with its stages) might be one of the few current motorsport disciplines where EVs might work.

French brand Alpine already showed off its incredible A290 Rallye EV race car, and now there are some more details on the A290-specific racing series coming next year:

Building on more than six decades of Renault Group’s experience in one-make cups, the Alpine A290 Rally Trophy will be contested on six rounds of the French Rally Championship. The 16 competitors will compete in a dedicated setting, featuring environmentally friendly charging solutions, technical assistance, an on-site spare parts service, and guaranteed technical and sporting fairness.

In parallel, the Alpine A290 Regional Trophy will be open to crews wishing to compete in eligible rallies and hill climbs, thus facilitating access to competition for all enthusiasts. Similar to the Alpine A290 Rally Trophy, only the five best results will count.

[…]

The Alpine A290 Rally Trophy will offer €19,200 in prize packages at the Rallye National de l’Indre, divided between performance bonuses and spare parts vouchers. Starting next year, this amount will increase to €236,000 while the leading contenders in the Alpine A290 Regional Trophy will compete for a prize fund of €46,000.

If there’s one series I’d love to try my hand at next year, this one has to be near the top… even if I’m a mediocre rally driver (I’ve had training! As Chris Duplessis how stellar I am).

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

It’s an emotional week here at TMD, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to be playing emo songs (I leave the screamo to Thomas). I think everyone here knows that “Highway Patrolman” from Nebraska is my favorite Springsteen song off my favorite album. Hits me hard, and I don’t even have a brother. Did you know there was a video for this? Did you know Sean Penn directed it and it stars Viggo Mortensen and David Morse (and Patricia Arquette!)

The Big Question

What’s the best one-make racing series of all time?

The project will feature new aircraft detection lighting technology to reduce blinking lights at night.

Wisconsin's first large-scale wind farm since 2011 has won state approval.

Badger Hollow Wind Energy Center, a 118-megawatt wind energy project in Iowa and Grant counties, was approved by the Public Service Commission on Sept. 25.

Its 19 wind turbines will produce enough energy to power 30,000 homes, according to Invenergy, the project's Illinois-based developer.

Invenergy expects construction to begin in the summer of 2026 and be completed in 2027. It will be built on 15,700 acres across the towns of Clifton, Eden, Linden, Mifflin and Wingville.

Energy projects larger than 100 megawatts must be approved by the PSC. Smaller wind farms have recently come online without needing the commission's approval.

The 92-megawatt Red Barn Energy Park, in Grant County, began operating its 28 turbines in April 2023. The PSC did approve the acquisition of Red Barn by We Energies parent company WEC Energy Group Inc.

The PSC will vote on an application by utility companies We Energies, Madison Gas and Electric, and Wisconsin Public Service Corp. to assume joint ownership of Badger Hollow once it's completed.

Invenergy said the project's goal is to meet rising energy demands using clean, renewable power.

Nearly 100 landowners have signed leases allowing Badger Hollow to operate on their property, the developer said.

Invenergy said it expects the project will create up to 200 local construction jobs and have a local economic impact of more than $64 million.

“We are grateful to the (PSC) commissioners for their consideration and approval, and to the hundreds of landowners, community leaders, and Wisconsinites who participated in the permitting process,"" said Invenergy's Brandon Davis.

""Invenergy is proud to support Wisconsin’s domestic energy industry, bringing good-paying jobs and long-term investment to local communities across the state,"" Davis said, in a statement.

Badger Hollow is the first proposal to come to the PSC with plans to implement an aircraft detection lighting system.

That new technology limits the impact of blinking lights from the wind farm at night, PSC Commissioner Marcus Hawkins said during the Sept. 25 meeting.

Clean Wisconsin called the PSC's decision a ""significant win for clean energy, local farmers and Wisconsin communities.""

“The environmental, economic and health benefits of this project will be felt for decades,” said Rick Coelho, Clean Wisconsin's rural energy campaign manager. “The PSC’s decision means more economic opportunity and more financial resources for our farming families and communities hosting this project.”

Wisconsin currently has a wind energy capacity of 829 megawatts, just under 3% of the total electric grid, according to federal data. The state is home to 479 utility-scale wind turbines, Hawkins said.

Wind energy development in Wisconsin experienced a lull in the 2010s. That was largely due to local opposition to wind projects, hostility from state lawmakers, and fights over wind farm siting rules, the Journal Sentinel previously reported.

But that has changed in recent years as energy demand increased and siting rules were sorted out.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/01/04/PMJS/72108640007-bh-solar-wind-background.jpg?crop=6594,3711,x0,y69&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-30 13:04:43.978390

Companies that voluntarily buy clean energy play a critical role in clean energy projects being built. Without extensive voluntary commitments by corporate buyers to purchase clean energy, fewer projects will be financed and built, and the U.S. will struggle to meet growing energy demand.

Over the past decade, corporate clean energy procurement has accounted for more than 40% of new U.S. clean energy capacity additions. Corporate procurement enables companies to meet sustainability goals, hedge against unpredictable energy prices, and support the U.S. electricity grid’s expansion and resilience.

The U.S. is demanding more electricity than ever, driven by the rise in artificial intelligence, increased electrification, and resurgent U.S. manufacturing. To meet this demand efficiently and cost-effectively, the U.S. needs to build a lot more clean energy — and fast.

Why Is Corporate Demand for Clean Energy So Important?

A recent CEBA-commissioned study analyzed the scale of impact that corporate offtake provides. Until now, there have been limited data points to show the extent to which long-term corporate virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) enable energy projects to get financed. This study shows how truly vital corporate offtake is in energy projects being built and bringing energy to the grid.

A VPPA is a financial contract between a company and a renewable energy project where the company agrees to buy the project’s power at a fixed price, but without taking physical delivery of the electricity, often contracted for 8-15 years. Corporate buyers guarantee a price for electricity, insulating the projects from the ups and downs of market electricity prices and making it possible for projects to get financing. This long price guarantee from the company gives lenders the assurance they need to provide capital for the project.

Without a corporate buyer, a project’s revenues are dictated by fluctuating wholesale electricity prices, also known as “merchant revenue.” Variability in merchant revenue can lead to periods where projects cannot meet their term debt obligations, resulting in frequency of financial distress. VPPAs – and, to a lesser, but still important, extent, renewable energy certificates (RECs) – are essential instruments to blunt these fluctuations.

VPPAs and RECs Provide Revenue Stability for Clean Energy Buildout

REsurety analyzed the economic performance of 251 wind and solar projects that operate in three major U.S. energy markets: ERCOT (Texas), MISO (Midwest), and PJM (Mid-Atlantic). Here’s what they found:

Corporate VPPAs slash financial distress by up to 90% in key markets: By hedging against volatile market prices, VPPAs provided the revenue stability to reduce the number of project facing financial distress by approximately 80% in ERCOT and over 90% in MISO and PJM compared to the merchant scenario. This stability is critical for securing project financing.

RECs reduce incidents of financial distress by up to 30%: While their impact is less substantial than VPPAs, unbundled REC purchases provide an additional revenue stream that can reduce financial distress compared to purely merchant projects. RECs do not directly mitigate wholesale power price volatility. However, higher REC revenue can lead to more significant reductions in financial distress.

And that may be the single most-feared outcome by industry of repealing the endangerment finding.","UCLA Law’s “Up in the Air” webinar explores the future of federal and state climate policy if the endangerment finding is repealed.

As Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin rushes to rescind the endangerment finding — which some have called “the Holy Grail of U.S. climate policy” — the UCLA Emmett Institute hosted an expert panel discussion on the reasoning and ramifications of such a move.

The effort underlines “an extraordinarily dark time in U.S. environmental politics,” UCLA Law Professor Ann Carlson said during the webinar. “But all is not lost,” she added. If successful, the proposal to revoke the endangerment finding would “take the Clean Air Act off the board as a toolbox for climate policy, but it will not eliminate other tools,” Joseph Goffman, who held top EPA posts in the Obama and Biden administration, said during the webinar. The proposal is partly predicated on a recent Energy Department report that has been widely criticized for “ignoring”, “cherry-picking”, and “misrepresenting” scientific studies, UCLA climate scientist Karen McKinnon said during the panel.

So, what challenges lie ahead for the repeal effort and for federal and state climate policy? Read key highlights from their discussion, which was moderated by the Emmett Institute’s Cara Horowitz. These excerpts have been edited for brevity and clarity. You can watch the full recording above or here.

Q: What is the endangerment finding and why is it important?

Ann Carlson: In order to understand the endangerment finding, we need to go back to Massachusetts v. EPA, that’s the decision that led to EPA regulating greenhouse gases. The court held in a 5-4 decision that greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, methane and others, are covered as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Another important question was whether the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency was required to determine under the Clean Air Act whether those greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. And the court said yes. The agency evaluated the science and determined that in fact greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare — and that the science and law were pretty clear that EPA needed to do something about that by regulating those pollutants.

Joe Goffman: This is a battle exclusively about what authority EPA has under the Clean Air Act and by extension prevailing case law. If the administration’s ambitions are entirely fulfilled to repeal, it’ll take the Clean Air Act off the board as a toolbox for climate policy, but it will not eliminate other tools.

Q: What’s the Trump administration proposing to do, and what are its stated rationales for the proposal?

Joe Goffman: The soundtrack for what the administration is trying to do is Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” because what the administration is assembling is what it hopes will be an impregnable wall against any future action to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. The proposal is a smorgasbord of arguments that either explicitly call on the Supreme Court to reverse Massachusetts v. EPA or set up ‘significance’ threshold tests in terms of the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector or transportation sector that in any conception of the real world are un-meetable — so that the EPA’s authority going forward to regulate either sector will not be viable for future administrations.

Q: Do any of the legal justifications seem particularly strong or particularly weak, do they surprise you at all?

Joe Goffman: A number of these arguments were made by the Bush administration in Massachusetts v. EPA, were undertaken by the Supreme Court and rejected. So what are they up to? I think they’re luring the Supreme Court to either explicitly reverse Massachusetts or fatally disable the authority that the court identified.

Ann Carlson: It really is just a complete rehash of the dissenting opinions in Massachusetts v. EPA — nothing new except for the wholesale assault on the science which is more brazen. I think the bigger surprise is the question of why they are doing this. I think Joe has a good theory which is ‘Let’s get the federal government out of the business altogether of using the Clean Air Act; let’s kneecap a future administration should there be one interested in regulating greenhouse gases.” But there are some consequences that may not be what industry wants. Having national regulation as opposed to state regulation is something industry clamors for all the time. To get the federal government out of the business of regulating — it sure seems like there is a vacuum opened up for states certainly on the power sector side, with oil and gas.

Q: Can you summarize the main scientific criticisms of the Trump administration’s stance? What is the administration getting wrong?

Karen McKinnon: A lot of my research is on heat waves and heat extremes, how they’re changing under climate change. But the Energy Department report came out with these statements that actually greenhouse gas emissions have had little to no effect on heat waves. For almost anyone around the world who has experienced heat — but certainly those of us studying heat — that claim is clearly so wildly inaccurate. They did a custom analysis using relatively low-quality and nonrepresentative data to argue their point, and then basically ignored the giant body of published literature on heat waves that very clearly shows that increasing heat waves are linked to climate change. There was egregious cherry-picking: I wrote a paper on a major heat wave and they took one sentence from my paper that by itself made it seem like the heat wave was just due to weather, but if you included the prior sentence it was very clear that there were climate change components as well. That’s just one anecdote that gets at why I can’t summarize all the scientific concerns. But I think the broad themes were ignoring decades of scientific research, cherry-picking parts from studies, and in some cases just completely misrepresenting studies.

Q: What is still possible in a world without the endangerment finding when it comes to federal policy?

Joe Goffman: “The blunt-force politics until at least 2029 are all stacked against [climate] action. I think we’re looking beyond the Clean Air Act toolbox and beyond the 2028 horizon.

Ann Carlson: There are of course other federal statutes that provide some opportunity to reduce greenhouse gases. One that is probably the most important is that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] retains the ability to regulate fuel economy and efficiency from heavy duty vehicles. If you want to talk about places where policy is important to continue to push technological innovation, the heavy-duty sector is one. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has a lot of interesting power that could be utilized that’s not affected by the Clean Air Act. We retain some tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, including some for wind and solar in the short-term but also for geothermal and other sorts of zero-emission power sources — I don’t think we should write those off. Energy efficiency standards remain, that law remains in effect and it’s super important to be cutting energy through increasingly efficient appliances. So, there are a lot of tools — the Clean Air Act is the centerpiece, but it’s by no means the only way to regulate, and that all remains in effect. So, all is not lost.

Q: What are the effects of this action on state power, particularly California’s authority, including unintended consequences?

Ann Carlson: States are preempted from issuing vehicle standards, but they are not preempted from a whole host of other programs, like California’s Cap-and-Invest program. We have limitations on stationary sources of pollution. Colorado has regulated methane. There is a regional cap-and-trade program in the Northeast. There are also a lot of financial investments that states are making — investments in EV charging infrastructure, which is really important as we try to push toward a clean transportation future; fleet investments in zero emission buses; incentives for heavy-duty trucks to be zero-emission. That’s the baseline.

If the endangerment finding is repealed and that repeal is sustained, the first thing that could happen is we could see the undermining of a case called American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, that’s a case that was issued a number of years ago to say that litigants could not bring federal common law nuisance cases to get emitters to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, because the Clean Air Act regulates greenhouse gases and therefore essentially occupies the field. If the endangerment finding presumably the rational for American Electric Power v. Connecticut is gone. I think that matters in a couple respects: There’s an argument being made by the oil companies that these are federal issues, and states shouldn’t be allowed to use state nuisance claims… I think it’s also the case that some courts have found appealing the argument that states shouldn’t be in the business of regulating something that crosses their borders.

A second issue is in these cases now involving state climate superfund statutes. The Justice Department has been trying to argue in a case challenging Vermont’s climate superfund law that the case has to be struck down because the 2nd Circuit struck down a state common law nuisance case filed in federal court, but that 2nd Circuit case was based on AEP vs. Connecticut. The Justice Department is pretty vigorously going after these climate superfund statues and here they’re undermining themselves in court. If you read the case briefs you can see how they are dancing around the central question, which is that their own EPA is attempting to pull the rug out from under the rational in AEP vs. Connecticut.

And there’s a third possibility that is probably more controversial, but I think is a very valid possibility. If Section 202 of the Clean Air Act doesn’t cover greenhouse gases, then presumably states aren’t preempted from regulating them. This is not a slam-dunk argument, but it certainly is a strong enough argument that if I were a state and the endangerment finding disappeared, I would be evaluating the possibility that I as a state could regulate emissions from vehicles. I would be stunned if California isn’t taking that argument into account. And that may be the single most-feared outcome by industry of repealing the endangerment finding. So, this could be a be-careful-what-you-wish-for moment.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Up-in-the-Air-Background-1.png,N,,2025-09-30 14:01:13.525153

Cox and other industry analysts and executives expect many buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase an EV before the federal incentives sunset.","DETROIT – Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said he expects demand for all-electric vehicles to be slashed in half next month following the end of federal tax incentives on Wednesday.

Farley on Tuesday said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends.

""I think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tail pipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,"" he said during a Ford event about promoting skilled trades and workers in Detroit. ""We're going to find out in a month. I wouldn't be surprised that the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%.""

Farley said the industry learned that ""partial electrification,"" such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept for the time being.

Farley said his Model e EV team is analyzing the demand for non-gas-powered vehicles each day. The company currently offers a handful of all-electric vehicles, including the F-150 Lightning pickup, which can top $90,000, and Mustang Mach-E crossover in the U.S.

The federal EV incentives of up to $7,500 are coming to an end as part of the Trump administration's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" which stripped the old enticement but included some perks for buying a U.S.-assembled vehicle, regardless of it being an EV.

""Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They're fast, they're efficient, you don't go to the gas station, but they're expensive,"" Farley said.

Once the bill was passed, sales of EVs quickly gained traction, especially as some automakers added even more discounts to move out older models.

Cox Automotive forecasts sales of EVs hit 410,000 during the third quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. That would easily be the highest amount of EVs ever sold in a quarter in the U.S., as well as a record 10% market share.

Cox and other industry analysts and executives expect many buyers pulled ahead plans to purchase an EV before the federal incentives sunset.

Farley also said the federal changes mean the auto industry, including Ford, will have to adapt, saying the company will have to figure out what to do with its battery plants and EV capacity.

""We'll fill them, but it will be more stress, because we had a four-year predictable policy,"" Farley said. ""Now the policy changed. ... We all have to make adjustments, and it's going to be good for the country, I believe, but it will be one more stress.""

These seed grants, totaling $400,000, will support innovative, interdisciplinary research across Michigan’s four premier research universities to help prepare the state for a resilient and prosperous future.

The Livable Futures Initiative was born from a May 5 summit in Detroit that convened more than 100 RU4M researchers. The event marked a critical step in leveraging the combined innovation and expertise of Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University to tackle challenges such as changing precipitation patterns, pressures on water and energy systems, and increased risks of flooding and coastal disruption.

Michigan and the Great Lakes region are well-positioned to adapt to climate and demographic shifts, thanks to moderate weather and abundant freshwater resources. The region could see increased population and investment as families and businesses seek reliable access to clean water, energy, and transportation. But seizing these opportunities will require forward-looking solutions and cross-sector collaboration.

“This initiative is about preparing Michigan not just to respond to climate challenges, but to lead in building livable futures for our communities,” said Britany Affolter-Caine, Executive Director of RU4M. “By combining the strengths of our state’s top research institutions, we can develop solutions that safeguard our resources, strengthen our economy, and improve lives.”

The water-focused seed grants will fund projects that explore and advance human health, environmental resilience, and community well-being. Research teams are encouraged to address critical questions, such as:

How can Michigan protect its lakes while meeting increased demand for potable water and wastewater management in growing cities and agricultural sectors?

What strategies will help manage coastlines and low-lying communities vulnerable to flooding?

How can Michigan build a resilient “blue economy” that sustains shipping, energy and fisheries while protecting ecosystems?

A total of $400,000 will be awarded in FY26, with five to six projects anticipated. The program is administered by the University of Michigan Office of the Vice President for Research.

Eligibility: Projects must include at least one investigator from three RU4M institutions; preference will be given to proposals that involve all four.

Funding: Each principal investigator (PI) may request up to $20,000, with a maximum award of $60,000–$80,000 per project depending on the number of institutions involved.

Priorities: Priority will be placed on interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects that incorporate community-based partners. Preference will also be given to tenure-track professors who have not yet attained the rank of associate or full professor.

Proposals will be evaluated based on their significance, innovation, collaboration, stakeholder engagement, and potential to deliver measurable societal impact for Michigan by 2050.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Monday proposed giving coal power generators additional time to comply with new wastewater disposal guidelines and said it also would consider regulatory changes to the Clean Air Act’s Regional Haze Rule.

EPA’s proposals are part of a package of coal-supporting actions the Trump administration unveiled this week, including $625 million to retrofit and recommission coal plants from the Department of Energy.

Extending compliance for EPA’s effluent limitations guidelines would reduce electricity costs by approximately $30 million to $200 million annually, the agency estimated. Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Laurie Williams countered that every day the requirements are delayed means more people “will be exposed to higher levels of toxic pollution.”

Dive Insight:

Residual waste from burning coal contains contaminants including mercury, cadmium and arsenic, according to the EPA. The federal government strengthened regulation on coal combustion residuals following a disastrous coal ash spill from the Tennessee Valley Authoriy’s Kingston plant in 2008, which contaminated some 300 acres of land, making it one of the largest industrial spills in U.S. history.

EPA revised its ELG requirements last year to include stronger protections around coal ash wastewater pollution. The changes included requiring plants to halt some types of discharges by 2029 or to commit by the end of this year to cease burning coal by 2034.

EPA’s proposal would extend both the compliance and the notice deadlines. The agency said the move would “reduce costs for facilities and help with electricity reliability and affordability.” Comments are due 30 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.

EPA’s current ELGs for wastewater discharges from steam electric power plants “are potentially costly to an electric power sector that is struggling with increasing demand as AI is booming, data centers are being constructed and operated around the country, and American industry and manufacturing is resurgent,” the agency said. “This action would give utilities more time to evaluate and plan for evolving energy demand for their customers/ratepayers.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin sought to cast blame on former President Joe Biden for what he and others in the Trump administration have characterized as a reliability crisis.

“Americans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable,” Zeldin said in a statement. “It is time to restore common sense to the programs and regulations.”

But Sierra Club’s Williams said in a statement the change would give “big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways with no care for how many Americans will suffer.” According to the conservation group, the 2024 ELG updates can reduce wastewater pollution by up to 64% and eliminate 325,000 tons of pollution in public waterways every year.

EPA also said it is issuing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit information regarding potential regulatory changes to the implementation and structure of the Regional Haze Rule, which calls for state and federal agencies to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas.

“Historically, the implementation of this program has imposed significant costs on power plants and other sectors, calling into question the supply of affordable and reliable energy for American families,” EPA said. “After years of implementation and feedback from stakeholders, it is clear that the Regional Haze program is broken and needs significant revisions to clarify requirements and alleviate the unnecessary burdens on states and the regulated community, and more closely align with Congressional intent.”

EPA said its advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeks input regarding “how the agency can meaningfully revise the RHR to streamline regulatory requirements impacting states’ visibility improvement obligations.” EPA said it will hold a 60-day public comment period after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.

Pollution from coal “comes with enormous health costs,” the Natural Resources Defense Council said, including . up to $26 billion a year in additional emergency room visits.

R-12 refrigerant (aka “Freon”) was the go-to coolant for more than 50 years. Then it was discovered that chlorine atoms in escaped R-12 molecules accumulated in the atmosphere and damaged the ozone layer.

A new refrigerant, R-134a, came out in 1991 and replaced R-12’s miscreant chlorine atom with a fluorine atom — which breaks down in 10 to 12 years.

To further minimize damage to the environment, another new refrigerant, R-1234yf, was developed and replaced R-134a’s fluorine atom with a propylene atom — which breaks down in one day.

A transition to R-1234yf is underway. Professional mechanics who use refrigerant recovery and recycling (R&R) machines must have special training and EPA Section 609 certification to buy more than 2 lb. of R-1234yf.

Necessary Adjustments

Cans of R-1234yf are at auto parts stores and have Schrader-type valves, which need a matching fitting on R&R machines or sets of pressure gauges.

Older R-134a refrigerant and new R-1234yf refrigerant are not interchangeable. The propylene atoms in R-1234yf make it mildly flammable. For that reason, newer systems are designed with spark-free compressors and other components.

If farmers have on-farm R&R machines, they can be carefully flushed between exposures to R-134a and R-1234yf, but the newer refrigerant is slightly caustic. Long-term exposure to R-1234yf can damage internal components in machines designed for R-134a.

Farmers who own a set of air conditioning gauges have a similar situation.

“You can buy adapters to hook up an R-134a set of gauges to a R-1234yf system,” says Jeff Weidecke, trainer for MasterCool refrigerant handling systems. “If a guy has an R-134a set of gauges and uses adapter fittings, he’s going to start the vehicle up, disconnect from whatever keg or 1 lb. can they’re using and turn on the machine’s air conditioning system so the clutch and compressor engage. Any R-134a refrigerant left in the hoses will be boiled off and pulled into the vehicle’s R-134a system. Then you can run R-1234yf through those gauges to check or fill a system.”

Weidecke notes that because R-1234yf is a more efficient than R-134a, compressors and other air conditioning system components are smaller, and less refrigerant is used.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ASSAILED wind since his first day in office, when he signed an executive order declaring a moratorium on permits, new leases and lease renewals for all wind projects.
BluEarth Renewables’ Two Rivers Wind Project had completed lengthy impact reviews and was awaiting its permit from the Bureau of Land Management when Trump issued his executive order blocking new wind projects.
The Lucky Star Wind Project is still in the planning stages, nimble enough for BluEarth to pivot on location.
Fewer wind projects translates to lost economic opportunities for the state, where revenue from wind projects primarily goes toward supporting public schools.","Greg Dale saw it coming. In August, the letter he’d been dreading arrived in the mail, notifying his harbor’s office that the federal government was withdrawing $427 million in funding for the construction of a wind terminal in Humboldt Bay, California.

As Humboldt Bay Harbor District’s commissioner, Dale had been worried about the offshore wind port ever since President Donald Trump campaigned to stop the rise of renewables, which he denounced as the “scam of the century.” Federal funds make up half of the port project’s total projected cost, and for now, state grants are enough to keep it going until construction starts. “We are taking it one day at a time,” Dale said.

The Humboldt Bay terminal, a heavy-duty port, would facilitate the final assembly of 600-plus-foot-tall floating turbines before they’re hauled out to sea. It would play a critical role in the installation of wind farms in the Pacific Ocean, where no turbines are currently spinning.

The terminal is just one casualty of the Trump administration’s war on both offshore and onshore wind. In addition to slashing funding, the federal government has used the federal permitting process to hamper wind projects that are on the verge of coming online. Meanwhile, developers are forced to place projects on indefinite hold or scramble for alternative plans. Experts say that Trump’s anti-wind crusade threatens the country’s green energy future by driving up costs and threatening power reliability.

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ASSAILED wind since his first day in office, when he signed an executive order declaring a moratorium on permits, new leases and lease renewals for all wind projects. In response, Washington, D.C. and 17 states, including six in the West, sued the administration in a case that is still ongoing.

The federal government says it is simply ending the unfair advantages that the Biden administration gave to renewable energy development. “Where actions have paused or been rescinded, the rationale centers on reliability, national security, stewardship and eliminating policies that gave wind/solar preferential treatment,” said Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the Department of the Interior, told HCN in an email.

In September, the Department of Energy announced plans to claw back $13 billion in funding for clean energy projects, including subsidies for wind, though it didn’t specify which programs will be impacted.

The Trump administration has gone after offshore wind with particular gusto. Humboldt Bay was just one of 12 port development projects that lost previously awarded federal funding. On the East Coast, where the offshore wind industry is further along than in the West, wind farms have been thoroughly pummeled, with approvals frozen and projects canceled amid a flurry of mixed messages. In August, the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management halted construction for a wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island, even though it was already 80% complete. In late September, a federal judge ruled that the project can continue.

Because all offshore wind projects occur in federal waters, they need approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management before construction can begin. This makes offshore wind particularly vulnerable to the whims of an administration like Donald Trump’s. Onshore wind is less at risk, because projects can sidestep most federal permitting if developers set up shop on state or private lands.

But even land-based projects are feeling the impact of the administration’s anti-wind agenda. In July, the Department of the Interior mandated that all projects go through additional layers of review from its leadership, a move that experts say stymies permitting. Less than a month later, Interior cancelled Idaho’s Lava Ridge Wind Project, a Biden-approved venture that Trump had singled out in his executive order.

CARBON COUNTY, WYOMING is a microcosm for how wind projects are faring in today’s turbulent political climate. Some projects are safe, while others await approval and remain vulnerable.

The projects closest to breaking ground are most at risk of disruption. BluEarth Renewables’ Two Rivers Wind Project had completed lengthy impact reviews and was awaiting its permit from the Bureau of Land Management when Trump issued his executive order blocking new wind projects. “It would not be economically feasible for (BluEarth developers) to back up and rethink,” said Carbon County Commissioner Sue Jones. BluEarth declined HCN’s request for comment.

Construction is already underway for the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, slated to be the largest in the U.S. The project seems to have skirted danger for now, given that the developer secured its final permit last year. The Lucky Star Wind Project is still in the planning stages, nimble enough for BluEarth to pivot on location. According to Jones, BluEarth initially proposed to erect turbines on a combined spread of federal and private lands. It has since modified its plans and will build entirely on private holdings.

“The public really needs to be involved in the consideration of these projects.”

But relocating wind projects from federal to private land is not a perfect solution. Wind developers may encounter more expensive leases from private landlords, which could translate to steeper energy prices for customers when the turbines finally start spinning. Projects on private ground also don’t have to undergo the same extensive environmental reviews and public comment process that their public-land counterparts do. “There are ways to site energy in a way that reflects community values,” said John Robison, the public lands and wildlife director of the advocacy group Idaho Conservation League. “The public really needs to be involved in the consideration of these projects.”

ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST, investment in future wind energy projects is grinding to a halt as companies take note of the new restrictions, even in states that have been pushing for renewable energy development.

In the last five years, New Mexico quadrupled the number of wind projects on state land. But now, that growth is sputtering. “We are seeing a real slowdown in our office on inquiries, applications and requests for information around big renewable projects,” said Stephanie Garcia Richard, New Mexico’s commissioner of public lands.

A year ago, Garcia Richard said, “we couldn’t keep up with the demand for new projects.” But since January 2025, no power companies have approached her office to propose wind construction.

New Mexico is one of the top five states with the greatest wind energy potential, but a third of its budget still comes from fossil fuels sales. Stalled wind investments will keep the state hooked on hydrocarbons, even as it works to diversify its energy sources. Fewer wind projects translates to lost economic opportunities for the state, where revenue from wind projects primarily goes toward supporting public schools. Nationwide, stifling planned wind energy projects means losing out on the thousands of jobs projects would create, as well as millions of dollars in tax and lease revenues.

For now, states and energy companies with diverse portfolios are pulling back on wind investment, doubling down instead on other renewable resources to meet their emission targets. But experts say the federal blitz on wind probably won’t sink the sector entirely — wind energy makes financial sense, since it’s cheaper than burning fossil fuels — only delay its progress. It also serves as an indispensable tool for slashing the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.

“The wind industry is not going to die,” said Mark Jacobson, energy and atmospheric scientist at Stanford University. “It’s going to come back, because it’s so beneficial.”

For these reasons, Dale remains optimistic that the Humboldt Bay port will materialize. Construction is still slated for 2026, with the goal of erecting California’s first floating turbine in 2030. By that time, political favor may shift again, perhaps even favoring the industry, but the importance of wind power likely won’t change. “I’m believer in the industry,” Dale said. “It’s a no-brainer.”

The flood of expert comments on the Climate Working Group report demonstrates that the scientific community is pushing back hard against these tactics.","This month, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) filed comments and submitted a letter signed by more than 1,000 scientists opposing the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which affirmed the agency’s responsibility and obligation under the Clean Air Act to regulate the health-harming heat-trapping emissions driving climate change. At the heart of the Trump Administration’s attempt to dislodge this cornerstone of federal climate action is a polished piece of fossil fuel disinformation: a sham report by a so-called Climate Working Group convened in secret by US Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright and US EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

Hundreds of experts submitted comments exposing the report’s misleading use of data and cherry-picked conclusions. The American Meteorological Society issued a powerful statement identifying five foundational flaws that place the report at odds with scientific principles and practices. Texas A&M University climate scientist Andy Dessler worked with 85 experts and compiled a 459-page response to the report, exposing fundamental errors that misrepresent the overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change. UCS filed comments underscoring the ways this deeply flawed DOE-commissioned document distorts science, delays action, and undermines public understanding of the crisis we are facing.

Together with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), UCS is suing to enforce federal legal requirements that apply to the committee that wrote the report. The lawsuit—against the DOE and Secretary Christopher Wright in his official capacity as head of that department, the EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in his official capacity as head of that agency, and the Climate Working Group—argues that the establishment and use of the Climate Working Group violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires fairly balanced viewpoints, public participation and transparency for committees like this one that advise the federal government on policy. On September 17, the court granted partial summary judgment as sought by UCS and EDF, ruling that the Climate Working Group is not exempt from FACA under an exception the government had argued should apply. The case is ongoing.

The scientific critiques are extensive and compelling, and they prompted me to scrutinize the authors behind the report. Who wrote it, and what do their records tell us about why the science they produced was so deeply flawed? Not surprisingly, these scientists’ names and viewpoints were familiar from previous research by UCS and others, congressional testimony, and other public appearances.

John Christy: Winning fossil fuel friends by distorting climate data to minimize warming

John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has repeatedly advanced analyses of atmospheric data that independent researchers have shown to be flawed. Even after corrections brought those records into line with surface temperatures and model projections, Christy has continued promoting outdated interpretations.

At the same time, Christy has been a familiar presence in fossil fuel industry-funded circles including the Heartland Institute, Cato Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Independent Institute, Global Warming Policy Foundation, and George C. Marshall Institute. He was even recommended for a federal climate role by ExxonMobil’s top lobbyist in the early 2000s.

As noted by Inside Climate News, he has frequently been invited to testify before Congress by “Republican lawmakers looking to cast doubt on the science of human-caused climate change.” In 2013, for example, Christy testified before the House Science Committee, chaired by then-Representative Lamar Smith. Smith, a recipient of significant fossil fuel industry campaign contributions, surrounded himself with staff tied to industry lobbying and PR firms. Under Smith’s leadership, the House Science Committee even subpoenaed UCS as part of an effort to intimidate scientists and accountability advocates.

Christy’s role in the Climate Working Group’s report likely ensured that long-debunked science was presented as if it were credible dissent.

Steven Koonin: Emphasizing doubt and serving fossil fuel interests

Steve Koonin has become known for portraying climate science as “unsettled.” His arguments consistently highlight uncertainty while downplaying the weight of evidence that climate change—caused primarily by burning oil, gas, and coal—is happening. This framing—promoted by ExxonMobil in a notorious 2000 New York Times advertorial—has been widely criticized by Koonin’s scientific peers for misrepresenting the state of knowledge.

Koonin’s career also links directly to fossil fuels. He was BP’s Chief Scientist for five years and later joined think tanks such as the Hoover Institution, which received $430,000 from ExxonMobil from 1998-2019, and the American Enterprise Institute, which has received millions of dollars in funding from ExxonMobil and over $2 million from Koch-related foundations. The selective way Koonin treats evidence aligns neatly with the interests of polluting industries.

Roy Spencer: Analytic errors and fossil fuel ties

Roy Spencer, another researcher at the University of Alabama, has co-authored analyses that independent scientists found contained serious errors. For example, a paper he co-wrote was so flawed that the journal editor resigned, acknowledging it should not have been published. Spencer was a signatory of the 2017 petition organized by retired MIT professor Richard Lindzen of the Cato Institute urging President Trump to pull out of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The claims in the petition were debunked by UCS.

Spencer also has close ties to networks that deny climate science, including the Cornwall Alliance, which the Guardian says “essentially believes God wouldn’t let damaging climate change happen,” and which, according to DeSmog, “claims environmentalism is ‘one of the greatest threats to society and the church today.’” Spencer was also formerly a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

According to PR Watch, in 2016 Spencer was listed as a creditor of Peabody Energy (at the time the world’s largest private-sector, publicly traded coal company) in its bankruptcy filings along with other figures from the network of climate denial and disinformation (such as Willie Soon, whose fossil fuel industry-funded contrarian climate science research was exposed in UCS’s 2015 Climate Deception Dossiers). PR Watch notes that Spencer was paid $4,000 to serve as an expert witness for Peabody Energy in an administrative hearing on the social cost of carbon in Minnesota.

Judith Curry: Cashing in on doubt

Judith Curry, professor emerita at the Georgia Institute of Technology (and who resigned from the university in 2017 citing the “craziness in the field of climate science”), has built a post-academic career critiquing mainstream climate assessments as overstating risks.

Her record includes notable instances where her work did not stand up to scrutiny. In Held v. State of Montana, a landmark climate case brought by young people, Curry was hired as an expert witness for the state. She charged at least $30,000 for her report, yet admitted in her deposition that she had never conducted research on Montana’s climate. The state ultimately excluded her testimony.

Curry’s consulting firm works with utilities, insurers, and fossil fuel companies, which has raised concerns about potential undue influence of commercial interests over her public positions. Her involvement with groups such as the Global Warming Policy Foundation and Heartland Institute reinforces the picture of a climate skeptic, whose skepticism is consistently aligned with industry agendas.

Ross McKitrick: Economics that excuse pollution

Ross McKitrick, an economist at the University of Guelph, has repeatedly advanced arguments that downplay the costs of fossil fuel pollution. His work often isolates narrow aspects of environmental economics while ignoring broader scientific evidence on climate risks, leading to conclusions that are inconsistent with mainstream climate science. In a public response to the Climate Working Group report, leading environmental and climate economists commented that its findings are “woefully out of date” and rely on “an array of fallacies.”

As the University of Oxford’s Ben Franta has observed, the role of some economists in opposing climate policies has received less attention than the role of physical scientists. In a 2021 study focused on an influential group of economists hired by the petroleum industry whose work played a key role in undermining numerous major climate policy initiatives in the US over a span of decades, Franta concluded that “further attention is needed on the role of economists and particular economic paradigms, doctrines, and models within climate politics and the perpetuation of fossil fuels.”

McKitrick is a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, which has received funding from fossil fuel interests including the Charles Koch Foundation. He has endorsed denialist declarations, collaborating with groups like the Heartland Institute and CO2 Coalition that spread climate science disinformation. In 2023, a month after the publication of a peer-reviewed study led by my UCS colleagues linking worsening forest fires across the western United States to fossil fuel companies, McKitrick wrote that “science tells us” forest fires aren’t becoming more common. In fact, there is a growing body of evidence highlighting the dangerous connections between heat-trapping emissions and wildfires.

A web of contrarian science and fossil fuel industry influence

Each of these authors has a record of disputed or selective analyses that deny or downplay the severity of the climate crisis, and each has ties to fossil fuel–funded institutions or front groups that benefit from such narratives. The Trump Administration’s choice to elevate these five voices is not a neutral decision: it reflects a political choice to prioritize contrarianism embraced by a tiny minority of scientific voices over credible, peer-reviewed research that represents the overwhelming scientific consensus.

The problem isn’t just who funds or amplifies these contrarian voices. Their science itself is bad, built on errors, cherry-picked data, and arguments that have been repeatedly rejected by the broader scientific community. When flawed science and fossil fuel influence reinforce each other, the result is a dangerous distortion of public understanding and obstruction of science-based policymaking.

To reveal the extent of fossil fuel industry influence on the proposed rollback of the endangerment finding—based in part on the Climate Working Group’s deeply flawed report—Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has launched an investigation, requesting documents from dozens of fossil fuel companies, trade associations, and polluter-backed groups by September 30.

The sham Climate Working Group report follows a disinformation playbook that UCS has long documented, through which industry-backed actors create the illusion of legitimate debate, exploit uncertainty, and delay action. Big Tobacco was among the first to deploy these tactics and networks, and the fossil fuel industry continues to unleash and hone them, as my team at UCS showed in our latest report, Decades of Deceit.

The flood of expert comments on the Climate Working Group report demonstrates that the scientific community is pushing back hard against these tactics. But this debacle underscores the urgent need for stronger, more consistent safeguards against political and corporate interference in public policy in the face of Trump administration efforts to weaken scientific integrity policies across federal agencies—read more in this blog by my colleague Jules Barbati-Dajches. Fortunately, science-based law and policy is holding its own globally: my colleague Delta Merner explains that international legal bodies are affirming the connections between science, responsibility, and justice.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Companies that voluntarily buy clean energy play a critical role in clean energy projects being built. Without extensive voluntary commitments by corporate buyers to purchase clean energy, fewer projects will be financed and built, and the U.S. will struggle to meet growing energy demand.

A new study commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) provides some of the strongest data to date that long-term corporate virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) are crucial in getting new renewable energy projects off the ground.

Misti Groves, senior vice president of U.S. Strategy at CEBA, noted, ""It confirms that corporate buyers are critical to ensuring the U.S. can build enough clean energy at the pace and scale that's needed to meet skyrocketing power demand from the growth in artificial intelligence, electrification, and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing.""

David Groleau, executive vice president of Pine Gate Renewables, which develops, owns, and operates utility scale solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., said, ""Corporate buyers are the backbone of clean energy deployment, anchoring project financing and shaping the future of reliable, cost-effective power.""

The study, which was completed by renewable energy data company REsurety, analyzed the economic performance of 251 wind and solar projects across three major power markets — Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and PJM Interconnection — and found that revenues for such projects often face significant financial headwinds without corporate buyer support.

Corporate clean energy buyers often enter into long-term contracts with clean energy projects to purchase the future electricity produced for a fixed price, through a contract called a VPPA. It's only possible to finance a project if the loan provider knows who will buy the electricity and at what price, so without these contracts, projects won't get the necessary loans to finance development.

REsurety found that VPPAs reduce the number of projects facing financial distress — defined as a negative cash flow — by 90% in MISO and PJM, and 80% in ERCOT.

""In this next year, as renewable energy projects aim to meet deadlines for tax credits, the support and cooperation of corporate buyers will give developers the confidence to advance spending to secure tax credits to reduce the cost of renewable energy,"" said Joan Hutchinson, managing director of Offtake Advisory, Marathon Capital.

Renewable energy certificates (RECs) also have an impact, reducing projects in financial distress by 30% and providing additional stable revenue.

Over the past decade, corporate buyers have become a steadying force in the U.S. clean energy market, accounting for more than 40% of new U.S. clean energy capacity additions. Maintaining that momentum is essential to ensuring that U.S. clean energy electricity grows at the pace and scale needed to meet the momentous challenge of increasing demand.

""The acceleration of corporate purchases from clean energy projects transformed the U.S. market over the past 10 years, providing developers and owners long-term, stable revenues on projects and a view on future demand to help maintain continued growth,"" said Emily Cohen, chief commercial officer of Primergy. ""As new markets evolve, we are excited to see more corporates buying energy across the country to bring the benefits of new energy resources.""

The Clean Energy Buyers Association is a business trade association that activates a community of energy customers and partners to deploy market and policy solutions for a carbon emissions-free energy system. CEBA's more than 400 members comprise one-fifth of the Fortune 500, represent more than $33 trillion in market capitalization, and include institutional energy customers of every type and size — corporate and industrial companies, universities, and cities.

(WTWO/WAWV) — The Vigo County School Board approved the signing of a contract from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management for a heavy-duty bus grant.

The grant will help cover the cost of replacing some of the older diesel school buses with electric buses instead.

The total amount for the grant was $3,920,000.00. This will help offset the costs of purchasing electric buses and end up costing the same amount as buying a new diesel bus would.

“We actually received [the grant] last January,” said Dr. Newport. “Working through the Indiana Department of Environmental Management were able to finally get the contracts in hand just last week.”

The school corporation is expected to see 7 new electric school buses this fall and 7 more in 2026.

Dr. John Newport, VCSC Deputy Superintendent says it costs 10 to 15 dollars a day to run an electric bus, but it costs 75 to 100 dollars a day to run a diesel bus.

“We’ll see a lot of savings in fuel,” said Dr. Newport. “That’s the obvious part. The other part that will see a lot of savings is the maintenance. The diesel engine, that diesel components, require a lot of maintenance for procedures that we’re not going to need to do anymore so that’s going to be a savings with that as far as the parts and labor.”

The VCSC will hold their next board meeting on October 20th at the administration building. The public is always welcome to sit in on meetings.

Island Green Power wants to build Lime Down Solar Park on land north of the M4 near Malmesbury in Wiltshire, and says it will provide energy to power 115,000 homes a year.

The farm, which would span six villages including Hullavington, Stanton St Quintin, Sherston and Luckington, has been criticised by councillors and also campaigners over fears it would create a ""permanent scar"" on the landscape.

Due to the scale of the plans, permission will be decided by Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, Ed Miliband.

Lime Down Solar Park would be four miles wide (6.4km) and two miles (3.2km) deep, with solar panels that would stand at 14.7ft (4.5m) tall - the height of a double decker bus and a UK-first, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

A number of battery storage systems would also be built as part of the scheme, one the height of a five-storey building.

A 196ft (60m) wide corridor for a 12.4m (20km) cable to the substation in Melksham would also be built, passing under the M4 and the Bristol-to-London railway line.

Wiltshire councillors, who will not get a chance to vote on the proposals, described the scheme as a ""solar factory"" and criticised the ""industrial"" nature of the design.

During a meeting in July to discuss the plans, Sherston councillor Martin Smith said Lime Down Solar Park would ""create an industrialised landscape to evolve into a permanent scar on the county's countryside"".

The Planning Inspectorate is expected to decide if it can accept the application for examination by 17 October.

The application will then go through several stages - which could take more than a year - before construction work begins.

The decision can be appealed and grounds for a judicial review can be reviewed at the High Court.

Even without those federal tax credits, state leaders say they still want people to invest in the future, which they believe is electric.

State officials say they will use other funds to push clean energy and increase the number of charging stations across Washington.

The federal tax credit was passed by the Biden administration in 2022.

The incentive is $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used.

Not every electric vehicle is eligible for the incentive. Some electric Jeeps, Rivians, Chevys, and others are excluded.

To see the full list of what you can and can’t use the credit for, click here.

​Experts say that without the tax credit, the demand for EVs will go down. They tell us this could slow manufacturing and ultimately make electric cars more expensive.

Washington got rid of its state tax exemption earlier this year, but officials say they’ll continue the push toward less pollution by using funds from the “Climate Commitment Act” for clean energy and expanding charging stations.

A survey by Cox Automotive shows 65% of people who plan on buying an EV in the next two years still plan to do so even without the tax credit.

It also shows that around 20% of buyers plan on going with a hybrid or traditional gas vehicle instead.

Reports show that people’s top concerns when buying a car are saving money on gas and helping the environment.

In order to take last-minute advantage of this credit, by this evening, you need to have a binding contract and make a payment on an eligible EV, but you do not need to have the keys in hand.

It’s designed to keep promising startups in Louisiana by supplying the capital they need to scale without leaving the state.

The fund provides investments between $250,000 and $1 million to high-growth, scalable Louisiana startups (or startups that are willing to relocate to Louisiana). Every dollar a startup raises privately is matched with a dollar in public capital, up to the aforementioned $1 million.

The first four companies to receive investments through the Louisiana Growth Fund have been awarded a combined $3.3 million. They are:

28bio, a New Orleans-based neurotechnology firm that engineers human brain organoid models to improve the ability to predict which therapies will work in humans.

CodeGig, a software firm with an office in Baton Rouge that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to help industrial companies predict and monitor their carbon emissions and track their tax credit incentives.

Hampr, a Lafayette-founded app-based on-demand laundry service that picks up, washes, folds and returns customers’ laundry via contracted “washrs.”

Pet Krewe, a New Orleans-based pet products company originally known for pet costumes that is now expanding its portfolio to include affordable and healthy pet food.

LA.IO Director of Innovation Capital Anna deTiege told Daily Report that the $3.3 million invested so far is just the beginning, as there are already 16 other companies in the growth fund’s pipeline.

“It’s not just about four investments,” deTiege said. “It’s about building momentum.”

While deTiege and LED Chief Innovation Officer Josh Fleig are the growth fund’s architects, LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois said she stands ready to assist by helping to shape the policy that will make it easier for companies to stay and scale in Louisiana.

Now the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project has surpassed 80% completion, which represents a major milestone for the Kingdom’s ambitions to build the world’s largest green hydrogen and ammonia facility. The project has been brought closer to completion thanks to a global consortium of EPC giants driving construction and technology delivery. This development underscores the potential that the project has to completely revolutionize clean fuel production and exports.

The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project integrates a diverse portfolio of renewable generation assets

The project is unlike anything the world has ever seen, integrating several key renewable generation assets to power large-scale green hydrogen production. The site will feature a hub of different energy generation assets that will enable the facility to produce up to 1.2 million tonnes of green ammonia annually, which will be exported through a purpose-built jetty to global markets, enabling the continuation of global decarbonization efforts.

Among the assets on site will be:

Wind power: 257 wind turbines will deliver 1.6 GW of clean wind energy

Solar power: A solar farm the size of Manhattan is being built to generate 2.2 GW of solar capacity

Transmission grid: A dedicated 4 GW transmission network will be constructed to distribute renewable energy

The groundbreaking project is being developed by the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (NGHC), a joint venture between ACWA Power, Air Products, and NEOM, with Air Products serving as the primary EPC contractor and system integrator. They will also be responsible for the engineering, procurement, and construction processes of both the hydrogen and ammonia facilities.

The project will position the Kingdom as a global leader in the renewable energy sector

Air Products will hold the exclusive 30-year offtake rights for all green ammonia produced, and the company will reap the benefits of the EPC agreement, which is valued at around $6.7 billion. The solar and wind farms, along with the transmission grid, will be the responsibility of the EPC contractor, Larsen & Toubro (L&T).

The Kingdom has stated that the project remains on schedule and has the potential to revolutionize the energy sector across the world. An update states that 4 GW of solar and wind power generation is set for completion by mid-2026, after that comes the commissioning of the electrolysers and first ammonia product availability in 2027.

The hydrogen sector has seen significant investments in the past few years that equate to billions of dollars. The NGHC released a statement updating the progress being made in the project.

“In May 2023, NGHC achieved a landmark financial close of $8.4 billion, supported by a $6.1 billion non-recourse loan from 23 local, regional, and international banks and financial institutions, including SIDF and NIF. This pioneering project directly supports the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 ambitions to drive economic diversification and global leadership in clean energy — paving the way for Saudi Arabia to become the world’s leading hydrogen producer while strengthening its role as a key player in the global energy sector.” – NGHC

The Road to Texas Tech Texas Tech first appeared on Sy’s radar when a friend decided to attend a year earlier.
“I didn’t know if that was going to be pre-med or some other type of field that was research-based.” Giving his all at Texas Tech Since finding his place at Texas Tech, Sy has worked beyond academic endeavors to broaden his perspective.
“For me, I’ve been able to do what I’ve done because of the people and resources here at Texas Tech,” he said.
“Texas Tech really gives you a door to open up and look at all these possibilities for what you want to do.","This senior microbiology major has already been accepted to medical school, and Texas Tech provided the pathway, support and resources to help him get there.

This senior microbiology major has already been accepted to medical school, and Texas Tech provided the pathway, support and resources to help him get there.

As it turns out, Texas Tech University was just what Sy Bogutski was looking for – and possessed a few things he didn’t know he was looking for.

Sy initially was charmed by the school’s ABCs, its activities, its buzz and its community, and not necessarily in that order. For Sy, Texas Tech was comfortable and challenging. It rapidly became the place where he wanted to settle in and write the next chapter of his life.

“I came here because I visited the campus and I loved everything about it,” he said. “I just felt a sense of community here, which I guess sounds kind of corny to say, but it was very different from my high school that I had been used to.”

Ah, Sy’s high school. He grew up in north Dallas near the suburb of Richardson, but his prep school days were a different experience from many. He attended Dallas International School with everything taught in French.

Yes, you read that right.

Consequently, he spent a dozen years learning in French, not just the language, but subjects like math, science and history as well.

Sacrebleu, indeed.

By Sy’s estimation, there were about 20 in his graduating class, making Texas Tech and all it had to offer a substantial change. There was also one other driving motivation for attending Texas Tech: It was one of a limited number of schools offering the Undergraduate to Medical School Initiative (UMSI).

“They have a lot of incredible programs here,” he said, “but one they have is UMSI, where you apply to medical school in high school, and it’s unique to Texas Tech. I can name maybe a handful of other schools that do something similar, and they are in the northeast part of the country or Ivy League schools.”

The Honors College and the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center are partners in the UMSI program, which is designed for students interested in becoming medical doctors. By meeting certain requirements and deadlines, a select group of first-year students entering the Honors College are guaranteed admission to TTUHSC School of Medicine upon completion of their bachelor’s degree at Texas Tech.

Sy, a fourth-year microbiology student in the Department of Biological Sciences, applied for the program, but unfortunately wasn’t accepted. However, the setback did nothing to deter his resolve.

Instead, he put his head down and worked hard for two years. Then, at the start of his third year he applied to the Early Acceptance Program (EAP). This allows students to apply to medical school a year earlier and likewise does not require them to take the MCAT if accepted.

This time, Sy was accepted, and he is scheduled to begin classes at the TTUHSC School of Medicine following graduation in the spring.

The Road to Texas Tech

Texas Tech first appeared on Sy’s radar when a friend decided to attend a year earlier. She had also applied to the same health care program and had plenty of good things to say about life on the Lubbock campus. Sy visited several times and was easily won over by all Texas Tech had to offer.

“The people here were just so nice,” he said. “The campus was nice. The programs were great, and we’re pretty good at sports, which is a pretty big part of it. It’s always fun to be able to go to football games or basketball games and know your teams are competitive. It just all felt like a really good fit.”

Sy had visited a couple of other Texas universities, but they did not give him the same sense of connection. Texas Tech, he came to realize, was just his style.

Another factor in Texas Tech’s favor was its status as a Carnegie Classification of Higher Education “Very High Research Activity” Institution. That really resonated with Sy, who is now doing cutting-edge work for which he has received national recognition in the lab of Ethan Chen.

His research involves tiny molecules called mirtrons, which have become important recently because some studies have shown they may play a large role in cancer and immune system problems.

Originally, Sy was a biochemistry major, but he changed his path midway through his first year after realizing chemistry didn’t hold his interest. He soon made the switch to microbiology.

“Because I was on the health care track, I felt like I needed to stand out,” he said. “I wanted to do something that would kind of make me follow my own path rather than just doing what a lot of pre-med researchers do.”

So far, his research team has unearthed several fascinating possibilities, including that cancer cells may produce specific mirtrons with a special shape that helps them avoid being broken down by the body. The mirtrons are packaged into small bubbles, called exosomes, and sent out of the cancer cell. Then, once outside, the mirtrons can interact with immune cells and may even disrupt how those cells respond to cancer.

The team is working to understand how cancer cells use the mirtrons to survive and hide from the immune system. According to Sy, the preliminary data indicate the mirtrons not only prevent immune cells from attacking the tumor, but they may also reprogram some of them to support and protect the cancer.

The thinking is if they can figure out how this process happens, it might open the door to novel ways of treating cancer through targeting the mirtrons. The work received the Portz Interdisciplinary Fellowship Award, and an accompanying $5,000 stipend, from the National Collegiate Honors Council, making Sy the first Texas Tech student to receive the prestigious and highly competitive national prize.

There’s more at stake here for Sy than that.

“It’s shown me how meaningful research can lead to real change, not just in the lab, but in people’s lives,” he said.

The impact of lab experiences

All of this comes as no surprise to Chen, an assistant professor who joined the Biological Sciences department in 2022 and focuses some of his research on tumor immunology. He said he and Sy became acquainted almost two years ago.

“He reached out and expressed a strong interest in joining my lab,” Chen recalled. “From the outset, he demonstrated a clear focus on pursuing research in the areas of immunology and epidemiology. This is something different from other undergraduate students who usually express interest to gain hands-on experience without a clear and defined interest in a specific research area.”

Sy knew he wanted to get into a lab and do meaningful work under the watchful eye of a mentor/researcher. He wasn’t sure, though, which path to take – and there were so many to choose from.

To his way of thinking, he might have idled too much during his first year as he transitioned to college life.

“I had been just getting used to Lubbock and getting used to being at college,” he recalled. ""I applied to six or seven different labs, and I only heard back from two of them. One was working with mosquitoes, which didn’t sound too appealing to me, so I declined that offer.”

At first, Sy thought he had made a mistake because he went several weeks without any other lab offers. But then, he heard from Chen, whose research interests were much aligned with his own. It would be the opportunity to work with cancer cells and tumors and how they function.

“I thought that was super cool,” he said.

Chen invited Sy into his lab and gave him the space and confidence to grow. He also taught him the tools of the trade like how to culture cells from one plate to another without having them die during the process. Sy had found his happy place, calling the chance to work in Chen’s lab amazing.

Likewise, Chen values the working relationship the two have built.

“I have over 20 undergraduate researchers in my lab, and Sy stands out as the only one I’ve never had to worry about in terms of academic performance, research progress or overall responsibility,” he said. “He is remarkably creative and consistently brings fresh, insightful ideas to both his coursework and research, and he is exceptionally disciplined.”

Chen reinforces that last claim with numbers. Sy spends more than 20 hours a week in the lab but also stays busy with a number of extracurricular activities that includes tutoring other students. And he has maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout his academic career.

Not bad for a young man who thought his professional path might be more likely in engineering and who didn’t even really sniff a “real” biology class until college.

Then came that fateful day in high school when he had the opportunity to shadow an oncologist.

And everything changed.

“I thought it was just really, really interesting,” he said. “Everything he did fascinated me, especially being able to see patients. He was talking to them and then diagnosing them and then going over treatment plans. It was incredible, and it got me leaning toward health care.”

Family matters cemented his aspirations as several of Sy’s grandparents faced cancer.

“As I went into college, I realized that I wanted to do something related to health care,” he said. “I didn’t know if that was going to be pre-med or some other type of field that was research-based.”

Giving his all at Texas Tech

Since finding his place at Texas Tech, Sy has worked beyond academic endeavors to broaden his perspective. He has joined several cancer-focused organizations, giving him a window into the faces of people dealing with the disease.

One of these groups makes trips to the Joe Arrington Cancer Research & Treatment Center and the UMC Cancer Center and offers small gifts, including their presence and encouragement.

“We just try to be there for them,” he said. “We want to try and make their day just a little bit better because nobody really wants to be in a cancer center. That’s not a fun place to be.”

It’s that situational awareness and compassion for others that has caught the attention of colleagues in Sy’s lab, like Reagan Farrell.

“I really admire how Sy is so consistent and dedicated to his project,” Reagan said. “Thanks to his hard work, he has been able to propel the work of others and become a more independent researcher. He is very methodical and observant.”

Those qualities have Sy laser-focused on cancer research. He sees his medical future as a calling, the opportunity to give back to a community and to be the healing hands for others.

And he has the pen and paper for his next chapter, having already applied to and been accepted to medical school.

“Right now, a lot of my friends are applying, but this summer and the next year for me are like 10 times easier because I don’t have to worry about that anymore,” he said. “I already have a guaranteed spot. I just have to keep doing my thing, and I’ll be good.”

Years after landing in Lubbock, Sy has no regrets. Texas Tech delivered on everything he hoped it would – and more.

“It definitely exceeded my expectations,” he said. “Some of my friends at other schools are kind of struggling at this point and doing all these things while I’m relaxing. That’s one of the things that’s great about Texas Tech. There’s so many pathways that you can take to do what you want to do in the end.”

Sy said accessing financial assistance was vital, adding that faculty and Chen, his research professor, have been instrumental in his success. He was also grateful for the impact and influence of the Honors College, which helped shape him into who he is today.

Of course, Sy had a lot to do with that as well.

“Sy has consistently gone above and beyond what is expected at his academic level,” Chen said. “His contributions have already had a meaningful impact in the lab, and I have no doubt he will excel in any academic or professional environment. He is not only a talented scientist, but a kind and principled individual – an exceptional combination.”

Sy’s skills and talents will serve him well at his next stop, the TTUHSC, where a new set of demands and expectations await him. For now, he is leaning toward internal medicine, which is, no surprise, directly connected to oncology.

“For me, I’ve been able to do what I’ve done because of the people and resources here at Texas Tech,” he said. “Texas Tech really gives you a door to open up and look at all these possibilities for what you want to do. That’s what happened for me.”",https://www.ttu.edu/_ttu-template/2017/img/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-30 14:02:01.788889

Dive Brief:

Volvo Cars is boosting its investment in South Carolina to build its XC60 mid-size SUV for the U.S. market starting in late 2026, the automaker announced in a press release Sept. 23.

Currently, the XC60 is primarily produced in Sweden. Following U.S. production of the vehicle, the plant will also build a new, next-generation hybrid model for the U.S. market before 2030, the automaker said.

“The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the U.S.,” said Luis Rezende, Volvo Cars’ president of Americas, in a statement. “By adding another model into production here, we’ll take a big step toward realizing the full potential of our local manufacturing investments and workforce, and accelerate progress toward our ambitious commercial targets in the coming years.”

Dive Insight:

The automaker has invested $1.3 billion in its South Carolina factory since 2015, and said it will continue to invest in the plant to bring the 2.3 million square foot facility into operational capacity. The plant’s current capacity is 150,000 vehicles a year.

Volvo said it sold over 27,000 XC60s in the U.S. in the first eight months of this year, a nearly 20% jump from the same period in 2024, so demand for the mid-size SUV remains strong.

Currently, the plant in Ridgeville, South Carolina, assembles two models, the fully electric EX90 SUV and Polestar 3. Previously, the plant built the S60 sedan, but it was discontinued last year amid sluggish sales. Volvo sold 903 S60s in the U.S. this year through the end of August, a 92% decline from the same period last year.

Volvo’s plan to build more vehicles in the U.S. is in line with the company’s strategic initiative to ensure that each region has the products it needs to meet customer demands, according to the release. It includes a more focused approach in terms of product, technology, manufacturing and commercial to better meet the needs of its customers.

“Our investment plans once again reinforce our long-term commitment to the U.S. market and our manufacturing operations in South Carolina,” said Håkan Samuelsson, Volvo Cars’ CEO, in a statement.

Samuelsson previously served as CEO of the company from 2012 to 2022. In March, Volvo Cars announced he was returning to his former role as CEO and president for a two-year term effective April 1. His return will help the automaker navigate “fast-moving technological shifts” and “growing geopolitical complexity,” the company said at the time.

While company executives didn’t disclose details on Volvo’s next-generation hybrid model, Samuelsson hinted that it’s likely to be some type of full-size, hybrid SUV, a segment that’s popular with U.S. consumers.

“This is a bigger size car for primarily for America,” Samuelsson said during a media roundtable with company executives at its South Carolina factory on Sept. 23. “It should [have] room for big families and the luggage and everything they bring, so you could imagine what type of car.”

Samuelsson also said Volvo’s new hybrid vehicles will serve as a “bridge” towards its goal of producing only EVs sometime after 2030, which is later than its initial target of ending ICE vehicle production by 2030. The plans were revised due to slower-than-expected EV adoption, which also led to other automakers revising their short to mid-term electrification goals to meet growing consumer demand for hybrid models.

“If you look at the strategy of our company, we believe we will come out stronger as an electric company after this transformation,” Samuelsson said. “It will take longer than we thought five years ago, and that’s why we need to be pragmatic and have this type of plug-in [hybrid] or bridge solution.”

Following the launch of the new next-generation hybrid model for the U.S., Volvo plans to launch additional hybrid vehicles until EV adoption becomes more widespread and demand increases.

“It’s not just in one [hybrid vehicle] generation,” Samuelsson said. “We need the second generation to bridge also.”

Ramping up vehicle production in the U.S. will also help Volvo Cars mitigate the impact of tariffs, which the Trump administration had previously set at 25% on imported vehicles from the European Union.

However, the levies decreased to 15% on Sept. 5 as part of an agreement reached between the U.S. and the EU, according to a Federal Register notice from the Department of Commerce. The reduced levies became effective Sept. 5 and were later made retroactive to Aug. 1.

In addition to its plans to build more vehicles in the U.S., Volvo commemorated its 70th year in the U.S. market during a factory event this week, which South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster attended. The automaker has sold over 5 million vehicles in the U.S. since it first started manufacturing vehicles in the country.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/y1QX-llJQjj9xFAnH7xJuXDYIp1GEvM1nxuvvjoxF3I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzIwMjUtMDktMjVfYXRfMTEuNTcuMTJBTS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-30 13:07:15.331655

She's 84, and this summer she participated in a program to get free, energy efficient upgrades to her family home. Gloria Romano lives in a senior community in Mooresville. She got a free fan from the county during the summer’s first heat wave. Harper Ellis is a street outreach worker who helps keep Charlotte’s unhoused community safe.

These women are a snapshot of the many community members, workers and leaders I had the opportunity to interview and learn from this summer as an environmental reporting intern at WFAE, Charlotte’s NPR news source.

Working at WFAE was an education in arts, community building, and of course, public radio. I had the unique opportunity to work one on one with their climate reporter and learned to master all the buttons, cords and seemingly random sounds that came from my equipment. From there, WFAE essentially dumped me head first into the great big world (the city of Charlotte). I reported from the government center, the mountains of western North Carolina and an encampment of unhoused people living beside I-77. Mic and chunky headphones in hand, I chased stories all around the region, learning more about North Carolinians from all walks of life with every interview.

Internally, working inside of a newsroom was also a very enlightening experience. I’ve been involved with the Davidsonian since my freshman year but this was my first professional journalism experience. Participating in daily pitch meetings, sitting through edits and even just listening to chatter within the newsroom gave me a significantly deeper understanding of journalism and at the same time, it showed me how much room I have to grow. An unexpected educational experience: While I was in that newsroom, WFAE confronted the rescission of federal funding for the corporation for public broadcasting. It was a window into the challenge of sustaining local journalism and the resilience of those determined to do the work.

The state’s goal is to reduce wildfire risk on 1 million acres of wildlands every year, including by thinning overgrown forests, which is expected to generate roughly 10 million tons of wood waste annually. Arbor hopes to take that waste, blast it through a “vegetarian rocket engine” to produce energy, then sequester all of the carbon the process would generate underground.

California has billed Arbor — and the handful of other similarly aimed projects it’s financed — as a win-win-win: wildfire mitigation, clean energy and carbon sequestration all in one.

Yet, after Arbor initially won state financial backing for a pilot project in Placer County, the El Segundo-based company’s California ambitions fell through, like many biomass projects before it.

Instead, it’s heading to Louisiana.

California, biomass energy advocates say, has struggled to get past its distrust of the technology, given traditional biomass’ checkered past of clear-cutting forests and polluting poorer communities. Further, the state’s strict permitting requirements have given residents tremendous power to veto projects and created regulatory headaches.

But many environmental groups argue it’s an example of California’s environmental and health protections actually working. If not done carefully, bioenergy projects run the risk of emitting carbon — not sequestering it — and polluting communities already grappling with some of the state’s dirtiest air.

“When you look at biomass facilities across California — and we’ve done Public Records Act requests to look at emissions, violations and exceedances ... the reality is that we’re not in some kind of idealized pen-and-paper drawing of what the equipment does,” said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “In the real world, there are just too many problems with failures and faults in the equipment.”

There are simpler and safer uses for this wood waste, these critics say: fertilizer for agriculture, wood chips and mulch. It may not provide carbon-negative energy but comes with none of the risks of bioenergy projects, they say.

The Center for Biological Diversity and others advocate for a “hands-off” approach to California’s forests and urge management of the wildfire crisis through home hardening and evacuation planning alone. But fire and ecology experts say more than a century of fire suppression have made that unrealistic.

However, the sweeping forest-thinning projects these experts say are needed will cost billions, and so the state needs every source of funding it can get. “Our bottleneck right now is, how do we pay for treating a million acres a year?” said Deputy Chief John McCarthy of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, who oversees the agency’s wood products and bioenergy program.

In theory, the class of next-generation biomass energy proposals popping up across California could help fund this work.

“California has an incredible opportunity,” said Arbor chief executive and co-founder Brad Hartwig. With the state’s leftover biomass from forest thinning, “we could make it basically the leader in carbon removal in the world.”

A lot of wood with nowhere to go

Biomass energy first took off in California in the 1980s after small pioneering plants at sawmills and food-processing facilities proved successful and the state’s utilities began offering favorable contracts for energy sources they deemed “renewable” — a category that included biomass.

In the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, the state had more than 60 operating biomass plants, providing up to 9% of the state’s residential power. Researchers estimate the industry supported about 60,000 acres of forest treatment to reduce wildfire risk per year at the time. But biomass energy’s heyday was short-lived.

In 1994, the California Public Utilities Commission shifted the state’s emphasis away from creating a renewable and diverse energy mix and toward simply buying the cheapest possible power.

Biomass — an inherently more expensive endeavor — struggled. Many plants took buyouts to shut down early. Despite California’s repeated attempts to revitalize the industry, the number of biomass plants continued to dwindle.

Today, only 23 biomass plants remain in operation, according to the industry advocate group California Biomass Energy Alliance. The state Energy Commission expects the number to continue declining because of aging infrastructure and a poor bioenergy market. California’s forest and wildfire leadership are trying to change that.

In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom created a task force to address California’s growing wildfire crisis. After convening the state’s top wildfire and forest scientists, the task force quickly came to a daunting conclusion: The more than a century of fire suppression in California’s forests — especially in the Sierra Nevada — had dramatically increased their density, providing fires with ample fuel to explode into raging beasts.

To solve it, the state needed to rapidly remove that extra biomass on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres of wildlands every year through a combination of prescribed burns, rehabilitation of burned areas and mechanically thinning the forest.

McCarthy estimated treating a single acre of land could cost $2,000 to $3,000. At a million acres a year, that’s $2 billion to $3 billion annually.

“Where is that going to come from?” McCarthy said. “Grants — maybe $200 million … 10% of the whole thing. So, we need markets. We need some sort of way to pay for this stuff and in a nontraditional way.”

McCarthy believes bioenergy is one of those ways — essentially, by selling the least valuable, borderline unusable vegetation from the forest floor. You can’t build a house with pine cones, needles and twigs, but you can power a bioenergy plant.

However, while biomass energy has surged in Southern states such as Georgia, projects in California have struggled to get off the ground.

In 2022, a bid by Chevron, Microsoft and the oil-drilling technology company Schlumberger to revive a traditional biomass plant near Fresno and affix carbon capture to it fell through after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requested the project withdraw its permit application. Environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and residents in nearby Mendota opposed the project.

This year, a sweeping effort supported by rural Northern California counties to process more than 1 million tons of biomass a year into wood pellets and ship them to European bioenergy plants (with no carbon capture involved) in effect died after facing pushback from watch groups that feared the project, led by Golden State Natural Resources, would harm forests, and environmental justice groups that worried processing facilities at the Port of Stockton would worsen the air quality in one of the state’s most polluted communities.

Arbor believed its fate would be different.

Bioenergy from the ground up

Before founding Arbor, Hartwig served in the California Air National Guard for six years and on a Marin County search and rescue team. He now recalls a common refrain on the job: “There is no rescue in fire. It’s all search,” Hartwig said. “It’s looking for bodies — not even bodies, it’s teeth and bones.”

In 2022, he started Arbor, with the idea of taking a different approach to bioenergy than the biomass plants shuttering across California.

To understand Arbor’s innovation, start with coal plants, which burn fossil fuels to heat up water and produce steam that turns a turbine to generate electricity. Traditional biomass plants work essentially the same but replace coal with vegetation as the fuel. Typically, the smoke from the vegetation burning is simply released into the air.

Arbor’s solution is more like a tree-powered rocket engine.

The company can utilize virtually any form of biomass, from wood to sticks to pine needles and brush. Arbor heats it to extreme temperatures and deprives it of enough oxygen to make the biomass fully combust. The organic waste separates into a flammable gas — made of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen — and a small amount of solid waste.

The machine then combusts the gas at extreme temperatures and pressures, which then accelerates a turbine at much higher rates than typical biomass plants. The resulting carbon dioxide exhaust is then sequestered underground.

Arbor portrays its solution as a flexible, carbon-negative and clean device: It can operate anywhere with a hookup for carbon sequestration. Multiple units can work together for extra power. All of the carbon in the trees and twigs the machine ingests ends up in the ground — not back in the air.

But biomass watchdogs warn previous attempts at technology like Arbor’s have fallen short.

This biomass process creates a dry, flaky ash mainly composed of minerals — essentially everything in the original biomass that wasn’t “bio” — that can include heavy metals that the dead plants sucked up from the air or soil. If agricultural or construction waste is used, it can include nasty chemicals from wood treatments and pesticides.

Arbor plans — at least initially — on using woody biomass directly from the forest, which typically contains less of these dangerous ash chemicals.

Turning wood waste into gas also generates a thick, black tar composed of volatile organic compounds — which are also common contaminants following wildfires. The company says its gasification process uses high enough temperatures to break down the troublesome tar, but researchers say tar is an inevitable byproduct of this process.

Watchdogs also caution that the math to determine whether bioenergy projects sequester or release carbon is complicated and finicky.

“Biomass is tricky, and there’s a million exceptions to every rule that need to be accounted for,” said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead with Frontier Climate, which vets carbon capture projects such as Arbor’s and connects them with companies interested in buying carbon credits. “There are examples where we have found a project that actually works on the carbon accounting math, but we didn’t want to do it because it was touching Canadian boreal forest that’s old-growth forest.”

Frontier Climate, along with the company Isometric, audits Arbor’s technology and operations. However, critics note that because both companies ultimately support the sale of carbon credits, their assessments may be biased.

At worst, biomass projects can decimate forests and release their stored carbon into the atmosphere. Arbor hopes, instead, to be a best-case scenario: improving — or at least maintaining — forest health and stuffing carbon underground.

When it all goes South

Arbor had initially planned to build a proof of concept in Placer County. To do it, Arbor won $2 million through McCarthy’s Cal Fire program and $500,000 through a state Department of Conservation program in 2023.

But as California fell into a deficit in 2023, state funding dried up.

So Arbor turned to private investors. In September 2024, Arbor reached an agreement with Microsoft in which the technology company would buy carbon credits backed by Arbor’s sequestration. In July of this year, the company announced a $41-million deal (well over 15 times the funding it ever received from California) with Frontier Climate, whose carbon credit buyers include Google, the online payment company Stripe and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook.

To fulfill the credits, it would build its first commercial facility near Lake Charles, La., in part powering nearby data centers.

“We were very excited about Arbor,” McCarthy said. “They pretty much walked away from their grant and said they’re not going to do this in California. … We were disappointed in that.”

But for Arbor, relying on the state was no longer feasible.

“We can’t rely on California for the money to develop the technology and deploy the initial systems,” said Hartwig, standing in Arbor’s plant-covered El Segundo office. “For a lot of reasons, it makes sense to go test the machine, improve the technology in the market elsewhere before we actually get to do deployments in California, which is a much more difficult permitting and regulatory environment.”

It’s not the first next-generation biomass company based in California to build elsewhere. San Francisco-based Charm Industrial, whose technology doesn’t involve energy generation, began its sequestration efforts in the Midwest and plans to expand into Louisiana.

The American South has less stringent logging and environmental regulations, which has led biomass energy projects to flock to the area: In 2024, about 2.3% of the South’s energy came from woody biomass — up from 2% in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, that number on the West Coast was only 1.2%, continuing on its slow decline.

And, unlike in the West, companies aiming to create wood pellets to ship abroad have proliferated in the South. In 2024, the U.S. produced more than 10.7 million tons of biomass pellets; 82% of which was exported. That’s up from virtually zero in 2000. The vast majority of the biomass pellets produced last year — 84% — was from the South.

Watchdogs warn that this lack of guardrails has allowed the biomass industry to harm the South’s forests, pollute poor communities living near biomass facilities and fall short of its climate claims.

Over the last five years, Drax — a company that harvests and exports wood pellets and was working with Golden State Natural Resources — has had to pay Louisiana and Mississippi a combined $5 million for violating air pollution laws. Residents living next to biomass plants, like Drax’s, say the operations have worsened asthma and routinely leave a film of dust on their cars.

But operating a traditional biomass facility or shipping wood pellets to Europe wasn’t Arbor’s founding goal — albeit powering data centers in the American South wasn’t exactly either.

Hartwig, who grew up in the Golden State, hopes Arbor’s technology can someday return to California to help finance the solution for the wildfire crisis he spent so many years facing head-on.

“We’ve got an interest in Arkansas, in Texas, all the way up to Minnesota,” Hartwig said. “Eventually, we’d like to come back to California.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bba8e55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+235/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F22%2Fd0681eeb432e9d7c0f9d2c6c1a81%2F1516003-enviro-new-carbon-capture-tech-02-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 10:59:36.289894

Here’s a list of tax breaks that will end in 2026 — and what that might mean for your household moving forward.
Yet the new Trump tax bill eliminates several key residential energy tax breaks, effective 2026 (though some are expiring earlier).
These tax breaks were to return in 2026 with the expiration of the TCJA, but the 2025 GOP tax bill ended them.
As noted earlier, the child tax credit also has new eligibility rules in the 2026 tax filing season.","Just when you thought you knew your federal income taxes, here comes a curveball: Key tax breaks are disappearing in 2026.

During his first presidency, Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) into law. The largest tax bill in recent decades temporarily halted several tax breaks, including deductions for individual investment costs, personal tax preparation fees, and home office expenses for employees.

Now, in his second term, President Trump and the GOP have extended many of the TCJA tax cuts and enacted several new temporary tax benefits in a law Trump often refers to as the “big, beautiful bill (OBBB).” This extensive tax and spending law, enacted on July 4, 2025, includes new incentives, like the car loan interest deduction, while also removing several tax credits and deductions that the TCJA previously suspended.

Here’s a list of tax breaks that will end in 2026 — and what that might mean for your household moving forward.

1. Which clean energy tax credits are going away?

Although most clean energy tax breaks were temporary, their expiration dates weren’t until 2032 or later, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act passed during the Biden Administration. Yet the new Trump tax bill eliminates several key residential energy tax breaks, effective 2026 (though some are expiring earlier).

Here are a few examples:

Federal Electric Vehicle (EV) Tax Credit worth up to $7,500 (expiring after September 30, 2025).

Residential Clean Energy Credit worth up to 30% of qualifying installations (until December 31, 2025).

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit worth up to $3,200 (until December 31, 2025).

About 1.2 million households have used credits for residential clean energy investments, resulting in $6 billion in savings, according to the latest data released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. That amounts to an average tax benefit per family of around $5,000.

Without these incentives, some taxpayers wanting to make the same investments will lose out on tax savings in 2026 compared to just one year prior.

However, it’s important to note that the federal tax credit for at-home EV charger equipment isn’t ending until June 30, 2026. This means you might be able to save up to $1,000 in federal income taxes if you install qualifying charging equipment by the deadline next year.

2. Itemized deductions are not allowed, and the home office deduction for employees is gone

Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), many miscellaneous itemized deductions could be claimed on your individual federal income tax return.

The deductions below were subject to a 2% adjusted gross income (AGI) floor, meaning you could only claim these tax benefits if the total of these expenses exceeded that threshold.

Here are a few examples of tax deductions that are expiring in 2026:

Unreimbursed work expenses, like those for travel and transportation.

Investment expenses, like custodial fees and safe deposit box rentals.

Hobby expenses (up to the amount of hobby income).

Tax preparation fees (personal). (The rules are different if you have business income.)

Home office deduction for employees.

These tax breaks were to return in 2026 with the expiration of the TCJA, but the 2025 GOP tax bill ended them.

Of all the miscellaneous itemized deductions, unreimbursed employee expenses, non-business tax preparation fees, and investment expenses were the most popular, according to the Tax Foundation. Over 21 million households used these deductions about ten years ago.

Republican lawmakers initially eliminated the miscellaneous itemized deductions to help fund the increased standard deduction. However, whether the standard deduction truly offsets these itemized deductions may vary from taxpayer to taxpayer (more on that below).

*Note: The moving expense deduction for work, although not a miscellaneous itemized deduction, was also eliminated by the OBBB (exceptions may apply to military personnel).

3. Family tax credits and exemptions: What the trade-off could mean for you

The personal and dependency exemption will also end in 2026.

This exemption, designed to connect tax liability to family size, was worth $4,050 per qualifying person in 2018, though the amount was adjusted for inflation annually.

The year before the TCJA was enacted:

About 292 million people claimed the personal and dependency exemption.

This resulted in about $1.2 trillion in taxpayer savings, according to the IRS.

Like the miscellaneous itemized deductions, the elimination of this exemption was used to offset the increased standard deduction and higher child tax credit, according to the Tax Policy Center.

Yet if you claim itemized deductions and have a large family, this trade-off might increase your taxable income compared to the law before the TCJA.

For example, consider a married filing jointly couple with five children before the TCJA and after the OBBB was enacted.

*Inflation adjustment amount calculated as of September 2025 via USAfacts.org.

In the example, the family’s taxable income increases under the pre-TCJA law compared to what it will be under the 2025 tax law. That’s because the increased standard deduction didn’t offset the combined itemized deductions and personal and dependency exemptions for the hypothetical household.

However, once the higher child tax credit is factored in, that same family could achieve a lower tax liability if they meet the updated eligibility requirements to claim the credit.

While the example shows a lower tax liability for 2025 than the law before the TCJA, the benefit a taxpayer could see for trading off the personal and dependency exemption for the increased child tax credit and standard deduction varies based on a taxpayer’s circumstances.

For instance, while a married couple with kids might save on income taxes owed with a higher child tax credit, a single filer with no children might not.

As noted earlier, the child tax credit also has new eligibility rules in the 2026 tax filing season. This includes a requirement that qualifying children and at least one parent must have a work-eligible Social Security number. As a result, about 2.7 million children who used to qualify for this tax credit may not be eligible next year.

Note: The personal and dependency exemption was subject to AGI phaseouts, and the child tax credit has a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) phase-out.

Is the ‘AMT tax’ back from the dead?

Before the TCJA, 5.2 million Americans paid the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), per Tax Policy Center data. This ""parallel tax system"" was implemented to ensure that higher-income taxpayers pay a minimum amount of tax.

However, data from the Tax Policy Center shows that previous AMT rules may have disproportionately affected upper-middle-income taxpayers.

Through the TCJA, the individual AMT threshold was raised in a couple of ways:

Increasing the exemption amount from $84,500 to $137,000 for married filing joint couples (single filers from $54,300 to $88,100).

Raising the phase-out threshold from $160,900 to $1,252,700 for married filing joint couples (single filers from $120,700 to $626,350).

The result was that the number of taxpayers who paid AMT dropped from about 5 million to just 200,000 in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center. Under the OBBB, the individual AMT exemption amounts were made permanent.

But starting in 2026, the phaseout will be lowered to $500,000 for singles and $1 million for married couples filing jointly. Once more, the phaseout rate for every dollar above this threshold was increased from 25% to 50%.

This means more income from higher earners will be subject to AMT next year.

So, in addition to the permanent elimination of tax breaks on this list, you could qualify to pay AMT in 2026 even if you haven’t in recent years.

Precise numbers of staffing cuts are hard to pin down, but their historic scale in the first eight months of this administration is unmistakable.
Effects of past cuts In the past, cuts to the EPA caused problems and were reversed -- but it took years.
The staffing and budget cuts that came during the first two years of the Reagan administration generated problems with meeting the agency's responsibilities.
Reagan's EPA budget, which had fallen to US$4.1 billion in 1984, increased to $4.9 billion in 1989.","As Congress faces a midnight deadline to fund the federal government, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has put the EPA on the chopping block.

But even before Congress decides about the administration's recommendations to slash its staff, the EPA's political leaders have made even more significant cuts to the agency's workforce.

And a look at past efforts to cut EPA staff shows how rapidly those changes can affect Americans' health and the environment.

Using publicly available government databases and a collection of in-depth interviews with current and former EPA employees, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a group of volunteer academics that we are a part of, has begun to put some numbers behind what many have suspected.

Zeldin's cuts have diminished the EPA's staffing levels, even before Congress has had a chance to weigh in, affecting the environment, public health and government transparency.

Precise numbers of staffing cuts are hard to pin down, but their historic scale in the first eight months of this administration is unmistakable. Released in May, Zeldin's budget proposal for the fiscal year starting October 2025 proposed to cut 1,274 full-time-equivalent employee positions from a total of 14,130 in the year ending Tuesday -- a 9% drop.

A July 18, 2025, press release from the EPA said the agency had already cut 23% of its personnel, terminating the employment of 3,707 of 16,155 employees. Using employees -- the number of people -- rather than full-time equivalents makes these numbers difficult to compare directly with EPA's budget proposals.

Combining EPA data on staffing changes with conservative estimates of the pending cuts, the initiative has calculated that 25% of EPA staff are already out of the agency.

That calculation does not include other announced cuts, including a third round of deferred resignations taking effect at the end of September and December. Those cuts may see the departure of similar numbers of full-time equivalents as in the past two rounds -- approximately 500 and 1,500.

The agency has also reportedly planned to be cutting as much as two-thirds of research staff.

With those departure figures included, the initiative estimates that approximately 33% of staffers at the agency when Trump took office will be gone by the end of 2025. That would leave, at the start of 2026, an EPA staff numbering approximately 9,700 people, a level not seen since the last years of the Nixon and Ford administrations.

These cuts are deeper than past efforts to shrink the size of the agency. In his first term, Trump proposed eliminating 21.4% of staff at the EPA, though Congress made no significant changes to the agency's staffing. The largest actual cut to EPA staffing was under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s: He advocated for a 17.3% drop in staffing, although Congress held the cuts to 10%.

Effects of past cuts

In the past, cuts to the EPA caused problems and were reversed -- but it took years.

The staffing and budget cuts that came during the first two years of the Reagan administration generated problems with meeting the agency's responsibilities.

For instance, rather than prosecute industry for polluting, Reagan's EPA administrator, Anne Gorsuch, told business leaders she would ignore their violations of environmental laws. Remaining staff were convinced that working on enforcement cases would be a ""black mark"" on their records.

Another top political appointee at Reagan's EPA, Rita Lavelle, who headed the Superfund effort to clean up toxic sites, faced prison time for her official acts. She was convicted of perjury and obstructing a congressional investigation because she lied about her ties to a former employer who had polluted the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a Superfund site near Riverside, Calif.

In the wake of the scandal, Lavelle was fired and Gorsuch and more than a dozen other political appointees resigned.

In a later report on the issue, Congress accused Gorsuch, Lavelle and others of poor job performance, noting that after four years of Superfund work, ""only six of the 546 ... of the most hazardous sites in the Nation have been cleaned up."" The Stringfellow site, a focus of the investigation, was ""threatening the health and safety of 500,000 people,"" the report noted.

With anger over the scandals from Americans and Congress, Reagan reversed course and spent the remaining six years of his presidency building the EPA back up in both staffing and budget. Staffing, for example, increased from a low of 10,481 full-time-equivalent employees in 1982 to 15,130 in 1989. Reagan's EPA budget, which had fallen to US$4.1 billion in 1984, increased to $4.9 billion in 1989.

The existing Trump cuts, and those proposed -- if enacted by Congress -- would be deeper than Reagan's, reducing the number of people doing important research on environmental harms and the health effects of dangerous chemicals; suing companies who pollute the environment; and overseeing the cleanup of toxic sites.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8381759240664/2025/1/55a684aeea8b8198ed45c646a08cda0b/v1.5/Trump-administration-slashes-EPAs-ability-to-protect-air-water.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 13:05:18.743915

By the end of the day, the $7,500 federal EV tax credit will be dead, and we've got no one but President Donald Trump and his merry band of Republican goons to blame. In all likelihood, sales of electric vehicles are about to crater as real-world prices rise. That's good for consumers, right?

In any case, the deadline caused a huge uptick in August EV sales. 146,332 electric cars found homes last month — more than any other month in history and 18% higher than the same time last year. Nearly one-in-10 new cars sold were fully electric last month. Even used EVs — which get their own $4,000 credit — set their own record with nearly 41,000 sales.

That's all over now. The $7,500 tax credit, meant to help swallow the $9,000-ish price premium EVs carry over their gas-powered counterparts, is dead. From The Verge:

In July and August, between credits and fire-sale incentives, the average EV cost $44,908, or $600 less than the $45,521 paid for ICE models, according to J.D. Power.

Now those clean-car credits that benefited buyers and automakers, first conceived in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, are sailing off into the sunset. President Barack Obama switched an existing $7,500 credit to a point-of-sale rebate, with a goal of getting 1 million EVs on the road. Rebates continued as a cornerstone of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, but tied to a dizzying array of domestic-sourcing rules and restrictions that created confusion for buyers.

[...]

EV sales could drop as much as 27 percent after consumers lose tax breaks, according to a study from economics professors Joseph Shapiro, Felix Tintelnot, and Hunt Allcott. Coincidentally, that 27 percent sales decline is exactly what Germany experienced over the first 10 months of 2024, after the government abruptly killed incentives worth $4,900.

Many experts bemoan the sudden loss of credits here, especially with EVs already fighting hurricane-force headwinds. A phase-out over a few years would give the market time to adjust.

Trump and his ilk have characterized the end of these credits as a victory for affordability and consumer choice (read: propping up a fossil fuel industry that really doesn't need any more propping up).

Trump tapped men with deep ties to the fossil-fuel industry to lead his Energy and Interior departments. As The Washington Post reported, he called for $1 billion in oil-industry donations at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser in 2024, backed by an explicit promise to roll back emissions regulations if elected. In a rambling jeremiad at the United Nations this week, the president claimed EVs and renewable energy are a road to economic ruin.

It's hard to know exactly what will come next for the industry. I'm assuming many automakers are going to slap fat deals and discounts on their EVs just to get them out the door and keep the market from stagnating too much. For us consumers, it means things get more expensive, but that's to be expected. Everything is getting more expensive all the time.

U.S. airlines are warning that a partial federal government shutdown could put even more strain on American airports and slow air traffic even further. It would cause air traffic controllers and security officers to work without pay, and it would halt other crucial functions.

Trade groups Airlines for America, which represents United, Delta, American, Southwest and other airlines, warned that if the government shuts down, ""the system may need to slow down, reducing efficiency,"" and impacting travelers. That's, uh, not ideal — especially as we get into the leading edge of the holiday season. From Reuters:

""When federal employees who manage air traffic, inspect aircraft and secure our nation's aviation system are furloughed or working without pay, the entire industry and millions of Americans feel the strain,"" the group said.

Air traffic controllers and about 50,000 Transportation Security Administration employees who staff airport checkpoints are among the government workers who would be required to keep working but would not be paid.

In 2019, during a 35-day shutdown, the number of absences by controllers and TSA officers rose as workers missed paychecks, extending checkpoint wait times at some airports. The Federal Aviation Administration was forced to slow air traffic in New York, which put pressure on lawmakers to quickly end the standoff.

The shutdown is expected to begin on Wednesday unless there is an agreement between the Democrats and Republicans on a government funding bill. Congressional Democratic leaders left a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday without reaching a deal.

In a separate letter, airline groups, aviation unions, manufacturers, airports and other aviation groups warned shutdowns force the FAA to ""suspend air traffic controller and technician hiring and training, delay the implementation of safety initiatives, postpone maintenance and repair work to critical air traffic equipment, suspend air carrier pilot check rides, delay airworthy inspections for aircraft, defer the analysis of voluntary safety reporting, and suspend work on modernization programs.""

A theoretical shutdown could delay the FAA's certification of the Boeing 737 MAX 7. That would be bad for Boeing. It could also delay the $12.5 billion overall of air traffic control, and that would be bad for everyone. The FAA said under its shutdown plan, it would not be able to conduct air traffic control hiring or field training of new controllers.

Jaguar Land Rover is getting a $2.7 billion loan from banks around the world as the automaker looks for ways to ease the financial struggle caused by a cyberattack that stymied production for months. Luckily, operations seem to be getting back online for the struggling British automaker, but this infusion of cash would be a big help in getting it through to the other side. From Bloomberg:

The foreign currency facility will be priced at about 110 basis points over the secured overnight funding rate, or SOFR, the people said asking not to be identified because the discussions are private. Citigroup Inc., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Standard Chartered Bank Plc have agreed to offer the 18-month credit facility to the carmaker, the people said, adding that the debt may be syndicated to more banks later.

The fund raise, that was reported by the Economic Times earlier on Monday, is expected to show JLR has liquidity to tide over revenue losses.

A JLR spokesperson declined to comment on the efforts to raise emergency funds. Representatives for Citigroup, MUFG and Standard Chartered also declined to comment.

Automotive suppliers typically operate on thin margins and need high working capital, leaving them vulnerable to prolonged disruptions after unexpected events such as the cyberattack confronting JLR. The funding requirement comes months after the luxury carmaker achieved its goal of becoming debt free on a net basis and will help the company normalize operations.

Yesterday, we reported that JLR would be resuming some of its manufacturing operations in the coming days. That's good news, but the company is hardly out of the woods. This year, it reported a near 11% drop in quarterly sales in July. I'm a bit of a JLR-head, so here's hoping it can turn things around sooner rather than later.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-7500-ev-tax-credit-dies-today-and-you-can-thanks-trump-and-the-republicans/l-intro-1759241930.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 13:05:56.602046

The package, which was announced by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the Global Citizen Festival, part of the UN General Assembly, forms part of the Scaling Up Renewables in Africa campaign, co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

“The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world,” von der Leyen commented. “A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.”

Huge potential

According to the Commission, Africa boasts ‘huge’ potential when it comes to renewable energy, however almost 600 million people across the continent still live without access to electricity.

Investment in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy is therefore ‘not just a moral and development imperative, it is also a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains’, it added, with the potential to create up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, as well as make energy systems more resilient.

Project funding

The largest share of the funding package will go to Côte d’Ivoire, where €359.4 million will be allocated to fund a high-voltage transmission line (Dorsale Est), intended to improve regional power distribution.

Some €59.1 million will go to Cameroon for electrification projects reaching more than 2.5 million people across 687 rural communities, while Madagascar will receive €33.2 million to expand electrification to rural areas.

Some €45.5 million will go to Somalia to increase access to affordable renewable energy, advance circular economy practices, and develop climate-resilient agri-food systems, while €25.9 million has been pledged to Lesotho, for its Renewable Lesotho wind and hydro project.

Other recipients include Republic of Congo (€ 3.5 million), Ghana (€2 million), Central Africa (€3.3 million), and Mozambique (€13 million).

The initiative forms part of broader commitments to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 at a global level, which were agreed at COP28.

The Scaling Up Renewables in Africa campaign, which is undertaken alongside the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen, relies on policy support from the International Energy Agency.

At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.
In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early?
But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.
So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected.","The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.

Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one fast.

The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.

""The past couple of weeks — even in the past several days — EV sales just exploded,"" says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. ""It's been bonkers.""

Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.

The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level ""only achieved once before in December of 2024."" At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.

Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.

The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.

But there's a flip side, of course.

""The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead,"" writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.

In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they won't be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.

Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.

J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.

But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.

The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.

So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.

Automakers will be waiting to see what ""natural demand"" for their electric offerings actually looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.

And car shoppers, for their part, will be waiting to see whether automakers can manage to cut prices and keep vehicles competitively priced despite increased pressure from tariffs — and without the largesse of the federal government.

President Donald J. Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cut into law on July 4, 2025, which repealed Section 134 of the Clean Air Act and rescinded the funding for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).

Earlier in the year, on March 11, 2025, EPA Administrator Zeldin terminated $20 billion in GGRF funding that was awarded to eight National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator entities as serious concerns were raised regarding self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and reduced government oversight.

On August 7, 2025, Administrator Zeldin announced the agency will no longer be implementing the $7 billion Solar for All program to remain aligned with Congressional intent. The Working Families Tax Cut repealed EPA’s authority to administer the program and rescinded all remaining funds.

The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was created through President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which passed both chambers of Congress in 2022 without any bipartisan support. GGRF is comprised of three programs: the National Clean Investment Fund, Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, and Solar for All. All of these programs were designed to shell out billions of taxpayer dollars to passthrough entities.

Self-Dealing and Conflicts of Interest

On December 3, 2024, a video from Project Veritas circulated of a former Biden Administration EPA political appointee boasting that “it’s like we’re on the Titanic and we’re throwing gold bars off the edge.”

The video highlighted the need to get the money out the door as fast as possible before the Trump Administration was sworn in. “Now it’s how to get the money out as fast as possible before they [Trump Administration] come in...”

“Over the last year, we’ve given out $50 billion dollars for climate things…so to go work for one of these places would be really cool.”

“We gave them [nonprofits] the money because… it was an insurance policy against Trump winning. Because they aren’t [a government agency], they’re safer from Republicans taking the money away.”

Read more below about the apparent self-dealing and conflicts of interest of the eight pass-through, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) selected as the prime recipients of $20 billion in taxpayer funding.

National Clean Investment Fund Grantees

Climate United Fund: $6,970,000,000

Coalition for Green Capital: $5,000,000,000

The players:

A Biden-Harris Administration climate advisor previously served on the board of the Coalition for Green Capital and rejoined the board in 2023 while the organization was applying for GGRF funding.

Coalition for Green Capital’s CEO served as a senior advisor to the Obama-Biden Administration Department of Energy and as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s “energy czar.”

Coalition for Green Capital’s Policy Director until 2021 left CGC to work at President Biden’s Climate Policy Office on GGRF implementation and later as a political appointee at EPA.

A Coalition for Green Capital board member served as senior director for environmental justice at the Council on Environmental Quality in the Biden-Harris White House.

Power Forward Communities: $2,000,000,000

The players:

Power Forward Communities’ CEO served as CEO of Fannie Mae during the Obama-Biden Administration.

The Vice Chair of Enterprise Community Partners, an arm of Power Forward Communities, worked in the Obama-Biden Administration.

The founder and co-chair of Power Forward Communities worked in the Obama-Biden Administration.

CEO and president of Enterprise Community Partners served in the Obama-Biden Administration as the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary in addition to the Office of Management and Budget Director.

Unqualified Recipients

Comments from the panel of government career staffers during the application review process highlighted concerns over handing billions of American tax dollars to these groups in addition to the lack of financial background to handle such large sums of money.

Unlike other EPA grant recipients, GGRF recipients had requirements baked into their grant agreements to take a training entitled, “How to Develop a Budget.” Grantees were encouraged to start drawing down funds in the first 21 days, even though they were given 90 days to complete the training to learn how to create a budget.

Examples of NGOs Lacking Financial Experience

The Coalition for Green Capital had only expended $1.42 million in 2023 before receiving a $5 billion award from EPA.

Power Forward Communities had reported a total of $100 for both “total revenue” and “net assets” in its 2023 tax return – the year before receiving a $2 billion grant from EPA.

Comments on Applications

Climate United Fund

Two separate reviewers noted that “exec comp seems high,” and that the large budget could “add risk to a federal award.”

Dedicated 2.2% of its budget to “market predevelopment,” about which an employee needed “additional clarity.”

One federal employee wrote that “these numbers don’t make sense” in response to Climate United Fund’s plan to decarbonize homes.

Coalition for Green Capital

Reviewers flagged that its “FY2022 and 2021 financials show a net loss with declining fees for service income.”

“Of the 71 expected hires, more than 20% would be making salaries more than approximately $450,000.”

The organization’s “assumption of deploying $10 billion in the first fiscal year of performance seems unattainable,” another federal employee noted.

“Ambitious assumptions around deployment call into question the risks being modeled by the lead applicant. It stands to reason that the accelerated deployment of capital well beyond what has been seen historically would result in losses well beyond what has been recorded historically,” the reviewer continued, noting that Coalition for Green Capital did not address this issue in its application materials.

Power Forward Communities

“The salary structure for top officers seems high for a nonprofit – or rather high enough that it merits some explanation,” one reviewer wrote. “[I’m] wondering if this could be a problem with public perception,” they continued.

“For such an important section, it was pithy, though not always in a good way. Many of the costs were just presented, but little or no explanation as to why they are reasonable. I would have preferred they omitted the travel discussion and explained why they need to pay the CEO $800,000, growing to $948,000 in year 7. And chief operation officer $455,000 per year.”

Another reviewer wrote that “executive salaries appear excessive,” adding that the amount did “not seem appropriate for federal funds.” Another added that “senior management salaries are seemingly high without justification.”

Twenty-two of the Power Forward Communities employees were slated to earn more than $150,000.

Reviewers also criticized the nonprofit for its lack of planning for “proactive oversight.”

Reviewers repeatedly listed Power Forward Communities’ partnership with United Way and Habitat for Humanity as a strength of its application, but both of the organizations later pulled out of the coalition.

Appalachian Community Capital

Two reviewers noted a lack of experience in their comments, saying “the amount of money managed under previous agreements was much less than what is being proposed under this grant opportunity.”

A reviewer also noted that Appalachian Community Capital planned to use $215 million to finance 600 zero-emission vehicles and $105 million to finance 700 charging stations. “This is $358,333 per EV vehicle,” the reviewer wrote, adding that $150,000 per charging station “seems too high.”

Reduced Agency Oversight

The Biden-Harris Administration’s unprecedented choice to use a financial agent for EPA grants deprives the government of immediate control over money held in accounts at Citibank. EPA’s use of a financial agent in connection with the GGRF program was the first use of a financial agent for a nonexchange grant program administered by the federal government.

EPA lacks sufficient oversight and transparency into the use of grant funding because every single grant recipient acts as a pass-through for subrecipients, many of which are themselves pass-throughs, and EPA is not a party to agreements with the subrecipients.

Modifications and amendments to the grant agreements that took place after the 2024 election appear intentionally designed to reduce EPA’s oversight and control over grant funding.

Citing deeply concerning matters of financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the program, EPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator formally referred GGRF to the Office of Inspector General.

Read the EPA referral letter to the OIG (pdf), which outlines the lack of EPA oversight in the distribution of the program funds.

EPA’s OIG has initiated an investigation into the GGRF program, and the agency is cooperating fully in that investigation, which remains outgoing.

Following the referral letter, EPA initiated further efforts to increase agency oversight including a letter requesting information from the eight recipients of the $20 billion for the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator.

Read the GGRF Letter from Acting DA McIntosh to Coalition for Green Capital (pdf) , which includes 35 critical questions for the sake of transparency and accountability.

IG Testimony

September 2024

Former EPA Inspector General Sean O’Donnell testified to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials that EPA’s “pace of spending” GGRF funds “escalates not only the risk for fraud but also the urgency for oversight.” He testified that EPA’s OIG “would need to hire oversight professional[s] with specialized expertise” to conduct sufficient oversight regarding the NCIF grants in particular, not only to “preven[t] waste, fraud, and abuse, but also [to] ensur[e] that IRA funds deliver the real environmental and human health benefits that the public is paying for.”

February 2025

Acting Inspector General Nicole Murley testified to the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations that EPA was “particularly concerned about” the GGRF program, including apprehension that the grant “structure makes providing effective oversight challenging,” and that EPA is “concerned that there will be critical gaps in monitoring, accountability, and compliance in the GGRF.”

Solar for All

""One of the more shocking features of Solar for All was with regards to the massive dilution of the money as many grants go through pass-through after pass-through after pass-through after pass-through, with all of the middlemen taking their own cut—at least 15% by conservative estimates. What a grift!

""Furthermore, the Biden-Harris Administration exempted this program from the Build America, Buy America law that requires federal agencies to use American workers, American products, and American infrastructure for projects using American taxpayer dollars. That’s great news for China, not so much for the USA.

""Lastly, while this program was stood up in 2024, very little money has actually been spent. Recipients are still very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.

""But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.

""With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.""

In the Courts

“While the Biden EPA touted ‘tossing Gold Bars off the Titanic,’ these terminated grants, riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending, are now frozen by court order. The Biden EPA handed politically connected and inexperienced nongovernmental organizations tens of billions in taxpayer funding in a manner that deliberately reduced the ability of EPA to conduct proper oversight. I will not rest until these hard-earned taxpayer dollars are returned to the U.S. Treasury. Every penny EPA spends will go towards our core mission of protecting human health and the environment and Powering the Great American Comeback.”

– EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin

On September 2, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 in favor of the agency and vacated a district court order preventing EPA from terminating certain grants previously awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and requiring the agency to make payments pursuant to those grants. The court noted that EPA’s terminations of the grants fell “well within the Executive Branch’s authority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly spent for its intended purposes.”

The agency released the following statement: “It’s fantastic to see reason prevail in the court system. EPA has a duty to be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars. Administrator Zeldin cancelled these grants due to well documented concerns about self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, and intentionally reduced agency oversight. The gold bar recipients were wrong about jurisdiction all along and wrong to act so entitled to these precious public funds that belong to hardworking American taxpayers.”

The opinion states, “We conclude the district court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed on the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, and therefore jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction over the grantees’ constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. Moreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which on behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and management of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we vacate the injunction.”

“The month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA modified the grant agreements—with no apparent consideration from the grantees—to make it more difficult for the government to terminate the grants.”

“[N]othing in the Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care that the grant programs be faithfully executed…. [T]his preliminary injunction … bar[red] EPA from carrying out basic executive functions to ensure the prudent and effective management of substantial public funds.”

“The district court also ignored the government’s evidence of mismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning ‘gold bars’ video, which further supports EPA’s good faith in deciding to terminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision and accountability.”

“Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity of the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Politico.”

A road safety message from North Carolina’s Electric Cooperatives did overwhelming numbers—nearly 6,000 likes and 2,500 shares on Facebook.","Editor’s note: This is the fifth installment in our series of stories looking back at Hurricane Helene’s impact on electric cooperatives. Read the first four stories here.

If you fall behind on disaster communications, you’ll never catch up.

Which is why Daniele Ligons of Aiken Electric Cooperative was posting social media messages in the hours after Hurricane Helene from the front seat of her 2019 Honda Civic, its engine running so she could keep her smartphone charged.

“It was a crazy day. My phone was dying just as fast as I could charge it,” said Ligons, the co-op’s marketing and strategic services manager, who handled the blackout workflow with Jamacia McCray, her marketing and communicators coordinator, also confined to car battery power.

“I was talking to her, responding to members, figuring out what we should do with our posts and figuring out how to make the media aware of what we were doing. We were both glued to our phones the entire day.”

Hurricane Helene put 1.44 million electric cooperative members in the dark last September, and communicating with every one of them was Job No. 1. All co-ops are different and all storms are different, so no one-size-fits-all strategy kept members and the media informed. But the scramble was worth it because catastrophe can represent a unique opportunity for connection.

“We had 65,000 of our members with eyes all on us,” said Jim Donahoo, vice president of marketing and business development at Laurens Electric Cooperative in Laurens, South Carolina. “We had 100% of the media. We had all the public officials and the public in general with all eyes on us. We had that opportunity to shine, to deliver, to build value and demonstrate in a great way the value of being a member of Laurens Electric Co-op.”

It’s a given that members want information about storm prep and relief. But the numbers staggered Blue Ridge Energy in Lenoir, North Carolina. One of the hardest-hit co-ops, Blue Ridge had 70,000 members out of power—92% of its system—with many roads not just inaccessible, but gone.

The day after Helene devastated areas from Florida to Kentucky, then-Blue Ridge CEO Doug Johnson spoke for 90 seconds on a simple video to members. To date, the post has 558,000 views, 9,000 likes and nearly 850 comments—viral by any standard.

“I remember him joking at the time, ‘With the internet being down and the power being down will anybody even see it?’ And I said, ‘Oh, it will get out there,” said Renee Walker, the co-op’s director of public relations. “Getting that empathy out there early on and communicating what we were doing to restore power was very important.”

The deluge of responses came from outside the normal channel of Blue Ridge members, since many of them lacked cell or internet access. In this case, Walker found it was also people searching for information about the status of friends and relatives in the co-op’s territory.

“There was very little communication, very little infrastructure left in this area,” Walker said. “So we even had folks reaching out from the West Coast and different parts of the United States saying, ‘Hey, thank you. My son lives in that area. I haven’t heard anything from him. Your posts are the only thing I have from that area that resembles a media outlet.’”

Setting expectations

Most members interact with their co-ops on two occasions—when they get their bills and when the lights go out. Donahoo wanted interaction around the clock with Helene.

“Anything that we can do outside the scope of those two things by creating a positive experience and engagement is a great way for us to build good will with our members,” he said. “We wanted to be transparent, but keep them informed on an ongoing, hourly basis.”

That meant images of lineworkers doing their thing multiple times a day, sometimes posting on social media channels until midnight. “The theme of what we said set the expectations with our members and then we showed how we worked hard to overdeliver,” Donahoo said.

Laurens Electric timed regular media updates in the morning for noontime broadcasts, in the afternoon for the evening news and late night for 11 p.m. newscasts, always showing line crews hard at work.

At Aiken Electric, expectations came in the form of sticky notes on McCray’s office wall that set messaging for the day—updates during morning, afternoon and night hours.

“We wanted to reassure them each morning, ‘OK, we’re powered up, ready to go; this is the plan,’” Ligons said. “The afternoon post was more of damage or a testimonial from a member who was living with foxes and squirrels because a tree fell on the house. Then, in the evening, we put out what we had accomplished.”

The results were dramatic. With 67 posts, Aiken Electric’s Facebook page registered 2.18 million impressions during the two weeks of repairs and a 111% increase in followers. The co-op also introduced a bit of humor and gamesmanship in response to weary members who fretted about attentive service.

“People kept saying, ‘We don’t see your trucks.’ Of course, they were there; they might have been behind a tree. So we did a post on ‘Can you find the line truck?’” Ligons said. “That helped them to understand they are working; it just may not look like you expected. Our members responded well.”

Walker and Jacob Puckett, digital communications manager at Blue Ridge, managed the bombardment of communications requests, including Fox News, by focusing on one to three main points each day.

For example, some parts of Blue Ridge’s territory suffered medium levels of wind damage while others were hit with cataclysmic flooding. “There were completely different scopes of damage across our service area and we needed people to understand that,” Walker said. “I think the videos and photos helped a lot in showing what we were up against. Trying to respond to every message is impossible when you’re getting comments and direct messages coming in by the thousands, so picking up on trends of concerns and addressing those in our posts helped.”

Canoochee EMC in Reidsville, Georgia, also stuck to a regular system of reports in the morning and in the evening. Along the way, Communications Specialist Joe Sikes learned an important lesson—setting expectations via high-speed internet is not always the way to go.

“We made the decision that the CEO’s update was going to come in the evening after everything happened,” he said. “But when communication is down, you don’t want to do a video without words and some kind of written report. For some people, their internet, if they had any, was not fast enough to actually pull up a video. Everything we do is videos now, but Helene showed us sometimes you need to take a step back.”

CEO on camera

Van O’Cain has seen several storms as director of public and member relations at the Electric Cooperatives of South Carolina, but heading to stricken Little River Electric Cooperative in Abbeville was another experience altogether.

“I had never seen anything like that before. It was the oddest feeling to be driving and not having cell service, so the GPS was not working. The power was out everywhere and you’d go into town and none of the lights are working. So you’re having to go slow and make sure that you don’t wreck. The only sound you could hear would be generators.”

At about 15,000 meters, Little River does not have a full-fledged communications office, so O’Cain traveled several times to put interim General Manager Chad Stone on camera. Not slick, but genuine, just a couple of unscripted minutes outdoors explaining the situation to members.

“We felt it was important for Chad to be able to let his members know what was going on. His people were doing what they could to get the lights on as fast as they could. He needs to be out in the field doing his thing. So that’s how we did it with Chad,” O’Cain said.

A week after the storm, Aiken Electric CEO Gary Stooksbury stood amid downed limbs and lines, half a dozen broken poles on either side of him, to show firsthand why 15,000 meters were still out. “We are literally rebuilding the power system in parts of Edgefield County,” he said.

In another video, Stooksbury, in the field in a work vest, broke down the power restoration process by hand on a sheet of paper and answered typical questions, such as why one house on a road has power but an adjoining one is still in the dark.

Ligons said static charts and graphics have a place on social media, but a CEO drawing by hand in front of members carries a much bigger wallop. “It humanized things, which was part of our overall strategy. We’re local, we understand and we care, but it is not going to be easy,” Ligons said.

High winds and flooding battered Mountain Electric Cooperative in Mountain City, Tennessee, as hard as any co-op. Fourteen days in, General Manager Rodney Metcalf used a simple smartphone video to identify areas that needed work and explain how Helene wiped out even underground systems.

“We are coming. Just give us a little bit more time,” he said. One social media respondent was so impressed that he wrote, “This is what leadership looks like. So many companies could learn a lot from you and MEC.”

To Alisia Hounshell, director of communications and statewide services at the Florida Electric Cooperatives Association, the idea of getting the CEO on camera should be in every communicator’s playbook.

“When a CEO is behind a desk, he’s in an air-conditioned room that has power and he’s talking to an audience that is out of power. Here in Florida, we’re melting or we’re mildewing all at the same time. You want to see the CEO in the field, where they look like they’re working, so the viewer thinks, ‘He’s got his boots on the ground. That guy knows what he’s talking about.’”

Mutual communications aid

Jerry Edge has worked for 31 years at Little Ocmulgee EMC in Alamo, Georgia, and trees falling on his house were not about to stop him. Edge continued his work at the co-op, which maintains a small Facebook presence. Sumter EMC in Americus helped Little Ocmulgee with social media during Helene and that’s how Edge’s story flew across the internet.

“Nobody at our place or Jerry thought anything about the social media side,” said Lewis Sheffield, general manager at Little Ocmulgee. “His quote was, ‘That’s what I do. That’s my job.’ That’s an impressive attitude, but Sumter really opened our eyes to the need to put out there on Facebook for others to see.”

If the sixth cooperative principle is cooperation among cooperatives, its corollary might be cooperation among communicators. Knowing the 24/7 demand from members, the media and other parties, communicators at statewide associations and co-ops in less affected areas stepped up to help other co-ops.

In South Carolina, coastal co-ops such as Berkeley Electric Cooperative and Horry Electric Cooperative largely escaped Helene’s wrath but applied their big storm expertise to support Little River and Laurens, O’Cain noted.

“It was mutual aid among communicators,” he said. “They would help them with social media content or whatever they needed to help the communicators at the most affected co-ops get a little bit of a break. That was something I had not seen that before in our state, so it was beyond the statewide that co-ops were helping co-ops.”

Posts did not have to be tied directly to line work, either. A road safety message from North Carolina’s Electric Cooperatives did overwhelming numbers—nearly 6,000 likes and 2,500 shares on Facebook.

“Co-op lineworkers put their lives on the line every day. If we can support them and the critical work they do by amplifying a strong safety message, that’s a priority for us,” said Townley Venters, director of communications at North Carolina’s Electric Cooperatives.

Hounshell is a big advocate of enlisting another cooperative as a backup when a storm is on the horizon. While at Talquin Electric Cooperative in Quincy, Florida, she turned over the social media account to another co-op communicator in the state for a couple of days once Hurricane Michael hit in 2018.

“Again, it’s setting those expectations. We knew we might lose communications, but we could not afford to go dark,” she said. “There’s always room for improvement and you can’t be so stuck one way and doing one thing that you won’t budge and do something else. You have to pivot in a heartbeat.”

Coming next week

Around 1,500 lineworkers from 175 electric cooperatives were part of the massive mutual aid effort to restore power after Helene. The next installment of our series puts the spotlight on crew members who traveled from states far outside the Southeast with conviction bred in their bones to help others.

Robert Cade grew up in San Antonio and graduated from UT in 1948 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. In 1961, this Life Member of the Texas Exes went to work as a nephrologist (kidney specialist) at the University of Florida College of Medicine and in 1965 led a team of researchers in trying to figure out why football players didn’t urinate after a game. They soon learned that players lost so much fluid that they had none left to form urine. Cade developed a drink that contained salts and sugars that could be absorbed more quickly, and the basis for Gatorade was formed, so named for the team that would first drink it, thanks to a Longhorn.

Texas and especially Austin is home to millions of Mexican free-tailed bats. Any major campus structure, including the Tower, the stadium, or academic buildings (and not only Batts Hall!), can house the flying mammals in its exterior joints, and administrators send out regular warnings against handling bats, which can carry rabies, found on the ground. Meanwhile, the University of Florida Bat Houses are home to 750,000 Mexican free-tailed bats (also known as Brazilian free-tailed bats), Southeastern bats and evening bats. It has even built bat houses and a bat barn (see video below) to shelter the insectivores.

If there’s one thing Texas and Florida have in common, it’s coastline. While Texas has 3,359 shoreline miles of coast, Florida has a whopping 8,436 shoreline miles. UT’s Marine Science Institute was founded in 1941 at Port Aransas to research and to educate students and the public about Texas’s marine ecology. It now has 125 faculty and staff supporting 600 students. Meanwhile, the University of Florida’s Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience is located in St. Augustine on Florida’s Atlantic coast. The Whitney Lab was founded in 1974 to use marine model animals for studying fundamental problems in biology and applying that knowledge to issues of human health, natural resources, and the environment. It’s composed of 11 faculty-led research labs with more than 70 researchers and staff.",https://news.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GatoradeCollage.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 12:07:11.414274

The comments come weeks after Rivian‘s founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said that the success of Chinese EV makers also comes from lower costs on both manufacturing and labor.
Late last year, upon concluding that BYD and other Chinese carmakers benefited from government subsidies, the European Commission imposed tariffs on electric vehicle imports.
In the United States, Chinese electric vehicles also face steep tariffs as a way to enforce fair competition.
The trade war led China and the EU to reopen discussions on the European Commission‘s tariffs on Chinese vehicles.","The incentives given by the Chinese Government to its new energy vehicle (NEV) manufacturers have been a hot topic in the industry since they started accelerating their expansion to Europe a few years ago.

To fight what the European Commission called last year an ‘unfair trading practices,’ a new round of tariffs was imposed exactly a year ago ranging from about 7.8% to 38.1%.

The figures were calculated based on the transparency from each brand during EU’s investigation.

The duties came on top of the existing 10% tariff on imported electric vehicles from China.

On the latest episode of The Verge‘s podcast Decoder, Ford CEO Jim Farley argued that China’s dominance in the auto industry is mostly due to this government support.

“The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry,” Farley stated.

The chief executive of the Detroit automaker added that “there’s no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we’ve seen from China.”

According to Farley, China “is completely dominating the EV landscape globally,” which comes from “great innovation at a very low cost.”

“There are hundreds of companies, and they’re all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies,” adding that it includes brands like BYD and Geely.

But it also includes “companies like Nio and Xiaomi, many of which have never been in the car business before, and that’s a big advantage for them.”

The Centre for Strategic & International Studies reported last year that between 2009 and 2023, China’s government spent at least $230 billion to support domestic electric vehicle manufacturers.

This is where the Chinese electric vehicle maker operates its three EV factories.

The comments come weeks after Rivian‘s founder and CEO RJ Scaringe said that the success of Chinese EV makers also comes from lower costs on both manufacturing and labor.

“It’s inconceivable that Western markets would not allow their domestic manufacturers to produce in China,” while allowing “freely those Chinese companies to produce in China and sell.”

“We’ve taken lots of cars apart, every car manufacturer does,” and “there’s not something magical when you take it apart that’s allowing these really impressive cost structures,” Scaringe said.

According to Morgan Stanley, Chinese automakers are still expected to expand further into the United States in the next decade — even with the tariffs in place between the world’s two largest economies.

The firm’s analysts reminded that Jim Farley praised Xiaomi‘s SU7 late last year, on the Everything Electric show, where he said that he “flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I’ve been driving it for six months now and I don’t want to give it up.”

“When Ford CEO Jim Farley praises a competitor’s car (Xiaomi SU7) — saying he aims to make one just as good or better in a few years… you’ve likely got a winner on your hands,” the note said.

Late last year, upon concluding that BYD and other Chinese carmakers benefited from government subsidies, the European Commission imposed tariffs on electric vehicle imports.

EU member states have encouraged Chinese carmakers to set up factories in Europe as the industry on the Old Continent faces severe headwinds.

In March, and according to the Financial Times, the EU opened a foreign subsidy probe into BYD‘s passenger plant in Hungary.

Setting up local production in Europe means that these companies will be exempt from these tariffs. However, the EU’s top trade official, Sabine Weyand, stressed that these companies must still follow European rules to keep competition fair.

“We are not interested in investments that are simple assembly operations without added value and without technology transfer,” Weyand said.

Instead, the expectation is for investments that create real economic value and include technology transfer. By then, Weyand added that the Commission has ways to enforce this.

In the United States, Chinese electric vehicles also face steep tariffs as a way to enforce fair competition.

Last year, the Biden Administration imposed a 100% tariff on EVs and a 25% tariff on EV batteries coming from China.

In April, Donald Trump announced new, country-specific tariff rates, including a 34% baseline tariff on China, which made the duties on electric vehicles jump to at least 134%.

Global trade tensions increased for the following months, with China and the US ending up with a trade deal, according to which the two countries will temporarily reduce tariffs, effective through November 10.

Under this agreement, the US has reduced its tariffs on Chinese imports from a peak of 125% to 10%, while China has lowered its retaliatory tariffs from 84% to 10% on US goods.

The trade war led China and the EU to reopen discussions on the European Commission‘s tariffs on Chinese vehicles.

Furthermore, and as they seek to avoid higher tariffs while expanding their presence in the European market, a group of Chinese automakers — including Nio, XPeng, and Xiaomi — took part in discussions between the two blocs in July.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gylt1ZRXMAIxsUb.jpeg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-30 13:06:41.020399

Which in the case of climate means much less emphasis on marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions, and much more emphasis on trying to solve the remaining hard problems of climate change on a technical level.
There are ideas that are clean and pro-growth (de-regulation of clean energy), and there are ideas that are clean and anti-growth (squelching energy demand or fossil fuel production).
Clean anti-growth is fine, if you believe that people are eager to make substantial sacrifices for the sake of climate change.
Taking the problem seriously I understand that people who are passionate about climate change don’t like to hear this.","I argued yesterday that donor influence has put Democrats out of step with the concerns of working-class voters primarily by pushing them to adopt left-wing stands on cultural and environmental issues.

For the most part, I think the solution is pretty straightforward: The party should nominate and support candidates who are in line with public opinion in the states they’re running in, and party leaders should stand by this big tent strategy.

But climate change is the sticky wicket, because even though Democrats have a bad habit of siloing climate and energy policy away from economic policy, energy is an incredibly important aspect of “the economy.” You cannot have an economic policy agenda centered on advancing the economic interests of the working class and an energy agenda that totally ignores this. It would be politically convenient for Democrats — and healthy for American democracy — if every climate philanthropist woke up tomorrow and decided that what they actually care about is abortion rights at home and public health abroad.

But, taking it as a given that people who are fired up about climate change will continue to be fired up about climate change, it would be constructive if they would engage with the topic more productively.

A huge share of climate funding in the United States is based on the false premise that there is a huge bank of “climate voters” who are themselves fired up about the issue and prepared to make meaningful sacrifices in order to address it. This is not true. In fact, I think it’s pretty obviously not true. But because there’s so much money available for climate activism, the field is full of stakeholders with personal investment in the status quo, and they expend incredible amounts of time and energy on trying to mislead others about this. So much so that it’s barely worth getting into the dirt and wrestling with them over the polling. Just consider that in a world where most voters cared about climate change, the following policy framework would make a ton of sense, politically:

Put a price on carbon equivalent to a credible estimate of the cost of carbon

Use some of the resulting revenue to cut other taxes

Use some of the resulting revenue to subsidize clean technology

There would, of course, be a lot of disagreement about the details, but that’s what the debate would be about: how high should the carbon price be, what non-carbon taxes should we cut, and how should we structure our clean spending. And 15 years ago, that’s what climate advocates were focused on. Their efforts at carbon pricing failed spectacularly, but instead of revisiting the premise that voters care a lot about this and are willing to make sacrifices to address it, the advocacy community keeps blocking infrastructure to make fossil fuels more expensive in a non-transparent way.

It’s far better to accept reality. Just because the voters don’t care about something doesn’t mean that you need to stop caring about it. But if your priorities diverge from those of the voters, you need to be smart. Which in the case of climate means much less emphasis on marginally speeding up the adoption of good climate solutions, and much more emphasis on trying to solve the remaining hard problems of climate change on a technical level.

Deep decarbonization is still not technically feasible

You can think of decarbonization as existing on a spectrum from things that have workable technical solutions to things where the only way to reduce emissions is to just give up on doing the thing.

At the easiest end of the spectrum right now, I would say, is using electric induction stoves for home cooking rather than natural gas. A majority of American stoves are already electric, the electric share is higher in other countries where energy costs are more salient, and the most widely recommended induction stoves are already cheaper than their gas competitors. A close cousin to electric cooking these days is the electric car, which is highly functional and just as good (if not better) for a majority of the driving that people do. One barrier to adoption is the logistics of taking a long road trip, but you can still definitely do a long road trip with an electric car. Another barrier is price, especially for the big trucks and S.U.V.s that Americans tend to prefer. On the other hand, the United States is deliberately keeping cheap Chinese E.V.s off the market. The barriers to adopting cheaper E.V.s are not all (or even primarily) technical.

At the other end of the spectrum is something like making cement.

Interesting work is happening on trying to make low-carbon cement (David Roberts has a good interview with Leah Ellis on this topic) but it is not currently possible to scale. Similarly, it’s not feasible to use electricity to manufacture primary steel. This chart from Nicolas Fulghum I think tends to err on the side of optimism in classifying things like trucking as “can be electrified economically,” but I do think it illustrates the basic shape of the situation.

If I were making that chart, I would add a fifth category for things, like trucks, where today we can’t really do it economically but the roadmap is perfectly clear. We know how to build a good electric truck. The problem is that to make electric trucking cost effective, we need bigger and cheaper batteries. But batteries are getting bigger and cheaper, and the basic industrial processes and market forces that are working on this in an electric car context should carry over. Something like recreational boating is in a similar place — it’s not that the problem is solved, but the solution is within sight.

So I think there are two major takeaways from this chart:

One is that incredible progress has been made! It’s sometimes fashionable to declare that technology will not save us, but in fact, technological progress on decarbonization has been enormous, while progress on getting people to adopt degrowth solutions has been essentially zero.

The other is that there are a lot of problems that are either unsolved or at best semi-solved, where making more or faster technological progress would have a large impact on climate outcomes. Also note that while steel, chemicals, and cement add up to a smaller share of the world’s final energy demand than cars or heating, that’s not the only way to think of the significance of those sectors. The entire modern economy would completely collapse without steel, chemicals, and cement. So it’s not like these are trivial issues.

Advocacy is focused on the wrong end of the spectrum

Right now, a large share of climate advocacy and spending is focused on the topics that are at the “easy” end of the spectrum.

This would make sense in a counterfactual world in which the majority of voters care a lot about climate change and are willing to make meaningful material sacrifices to promote decarbonization. In that world, there’s still nothing we can do about the fact that some problems are technically hard. The very small gray “chemicals” box in the chart above, for example, contains within it the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia. Without that process, global agricultural production would crash and we’d see mass starvation. In a universe of climate voters, you just leave ammonia alone and focus on banning gas stoves and internal-combustion-engine cars. Not only would that promote short-term emissions reduction, it would drive investment all throughout the stack. A ban on gas stoves or conventional cars would serve as a proof point that if someone, for example, did invent a zero-carbon boat, the government would act swiftly to make their competition illegal, which would make that type of invention a very promising avenue for investment.

But we are not in that world.

Banning normal consumer appliances is a political liability: vulnerable Democrats worry about taking these votes and vulnerable Republicans never cross the aisle to join with Democrats.

Instead, renewable energy, electric cars, heat pumps, and induction stoves are all growing primarily because the technology is good enough to be compelling to consumers. That’s not to say public policy, philanthropy, and advocacy had nothing to do with it. But these things all had the biggest impact when they drove the technology forward when it was in a more primitive state. And by the same token, the most important thing to do today is to put resources into trying to make technical progress on the issues where little has been made.

Innovation is hard, and hard to predict.

Maybe someone will come up with a viable method of using electricity to generate the kind of very high heat that you need for some of these applications. Maybe some kind of battery breakthrough will make electric passenger jets viable. Or maybe the answer will be something more like what Terraform Industries is doing, trying to manufacture hydrocarbons out of a mix of air and electricity. If that becomes cost-effective, then we don’t need to solve electrification problems in some of these other areas. Or maybe we could replace fossil fuels in some of these processes with pure hydrogen, which in principle can be manufactured out of water, if electricity is cheap enough.

Clean energy abundance

This last point about the cost of electricity is important.

To an extent, the case for switching from fossil fuel heat to heat pumps hinges on the performance characteristics of heat pumps. But it’s also a function of the price of electricity. This is probably less of a concern for those considering a switch to an electric car, but it’s still relevant. And of course, if everyone did switch to an electric car, that would drive up the price of electricity. And there are a lot of potential technological solutions related to things like green hydrogen or carbon capture that would only work if electricity were dramatically cheaper. By the same token, we could address a lot of the challenging climate issues at the nexus of agriculture and deforestation by switching to vertical farms — except that requires a ton of electricity.

All of which is to say that policy measures to dramatically increase the supply of clean energy are a big win.

A lot of conventional approaches seem to make the mistake of starting with current levels of energy use and then reasoning backward to figure out how much clean energy we “need.” But in the future, it would be desirable to use a lot more energy — in part so that poor people around the world can enjoy better living standards, in part so that we in the United States can enjoy better living standards, and in part so that we can deploy abundant electricity to solve some of these other problems by doing “wasteful” things like manufacturing synthetic hydrocarbons.

One virtue of a strong policy focus on this is that even if you are focused on clean energy abundance because you care a lot about climate change, you’re not asking other people to accept material sacrifice for the sake of climate. If clean electricity gets cheaper, people will just use it and, at that point, facilitating the deployment of clean energy is just solid pro-growth economic policy.

Most major environmental organizations in the United States, as well as prominent activists like Bill McKibben, think they have embraced this vision. Solar panels are really cheap, batteries are getting cheaper, and they’re enthusiastic about the idea that this means the renewable energy future will be cheap. Which is great.

But if you scratch the surface, they’re still obsessed with blocking fossil fuel production, even though if you ask them about carbon pricing, they’re happy to admit that making oil and gas expensive is a political dead end. There’s a lot of interest in the cutesy argument that blocking liquified natural gas exports will depress the domestic price of gas, so their anti-supply position is also good for reducing the cost of living. Or else they want to play Whac-A-Mole and block new sources of energy demand, like data centers, and say that’s a solution to cost of living problems.

This is clever as debate gamesmanship at a time of acute concern about prices, but it evades the actual issue. There are ideas that are clean and pro-growth (de-regulation of clean energy), and there are ideas that are clean and anti-growth (squelching energy demand or fossil fuel production). Clean anti-growth is fine, if you believe that people are eager to make substantial sacrifices for the sake of climate change. But again, that’s not true, and if it were true, we’d be talking about carbon pricing.

Taking the problem seriously

I understand that people who are passionate about climate change don’t like to hear this. But it is genuinely okay to be a high-minded person who cares about things like coastal flooding in Bangladesh in the 2060s, even if most voters don’t. If you really, truly, deeply care about an issue, though, you owe it to yourself to look reality squarely in the face.

And my point here is that “approaching climate change realistically” does not mean “giving up.”

It means refocusing our efforts on the things that have paid dividends in the past — trying to solve the hard technical barriers to decarbonization and trying to facilitate the deployment of zero-carbon energy. Singularly focusing on these two pillars will probably not achieve global net zero by 2050, but neither will banging our collective heads against the wall and ceding every election to Republicans.

Finally, I want to say that the last refuge of scoundrels on this topic is for advocates to hide behind their non-partisan non-electoral 501(c)3 status and say it’s not their job to worry about politics.

I’m sorry, but no.

I’m not asking you to break the law and do electoral work with tax exempt funding. But we all need to act like adults here. If you’re cooking up a policy and advocacy agenda, you have to pay attention to what’s plausible. If we’re sitting around a seminar table, I could make an argument to “cut Medicare and use the money to finance anti-malaria programs in Africa,” but that would be a ridiculous thing for an aid advocacy organization to spend its time talking about. It’s not going to happen, and if you succeed in branding “pay for it by cutting Medicare” as the authentic way for people who are passionate about global public health to engage with the issue, you’re going to engender catastrophic backlash.

There are many unmet needs on both the technical and the deployment side of these problems, plenty of things that could be worth funding, and lots of non-activism work that people could be doing. Go invent a better battery, build an electric boat, start a business installing heat pumps, develop a policy agenda for industrial decarbonization or efficient intensive agriculture, or try to find a way to stop conservatives from banning lab-grown proteins. Climate is a big problem! It’s great that a lot of people with resources at their disposal want to do something about it, but there’s a dire need to do things that are constructive rather than destructive.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mEs2!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15a01b65-bbb3-48b9-9f45-79c7745f1615_5160x3604.jpeg",N,,2025-09-30 12:05:59.758927

Administered by the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), the Climate Service Corps provides funding to organizations to establish career training programs that are focused on energy efficiency, as well as clean heating and cooling systems. Discussion of the new program preceded a graduation ceremony that day for the college’s first cohort of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) students.

“The horse is out of the barn — clean energy transition is happening. It is happening all around the world. You know, unfortunately, I think you know what’s occurring here is really just impeding and diminishing American competitiveness in that market,” Hoffer said. “For folks who are worried about what it means, I’m here to tell you … I have never seen folks more energized. I have never seen the presence of corporate America engaged in this discussion at the level that I did this time around — states, cities, leading nonprofits, philanthropy stepping up in an incredible way, private investors looking for ways to get in and support work, looking for [clean energy] projects. I am bringing that message of hope.”

Hoffer mentioned the inaugural graduating class of Greenfield Community College’s HVAC cohort will be able to take part in the state’s “wave of electrification,” which includes the growth of a number of industries, such as offshore wind and heat pump installation.

The climate chief added that while bringing the state closer to its goal of emitting net-zero greenhouse gases by 2050, the initiative will help young people access careers in high-paying fields.

“This can bring real climate solutions to our neighborhoods … things like weatherization, which we know immediately reduces costs and also improves indoor air quality and just the quality of life at home, energy-efficiency upgrades and community education to gain skills, credentials, work experience that prepare folks for meaningful jobs in clean energy,” she told those gathered at GCC on Friday. “As we move forward, I know all of you are committed to connecting young people to careers, strengthening communities and accelerating our move to the clean energy transition.”

MassCEC announced last week that it awarded GCC a $374,995 grant to deliver industry skills training and career readiness activities in energy efficiency and building science occupations to 22 students in partnership with the MassHire Franklin Hampshire Workforce Board and MassHire Franklin Hampshire Career Center’s YouthWorks program.

“GCC Workforce Development’s partnership with MassCEC has allowed us to expand training programs for climate-critical careers. These careers will advance the commonwealth’s ambitious climate goals and provide meaningful sustainable wages right here in Franklin County,” GCC President Michelle Schutt said. “This investment builds upon GCC’s longstanding commitment to clean energy and environmental sustainability.”

“Where we see ourselves fitting in in this support system is really focusing on what somebody needs to be able to not just get a job, but to be able to maintain a career. There’s a really big difference there,” Young Adult Career Programs Manager Zach Podhorzer said during the panel. “By working in partnership with GCC and partnering with businesses for these opportunities, we all come together to make sure that the young folks that are here in our region are able to recognize there’s value in this part of the state.”

Other panelists, such as program graduate Jae’Kwon O’Connor, said he liked working with his hands and was inspired to take part in the HVAC program by his late cousin, who was going to apply to join the HVAC union.

“I just want to say thank you to everybody that was involved with this program. It means a lot to all of us, especially my fellow classmates tonight. Thank you for the opportunity,” O’Connor said. “I really never knew [anything] about this until about a year ago, when I found out about this program. I was always good with my hands, but I couldn’t tell you what a heat pump was four months ago. I’m very thankful for this program.”

“Congratulations for reaching this incredible milestone,” Schutt told the HVAC program graduates, mentioning how they succeeded in the “rigorous” 17-week program. “This is not the end. This is just the beginning, because the skills you have learned are the foundations of an incredible career.”

Earlier this month, Greenfield Mayor Ginny Desorgher issued a statement encouraging all Greenfield residents to take advantage of federal tax credits for clean energy and energy-efficient home improvements, some of which are set to expire soon.

Residential clean energy credits can earn residents back 30% of the total cost associated with installing solar panels, battery storage and geothermal systems until Dec. 31. Residents can also claim up to $2,000 for a new heat pump and up to $1,200 for other energy-efficient upgrades, such as insulation. This credit is likewise valid until Dec. 31.

Until June 30, 2026, residents can receive credits of up to $1,000 for installing an electric vehicle charger in their homes.

“These federal tax credits represent a fantastic opportunity for Greenfield residents to make smart financial and environmental choices,” Desorgher said in a statement. “Whether you’re looking to … install solar panels or upgrade your home’s insulation, there is a significant financial incentive waiting for you. Don’t miss out on these savings that will not only put money back in your pocket but also help us build a more sustainable community.”",https://i0.wp.com/recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CleanEnergy2AC92925-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-30 14:00:58.903771

The Irony Blowing Across the Plains

Donald Trump stood at the U.N. railing against wind turbines, sneering that renewables are a scam. The irony? The states with the most wind turbines are the same ones that voted for him. Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota — all deep-red, all leaders in renewable energy production.

This isn’t liberal California’s doing. It’s geography and economics. The windiest land in America just happens to be in Trump country, and you can’t make an oil rig sprout out of cornfields.

Culture War vs. Checkbook War

Here’s the two-step GOP hustle:

Culture War: On Fox News and campaign stages, renewables are painted as “elite fantasies,” “ugly bird killers,” or part of some Green New Deal plot to control your thermostat.

Checkbook War: Back home, those same lawmakers cut ribbons at wind farms, brag about the jobs, and quietly take credit for federal dollars flowing into their districts.

The disconnect is staggering. According to the Department of Energy, Texas alone generates over 28% of America’s wind power, and rural counties are flush with property tax revenue from turbines. In Iowa, nearly 60% of the state’s electricity comes from wind. These aren’t tree-hugger policies — they’re red-state cash cows.

State-by-State: Who’s Cashing In?

Notice the pattern? The redder the state, the bigger the turbine.

Precise numbers of staffing cuts are hard to pin down, but their historic scale in the first eight months of this administration is unmistakable.
Effects of past cuts In the past, cuts to the EPA caused problems and were reversed – but it took years.
The staffing and budget cuts that came during the first two years of the Reagan administration generated problems with meeting the agency’s responsibilities.
Reagan’s EPA budget, which had fallen to US$4.1 billion in 1984, increased to $4.9 billion in 1989.","As Congress faces a Sept. 30, 2025, deadline to fund the federal government, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin has put the EPA on the chopping block. But even before Congress decides about the administration’s recommendations to slash its staff, the EPA’s political leaders have made even more significant cuts to the agency’s workforce.

And a look at past efforts to cut EPA staff shows how rapidly those changes can affect Americans’ health and the environment.

Using publicly available government databases and a collection of in-depth interviews with current and former EPA employees, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a group of volunteer academics that we are a part of, has begun to put some numbers behind what many have suspected. Zeldin’s cuts have diminished the EPA’s staffing levels, even before Congress has had a chance to weigh in, affecting the environment, public health and government transparency.

How many people are being let go?

Precise numbers of staffing cuts are hard to pin down, but their historic scale in the first eight months of this administration is unmistakable. Released in May, Zeldin’s budget proposal for the fiscal year starting October 2025 proposed to cut 1,274 full-time-equivalent employee positions from a total of 14,130 in the year ending Sept. 30, 2025 – a 9% drop.

A July 18, 2025, press release from the EPA said the agency had already cut 23% of its personnel, terminating the employment of 3,707 of 16,155 employees. Using employees – the number of people – rather than full-time equivalents makes these numbers difficult to compare directly with EPA’s budget proposals.

Combining EPA data on staffing changes with conservative estimates of the pending cuts, the initiative has calculated that 25% of EPA staff are already out of the agency.

That calculation does not include other announced cuts, including a third round of deferred resignations taking effect at the end of September 2025 and December 2025. Those cuts may see the departure of similar numbers of full-time equivalents as in the past two rounds – approximately 500 and 1,500.

The agency has also reportedly planned to be cutting as much as two-thirds of research staff.

With those departure figures included, the initiative estimates that approximately 33% of staffers at the agency when Trump took office will be gone by the end of 2025. That would leave, at the start of 2026, an EPA staff numbering approximately 9,700 people, a level not seen since the last years of the Nixon and Ford administrations.

These cuts are deeper than past efforts to shrink the size of the agency. In his first term, Trump proposed eliminating 21.4% of staff at the EPA, though Congress made no significant changes to the agency’s staffing. The largest actual cut to EPA staffing was under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s: He advocated for a 17.3% drop in staffing, although Congress held the cuts to 10%.

Effects of past cuts

In the past, cuts to the EPA caused problems and were reversed – but it took years.

For instance, rather than prosecute industry for polluting, Reagan’s EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch told business leaders she would ignore their violations of environmental laws. Remaining staff were convinced that working on enforcement cases would be a “black mark” on their records.

Another top political appointee at Reagan’s EPA, Rita Lavelle, who headed the Superfund effort to clean up toxic sites, faced prison time for her official acts. She was convicted of perjury and obstructing a congressional investigation because she lied about her ties to a former employer who had polluted the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a Superfund site near Riverside, California.

In the wake of the scandal, Lavelle was fired and Gorsuch and more than a dozen other political appointees resigned.

In a later report on the issue, Congress accused Gorsuch, Lavelle and others of poor job performance, noting that after four years of Superfund work, “only six of the 546 … of the most hazardous sites in the Nation have been cleaned up.” The Stringfellow site, a focus of the investigation, was “threatening the health and safety of 500,000 people,” the report noted.

With anger over the scandals from both Americans and Congress, Reagan reversed course and spent the remaining six years of his presidency building the EPA back up in both staffing and budget. Staffing, for example, increased from a low of 10,481 full-time-equivalent employees in 1982 to 15,130 in 1989. Reagan’s EPA budget, which had fallen to US$4.1 billion in 1984, increased to $4.9 billion in 1989.

The existing Trump cuts, and those proposed – if enacted by Congress – would be deeper than Reagan’s, reducing the number of people doing important research on environmental harms and the health effects of dangerous chemicals; suing companies who pollute the environment; and overseeing the cleanup of toxic sites.

By 2028, U.S. electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are projected to produce approximately 4.7 million EVs annually. This growth will fuel demand for charging stations, infrastructure, batteries, supply chain operations and more. As the EV sector continues to grow, Governors are assessing the workforce infrastructure needed to ensure it drives economic growth, strengthens local industries and expands opportunity for their residents. Meeting this moment requires a larger, more highly skilled workforce, with opportunities that are well-paying, wide-ranging and accessible through community colleges, apprenticeships and workforce training programs nationwide.

However, persistent myths and misconceptions about EV careers are slowing progress and creating barriers for students, job seekers, educators and employers, resulting in untapped talent that could be put to work in a rapidly growing sector. Below, we unpack some of the most common EV workforce myths and share examples of real pathways that exist today.

Myth 1: EV Jobs Are Only Engineering or Highly Technical Roles

Most EV careers are hands-on and don’t require an engineering degree. This industry spans electrical work, assembly, automotive maintenance and advanced manufacturing with roles for battery technicians, machinists, assemblers, industrial production managers, electricians and power-line installers. Many of these jobs are learned through experience on the job or apprenticeships.

As EV technology and infrastructure expands, so does the demand for a broader range of skills and occupations. Growth in charging infrastructure alone is creating new opportunities for power-line installers, repairers and electricians who maintain EV systems.

The EV workforce is broad, hands-on and open to people with diverse backgrounds. It covers five key areas: scientific research, design and development, manufacturing, maintenance and repair, and charging infrastructure development. For workforce strategies, this means tapping into a wide talent pool and promoting multiple entry-points into the sector.

Myth 2: You Need A College Degree To Enter The EV Industry

Global electric car sales topped 17 million in 2024, accounting for over 20% of all new cars sold. This surge is creating high-demand, well-paying roles across the EV industry, many of which don’t require a four-year degree. Short-term training programs, apprenticeships and community college pathways provide direct access into careers ranging from EV maintenance to battery manufacturing.

From wiring and mechanical assembly to safety protocols, the industry values hands-on skills and experience often more than formal degrees. Competency-based training and industry certifications offer job seekers efficient pathways into these growing careers, saving both time and the cost of traditional higher education.

Myth 3: The Electric Vehicle Workforce Isn’t Diverse

A growing number of programs are working to diversify the EV talent pipeline. Programs like Rosie’s Girls in Philadelphia introduce high school girls to EV technology through a 63-hour pre-apprenticeship program with real-world training. In Denver, Women Who Charge fosters growth of the EV industry by hosting networking events, recognizing women leaders in the field and developing best practices on project designs that are female friendly.

ChargerHelp, a leader in EV charging technology, launched SmarterHelp to scale training for in-demand technical careers. The organization is taking an equity-centered approach to workforce training and job placement by supporting workers and learners from various backgrounds and with varying levels of skills and work experience – like youth and people with records – and training them for careers in the clean energy sector. They are starting with the EVSE Reliability Technician Training program to prepare a diverse workforce for the growing sector.

These combined efforts are helping ensure the EV workforce reflects the diversity of the communities it serves.

Myth 4: EV Training Needs Don’t Translate Across Industries

The skills required to build and maintain electric vehicles are highly transferable, spanning traditional auto manufacturing and energy sectors among others. Technical knowledge in diagnostics, data analysis, assembly, project management and quality assurance testing is equally valuable in fields like advanced manufacturing, solar and clean energy, AI and infrastructure. Learning skills for an EV job doesn’t confine someone to a singular career path.

Training providers and community colleges are responding by designing curricula that integrate skills from overlapping sectors. This effort is reinforced by national organizations working to provide structure and guidance for states. For example, Advance CTE has developed an energy and natural resources career cluster – groupings of related career areas within the energy sector that share common skills – to assist workers and learners in navigating their career options and upskilling opportunities. This approach strengthens the EV talent pipeline while providing workers with greater career flexibility in a rapidly evolving economy.

Conclusion

Dispelling myths about who can work in the EV sector is more than just setting the record straight; it’s about opening doors and helping people pursue careers that feel stable, rewarding and worthwhile. If left unchallenged, these outdated assumptions will continue to block access for many people – an issue Governors may want to weigh as they consider policies that broaden pathways into the EV workforce and ensure inclusive economic growth.

The EV Workforce Collaborative, a partnership between the National Governors Association and the National League of Cities powered by the Siemens Foundation, has already helped states and cities consider policies, funding and workforce strategies that help build an inclusive EV workforce. By addressing shared challenges, expanding training for underrepresented communities, and investing in transferable, industry-aligned certifications, the Collaborative is bringing organizations together around the shared mission of helping more people envision themselves in EV careers. Through this effort, Taskforce and Working Group members are ensuring that as the EV industry grows, the workforce grows with it, remaining diverse, skilled and ready to power the future of transportation.

When the clock strikes midnight on Oct. 1, the $7,500 federal tax credit on EVs will expire, potentially turning affordable electric carriages into showroom pumpkins.

Sales of electric cars are certain to dip. Real-world prices will rise. The only question is how much, and for how long, as President Donald Trump and his administration continue to go scorched-earth over climate change and kneecap support for electric cars and renewable energy.

With one eye on the clock, consumers bought more new EVs in August 2025 than in any other month in US history: Sales reached 146,332 cars, up nearly 18 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive. Nearly one in 10 new cars — 9.9 percent — was fully electric, another market milestone. Used EVs, good for credits of up to $4,000, set their own record with nearly 41,000 sales.

With one eye on the clock, consumers bought more new EVs in August 2025 than in any other month in US history

Those sales came despite a stubbornly high price premium of $9,066 versus a typical internal combustion model, according to Cox. But that calculation doesn’t take credits into account, meaning $7,500 credits helped many buyers get closer to elusive “price parity” with gasoline models — precisely what credits were designed to do, to spark mainstream adoption and combat climate change. In July and August, between credits and fire-sale incentives, the average EV cost $44,908, or $600 less than the $45,521 paid for ICE models, according to J.D. Power.

Now those clean-car credits that benefited buyers and automakers, first conceived in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, are sailing off into the sunset. President Barack Obama switched an existing $7,500 credit to a point-of-sale rebate, with a goal of getting 1 million EVs on the road. Rebates continued as a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, but tied to a dizzying array of domestic-sourcing rules and restrictions that created confusion for buyers.

“Without doubt we will see a sales dip, but it won’t fall off a cliff,” says Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. “It’s not like people aren’t going to buy EVs.”

Short-term pain

EV sales could drop as much as 27 percent after consumers lose tax breaks, according to a study from economics professors Joseph Shapiro, Felix Tintelnot, and Hunt Allcott. Coincidentally, that 27 percent sales decline is exactly what Germany experienced over the first 10 months of 2024, after the government abruptly killed incentives worth $4,900.

Many experts bemoan the sudden loss of credits here, especially with EVs already fighting hurricane-force headwinds. A phase-out over a few years would give the market time to adjust.

Short-term pain will ensue, yet some experts liken the situation to tearing off the Band-Aid. Automakers will have to step up their electric games and deliver truly affordable EVs, with no excuses or subsidies to hide behind. Optimistically, perhaps, EVs may carry less tiresome political baggage, rather than being a symbol of government overreach or an “EV mandate” that never existed.

“A lot of the murkiness goes away, and to some degree, the stigma,” Drury says. “You say, ‘Oh, the government shouldn’t be subsidizing cars’? That’s gone, and now it’s just another car. There are fewer reasons and rationales to say no.”

Leasing lessons

Consumers will also have to fully commit to the tech, buying their EV rather than leasing to take advantage of the IRA’s controversial leasing loophole — a back door that allowed even the wealthiest households to knock $7,500 off the priciest imported luxury EVs.

“We know this will change the dynamic of how people buy EVs, but it’s almost in a positive way,” Drury says. “You’ll have customers who are in it for the long haul. You’ll get more people who buy an EV on its merits, because it’s the best car in its class, not because it’s a cheap lease or the lowest price.”

Why should EV fans or carbon-conscious Americans care how people pay for their cars? When the IRA was passed in August 2022, about 7 percent of EVs were leased, according to Edmunds. By November 2024, that shot to 79 percent, and lease percentages now hover around 70 percent. No one can blame consumers for seeking the best deal on a car. But the market distortion of leasing credits has tarnished the perception and long-term value of many EVs. Most ICE automakers had internalized the lesson: If you give too many cars away via leases or rental fleets, you’ll pay a steep price later.

“A lot of the murkiness goes away, and to some degree, the stigma.”

Among 10 models with the worst residual prices after three years, eight are EVs, including the Mercedes EQS, Nissan Leaf, and popular Kia EV6, which lose more than half their original value.

Lingering, unfounded stigma over EV battery life — despite typical 10-year, 100,000-mile warranties — play some role in shaky residuals. But in a vicious circle, those battery suspicions are fed by the glut of low-mileage EVs coming off leases, herds of white (or green) elephants that dealers must offload. The takeaway is that used EVs are damaged goods, giving the oil industry or online skeptics more ammunition to scare people away.

“We have better EVs today. The batteries aren’t dying,” Drury says. “But when people see all these two- and three-year-old EVs on lots, and a $100,000 car that’s down to $50,000, they become suspect.”

Fewer choices

Without a backstop from credits, automakers are still in a tricky spot. Many will need to adjust EV prices downward or boost incentives — cash back, zero down, or low-interest deals — to soften the blow to consumers and avoid a sales collapse. If automakers can’t move EVs at current prices, they certainly can’t sell them for $7,500 more. When Tesla and General Motors faced an earlier credit phase-out in 2019, after crossing the 250,000 mark in cumulative EV sales, both responded by cutting prices.

Yet Tesla aside, every major automaker already loses money on every EV they sell, as they work to scale up and reduce battery costs. With domestic and foreign brands already swallowing massive tariff bills, without passing many price increases to customers, their bottom lines are becoming so many rolls of Bounty: They can only absorb so much.

“You’ll get more people who buy an EV on its merits”

At least temporarily, consumers will see fewer choices in EVs, as spooked automakers renew their love affairs with gasoline and play along with Trump’s bid to unwind regulations. Affordable hybrids and PHEVs, their sales already booming, look like clear winners in a post-credit world.

Reversals and do-overs are coming on a near-daily basis: Honda will stop making the Acura ZDX that GM assembles in Tennessee. Stellantis killed off its long-awaited Ram electric pickup, with its titanic, 229 kilowatt-hour battery pack and 500-mile range, before it sold even one. Tariff-tossed brands that import EVs from overseas, such as Volvo, Audi, and Mercedes, have the least wiggle room. Volvo nixed its ES90 sedan for America. Porsche postponed a three-row electric SUV flagship, and took a painful $2.1 billion writedown on its electric operations.

Drury says that, like the “compliance cars” of another era, half-hearted or fitfully competitive EVs like the ZDX or Audi Q4 e-tron will fall by the wayside. Only the strongest entries, and automakers, will maneuver through newly hostile terrain and come out whole on the other side.

“We’re going to be filtering out the crowd to see who really makes the best EVs,” Drury says.

No automaker will simply walk away from the electric game, he adds, lest they cede customers to nimbler brands. Once loyal customers are lost, as Detroit once learned against Japanese automakers, they may never return.

While Trump and co. paint the end of credits as a victory for affordability and consumer choice, their moves to wind back the clock on fossil fuels — perhaps to the days of Daniel Plainview — make clear they have no interest in a level playing field. Trump tapped men with deep ties to the fossil-fuel industry to lead his Energy and Interior departments. As The Washington Post reported, he called for $1 billion in oil-industry donations at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser in 2024, backed by an explicit promise to roll back emissions regulations if elected. In a rambling jeremiad at the United Nations this week, the president claimed EVs and renewable energy are a road to economic ruin.

‘Like a Greek tragedy’

As former director of the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, Margo Oge was the architect of President Obama’s landmark 2012 auto emissions rules that demanded automakers double their fuel efficiency and halve greenhouse emissions. Back then, lithium-ion batteries cost more than $800 a kilowatt-hour, about eight times what they do today. Oge and the administration figured that if just three percent of consumers bought EVs by 2025, America could meet targets that called for a 54.4mpg fleetwide average. After reaching 8.1 percent market share in 2024, EVs were brushing 10 percent of the market in August, more than three times those expectations in 2012.

“We’ve seen so much progress” Oge says, due largely to government subsidies and firm fuel-economy targets that spurred automakers to get serious about electrified models.

“Now it’s like a Greek tragedy,” Oge says. “I would hate to be the CEO of GM or Ford. Everyone is fearful and intimidated to speak out. But as politely as they can, they are saying, ‘Give us a reason to invest and have certainty.’”

“I would hate to be the CEO of GM or Ford”

Oge said one might fairly argue whether Biden’s pollution and EV targets for 2031 were too ambitious. But Washington now seeks to nullify fuel standards entirely, and even deny California’s legally affirmed right to set its own pollution and climate-change rules.

“The administration is saying standards don’t even exist, the EPA has no authority, and they’ll give the oil industry everything they’ve been looking for,” she says.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California yesterday reversed a pledge to offer state credits to keep models more affordable, saying, “We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

But Oge believes blue states especially need to step in to help offset the loss of credits, and affirm their support of EVs.

“It’s not just about climate change, but our country’s competitiveness,” Oge says. “Our domestic industry has to continue to innovate, for the long-term survival of the industry.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/257977_clock_run_out_on_EVs_CVirginia-.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-09-30 09:00:04.946078

Signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, for the duration of its three-year life, the electric vehicle tax credit eased the financial burden for manufacturers and consumers as Americans embarked on the transition from fossil fuel-dependent cars to the more climate-friendly electric option.

The transition to cleaner electric vehicles is a key part of the global effort to reduce humanity’s carbon footprint and fight against climate change. But electric vehicles are a new industry, the technology is still expensive and growing, and they have a tough fight against the heavily established, and still directly and indirectly subsidized fossil fuel-dependent auto industry.

“We need incentives to help try to replace as many gasoline vehicles with electric vehicles as possible,” David Reichmuth, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Clean Transportation Program, told Gizmodo. “Transportation is the largest source of global warming pollution in the country, and passenger vehicles are the largest source within transportation. There’s really no way to make the reductions we need to make to avoid the worst damages from climate change without switching from fossil fuels to cleaner electric vehicles powered by renewable energy.”

The tax credit also helped build up the American electric vehicle industry and bring manufacturing back to North America at a time when Chinese and European competitors are running circles around the American electric vehicle industry. To qualify for the electric vehicle tax credit, the vehicles were required to have been assembled in North America.

But that all comes to an end today, as the tax credit officially expires. President Trump is to thank for that.

Trump was never shy about his distaste for the electric vehicle tax credit on the campaign trail. When elected President, it was one of his first orders of business to start the dismantling process of the incentive. That process was finalized when Trump’s “big beautiful” spending bill passed Congress and was signed into law in July.

What was the tax credit?

The electric vehicle tax credit was threefold: a new car sales tax credit of up to $7,500 and a used car sales tax credit of up to $4,000, both of which consumers could get back on their tax returns, and a leasing tax credit of up to $7,500 that was claimed by leasing companies and translated to lower costs for consumers.

Even before Biden pushed for the electric vehicle tax credit, climate-friendly policy in one shape or another had protected American electric vehicle manufacturers for more than a decade.

The predecessor of the current electric vehicle tax credits was first introduced in 2008, under the second administration of Republican President George W. Bush. But there was a cap on the number of rebates per manufacturer, so the benefits expired faster for big names like Tesla. Biden’s EV tax credit changed that and expanded the rule further to include new eligibility requirements, such as putting an income limit and requiring the final assembly location to be in North America.

What now?

The looming end of the tax credit led to a record-breaking surge in electric vehicle sales in August and September as companies tried to empty out their EV stocks, and consumers who were thinking about buying or leasing EVs rushed to get theirs before the deadline.

Going forward, experts have grim sales expectations for electric vehicles, at least in the short term, as those who would have bought EVs in, say, November or December already made the purchase.

In the longer term, though, demand is likely to pick back up again, although likely to be slower than before, at least in the foreseeable future.

Hyundai Motor CEO José Muñoz told reporters earlier this month that even though the company expects short-term demand to go down, in the mid to long-term, they are expecting electric vehicle demand to continue to grow.

Ultimately, the repeal of this tax credit is bound to disproportionately affect newcomers in the electric vehicle industry. Although big names like Tesla and Rivian will likely be hurt, to some extent, by the decrease in consumer demand, they will continue to dominate the market while other automakers pull back on EVs, and potential new competition is discouraged from entering the industry. Tesla CEO Elon Musk last year advocated for the end of the subsidies himself, saying that “it will only help Tesla.”

It is also going to disproportionately impact relatively lower-income buyers who relied on the cost cuts to buy electric vehicles, while the EVs in the luxury car market are likely to continue to see demand from higher-income buyers for whom the tax credit was less of a reason to purchase, Reichmuth said.

“It might change some decisions, but probably not a whole lot, you’re probably already interested in buying that EV for other reasons besides the tax credit,” Reichmuth said of luxury buyers.

States and companies are likely to step in

So what to do? Is it all doom and gloom for electric vehicles? Likely not.

Electric vehicles are here to stay. They are a key part of the fight against climate change, and have high adoption rates elsewhere in the world, especially where the industry has received ample government support.

Even American companies that are pulling back production in the face of an uncertain regulatory environment are vowing to return.

In response to the expiration of the EV tax credit, GM cut output at a major electric vehicle assembly plant, temporarily laid off workers, and indefinitely delayed a shift at a Kansas City assembly plant that was set to produce electric Chevy Bolts later this year. Despite that, CEO Mary Barra has said, as recently as this month, that electric vehicles are still the company’s “north star.”

The cost has to come down to make EVs more attractive to consumers. In the absence of federal leadership on this issue, Reichmuth suggests that companies that are still dedicated to an electric future will take matters into their own hands, and that state regulators are likely to step in.

Car manufacturers that have built up electric vehicle capability, like GM or Hyundai, might start offering incentives like cash-back offers, special interest rates, discounts, lease deals, and more to bring down the cost of electric vehicles, similar to those already offered for various gasoline vehicles that are deemed slow sellers.

States and other local authorities are also likely to step in. There are already numerous regional incentives available for electric vehicles, and it’s looking more likely that this will increase in the coming years.

“[California] had a state EV rebate that went away, especially when the federal tax credit was there, and I think we may see some form of that come back as well,” Reichmuth said. “I think we’re going to see a lot more happening at the state level than at the federal level, at least in probably the next three years or so.”",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2358351943-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 09:00:09.180128

WASHINGTON — The EV tax credit dies today. But its story doesn’t necessarily end here.

The $7,500 federal incentive, which had two main iterations over an almost 17-year run, was designed to encourage the production and purchase of electric vehicles in the United States. It expires after the calendar flips past Tuesday thanks to legislation enacted this year by GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump.

“You were a good patriot, and you lived a tragically short life,” Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who leads an effort to make EVs less political, said of the program. “I’d say goodbye to you in Chinese if I could.”

The tax credit was popular and significant in more ways than one. It has been widely adopted to bring down price tags for new and used EVs, and it has been widely debated as a signature policy emblematic of the U.S. auto industry’s rocky road to electrification.

The program was a darling of affluent and eco-minded consumers, elected officials eager to steer the U.S. economy toward greener technologies and some China hawks like Murphy who are wary of the rival nation’s dominance in the global EV sector. It was also a target for Republicans eager to dismantle all aspects of what they called an “EV mandate” from former President Joe Biden.

The credit, according to economists and analysts, had its tradeoffs but was ultimately successful in achieving two main goals: Sparking growth in a nascent product category and helping domestic automakers to keep pace with their foreign rivals. Now the industry faces an EV transition—which most experts say is inevitable—without one of its key federal supports.

“I don’t think we’re going to have a collapse. I’m not that much of a pessimist,” Murphy said in a phone interview. “I’m not sure next year will be a growth year like all the past years have been. But if it’s negative, I think it’ll be low single digits (EV market share), which will then lead to more growth.”

The growth Murphy referred to was most significant between the start of the Biden administration in February 2021 and the beginning of 2024, when EV sales figures started to become less consistent. Market share has since hovered around 9% but spiked to an all-time high of 11.5% in August with the impending end of the program.

The federal government expanded tax credits for EVs via the Inflation Reduction Act during the middle of that Biden-era growth window, gaining heightened national attention in the process. But the program’s story began more than a decade before.

Credit 1.0: Sparking early growth

There were two main phases of the tax credit, according to Corey Cantor, research director for the Zero Emission Transportation Association. The first began in late 2008 and second began in 2023.

“In its early iteration and form, the credit helped jump-start the kind of EV transition here in the U.S., encouraging more and more consumers to consider electric vehicles,” Cantor said.

Lawmakers established the federal EV tax credit—also known as the 30D credit—at the end of the George W. Bush administration amid a deepening collapse of the American auto industry. The program offered a $7,500 credit for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles.

There was bipartisan support for legislation that led to the program, with the effort led in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois. The credit was folded into a larger clean energy tax incentive package that passed the chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support in October 2008.

That version of the credit, after a legislative tweak in 2009, had a 200,000-vehicle cap for eligibility. Automakers making forays into electrification like Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. could benefit from the incentive only while establishing a foothold with their electrified offerings.

The results—and resulting taxpayer costs—were not immediate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a September 2012 report that “no manufacturer is near the threshold at which the tax credits will begin to be phased out.” Then- President Obama at one point that year proposed raising the credit to $10,000.

EV momentum developed over time, though, and research points to the tax credit playing an important role. One study from 2016, which surveyed about 2,900 plug-in vehicle owners, attributed “more than 30% of the (EV) sales to the federal tax credit, with an impact of up to 49% for the Nissan LEAF.”

GM and Tesla were first to hit the ceiling in 2018, triggering a phase-out process that saw the number of tax credits they could offer falling by half every six months until they hit zero. GM found success with the Chevrolet Volt, and Tesla began building its dominance of the U.S. electric vehicle market with the Roadster and Model S.

Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. also eventually hit the credit limit, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

By the end of 2018, plug-in models accounted for 2% of U.S. new vehicle market share for the first time and brought renewed scrutiny to the credit originally designed to foster early growth. GM and Tesla called on Congress to lift the 200,000 cap, and many lawmakers agreed with their position.

Democrats in Congress introduced a bill to remove the cap. So did Republican then-U.S. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, where Tesla has a major presence. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, now the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, introduced legislation to terminate the credit.

“The electric vehicle tax credit largely benefits the wealthiest Americans and costs taxpayers billions of dollars,” Barrasso said at the time. “My legislation levels the playing field for all drivers across America.”

Credit 2.0: Pushing U.S. manufacturers

Supporters of the EV credit won out in the summer of 2022 when Biden and his allies in Congress lifted the cap and set the credit to expire in 2032, though there were new strings attached meant to promote U.S. manufacturing. The expanded incentive succeeded at doing just that, according to economists and analysts.

“The way the credits were constructed really did have an eye specifically towards not just enhancing EV adoption in the U.S. market, but specifically enhancing the adoption of EVs made in the United States,” economist Reigner Kane said in a phone interview. Kane was one of five co-authors on an October 2024 working paper examining the expanded tax credit.

Kane continued: “And that does seem to be something, according to our estimates, that the IRA did fairly well at. A lot of the benefits, in terms of additional EVs added to the market, were really coming from these domestic firms—so Tesla, GM, Ford, etc.—and relatively few from foreign firms.”

The Biden administration restructured the credit by splitting it into two parts worth $3,750 each: One for critical minerals sourcing and the other for battery component sourcing, with domestic content requirements getting stricter over time. The administration also required that final vehicle assembly take place in North America for a car or truck to be eligible and set an income cap for buyers—albeit with a big loophole.

Beyond the headline-grabbing 30D credit, the government created an additional $4,000 tax credit for used EVs and another for qualified commercial vehicles, both of which also disappear after Tuesday.

The tax credits boosted new EV registrations by 300,000 in 2023, according to the October study. The researchers estimated that domestic brands sold about 835,000 EVs that year, but would have sold only 525,000 without the credit. That represents a nearly 60% jump.

Foreign firms, by contrast, enjoyed a much smaller boost of about 7,000 units from the credits. They would have sold between 340,000 and 350,000 EVs regardless.

The study also estimated that the credit caused a roughly 3 percentage point increase (8.3% to 11.2%) in EV market share and a 10-point jump (59.9% to 70.5%) in the percentage of U.S.-sold EVs that were assembled domestically.

Those numbers indicate that the Biden administration’s expanded version of the EV credits did what the former president and his allies hoped, though critics like Barrasso and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have called out the multibillion-dollar price tag to achieve those results.

Republicans’ move to repeal the EV credits through their One Big Beautiful Bill Act will save the federal government about $189.7 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

“The hard-earned money of taxpaying Americans should not cover the cost for the luxuries of the nation’s elite,” Barrasso said in a February statement after again introducing legislation to end the credits. “Repealing these reckless tax credits from the Biden administration once and for all will stop Washington from giving handouts to our adversaries and high-income individuals.”

His statement was a reference to the fact that EVs are more popular with affluent consumers and that a critical loophole in the credits allowed buyers and automakers to get a $7,500 boost on leased vehicles without any of the income or domestic sourcing restrictions.

The impact of that loophole was significant. That policy design resulted in a 17-point jump (12.2% to 29.3%) in the share of new EVs that were leased rather than purchased, according to Kane and the other researchers.

Murphy, the Republican strategist, said the Biden administration was certainly aware of the loophole. But he guessed that officials decided not to patch it because leases—especially given many buyers’ hesitance to commit to a new and unfamiliar powertrain—have become a driver of EV adoption. They also have the power to create longer-term impacts on the market than outright purchases.

“I’m very curious to see how the leasing provision is going to affect the used vehicle market in the next few years,” said economist Max Maydanchik, one of the October study’s co-authors. He pointed out that the U.S. used vehicle market (about 37.4 million units last year) is significantly larger than the new vehicle market (about 16 million).

“The typical lease term is about three years, and a lot of those leased vehicles are going to enter the used vehicle market,” Maydanchik said. “Maybe used vehicles that are cheaper are going to be the entry point for a lot of people into EVs.”

For that reason, he said the full story of the EV tax credits is “not yet written.”

Roll credits: What comes next

Republicans’ sweeping election wins last November quickly created a difficult political environment for federal EV support, even as a short-lived bromance between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Trump provided some hope for the credits and other programs.

In the new environment, Murphy explained, automakers shifted priorities to issues that better aligned with GOP leaders: “They did do some lobbying for (EV supports). You know, they called up and said, ‘We think this is really important. And by the way, we want to save our subsidy for our specific plant.’ But did they really go to war? They did not.

“Their theory was: ‘We’re going to get the fuel economy standards lifted and we’re not going to have to pay Elon billions of dollars a year in carbon credits. We’d love to keep the credit because we’re losing money on EVs, we don’t want to piss off Trump on the other stuff.’ This was nothing like the kind of full-scale push they’re capable of putting on. And I think that was a choice.”

Automakers, especially without stringent Biden-era emissions targets, can now transition to electric vehicles at a more comfortable pace. Several have shown signs of doing just that by scrapping or delaying certain electrified product offerings while still committing to long-term EV manufacturing projects. Many of those projects will rely on the separate federal 45X tax credit—which survived the Trump transition—for production of EV batteries.

In the very short term, demand for electric vehicles has spiked to record levels in the dying days of the EV credits. However, analysts widely expect a lull without those financial incentives.

“Growth moving forward will be slower than many advocates hoped, though continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism. The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, wrote in a Sept. 23 blog post.

Cantor, the ZETA research director, pointed to Germany and the United Kingdom for reference points on what might happen in the U.S. market. Both countries ended their national EV credits in recent years, though the U.K. restarted a similar program in July.

“You basically see a correction in the quarter following, weaker demand than you otherwise would have seen. And then it takes a couple of quarters to get back on the growth track,” he said of those examples. Cantor also pointed to some places in the United States, like Colorado, that will help buoy EV sales with existing state-level credits.

Dealers around the country, in touch with their automakers and heeding industry predictions, said they are riding out the EV sales highs while preparing for a slowdown.

“We’re a little bit nervous because we’re not sure exactly how it’s going to work out,” said Walt Tutak, the dealer trade inventory manager at Matthews-Hargreaves Chevrolet in Royal Oak.

“We’re watching the inventories. We don’t want to go crazy trying to sell them now, because there’s still going to be a market for (EVs). But we’re sort of playing it by ear because we’re waiting to see whether GM is gonna slow down production on anything,” he added.

Tutak said his dealership usually sells about 90% traditional-gas powered vehicles and 10% plug-ins, but that split has looked more like 70/30 over the last two months. The dealer manager also noted that around 80% of the electric models driven off the lot recently have been leased.

Tutak predicted that “we’re going to probably see a decrease in sales, but it’s not going to be as big as some people think.” He added that “there’s a lot of two-year leases out there. And people really enjoy these EVs, so I think they’re going to stick with them.” His top-selling EV models have been the Chevy Blazer and Equinox.

Scott Gruwel, president and CEO of Courtesy Automotive Group, painted a similar picture in discussing dealerships for nine different car and truck brands near Phoenix and San Diego.

“We are seeing an uptick in leads, and we are doing a good job of selling this last week and a half—definitely more than normal. But people aren’t coming and blowing down the doors and waiting in lines to try to take advantage of this EV tax credit,” he said.

Gruwel noted that the Phoenix market typically does not have high lease penetration, but “astoundingly good” deals meant to offload EVs have caused leases to double above usual levels. “The idea is to not have too much inventory when this thing goes away,” he said.

“But we still anticipate having EVs to stock and to sell, and I support that. It might not be as much of a focus, but it’s still a part of the game plan,” Gruwel added. “It’s not like everything drops off a cliff.”

Jim Walen, who owns and operates Stellantis and Hyundai Motor Corp. dealerships in Seattle, said he had mixed feelings about the end of the EV credits.

Walen did not like that the credits largely went to “rich people” who could already afford more expensive electric vehicles. He was also frustrated that exclusive EV-makers like Tesla and Rivian Automotive Inc. were eligible for the credits while also collecting, in Tesla’s case, “billions and billions of dollars” from emissions credits sold to other automakers.

However, Walen also lamented that losing the $7,500 credit would slow industry progress toward making EVs accessible and “depress sales” at a time when the car business has already been “under assault by the Trump administration from Day One” via tariff policies.

“I’m the largest volume Hyundai dealer in the state of Washington, as well as the largest by retail volume for Stellantis,” he said. “My job is to deliver affordable transportation to the masses. And I will say that, overall, this is going to hurt us.”

First launched in October 2023, 24M ETOP is both an electrode- and chemistry-agnostic battery manufacturing platform that integrates electrodes directly into the battery pack, removing the limitations of traditional cell-and-module designs. By effectively eliminating cell manufacturing, 24M ETOP offers manufacturers a simpler, more cost-effective path to build compact, high-voltage batteries with maximum energy density and design flexibility.

“The pressure to compete on price, design and performance is mounting for American industries that are heavily reliant on imported batteries,” said Naoki Ota, 24M President and CEO. “The U.S. must advance battery innovation, not just scale production to close the gap with competitors overseas. Our 24M ETOP offers U.S. manufacturers the technology they need to leapfrog Asian counterparts with industry-leading energy density, first-of-its-kind design flexibility, and lower manufacturing costs.”

A Revolutionary Battery Pack and Manufacturing Process Designed for the U.S. Market

Current manufacturing processes build battery packs and modules from individual cells, which introduce a significant proportion of inactive, non-energy-carrying materials, like metals and plastics, within a cell’s casing. This outdated approach wastes space, reduces energy efficiency, increases costs, and limits design flexibility.

24M ETOP addresses these challenges and fundamentally transforms the battery manufacturing process by creating a sealed anode/cathode pair that is integrated directly into the battery pack, eliminating the need for individual cells, modules, and unnecessary materials. This innovation eliminates conventional cell structures entirely in high-voltage systems and allows manufacturers to achieve the highest energy density at the pack level for any chemistry because a higher percentage of the battery comprises electrodes and other active materials, which are the only energy-carrying components. In a traditional battery pack, electrodes comprise 30% to 60% of a battery’s volume, whereas with 24M ETOP, electrode content reaches up to 80% of a pack’s volume.

24M ETOP enables manufacturers to cost effectively compete against larger Asian manufacturers by operating simple, flexible and low-cost battery manufacturing lines in the U.S. Companies can integrate the 24M ETOP technology – which makes sealed electrodes, stacks them into the pack, wires them, and closes the pack, all from a single machine – directly into their battery pack assembly lines.

24M ETOP is especially well-suited for emerging markets like eVTOL -- projected to reach $1.75 billion by 2028 -- where compact, lightweight designs that deliver maximum power, extended range, and cost efficiency are essential. Key benefits 24M ETOP provides manufacturers include:

Unmatched Energy Density and Range: Unleashes up to 50% more electric vehicle range by packing more energy into a same-sized battery

Unprecedented Design Flexibility: Offers unprecedented design flexibility for manufacturing battery packs of virtually any size, configuration, chemistry or voltage. It can be sized to fit any application, from large-scale grid batteries to EVs to mobility applications including e-bikes two and three-wheelers, to consumer applications

Cost Efficient Offering: Allows manufactures to begin production and achieve GWh-level 24M ETOP production capabilities with relatively low capital expenditures and minimal, if any, facility investments

Significant Cost Savings and Tax Credit Advantages: Delivers substantial cost savings through a streamlined manufacturing process and eligibility for U.S. production tax credits under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)

For optimized results, 24M ETOP can be used in conjunction with 24M Impervio™ separator for added safety and 24M's Eternalyte™ electrolyte for fast charging down to minus 40° temperatures. Together with 24M ETOP and Impervio, manufacturers can deliver a cost-effective and safe 1,000-mile-per-charge battery pack, overcoming previous challenges with solid-state electrolytes.

“The bottom line: If government is looking for tangible proof of success and impact, these programs offer standout examples of how strategic investment is driving real and meaningful results.”

The report, released Sept. 23, identifies existing remote renewable energy initiatives at the federal level and in each province and territory that are “helping to restore the flow of clean power back to communities.” The projects include transmission lines and local renewable generation projects like hydropower, wind, or solar power developments.

“But it’s about more than just electricity: ‘Restoring the Flow’ also refers to the flow of benefits of energy development, and the flow of decision-making power, returning to the community,” Pembina says in the report.

The report’s authors—Arthur Bledsoe, Emily He, and Rosa Brown—found that remote clean energy development relies on strong collaboration between the federal government, provinces and territories, utilities, and Indigenous leadership.

Remote renewable energy projects are found across the country, though the report shows that British Columbia, Quebec, and the Yukon have made the most progress in supporting Indigenous-led clean energy development. However, renewable energy development remains uniquely challenging in Canada’s northern territories due to high costs, small tax bases, outdated technology, and other constraints—which demonstrates why federal support is so vital for projects in these areas.

But although the federal government provided funding for remote community energy development from 2018 until the current fiscal year, the report notes that many of the most effective programs are no longer accepting applications, and the federal government has not announced plans to reinvest.

“As Canadian jurisdictions advance their goals of growing the clean economy and pursuing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, supporting remote community energy must remain a central priority: restoring the flow of clean electricity and economic benefits to remote Indigenous communities,” the report states.

In the manufacturing, construction and electrical trades, there's a dearth of talent as skilled laborers age out of the workforce without being replaced by younger workers.

""Now you add this layer of complexity, this need for precision, that would not exist in a typical apartment building or office building. ... Do we have the workforce for that? Not in abundance, that's for sure.""

ABC's construction backlog data shows that 14% of the group's members are under contract to perform work on data centers, a level that's held steady since the question was first posed in June, and indicates there's a backlog of 8.5 months on projects.

Meanwhile, the construction unemployment rate sank to 3.2% in August, tied for a record low, from 3.4% a month earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, told CNBC the worker shortage is already impacting data center development. Carrillo said Hispanic-owned firms are the fastest growing in construction. A recent study from his group called for reforms that would cut permitting timelines, speed up payments to small contractors and create a lawful work pathway for trained people.

""These projects represent trillions in investment but require more than steel and concrete,"" Carrillo said in an email, citing a projected shortage in construction workers of 3.2 million by 2030.

""Retirements, restrictive immigration policies, and deportation threats are shrinking the labor pool, creating the risk that data centers become stranded assets, billion-dollar buildings that cannot go online,"" he said.

Mike Bellaman, CEO of ABC, told CNBC that speed of service is critical for data center builds because of the immediate demand.

That could present a big opportunity for younger workers or those new to the industry to enhance their skills and advance in rank, taking advantage of the need for people who are trained across a variety of areas.

""They can become quickly masters of the trade of installing that work,"" Bellaman said. ""They have a huge opportunity to get a lot of on-the-job training and practical training where they become masters, so we can get apprentices up to journeyman level and specific tasks.""

Many of the jobs can last from three years to a decade given the size of the projects, said Pat Lynch, executive managing director and global lead of CBRE's Global Data Center Solutions. Lynch compared the projects to the building of railroads or large oil and gas deployments.

""I do see longer-term economic stability from these projects in these regions,"" he said. ""Clearly in many of these locations, you're having to pull employment from a large regional area, not just from a single state or a couple of markets, at a time that these skilled workers are in short supply in major markets to begin with.""

ABC's Basu said that the tech giants are so well capitalized and committed to large-scale growth that they'll be willing to pay up to bring in workers from other geographic areas, and to train people on the necessary skills.

""These hyperscalers have so much money, and there's so much at stake in terms of global dominion and artificial intelligence, maybe they'll just throw so much money at it,"" he said. ""These problems go away.""

At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.
In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early?
But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.
So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected.","The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.

Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one fast.

The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.

""The past couple of weeks — even in the past several days — EV sales just exploded,"" says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. ""It's been bonkers.""

Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.

The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level ""only achieved once before in December of 2024."" At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.

Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.

The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.

But there's a flip side, of course.

""The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead,"" writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.

In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they won't be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.

Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.

J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.

But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.

The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.

So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.

Automakers will be waiting to see what ""natural demand"" for their electric offerings actually looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4799x2699+0+500/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F4d%2F625ee8f44b02bcbedd280ba64d13%2Fap25199767055970.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 08:59:36.102093

That means after Tuesday, people can no longer use a $7,500 federal tax credit to buy an EV.

Up until now, The Colorado Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) said there was more of a rush to buy EVs before the deadline, but sales are expected to decline. Despite that, CADA CEO Matthew Groves said Colorado is still expected to remain ahead of others when it comes to EV sales.

""We were at 25% where most of the states around us are at six or seven. So we've got a ways to fall,"" Groves said.

As for what comes next, Groves thinks dealerships and manufacturers could offer deals to make up the difference, but he said it won't happen right away. He advised watching for changes, starting in about a month.

Groves also said manufacturers are already showing signs of changing their strategy over the next several years.

""Manufacturers are changing their strategy and redirecting a little bit from pure battery electric towards a traditional hybrid vehicle,"" he said.

Outlook for electric vehicle sales after federal tax credit expires Tuesday

""Traditional hybrids were at 14% so they're doing very, very well organically,"" he added. ""And we think that probably some of the loss will transition back to hybrids. Because one, they're better for the environment. You're getting 40 plus miles a gallon, and two, they're significantly cheaper. You know, the amount of rare earth metals it takes to make a lithium ion battery is about nine times what it takes to make a traditional hybrid. So you can manufacture more of them and continue to keep them affordable for consumers.""

Tax credits, interest rates and tariffs all play a role in EV purchases and trends, and data continues to be collected.

Groves said he knows some people who own EVs already are worried about infrastructure for their cars but wanted to reassured them.

""Dealers in Colorado made investments several years ago to be able to help consumers operate and maintain those vehicles, and nothing's going to change there,"" Groves said.

Groves also shared some additional insight CADA just received from the IRS, which indicates if you are buying an EV, the deal has to be done by September 30.

""As long as the deal is contracted by by the deadline, you don't actually have to take possession by the deadline,"" Groves said.

Notably, Oklahoma had an unusually large presence, re-entering the market with 170MW across three projects.

While the growth reported in this and the organisation’s previous market reports is encouraging, the Q3 2025 US Energy Storage Monitor notes that, due to the impacts of the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ Act (OBBBA) and global trade uncertainty, deployment is expected to slow.

As noted in the report, “US utility-scale storage installations will drop 10% y-o-y in 2027 but reach 72GW/259 GWh cumulative installations through 2029.”

The leading markets for utility-scale storage are expected to remain California, Texas, and other states that have supportive storage policies and anticipated high load growth.

The US energy storage market is projected to remain resilient despite federal policy challenges, with total installations reaching 87.8GW/281.2GWh over the next five years.

Residential, community-scale and commercial and industrial storage

The national residential storage market expanded for the fifth straight quarter in Q2 2025.

California, Arizona, and Illinois were at the forefront of quarterly installation growth in the residential sector, primarily due to California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), decreasing solar export rates, and state incentives.

The report predicts that residential storage will increase by 96% in MWs and 41% in the number of installations by 2025.

According to the report, the community-scale and commercial and industrial (CCI) segment achieved its highest Q2 storage installations since 2023.

The deployment of commercial solar-plus-storage projects in California has spurred growth in this sector, driven by the implementation of Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0.

Wood Mackenzie says storage incentive programmes encourage storage growth in New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts.

The CCI storage market is anticipated to steadily increase as demand for more solar-plus-storage projects grows.

From the report, “High development costs and slow transition to programs with lower solar project support, such as NEM 3.0 in California, cap CCI storage deployment pace until 2027. By the end of the five-year outlook, storage is expected to rise.”

Five-year forecast

Wood Mackenzie states that federal policy headwinds could reduce the five-year buildout by 16.5GW.

The forecasted low case predicts a 19% reduction in installations from 2025 to 2029.

The low case assumes a significant foreign entity of concern (FEOC)-compliant supply shortage, persistent trade barriers between the US and China that restrict procurement, and limited issuance of permits for renewables and transmission on federal lands.

This scenario leads to a 19% cumulative decrease in the utility-scale outlook compared to the base case. Projects not secured by 2025 may be at risk if additional FEOC-compliant supply does not emerge in the near term.

Beyond the five-year horizon, there is further downside risk if gas supply chain bottlenecks are resolved and if additional permitting restrictions threaten solar and storage projects.

The residential low case forecast considers the uncertainty regarding further guidance on FEOC, which could restrict FEOC-compliant supply and affect third-party ownership investment tax credit (ITC) qualification.

In the CCI segment, the low case indicates slow deployment of SMART 3.0 and limited BESS adoption because of higher costs, leading to fewer installations over the five-year period.

In Q2 2025, the low case assumed the US reconciliation bill was passed as written in the House version. The House version established a 60-day start of construction period and a deadline of 2028 for in-service status to obtain the ITC.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-68.png,N,,2025-09-30 12:07:44.720882

Ford and GM are using dealer programs to extend the $7,500 federal EV tax credit beyond its September 30 expiration, allowing leases to continue with the subsidy included.

The programs involve automakers’ financing arms making down payments on EV inventory to secure the tax credit before transferring the vehicles to consumers via leases.

Industry analysts warn that EV sales and leases could fall sharply after the subsidy ends, making these programs a critical tool for sustaining demand in the short term.

Ford and General Motors are rolling out programs for their dealers that effectively extend the $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicle leases past the September 30 expiration, according to an exclusive Reuters report.

The programs use the automakers’ financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealer inventories, allowing the vehicles to qualify for the tax credit. Dealers can then offer leases to customers for several more months with the subsidy included.

Additionally, the initiatives are designed to mitigate the expected decline in EV sales and leases following the expiration of the subsidy, which has encouraged EV adoption for over 15 years. GM confirmed the program in a statement to Reuters on Monday, but Ford has not commented publicly on the program.

Industry executives and analysts had predicted a sharp slowdown in EV sales after the credit ended, especially following a recent surge in purchases from buyers rushing to meet the September 30 deadline.

Under the programs, the automakers’ financing arms effectively “purchase” vehicles in dealer stock through down payments, securing the $7,500 credit. Dealers then offer leases to customers as usual, with the tax credit factored into the monthly payments. Both companies developed the programs in consultation with officials from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The federal EV tax credit, enacted more than 15 years ago, applies to vehicles acquired by September 30, according to guidance from the IRS. Acquisition is demonstrated through a binding written contract and a payment on the vehicle by that date.

Schall said smart metering and systems that launch electric appliances such as heat pumps, batteries or wallboxes for charging electric vehicles when prices are lowest are needed to let customers truly benefit from the changes. “Those who don’t use flexible devices or don’t have a dynamic tariff won’t immediately take note of the switch,” he added.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-30 09:58:09.664708

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are

in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do — pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses — it is a lose-lose.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.lockhaven.com/images/2025/09/29160841/blackrock-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 12:08:09.789018

have introduced a bill authorizing $200 million annually to modernize and repair municipally owned natural gas distribution systems.","Top Democratic lawmakers and strategists are road-testing an energy slogan that has for years been mostly absent from the left’s vocabulary — “all of the above.”

But they’ll have to overcome environmental advocates and other Democrats hostile to that phrase and all it entails. They are pushing instead for a quick move away from all fossil fuels to address global warming.

Despite such hurdles, many Democrats see an opening to embrace all energy sources in the face of attacks from Hill Republicans and the Trump administration on wind and solar.

“We have an energy crisis, electricity prices for homeowners and businesses have gone up over 20 percent in New Jersey,” Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), said in an interview. “The only answer is all of the above.”

Party leaders have urged Democrats to pin rising energy costs on President Donald Trump and Republicans, citing the phaseout of Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives that were bolstering renewable energy projects around the country.

Republicans are betting on the administration’s work to expand drilling, mining and nuclear, and prevent coal plants from shutting down.

But for Democrats, reviving “all of the above” dovetails with their focus on abundance and affordability. Their pitch: They’ll lower costs, no matter the energy source.

“To meet American energy needs, we need an all-of-the-above energy approach. Wind, solar, geothermal, you name it,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) in a post on the social media site X. “Yet, Congressional Republicans voted to shut clean energy projects down, which is already skyrocketing energy bills for working families.”

And, Pallone adds, “We’re not looking to cut off fossil fuels, but we have to emphasize renewables. The problem is that Trump just wants everything to be fossil fuels.”

The center-left group Third Way has been pushing the slogan as well, arguing natural gas is part of the “pragmatic policies Americans want” as Democrats work toward decarbonization.

The shift from Democrats could also lay the groundwork for nascent permitting overhaul talks. Any deal would need to balance Republican goals of increased fossil fuel infrastructure with Democratic dreams of transmission build-out.

For their part, Republicans were all about “all of the above” following Trump’s election last year, and some still utter the magic words, like Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) at a recent hearing.

But the administration has broken with that framing, emphasizing that “energy dominance” can only be achieved with “baseload,” at-the-ready power sources like fossil fuels and nuclear, while throttling solar and wind projects via executive actions.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stunned some lawmakers at a June hearing when he said he has “never been for ‘all of the above.'”

And earlier this month, a Department of Energy official told lawmakers the administration was focused on the “best of the above,” putting an official stamp on its hostility to renewables. Republicans in Congress are already falling in line with a narrower definition.

“We have an energy deficit and it’s only going to grow further,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). “I’m not opposed to intermittent renewables, but baseloads have to have the highest priority.”

‘Rethink our energy policy’

The big question for Democrats, who spent Joe Biden’s presidency de-emphasizing fossil fuels in favor of renewables, is how many will be on board for such a revival, which carries with it the implicit endorsement of oil, gas and coal.

During last year’s vice presidential debate with JD Vance, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz unleashed the phrase in touting the Biden administration’s energy record, earning a clap back from the League of Conservation Voters.

“We don’t like that expression,” Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs, said at the time.

The concept first appeared in BP marketing materials in 2006 and gained traction under President Barack Obama, who promoted diversifying energy sources without eliminating oil, natural gas or coal.

Obama and many Democrats, however, increasingly moved away from coal as environmental groups adopted a “keep it in the ground” mantra to fossil fuels.

“I think there’s a lot of us that have been advocating [for all of the above], but we certainly don’t want to add more coal power plants to the grid,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.). “That’s not the way we should go.”

Trump’s DOE moved twice to extend the life of a coal plant in Michigan and has announced a suite of initiatives to bolster new coal generation.

And while Democrats mostly agree coal is a bridge too far, it’s unclear how many will back increased natural gas production. They used to call it a bridge fuel on the road to cleaner sources.

According to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute, utilities are currently looking to build twice as much natural gas capacity as they were 18 months earlier.

“I think there’s some different opinions within the caucus” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). “I don’t know that there is a single Democratic position on natural gas.”

Many Democrats argue that they’ve never really been that antagonistic against natural gas or oil. Under the Biden administration, oil and natural gas output reached record highs — surpassing 13.5 million barrels of crude per day and more than 103 billion cubic feet of gas.

Still, Biden moved to limit oil and gas leases — particularly offshore — and placed a pause on new liquefied natural gas export terminals.

“Natural gas is the next nuclear energy, to where people 15 years ago absolutely hated it and now everybody seems to be on board,” said Texas Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey. “It’s going to be a part of us being able to do things around AI, to be able to handle that load on the grid.”

Some Democrats are quietly exploring bipartisan solutions. Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) have introduced a bill authorizing $200 million annually to modernize and repair municipally owned natural gas distribution systems.

Progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said, “I am unenthusiastic about putting billions of dollars into new gas pipelines that will force us in that direction for decades.”

Still, Warren, the top Democrat on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, allowed, “But that doesn’t mean there aren’t places that we could stop and rethink our energy policy. We need to get costs down and the Trump administration’s approach is a disaster.”

Permitting talks

When asked if Democrats should embrace an “all of the above” strategy, Sara Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at LCV, said the party should be focused on promoting renewables.

“The question we should be asking is, ‘Why are President Trump and congressional Republicans pushing fossil fuels above all else, when clean energy is widely supported and the most affordable and fastest to deploy?'” Chieffo said.

Indeed, the four states where wind and solar produce the greatest share of electricity — Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico — are among the 20 cheapest states for electricity, according to federal data.

An upcoming litmus test for whether Democrats want to go down an “all of the above” approach could be bipartisan permitting overhaul.

For years, lawmakers have been looking for the right mix of concessions to secure a permitting deal for energy projects stuck in bureaucratic processes both sides claim to want.

Already, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) released a bipartisan permitting framework in September with Republicans for “all of the above sources.” That includes provisions for natural gas pipelines and transmission lines.

That framework of a “technology neutral” approach could show industry players that Democrats are a steady hand on energy policy, unlike what’s going on with the Trump administration currently, said strategist Frank Maisano at the law firm Bracewell.

“I think the Trump actions only create more reason and impetus for Democrats to want to jump in and help create a structure that can prevent this type of back and forth,” Maisano said.

But House Natural Resources Committee ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said, “I think that’s folly. If anything, this is a moment to reaffirm the clean energy path forward, it’s much more compelling than this high cost, high pollution chaos agenda.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/c6/1a/3791bc764080bb5c31634b712183/u-s-congress-61460.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:13.883585

Deep Geothermal Makes Dramatic Progress; Virtually Unlimited Potential

This week Quaise Energy, a leader in “deep geothermal” energy, announced successful completion of its Texas field trials of its microwave drilling system. Powered by a Gryotron, a device first used in fusion research to superheat plasma, the Gyrotron was paired with an oil drilling rig to bore through solid rock. This is the first step in reaching geothermal waters (or rock) far below the surface.

✁

Deep geothermal energy refers to hot water or rock below 400 meters from the surface, and usually far deeper, typically 4-12 miles [6-18 km] below the surface.

✁

The hardest part of DG (Deep Geothermal) is getting there. Drilling through even two miles of rock, let alone ten to twelve miles deep, is a daunting task. Conventional drilling gets geometrically more expensive as depth increases. Harder rock, higher pressures, and increasingly hotter rock at depth are insurmountable at this point for those rigs in use for the past 150 or so years. About 15 years ago, MIT engineers came up with a novel solution—microwave transmitters which were integrated in the Gyrotron. The Gyrotron was (and still is) used to super-heat plasma for fusion reactors. Essentially, it’s a powerful microwave transmitter enclosed in a tube. At MIT (Mass. Institute of Technology), Paul Waskov, a research engineer at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, had a lightbulb moment in 2008 about using the Gyrotron to replace conventional drilling.

✁

Quaise plans to pilot the plant near Bend, Oregon, and hopes to have it ready by 2028. Nabors, which is in a partnership with Quaise, sees it as a very timely play.

Quaise: Unlocking the true power of clean geothermal energy

Quaise Energy and Nevada Gold Mines Partner on Deep Geothermal Pilot Plant to Decarbonize Mining

The partnership highlights two key reasons why going deeper is a necessity for geothermal to achieve a significant share of the global energy mix by 2050. The first is location. Deep geothermal wells can be drilled in more places around the world, even next to existing power plants. The second is economics. Deep geothermal can compete with fossil fuels on cost while eliminating carbon emissions by producing as much as 10x more power per well than traditional geothermal.

“Deep geothermal can decarbonize critical industrial processes like mining because of its superior power density,” said Carlos Araque, President and CEO of Quaise Energy. “Our millimeter wave drilling technology is the key to unlocking high-grade geothermal heat, repositioning fossil-fired assets for a clean energy future.”

Once the wells are drilled and cased, geothermal plants provide cheap, clean, 24/7 heat or electricity.

A new report from advocacy group E2 finds the clean energy sector added nearly 100,000 jobs in 2024, outpacing job growth in the rest of the U.S. economy despite a slowdown from previous years.

The Iowa Utilities Commissionapproved a settlement that authorizes the largest utility-scale solar project in the state’s history.

California officials and industry insiders saythe state is sticking with its goal of developing 25 gigawatts of floating offshore wind energy by 2045 despite expiring federal tax credits and Trump administration hostility.

In the first six months of this year,the world built 64% more new solar energy capacity than it did in the first half of 2024.

In August,global electric vehicle sales increased 5% month-over-month and 15% year-over-year.

A landmark legal settlement will require a plastics facility in Pennsylvania to clean up the tiny plastic pellets — known as “nurdles” — that were found to be spewing out of its stormwater and wastewater pipes.

Texas has had a record-breaking year for solar development, in spite of federal policy shifts.

The High Seas Treaty has officially been ratified! For the first time, nations can establish marine protected areas in international waters - a critical step toward the global goal of safeguarding 30% of the ocean by 2030. HUGE!

Trump has vowed to make coal king again. How’s it going? www.eenews.net/...

Trump has made rescuing coal a top priority in his second term, something he promised and failed to do during his first term.

coal-fired power plants are expected to generate 9 percent more power for all of 2025 compared with last year, the first year-over-year increase in coal generation since 2021 But experts say the temporary upticks in coal production and demand aren’t proof of a bigger trend, and instead temporary fluctuations driven by the price of gas and weather.

coal is in a long-term structural decline that’s unlikely to ease even with Trump’s intervention That’s because the country’s existing coal fleet is aging — the average age hovering around 42 years — as maintenance and fuel costs rise, he said. There are no plans for new facilities on the horizon

“I don’t see anything that’s going to kind of stop this long-term trend, because it’s really driven by these fundamental economic factors,” said Pierpont. “These are older, less economic clunkers, essentially, and … it’s pretty clear that economics there are going to be a limiting factor.”

About Walker & Dunlop Walker & Dunlop (NYSE: WD) is one of the largest commercial real estate finance and advisory services firms in the United States and internationally.","Walker & Dunlop, Inc. announced today that the firm has successfully closed over $820 million in sales and financings across Central Texas between January and August 2025. This underscores the region’s resurgence of demographic and economic growth.

Since the start of 2025, Walker & Dunlop Capital Markets has arranged over $320 million in conventional property and land sales and over $500 million in acquisition financing, refinancing, and equity capitalization transactions across conventional and affordable properties.

“This performance underscores Walker & Dunlop’s ability to connect buyers and sellers, place capital, and execute in a complex market,” said Matt Pohl, managing director of Capital Markets. “Our integrated platform has helped clients move quickly on opportunities as the market pivots from an interest rate focus to fundamentals-based underwriting. Capital is returning to core growth markets like Austin and San Antonio as investors meet an entry point defined by tightening supply, strong absorption, and forward rent growth. The development pipeline has dropped to lows not seen in this market in decades, and absorption stats continue to set records. Market sentiment has shifted, and we are poised to pair investors with investment opportunities supported by Central Texas’ job and population growth.”

As of mid-2025, Central Texas is showing clear signs of stabilization and a shift toward balance. Property sales and financing volume is climbing, even in a volatile interest rate environment, fueled by rising capital demand and renewed lender activity in the multifamily sector.

Patrick Short, senior director of Capital Markets added, “Lenders are leaning into Central Texas with renewed conviction, taking a more disciplined approach to underwriting and competing aggressively for high-quality deals in Austin and San Antonio—growth markets supported by significant outside investment and institutional sponsorship.”

While cost relief has been seen in certain sectors, developers are still not seeing the relief some had hoped for which has caused challenges for new development in Central Texas to persist. This has provided an opportunity to purchase new construction class-A product well below replacement cost. While underwriting remains a challenge in today’s environment, the accelerating demand for multifamily paired with the attractive basis opportunities in the market have pushed buyer underwriting in anticipation of the growth to come.

Key factors fueling this sector include:

Continued expansion from firms like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia is fueling demand for both talent and office space across Central Texas.

Mega-projects like Samsung’s $45B Taylor fabrication facility and the EV supply chain are driving long-term job growth and industrial absorption.

Billions in upgrades to highways, transit, and airports are unlocking new submarkets and enhancing regional connectivity.

Rising median household incomes, paired with lower unemployment rates.

Walker & Dunlop remains at the center of this activity, demonstrating the strength of its platform and its role in driving the growth of Central Texas commercial real estate asset class. From growth-stage developers to long-term institutional owners, clients continue to rely on our guidance and capital relationships to transact in today’s market.

Walker & Dunlop is a leader in multifamily property sales, having completed over $57 billion in property sales volume since 2021. The firm is also one of the top providers of capital to the U.S. multifamily market.

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, LA. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers.

This was underscored with a new $1 million investment from the state.

Founded in 2023, Wilmington-based clean hydrogen company Aternium aims to produce and supply energy needs across the mid-Atlantic. Its vision is ambitious, including building compact plants with essentially no direct emissions and minimal waste streams, supplying existing industries already using hydrogen and, ultimately, shifting Delaware from a state that imports virtually all of its energy into a regional exporter.

“Our focus here is to produce profitable and responsible clean hydrogen for the mid-Atlantic future,” Cottone told Technical.ly, a goal that would potentially bring lower energy costs and new jobs, while leaning into Delaware’s long legacy in chemical manufacturing and engineering.

Delaware’s $1 million investment in Aternium, granted on Sept. 25, comes from the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP), one of four programs awarded under the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) from the US Treasury Department.

It’s part of a $60.9 million SSBCI award aimed at providing access to capital for startup and early-stage businesses, administered by the Delaware Division of Small Business.

Delaware as a hydrogen hotbed

Nearly 97 million metric tons of hydrogen are used worldwide each year in industries like steelmaking, pharmaceuticals and refining. For Aternium, that means it doesn’t have to invent new markets; it can supply existing demand while preparing for hydrogen’s next chapter as a cleaner, more flexible power source for things like vehicles.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, Delaware currently consumes about 100 times more energy than it produces, importing nearly all of its energy.

“If we’re able to build the plants we want, we can convert Delaware into the hydrogen capital of the East Coast,” Cottone said.

Delaware may be small, but with its location at the heart of the mid-Atlantic corridor, it’s close enough to New York and Washington to access massive markets. Just as importantly, Delaware has a healthy pipeline of engineering and chemical manufacturing talent.

“Our workforce is strong. Chemistry, manufacturing and clean is in our DNA in this region,” Cottone said. “We have some of the highest levels of PhDs and engineers here,” as well as partnerships with Del Tech, Delaware State and Wilmington University to train new talent through certification programs.

A personal streak runs through it

Cottone founded Aternium after nearly two decades leading manufacturing as the founder, president and CEO of Adesis.

At first, he called the company First State Hydrogen. In early 2024, Cottone brought on Dora Cheatham, former executive director of the Delaware Sustainable Chemistry Alliance, as vice president of sales and commercialization.

They decided that the company needed a name that reflected both science and its regional goal beyond Delaware. Having shared a love of Roman history and Latin with his late father, Cottone combined “eternal” with the suffix “-ium” (from deuterium) to form Aternium.

That personal streak runs through the way he talks about the company today. Cottone insists on showing up in communities directly, introducing himself and asking for support.

“I’ll take any speaking engagement because I want to build in your community,” he said. “If you don’t like my idea, that’s okay. We can still go have a whiskey or a coffee together. We’ll be friends, and I’ll move on to the next community.”

Building trust in safety

With proposals like a 6-million-square-foot data center in Delaware City, residents are paying closer attention to potential safety and health risks when it comes to new energy facilities.

Unlike fossil fuel refineries, Aternium’s planned hydrogen plants are designed to be compact, low-impact facilities that blend into the landscape. Cottone said a single site would cover just four to five acres, with no stacks, no gas flares and nothing rising above the tree line.

“It’s essentially no waste,” he said. The process produces only hydrogen and oxygen, without direct emissions.

The company plans to partner with industrial technology firm Honeywell to wrap facilities in AI-driven predictive maintenance software, using ultrasonic sensors to detect microscopic leaks before they happen.

“We’re not going to store the hydrogen,” Cottone explained. “We make the hydrogen, we put it in the trucks, and we move it out. That’s a responsible way to do this.”

Aternium is also an anchor partner in Mach2, the mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub, a network of producers, users, distributors and stakeholders within the hydrogen ecosystem that was designated a Clean Energy Hub by the US Department of Energy in 2023.

A clean energy option for the future

Looking ahead, hydrogen could support the mid-Atlantic’s biggest infrastructure needs, including those data centers requiring round-the-clock energy. By using surplus solar or wind power to create hydrogen, Cottone said, that energy could be stored and later used to “firm” the grid during peak demand.

“There’s no such thing as energy transition. There’s only energy addition,” Cottone said. “This is about adding a reliable, clean source that can make Delaware stronger.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aterniummockup.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 09:58:13.321621

Regulators would review costs to Wisconsin energy providers and ratepayers if the facility or power from the facility is purchased by state utilities.
According to Clean Wisconsin, the Badger Hollow Wind Project is the first large-scale wind farm approved since 2011.
According to Invenergy, the Badger Hollow wind farm is expected to create up to 200 local construction jobs.
He also said that wind energy can be harnessed reliably in the winter, when daylight hours are shorter.","State utility regulators approved a pair of renewable energy projects last week, including Wisconsin’s first large-scale wind farm in more than a decade.

The Badger Hollow Wind Project in Iowa and Grant counties and the Whitewater Solar Project in Jefferson and Walworth counties received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, or PSC, on Thursday.

The Badger Hollow Wind Project is a 118-megawatt wind farm that will be able to generate enough electricity to power more than 30,000 homes, while the Whitewater Solar Project is a 180-megawatt solar farm that will be able to generate enough electricity to power more than 21,000 homes, according to the developers.

Because both were proposed by developers and not state electric utilities, they were not required to provide their project cost to the PSC. Regulators would review costs to Wisconsin energy providers and ratepayers if the facility or power from the facility is purchased by state utilities.

Clean energy and environmental groups framed the approvals as wins for the renewable energy sector.

“Renewable energy generally is facing a lot of threats nationally. Our federal government is taking a lot of creative paths to putting up hurdles for renewables,” said Chelsea Chandler, climate, energy and air program director for the nonprofit Clean Wisconsin. “It’s encouraging to see that projects are still getting permitted here in Wisconsin.”

The federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed this summer by President Donald Trump, phased out tax credits for wind and solar energy that were expanded in a Biden-era climate law. In August, the Trump administration ordered construction to stop on a nearly completed wind farm being built off the coast of Rhode Island, and it canceled $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects.

For the new projects in Wisconsin, Chandler said there are a few “limited routes” the federal government can interfere with, depending on whether permits are needed related to federal regulations around air traffic and sensitive species.

“Generally speaking, it’s a lot easier to permit an onshore wind project than offshore,” she said. “I’d say these projects moving forward through our process in Wisconsin indicates that they’re in good shape.”

Andrew Kell, policy director for the nonprofit RENEW Wisconsin, said the projects approved by the PSC will be on private property, with farmers choosing to lease their land for solar or wind.

“It’s really an issue of private property and something that allows farmers to continue their businesses here in the state of Wisconsin,” he said.

According to Clean Wisconsin, the Badger Hollow Wind Project is the first large-scale wind farm approved since 2011.

Chandler said there have been some smaller wind projects in recent years, but Badger Hollow is the first to be more than 100 megawatts.

“It’s been 14 years since we’ve seen a project of this size,” she said. “We expect that there will be more similar projects that will be proposed, and that’s really important.”

The wind farm is being developed by Chicago-based Invenergy, the developer behind the Badger Hollow Solar Project in Iowa County and the Paris Solar Energy Center in Kenosha County. Invenergy also has plans to build a pair of natural gas plants in Kenosha and Walworth counties.

According to Invenergy, the Badger Hollow wind farm is expected to create up to 200 local construction jobs.

In its application to the PSC, Invenergy said it hoped to begin construction in summer 2026 and complete the project by the end of 2027.

“We are grateful to the Commissioners for their consideration and approval, and to the hundreds of landowners, community leaders, and Wisconsinites who participated in the permitting process,” Brandon Davis, lead developer of Badger Hollow Wind, said in a statement. “Invenergy is proud to support Wisconsin’s domestic energy industry, bringing good-paying jobs and long-term investment to local communities across the state.”

Kell with RENEW Wisconsin said the Badger Hollow wind project would complement the similarly named solar farm nearby because wind tends to blow harder and more consistently at night, while solar panels are most effective during the day.

He also said that wind energy can be harnessed reliably in the winter, when daylight hours are shorter.

“Both seasonally and during the day and night, (these are) very complementary resources in terms of renewable energy development,” Kell said.

The Whitewater Solar project is being developed by Whitewater Solar LLC, an affiliate of New York-based DESRI. It’s a spinoff from the D.E. Shaw group, an investment and technology development firm. The developer estimates the project will create hundreds of local construction jobs.

In a statement, Aileen Kenney, principal of project management and development at DESRI, said the developer is pleased that the project received approval from utility regulators.

“(DESRI) looks forward to working with the communities in Jefferson and Walworth Counties further as the development is finalized and the project is constructed,” the statement reads.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/aerial_wis_farmland18_0638.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 08:00:57.071414

The state's goal is to reduce wildfire risk on 1 million acres of wildlands every year, including by thinning overgrown forests, which is expected to generate roughly 10 million tons of wood waste annually. Arbor hopes to take that waste, blast it through a “vegetarian rocket engine” to produce energy, then sequester all of the carbon the process would generate underground.

California has billed Arbor — and the handful of other similarly aimed projects it's financed — as a win-win-win: wildfire mitigation, clean energy and carbon sequestration all in one.

Yet, after Arbor initially won state financial backing for a pilot project in Placer County, the El Segundo-based company’s California ambitions fell through, like many biomass projects before it.

Instead, it’s heading to Louisiana.

California, biomass energy advocates say, has struggled to get past its distrust of the technology, given traditional biomass’ checkered past of clear-cutting forests and polluting poorer communities. Further, the state’s strict permitting requirements have given residents tremendous power to veto projects and created regulatory headaches.

But many environmental groups argue it's an example of California's environmental and health protections actually working. If not done carefully, bioenergy projects run the risk of emitting carbon — not sequestering it — and polluting communities already grappling with some of the state's dirtiest air.

“When you look at biomass facilities across California — and we've done Public Records Act requests to look at emissions, violations and exceedances ... the reality is that we're not in some kind of idealized pen-and-paper drawing of what the equipment does,” said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “In the real world, there are just too many problems with failures and faults in the equipment.”

There are simpler and safer uses for this wood waste, these critics say: fertilizer for agriculture, wood chips and mulch. It may not provide carbon-negative energy but comes with none of the risks of bioenergy projects, they say.

The Center for Biological Diversity and others advocate for a “hands-off” approach to California’s forests and urge management of the wildfire crisis through home hardening and evacuation planning alone. But fire and ecology experts say more than a century of fire suppression have made that unrealistic.

However, the sweeping forest-thinning projects these experts say are needed will cost billions, and so the state needs every source of funding it can get. “Our bottleneck right now is, how do we pay for treating a million acres a year?” said Deputy Chief John McCarthy of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, who oversees the agency's wood products and bioenergy program.

In theory, the class of next-generation biomass energy proposals popping up across California could help fund this work.

“California has an incredible opportunity,” said Arbor chief executive and co-founder Brad Hartwig. With the state’s leftover biomass from forest thinning, “we could make it basically the leader in carbon removal in the world.”

A lot of wood with nowhere to go

Biomass energy first took off in California in the 1980s after small pioneering plants at sawmills and food-processing facilities proved successful and the state’s utilities began offering favorable contracts for energy sources they deemed “renewable” — a category that included biomass.

In the late '80s and early '90s, the state had more than 60 operating biomass plants, providing up to 9% of the state’s residential power. Researchers estimate the industry supported about 60,000 acres of forest treatment to reduce wildfire risk per year at the time. But biomass energy’s heyday was short-lived.

In 1994, the California Public Utilities Commission shifted the state’s emphasis away from creating a renewable and diverse energy mix and toward simply buying the cheapest possible power.

Biomass — an inherently more expensive endeavor — struggled. Many plants took buyouts to shut down early. Despite California’s repeated attempts to revitalize the industry, the number of biomass plants continued to dwindle.

Today, only 23 biomass plants remain in operation, according to the industry advocate group California Biomass Energy Alliance. The state Energy Commission expects the number to continue declining because of aging infrastructure and a poor bioenergy market. California's forest and wildfire leadership are trying to change that.

In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom created a task force to address California’s growing wildfire crisis. After convening the state’s top wildfire and forest scientists, the task force quickly came to a daunting conclusion: The more than a century of fire suppression in California’s forests — especially in the Sierra Nevada — had dramatically increased their density, providing fires with ample fuel to explode into raging beasts.

To solve it, the state needed to rapidly remove that extra biomass on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres of wildlands every year through a combination of prescribed burns, rehabilitation of burned areas and mechanically thinning the forest.

McCarthy estimated treating a single acre of land could cost $2,000 to $3,000. At a million acres a year, that’s $2 billion to $3 billion annually.

“Where is that going to come from?” McCarthy said. “Grants — maybe $200 million … 10% of the whole thing. So, we need markets. We need some sort of way to pay for this stuff and in a nontraditional way.”

McCarthy believes bioenergy is one of those ways — essentially, by selling the least valuable, borderline unusable vegetation from the forest floor. You can’t build a house with pine cones, needles and twigs, but you can power a bioenergy plant.

However, while biomass energy has surged in Southern states such as Georgia, projects in California have struggled to get off the ground.

In 2022, a bid by Chevron, Microsoft and the oil-drilling technology company Schlumberger to revive a traditional biomass plant near Fresno and affix carbon capture to it fell through after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requested the project withdraw its permit application. Environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and residents in nearby Mendota opposed the project.

This year, a sweeping effort supported by rural Northern California counties to process more than 1 million tons of biomass a year into wood pellets and ship them to European bioenergy plants (with no carbon capture involved) in effect died after facing pushback from watch groups that feared the project, led by Golden State Natural Resources, would harm forests, and environmental justice groups that worried processing facilities at the Port of Stockton would worsen the air quality in one of the state’s most polluted communities.

Arbor believed its fate would be different.

Bioenergy from the ground up

Before founding Arbor, Hartwig served in the California Air National Guard for six years and on a Marin County search and rescue team. He now recalls a common refrain on the job: “There is no rescue in fire. It’s all search,” Hartwig said. “It’s looking for bodies — not even bodies, it’s teeth and bones.”

In 2022, he started Arbor, with the idea of taking a different approach to bioenergy than the biomass plants shuttering across California.

To understand Arbor's innovation, start with coal plants, which burn fossil fuels to heat up water and produce steam that turns a turbine to generate electricity. Traditional biomass plants work essentially the same but replace coal with vegetation as the fuel. Typically, the smoke from the vegetation burning is simply released into the air.

Arbor’s solution is more like a tree-powered rocket engine.

The company can utilize virtually any form of biomass, from wood to sticks to pine needles and brush. Arbor heats it to extreme temperatures and deprives it of enough oxygen to make the biomass fully combust. The organic waste separates into a flammable gas — made of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen — and a small amount of solid waste.

The machine then combusts the gas at extreme temperatures and pressures, which then accelerates a turbine at much higher rates than typical biomass plants. The resulting carbon dioxide exhaust is then sequestered underground.

Arbor portrays its solution as a flexible, carbon-negative and clean device: It can operate anywhere with a hookup for carbon sequestration. Multiple units can work together for extra power. All of the carbon in the trees and twigs the machine ingests ends up in the ground — not back in the air.

But biomass watchdogs warn previous attempts at technology like Arbor’s have fallen short.

This biomass process creates a dry, flaky ash mainly composed of minerals — essentially everything in the original biomass that wasn’t “bio” — that can include heavy metals that the dead plants sucked up from the air or soil. If agricultural or construction waste is used, it can include nasty chemicals from wood treatments and pesticides.

Arbor plans — at least initially — on using woody biomass directly from the forest, which typically contains less of these dangerous ash chemicals.

Turning wood waste into gas also generates a thick, black tar composed of volatile organic compounds — which are also common contaminants following wildfires. The company says its gasification process uses high enough temperatures to break down the troublesome tar, but researchers say tar is an inevitable byproduct of this process.

Watchdogs also caution that the math to determine whether bioenergy projects sequester or release carbon is complicated and finicky.

""Biomass is tricky, and there's a million exceptions to every rule that need to be accounted for,"" said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead with Frontier Climate, which vets carbon capture projects such as Arbor's and connects them with companies interested in buying carbon credits. ""There are examples where we have found a project that actually works on the carbon accounting math, but we didn't want to do it because it was touching Canadian boreal forest that's old-growth forest.""

Frontier Climate, along with the company Isometric, audits Arbor's technology and operations. However, critics note that because both companies ultimately support the sale of carbon credits, their assessments may be biased.

At worst, biomass projects can decimate forests and release their stored carbon into the atmosphere. Arbor hopes, instead, to be a best-case scenario: improving — or at least maintaining — forest health and stuffing carbon underground.

When it all goes South

Arbor had initially planned to build a proof of concept in Placer County. To do it, Arbor won $2 million through McCarthy’s Cal Fire program and $500,000 through a state Department of Conservation program in 2023.

But as California fell into a deficit in 2023, state funding dried up.

So Arbor turned to private investors. In September 2024, Arbor reached an agreement with Microsoft in which the technology company would buy carbon credits backed by Arbor’s sequestration. In July of this year, the company announced a $41-million deal (well over 15 times the funding it ever received from California) with Frontier Climate, whose carbon credit buyers include Google, the online payment company Stripe and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook.

To fulfill the credits, it would build its first commercial facility near Lake Charles, La., in part powering nearby data centers.

“We were very excited about Arbor,” McCarthy said. “They pretty much walked away from their grant and said they're not going to do this in California. … We were disappointed in that.”

But for Arbor, relying on the state was no longer feasible.

“We can't rely on California for the money to develop the technology and deploy the initial systems,” said Hartwig, standing in Arbor’s plant-covered El Segundo office. “For a lot of reasons, it makes sense to go test the machine, improve the technology in the market elsewhere before we actually get to do deployments in California, which is a much more difficult permitting and regulatory environment.”

It's not the first next-generation biomass company based in California to build elsewhere. San Francisco-based Charm Industrial, whose technology doesn't involve energy generation, began its sequestration efforts in the Midwest and plans to expand into Louisiana.

The American South has less stringent logging and environmental regulations, which has led biomass energy projects to flock to the area: In 2024, about 2.3% of the South’s energy came from woody biomass — up from 2% in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, that number on the West Coast was only 1.2%, continuing on its slow decline.

And, unlike in the West, companies aiming to create wood pellets to ship abroad have proliferated in the South. In 2024, the U.S. produced more than 10.7 million tons of biomass pellets; 82% of which was exported. That’s up from virtually zero in 2000. The vast majority of the biomass pellets produced last year — 84% — was from the South.

Watchdogs warn that this lack of guardrails has allowed the biomass industry to harm the South’s forests, pollute poor communities living near biomass facilities and fall short of its climate claims.

Over the last five years, Drax — a company that harvests and exports wood pellets and was working with Golden State Natural Resources — has had to pay Louisiana and Mississippi a combined $5 million for violating air pollution laws. Residents living next to biomass plants, like Drax’s, say the operations have worsened asthma and routinely leave a film of dust on their cars.

But operating a traditional biomass facility or shipping wood pellets to Europe wasn’t Arbor’s founding goal — albeit powering data centers in the American South wasn’t exactly either.

Hartwig, who grew up in the Golden State, hopes Arbor’s technology can someday return to California to help finance the solution for the wildfire crisis he spent so many years facing head-on.

“We've got an interest in Arkansas, in Texas, all the way up to Minnesota,” Hartwig said. “Eventually, we'd like to come back to California.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/f1c525e8d4381931e9a6483e51e543ea,N,,2025-09-30 06:58:19.960884

Following the successful results, CFS received $8 million from the DOE's Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program, the largest amount paid to any company in the program, which aims to accelerate innovation and the commercialization of fusion power.

DEVENS, Mass., Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), the largest and leading private fusion company, announced that the results of rigorous performance tests of its toroidal field (TF) magnet, a key component at the heart of the company's SPARC fusion power machine, have been successfully validated by an independent panel of reviewers under the U.S. Department of Energy's Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright visited CFS' headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts, where the company is manufacturing their proprietary high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and completing construction of SPARC. The visit followed the successful completion and validation of the TF milestone, and gave Secretary Wright the opportunity to observe the assembly of the SPARC fusion machine. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey also joined the delegation to witness CFS' progress towards commercializing fusion power.

""Fusion has the potential to be transformative for the world's energy security,"" said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. ""The Department of Energy is committed to ensuring American leadership in fusion power by accelerating innovation and collaboration across the government, our National Labs, and the private sector.""

""Fusion is the future of affordable, reliable energy — and it's being made right here in Massachusetts,"" said MassachusettsGovernor Maura Healey. ""Congratulations to Commonwealth Fusion Systems on this incredible milestone and thank you to Secretary Wright and the U.S. Department of Energy for recognizing the enormous potential of fusion power here in Massachusetts.""

""DOE's Milestone program is designed to promote progress in the development of commercial fusion energy through a rigorous review process of key technical milestones that will build confidence in this nascent industry,"" said Bob Mumgaard, CEO and Co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems. ""Fusion will ultimately help to define the future of global energy security, economic competitiveness, and human development for generations to come. American ingenuity has helped lay the groundwork, and ongoing DOE support will help to accelerate the full realization of this groundbreaking technology.""

DOE's Milestone program leverages public-private partnerships to catalyze the development of a new commercial fusion power industry. The milestones and completion criteria that are selected represent key achievements to de-risk the technologies, and to demonstrate real and tangible progress towards the advancement of commercial fusion. The milestones are assessed by an independent board of technical experts from national labs, and the DOE reimburses costs only upon satisfactory technical milestone achievement

The recent award to CFS provided confirmation that the company's first production high-field D-shaped TF magnets passed a battery of acceptance tests for inclusion in the SPARC machine. These magnets use proprietary design and manufacturing processes and are based on Nobel-prize winning High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). Over a month of rigorous performance tests were performed that mimic operational modes in SPARC; the results were reviewed and validated by a team of DOE magnet experts experienced in fusion, high energy accelerator, and material science magnets. As a result of this success, the DOE awarded CFS $8 million — the biggest amount given to any company to date in its Milestone program. The magnet technology was previously validated in a series of record-settingTFMC tests in 2021, and these tests showed that the full production magnets installed in CFS'SPARC demonstration fusion machine are meeting requirements. The magnets are now in regular serial production at the manufacturing facility. The same design is anticipated for theARC power plant.

CFS is eligible to receive$15 million from the first budget period of the DOE Milestone program, the most of the eight participating companies. The TF magnet award is the third milestone that CFS has achieved in the program. The Milestone program currently has $46 million appropriated for the first budget period.

The DOE fusion milestone program is modeled on a successful NASA effort, called theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, which used public-private partnerships to reduce the cost of space flight and catalyze a new commercial space industry. CFS, the Fusion Industry Association, the Special Competitive Studies Project Commission on Scaling Fusion Energy, and others are calling for an expanded, demonstration phase of the Milestone program to support the first commercial demonstration fusion pilot plants, like the ARC power plant. Support for this expanded program in order to accelerate fusion's deployment and compete with other competitor nations, was recently covered at aHouse Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing.

At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.
In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early?
But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.
So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected.","The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.

Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one fast.

The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.

""The past couple of weeks — even in the past several days — EV sales just exploded,"" says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. ""It's been bonkers.""

Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.

The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level ""only achieved once before in December of 2024."" At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.

Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.

The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.

But there's a flip side, of course.

""The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead,"" writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.

In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they won't be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.

Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.

J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.

But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.

The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.

So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.

Automakers will be waiting to see what ""natural demand"" for their electric offerings actually looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.

And car shoppers, for their part, will be waiting to see whether automakers can manage to cut prices and keep vehicles competitively priced despite increased pressure from tariffs — and without the largesse of the federal government.

About Ford Motor Company Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is a global company based in Dearborn, Michigan, committed to helping build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams.","DETROIT--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ford Pro is convening 300 leaders from across the Essential Economy – critical industries like manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, and energy, among others – for a national forum to accelerate productivity in these critical sectors.

The summit, Ford Pro Accelerate: The Essential Economy, held at Michigan Central Station in Detroit, comes at an urgent moment for America, which is grappling with a yawning productivity divide. From 2015 to 2023, productivity in the knowledge economy rose 28 percent, powered by innovation in software and cloud services. During that same period, productivity in much of the Essential Economy declined.

“This summit addresses a fundamental challenge to America’s prosperity: a growing productivity divide that holds back the very people who build, move, and fix our country,” said Jim Farley, Ford president and CEO. “At Ford, we believe honoring these essential workers means equipping them to win. This is a call to action for business, technology, and government to break down the barriers of bureaucracy and underinvestment. The work we begin today is about ensuring America’s Essential Economy is strong and fit for the future.”

The urgency of this mission was echoed by other national business leaders.

“I would put this in the category of critically important right now,” said Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorganChase. “America has one of the best and most prosperous economies the world has ever seen. But we’ve gotten bogged down by crippling bureaucracy that slows down growth, job creation, and innovation. Too often, it can take longer to get permits than to build something. We can grow our economy for the benefit of all Americans, and I believe meetings like this will help us do that.”

“We need to do a better job helping people understand how critical our industries are,” said John May, chairman and CEO of Deere & Company. “We need to demonstrate our purpose--to provide the food and critical infrastructure the world needs with equipment that allows our customers to do it in a more productive way and more profitably so they can continue to reinvest in their business and reinvest in their community.”

“More than a million skilled trade jobs are going unfilled today – a number that’s only projected to rise,” said Linda Hubbard, President and CEO, Carhartt, Inc. “Skilled trade jobs are too often overlooked as pathways to meaningful careers, yet these workers are the backbone of our economy. Elevating and investing in this workforce is critical to our physical infrastructure, industrial production and community development—everything that supports our society and helps it advance.”

In partnership with the Aspen Institute, Ford identified three evidence-based paths to address these productivity challenges:

Bolstering Human Capital: As the U.S. faces major workforce shortages—including 600,000 workers in manufacturing and 500,000 unfilled jobs in construction—federal spending on workforce services has dropped by two-thirds in inflation-adjusted terms since 1979.

Streamlining Regulatory Procedures: The average time for approval of a power-connection request has more than doubled since the early 2000s, and the U.S. now adds only one-eighth the annual miles of high-voltage transmission lines compared to 20 years ago.

Fostering Innovation Where It’s Needed Most: Federal spending on R&D is at its lowest point as a percentage of GDP since 1953, with innovation shifting away from industrial sectors. The manufacturing industry’s share of new patents fell from 78% in 1970 to 30% in 2010.

Recognizing that action must come from both the public and private sectors, Ford is leading through its Ford Essential Workforce Initiative. This includes programs like the UAW-Ford Joint Apprentice Program; nationwide auto tech recruiting and training partnerships; and Ford Pro services that make customers more productive, including a new collaboration with ServiceTitan.

Building on this commitment, Ford and Ford Philanthropy today announced new workforce development investments totaling over $5 million for 2025-2026, projected to benefit more than 100,000 students and educators through:

15 Ford Future Builders Labs in Michigan and Tennessee to bring hands-on learning to K-12 students.

A new partnership with SkillsUSA to expand advanced manufacturing and automotive programs for high school students.

The creation of the Ford Philanthropy Advanced Manufacturing & Trades Scholarship to cover training, tools, and expenses for students pursuing careers in the skilled trades.

The expansion of Ford’s Auto Tech Scholarship with TechForce Foundation, which has already provided $7 million in financial support to 1,400 students since 2023.

As part of these efforts, Ford is also exploring with Bloomberg Philanthropies how to expand its innovative model for career-focused high schools to the skilled trades.

Indonesia holds some of the world’s largest reserves of nickel, copper, cobalt, and other minerals crucial to clean energy systems. Nickel, in particular, is essential for battery technologies used in electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

Recognizing this strategic value, Indonesian leaders aim to move beyond exporting raw materials toward becoming a processing and manufacturing center. Their national strategy includes smelting, refining, and battery assembly.

But those goals face significant headwinds. The national grid still relies on coal for nearly 60 percent of electricity generation. Renewable energy investments remain limited by low tariffs, fossil fuel subsidies, and regulatory uncertainty. Indonesia also lacks a transparent wholesale electricity market and has limited domestic capacity in high-tech manufacturing.

Still, the government has pledged to generate 44 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. This target reflects both climate goals and efforts to draw international investment, particularly from countries looking to secure resilient supply chains.

China’s embedded influence in Indonesia’s minerals and energy sectors is already deep and expanding

China moved early and decisively. State-linked Chinese firms have invested billions in Indonesian smelters, industrial parks, and mining infrastructure. These projects span the entire supply chain, extraction, processing, and in some cases, manufacturing.

By 2023, Chinese companies had signed over $50 billion in energy and mineral deals with Indonesia. Many smelters operate within special economic zones and are powered by coal, raising concerns over emissions despite their alignment with clean energy inputs.

For Indonesia, the advantages are clear: capital inflows, infrastructure development, and job creation. But China’s influence also brings drawbacks. Transparency and environmental safeguards remain limited. Critics say some investments have led to deforestation, land conflicts, and excessive reliance on one geopolitical partner.

Moreover, Chinese dominance makes it difficult for Indonesia to meet sourcing requirements for Western markets. Many US and EU policies mandate that clean energy inputs originate outside of China, which complicates Indonesia’s plans to enter those supply chains.

The US strategy is high in ambition but low in delivery

The US-backed Just Energy Transition Partnership was launched in 2022 with a $20 billion funding package to help Indonesia retire coal plants and scale renewables. But to date, only a small portion of that funding has been disbursed. The US has since pulled back from some components of the agreement, weakening its influence.

Other initiatives have emerged. The US has pushed for Indonesia’s participation in the Minerals Security Partnership, designed to build secure, China-free supply chains. Indonesia has also proposed a joint venture between its sovereign wealth fund and American partners focused on critical minerals.

These moves show strategic intent, but implementation has lagged. Complex environmental, legal, and financial requirements have slowed projects. And while Washington emphasizes clean governance and environmental standards, it has yet to offer Indonesia the same speed or scale of support China already provides.

Indonesia’s nonalignment strategy offers leverage but demands careful balance

Jakarta continues to pursue what it calls “active and independent” foreign policy. Rather than choosing sides, Indonesia seeks to extract value from both China and the United States. Domestic processing mandates now require foreign companies to refine minerals in-country rather than export raw ore.

This policy has attracted investment but also sparked legal challenges and raised environmental questions. Enforcement varies, and safeguards are still evolving. Balancing domestic interests with international expectations remains a tightrope walk.

Indonesia also uses its leverage to bargain for better terms, pushing for technology transfer, infrastructure development, and job creation. But with growing dependence on external capital, the country faces long-term risks if one partner becomes too dominant.

The stakes are global. If Indonesia succeeds, it could become a model for other mineral-rich nations. It would show that countries can shift from raw material exporters to clean energy producers while protecting national interests.

If it fails due to environmental damage, political missteps, or overdependence on one power, the consequences would extend beyond Indonesia. It could discourage investment, reinforce extractive models, and delay progress toward net-zero goals.

“This year, we celebrate 70 years of Volvo Cars presence in the United States.
Yet, the shift to electrification demands new skills in battery systems and software, areas where South Carolina lags behind tech hubs like California.
“Volvo Cars' decision to further invest in Ridgeville reinforces South Carolina's position as a national leader in automotive manufacturing,” said Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina.
“The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the US,” said Luis Rezende, Volvo Cars’ president of Americas.","Volvo Cars is funnelling additional capital into its Ridgeville, South Carolina plant, building on a $1.3 billion investment over the past decade. The goal is to fully utilise the facility’s 150,000-vehicle annual capacity, a move that promises sharper cost efficiencies in a sector battered by supply chain volatility. Operational since 2015, the plant currently produces the electric EX90 SUV and Polestar 3 but runs below potential.

By introducing XC60 mid-size SUV production from late 2026, Volvo capitalises on a model that sold over 27,000 units in the US in the first eight months of 2025, up nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. This shift may also counter rising tariffs on Chinese imports, which have disrupted global automotive trade since 2024.

Before 2030, a US-specific hybrid model, likely a next-generation XC90, will join the line-up, blending petrol and electric power to appeal to buyers hesitant about full EVs. This reflects Volvo’s regionalisation strategy, tailoring products and production to local markets to mitigate risks from geopolitical tensions and supply bottlenecks.

“Our investment plans once again reinforce our long-term commitment to the US market and our manufacturing operations in South Carolina,” said Håkan Samuelsson, chief executive. “This year, we celebrate 70 years of Volvo Cars presence in the United States. We have sold over 5 million cars there and plan to sell many more in years to come.”

South Carolina’s automotive edge

Volvo rebalances production geography due to US tariffs

Like many European OEMs, Volvo is facing additional costs to import vehicles into the US. This challenge is seeing production strategies being quickly revised and manufacturing of some models relocated.

South Carolina’s status as a US automotive powerhouse, leading in vehicle exports, is bolstered by Volvo’s plans. The state’s skilled workforce and port access have drawn over $2 billion in auto-related investments since 2020, with Volvo’s expansion poised to add jobs and supplier activity, though exact figures remain undisclosed.

Nearby, Magna’s $200 million investment created 200 roles, hinting at the ripple effects Volvo’s move could trigger. Yet, the shift to electrification demands new skills in battery systems and software, areas where South Carolina lags behind tech hubs like California.

“Volvo Cars' decision to further invest in Ridgeville reinforces South Carolina's position as a national leader in automotive manufacturing,” said Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina. “It highlights the strength of our workforce and the confidence the world's top companies have in our state. We're proud to continue our partnership with Volvo Cars and look forward to the company's ongoing success in South Carolina.”

The plant’s ability to handle multiple platforms and technologies offers agility in a turbulent market. Still, South Carolina’s reliance on foreign manufacturers like Volvo and BMW, whose exports exceed $10 billion annually, raises questions about economic sovereignty if trade policies harden.

Volvo navigating a tricky EV landscape

Volvo’s US strategy aligns with its global network, including plants in Europe and China, to deliver region-specific products while pursuing net-zero emissions by 2040. Yet, recent financial turbulence, including a $1 billion loss in Q2 2025, has forced a recalibration.

Volvo now targets 50 to 60 per cent electrified sales by year-end, down from earlier ambitions, as EV demand wanes amid sparse charging networks and reduced subsidies. Hybrids, outpacing pure EVs in US sales, make Ridgeville’s planned hybrid a pragmatic bet.

“The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the US,” said Luis Rezende, Volvo Cars’ president of Americas. “By adding another model into production here, we’ll take a big step toward realising the full potential of our local manufacturing investments and workforce, and accelerate progress toward our ambitious commercial targets in the coming years.”

The challenges and opportunities of production investment

Volvo’s 2024 performance, with a core operating profit of $2.87 billion, and revenue of $42.5 billion, supports its investment push. Global sales of 763,389 vehicles provide a solid foundation, but rising material costs and a softening premium market pose risks.

Localising production in Ridgeville may ease reliance on China’s EV supply chain, a strategy mirrored by rivals like BMW. Success will depend on hybrids bridging the gap to full electrification, as consumer caution and infrastructure gaps slow the transition. Volvo’s regional focus could prove a deft move in a fragmented global market.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/675404.jpg?imageId=675404&x=0&y=34.85&cropw=100&croph=65.15&panox=0&panoy=34.85&panow=100&panoh=65.15&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:31.617712

Based on the current plan, the companies rely too heavily on natural gas and not enough on solar and wind energy. She said the utility would need to transition new and existing natural gas generators to hydrogen fuel or implement carbon capture to meet North Carolina’s 2050 carbon neutrality deadline.

Neither technology is currently commercially viable in North Carolina, and existing research does not show that natural gas pipelines can transport hydrogen without major modifications.

“We have proven, available technologies, and we’re not seeing Duke bring them on the grid at the pace and scale that we need,” Curry said.

It's North Carolina and South Carolina companies placed third, behind Georgia Power and Tennessee Valley Authority, with plans to add 3,620 megawatts of natural gas generation during the next seven years.

Curry said the poor grade also reflects risks for ratepayers. Fuel prices caused two-thirds of electric bill increases for Duke Energy Carolinas ratepayers over the last seven years, according to a 2024 report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

“The customers bear those fuel costs, not the utility,” Curry said. “Whereas if you’re bringing solar and battery storage online, there’s no associated fuel costs with those.”

Duke also lost points for not retiring its coal plants by 2030. Last year, state regulators ordered Duke to retire its remaining coal-powered plants by 2036.

The hall’s current Science on a Sphere exhibit will return. Also, access through the hall to the museum’s upstairs labs will remain. The museum’s prenatal exhibit will reopen in a different area of the hall. The remainder of the space will be renovated, including construction of new walls, additions of murals, and installation of new lighting to lower energy costs. Key activations in the hall focusing on renewable energy, sustainable living and conservation were developed in partnership with Portland General Electric, a sponsor of the renovation.

A new permanent, interactive exhibition will illustrate the relationship between humans and the environment. “Climate of Change/Clima de Cambio” will feature narratives from the communities in Oregon most affected by climate change.

“We want to invite visitors to explore in hands-on participatory ways how climate change is affecting our region here in the Pacific Northwest, both in our ecosystems and in our communities,” said Ciera Iveson, OMSI’s creative director.

Key climate science concepts and climate solutions will be presented, she said.

The climate impact message carried through the project’s design. OMSI is working with Timberlab to create an entrance using reclaimed yellow cedar left over from construction sites. Inside, tan oak will be used. The team will use mainly reclaimed wood that otherwise would have become waste, Iveson said.

The project’s theme is reclaiming waste, sourcing local building materials, and minimizing use of anything that in the long run would be discarded, she added.

Hall features will include: an immersive multimedia experience developed by Tellart that highlights the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world; design showcasing the beauty of the Pacific Northwest through landscapes, textures, and ecosystems; and other interactive, hands-on elements and education modules.

“We’re putting in a story theater where we’re sharing some documentary films we’ve been shooting of local communities here in the Pacific Northwest and their solutions,” Iveson said. “That’s going to be a really beautiful part of this installation.”

Donors, trustees and sponsors in the past few years have provided support for the project, Iveson said.

The museum’s “Accelerated” campaign raised $6.75 million from 2020-2025 in support of OMSI District plans. Approximately $2 million was allocated for the Nancy Stueber Natural Sciences Hall. Officials also garnered approximately $2 million in federal grants (from the National Science Foundation and the Institute of Museum and Library Services), of which $1.5 million was rescinded, Iveson stated in an email. When the grants were terminated, OMSI reduced the project scope and allocated operational funds to its partners to ensure key exhibition elements of the exhibitions could be preserved, she added.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Museum.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:26.696229

Starting Wednesday, Americans who purchase a new or used electric vehicle, or EV, will no longer be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500.

But in Connecticut, those who purchase after the deadline can still enjoy statewide EV rebates of up to $4,000.

Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act defunded the federal EV tax credit program in July as a part of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back long-standing federal green initiatives. However, federal investments in charging infrastructure passed under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act remain intact, leaving local officials optimistic that EV use will continue to rise.

“Cars and trucks contribute more than 40% of our climate pollution and the majority of ozone-forming emissions in the state. Expanding EV adoption is key to addressing air quality challenges that have impacted Connecticut residents for decades,” James Fowler, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, wrote to the News.

Which EV incentives remain?

After the federal tax credit expires on Oct. 1, Connecticut residents will still be eligible for rebates through the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate — or CHEAPR — program.

Effective Oct. 1, any resident who purchases or leases an eligible battery EV from a licensed Connecticut dealership will receive $1,000 in rebates. The increase from the current $500 incentive was announced by the state last week and aims to help Connecticut residents buy EVs after federal tax credits expire, according to a DEEP press release.

The standard rebate for plug-in hybrids will remain at $500. Prequalified low- and moderate-income families can also obtain additional incentives for a total rebate of up to $4,000, according to DEEP.

Earlier in July, DEEP lowered standard incentives for both battery EVs and plug-in hybrids to conserve their budget in light of an “extreme jump” in EV rebate demand, officials said in a July 29 meeting explaining the CHEAPR cuts.

After Trump signed the tax-and-spending bill that cut federal tax credits on July 4, Connecticut consumers rushed to purchase EVs. The state’s average daily spending on CHEAPR incentives was 33 percent higher in the 30 days before July 29 than the 2025 year-to-date average, according to data shown at the meeting.

This far exceeded the target range of what the budget provided by the Connecticut General Assembly could support, DEEP official Paul Farrell said in the meeting.

While Barry Kresch, president of the EV Club of CT, expects EV sales to slow for a period of time after federal incentives expire, he is optimistic that sales will recover soon.

“I can’t tell you exactly when: it might be a year, it might be two years, but electric is the technology of the future, and all of the manufacturers know it,” Kresch said. “In fact, everybody knows it, except the president.”

As battery technology and charging infrastructure improves, EV prices will continue to drop, making EVs a more obvious choice for consumers in the near future, Kresch said.

Electric vehicles can offer a lower total cost of ownership, are far more efficient than comparable internal combustion engine vehicles and help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, DEEP spokesperson James Fowler wrote.

Connecticut has committed to bringing at least 125,000 EVs to the state by 2025. As of July 1, which predates the passage of Trump’s spending bill, there are only 67,656 registered EVs in the state, according to DEEP.

How convenient is an EV in New Haven?

Limited charging options are the largest barrier to expanding EV adoption among New Haven residents, Steve Winter ’11, executive director of New Haven’s Office of Climate and Sustainability, said.

Gaps in charging infrastructure are especially prohibitory in residential areas, where lack of access to a dedicated charging port at home or at an off-street location can dissuade residents who would otherwise purchase an EV, Winter said.

While the state’s “right-to-charge” law allows renters to install chargers in their residential space, renters may not choose to take up that cost if they’re not staying long-term, Winter added.

According to data from ChargeHub, there are 311 Level 2 and 3 charging ports in New Haven. But some charging stations in the city, such as the Tesla fast chargers at Long Wharf, may be restricted to a certain type of vehicle, Winter said.

While the New Haven Parking Authority offers EV chargers across 10 of its lots and garages in New Haven, these chargers might not be the most convenient if drivers aren’t planning to otherwise use those facilities, Winter said.

New charging stations

One of the city’s first priorities in EV adoption is to increase residential charging availability, Winter said.

Last November, Connecticut was awarded $14.6 million through the federal Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program to expand EV charging stations in seven communities, including New Haven.

New Haven’s portion of the grant will fund 24 new fast charging stations in two residential areas: 12 stations will be built next to the Wilbur Cross Athletic Complex in East Rock, and 12 will be installed on Chapel Street near Wooster Square, Winter said.

“Even if you’re not in one of those neighborhoods, they should be fairly easy to get to,” Winter said. “They’re both close to the highway and in the center of the city.”

As of early September, the state had already selected a vendor to provide support and implementation services for the grant and is working on drafting a contract, Winter said.

Those planning on driving their EV outside New Haven will also see nine more charging locations on major Connecticut highways, funded by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program — or NEVI.

Meriden and Hartford will each have 4 new fast charging ports on Interstate 91 between New Haven and the Massachusetts border.

On Friday, the Connecticut Department of Transportation announced that the Federal Highway Administration approved Connecticut’s plan to utilize the NEVI funds for the new charging stations, allowing the state access to $52.5 million to build out charging infrastructure.

In February, the Trump administration had frozen NEVI funds indefinitely. The Department of Transportation decided to unfreeze all NEVI funds in August after a federal judge ordered the money to be distributed to more than a dozen states in June.

New Haven hopes to lead by example by purchasing and deploying electric vehicles in the community, Winter said.

“We hope to show that they reduce the city’s operating costs in terms of fuel and maintenance, and they provide cleaner air,” Winter said.

Last year, the city purchased more than 30 electric Chevrolet Bolts but experienced a lag in charging infrastructure to accommodate deploying all of them, Winter said. The city has since installed a bank of charging stations, including on State Street, on Chapel Street and at Board of Education facilities.

Now, the city electric fleet includes the Chevrolet Bolts, a refuse truck, a Parks Department truck that supports the charging of equipment like leaf blowers for ranger crews and two police vehicles, among others.

As of July 1, there are 1,264 registered EVs in New Haven, according to DEEP data.",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/evcredits_kv_AlexHong_05-2-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 06:58:11.889843

Creativity and efficiency are becoming the new operating models for economic and community development, defining which regions will lead in the next chapter of the energy transition.

This was made clear earlier this month at the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) conference in Detroit, where RMI convened a panel of leaders to explore how US regions can capture advanced energy opportunities as federal support wanes but energy demand heats up. The discussion built on RMI’s recent insights, Scaling Clean Energy with Regional Financing Ecosystems, which highlights how capital providers with a stake in local economic development pursue aligned goals, but too often in silos.

Panelists included Scott Beckerman, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Sustainability at Comerica; Martha Campbell, Chief Program Officer at Michigan Saves; John Moon, President of LISC Green LLC; and Amanda Taylor, Vice President of Business Investment at Greater MSP Partnership.

The panel discussion elevated three lessons on this moment and what lies ahead for economic development leaders.

Lesson 1: Today’s strong pipelines require new strategies to overcome uncertainty

In recent years, unprecedented federal incentives have revealed a strong pipeline of clean energy projects across the United States. John Moon shared that LISC used an interest form for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to measure demand and identified nearly $1 billion in potential projects, with around $150 million ready to move this year. Even without GGRF grants, LISC plans to deploy $100 million in sustainable finance over the next three years– but reaching the lowest-income communities without concessional capital will be difficult and dependent on strong city and state incentives.

Michigan Saves faces a similar challenge. Over 15 years, the green bank has enabled more than $600 million in residential energy efficiency loans by leveraging loan-loss reserves to attract private capital. A GGRF subaward would have enabled an expansion into direct commercial lending. With those funds on hold, Michigan Saves is working to raise private capital and sharpen its value proposition to compete without subsidies.

Panelists cautioned that today’s strong project pipeline faces uncertainty from expiring solar and wind tax credits and impending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations. Developers and capital providers nationwide are scrambling to complete or safe harbor projects, but what comes next is less clear. Technologies whose credits have longer runway, such as geothermal and storage, could emerge stronger.

Lesson 2: Competitiveness will be shaped by demand

Policy-driven uncertainty isn’t the only factor shaping market outlook. Rising energy demand, grid needs, and long interconnection queues will be just as decisive. Globally, AI is accelerating the need for electricity and water for data centers. In the United States, meeting that demand is vital to maintaining resilient, competitive economies. If investment lags, businesses and households will face higher costs and reliability risks.

As Beckerman observed, banks don’t like uncertainty, yet it has defined 2025. Comerica initially entered clean energy financing because the deals were sound business opportunities, not pure sustainability plays. That still holds true. “We’ll be forced to deploy our creativity,” he said, emphasizing that while capital stacks may evolve, advanced and clean energy projects will continue — driven both by investors’ pressure on global companies to decarbonize and by the sheer growth in energy needs.

The Minneapolis–Saint Paul region offers an example of how local leaders can respond strategically to corporate demand. After hearing airline CEOs express interest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the region began building a value chain that connects feedstock, technology providers, and buyers. As Taylor advised, economic developers should listen closely to what Fortune 500 companies need, and work collaboratively across their region to align solutions with local strengths. That alignment of corporate demand with regional capabilities positions places to compete globally.

Lesson 3: Regions must balance short-term competitiveness with long-term resilience

Economic developers must act as the “strategic brains” of their regions, helping communities balance near-term competitiveness with long-term resilience. Campbell suggested a dual-track strategy: on the one hand, expansively pursuing growth opportunities by attracting foreign direct investment, scaling advanced and cleantech energy clusters, and aligning with global megatrends; at the same time, planning for long-term shifts by hedging against worst-case scenarios such as slowing population growth, and by rethinking infrastructure and city design for sustainable growth.

Panelists acknowledged the challenge of holding near-term needs together while advancing a long-term vision like decarbonization. Data centers illustrate this tension in real-time, as communities wrestle with how to weigh potential tax revenue against impacts on power and water systems. More constructive approaches to data center development are possible, including negotiating with companies to secure workforce training programs, infrastructure investment, or other commitments that build long-term resilience alongside competitiveness.

From uncertainty to regional leadership

The panel discussion in Detroit underscored that while federal uncertainty looms, the regions best positioned to thrive are those building robust financing ecosystems by designing public incentives to attract private dollars, aligning with corporate demand, building coalitions to de-risk projects, and sharpening strategies to deliver dollars more efficiently.

Clean and advanced energy projects will continue. The real question is which regions will rise to meet the moment, using creativity not only to attract investment but also to secure durable, inclusive benefits for their communities.

This is despite the cost-optimal pathway requiring a higher total fixed expenditure of $168 billion over 2024 to 2037.
Despite factoring in higher EV charging and data centre electricity demand than the RPDP, our cost-optimal pathway finds that more solar and batteries can reliably meet the demand.
Despite these demand additions, our cost-optimal pathway does not add about 2 GW of new gas capacity.
Cost-optimal pathway offers greater energy security and defence from gas market volatility The cost-optimal pathway can significantly reduce Thailand’s gas use, compared to the RPDP.","Rising electricity demand from data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging could place significant pressure on an energy system still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Expanding renewable energy can help accelerate the transition, attract clean investment, lower costs and emissions, and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.

Thailand’s draft revised power development plan (RPDP), released in 2024, is an important signal of the country’s ambition in energy transition. It seeks to reduce the country’s historical reliance on fossil fuels, especially natural gas, by aiming for 51% renewable energy generation by 2037. To achieve this, the plan targets to reduce 8 GW of net fossil fuel capacity and add 64 GW of renewables and energy storage. We estimate that implementing the plan will require a total fixed expenditure of $153 billion between 2024 and 2037.

The RPDP, formulated on the principles of energy security, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability, underscores the country’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050. While it is a big step in the right direction, Ember’s cost-optimal pathway finds that Thailand saves billions in electricity generation costs by aiming for an even cleaner power system.

Our model finds that raising the plan’s solar capacity targets by 89% and battery storage by 60% can help Thailand save $1.8 billion in power generation costs by 2037. This is despite the cost-optimal pathway requiring a higher total fixed expenditure of $168 billion over 2024 to 2037. But, given that it cuts gas imports equivalent to almost two times Thailand’s 2024 consumption, it saves nearly $16 billion in fuel costs. At the same time, the country’s ambitions of becoming a hub for EVs and data centres remain unaffected.

Ember’s proposed cost-optimal pathways also fit well with Thailand’s economic goals, as its export-oriented manufacturing strategy, rising demand from data centres and EV adoption require more clean energy. Global markets increasingly seek products with low carbon footprints. Aligning the power system with such trends is imperative to maintaining global competitiveness.

Despite factoring in higher EV charging and data centre electricity demand than the RPDP, our cost-optimal pathway finds that more solar and batteries can reliably meet the demand. Instead of adding more fossil fuel capacity and locking in capital with a stranded asset risk, diverting it to solar and batteries will better serve the country’s interests.

The pathway is achievable with the right policy changes that prioritise solar and battery storage, plan for flexible power systems, reduce fossil fuel imports and improve demand forecasting.

Adding 32 GW more solar and 6 GW / 15 GWh more battery storage capacity beyond RPDP targets can help reliably meet additional data centre and EV charging demand

We estimate 10 terawatt-hours (TWh) of additional electricity demand from the data centre boom and an extra 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of peak load from EV charging by 2037, compared to the RPDP projection. Despite these demand additions, our cost-optimal pathway does not add about 2 GW of new gas capacity. Instead, it recommends building an additional 32 GW of solar and 6 GW/ 15 GWh of battery storage by 2037, beyond the RPDP’s targets, to meet the higher demand reliably.

Cost-optimal pathway offers greater energy security and defence from gas market volatility

The cost-optimal pathway can significantly reduce Thailand’s gas use, compared to the RPDP. It cuts the power system’s gas use by 1,815 billion cubic feet by 2037, 11% lower than the RPDP trajectory or almost two times the consumption in 2024. This strengthens energy security and reduces exposure to gas price volatility. It also helps save nearly $16 billion over 2026-2037 in fuel costs compared to the RPDP.

Up to 6 GW/ 15 GWh of additional battery is required by 2037 to ensure a reserve margin of 15% throughout the timeframe

Our analysis uses reliability-adjusted reserve margin to optimize capacity expansion to ensure reliability in systems with high variable renewable energy penetration. Thailand’s peak load interval falls in the evening when there is no sunlight, making planning for reserve even more critical to ensure system reliability. The study shows that an additional 6 GW/ 15 GWh of battery can help the system meet the 15% reserve margin target throughout the planning horizon.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/09/thailand-solar-panels-forest-mountain-renewable-energy.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 09:58:18.039406

Clean energy jobs grew 2.8% in 2024, adding nearly 95,697 new jobs, outpacing the rest of the U.S.’s employment rate by three times.

On a per-capita basis, clean energy jobs account for a significant share of the workforce nationwide, with an average of more than 2,200 jobs per 100,000 workers.

The clean energy sector accounted for 8% of all new energy jobs added in 2024.

It also accounted for 42% of nationwide employment in the energy and motor vehicle sectors.

Approximately 60% of all clean energy occupations, totaling 2.2 million jobs, are in the construction and manufacturing sectors. These include jobs involved in manufacturing solar components and building solar power projects.

According to the report, the South led clean energy job growth in 2024 with 41,000 new jobs, followed by the West and Northeast with over 22,000, and the Midwest with 4,000.

California led the nation with more than 550,000 clean energy workers, followed by Texas (281,000), Florida (184,000), and New York (180,000). Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia generated at least 100,000 clean energy jobs.

Solar and Wind

The solar sector led as the largest employer in the renewable energy generation sector with 370,000 jobs in 2024.

Onshore wind followed with nearly 132,000 jobs, concentrated in utility operations, construction, and supply chain.

Energy Storage

Among jobs in batteries, smart grids, and electric vehicle (EV) charging, clean storage technologies led with more than 93,000 jobs, followed by the smart grids sector with over 27,000 jobs.

At the start of 2025, the U.S. had added over 168,000 workers in the storage and grid sector.

Battery storage dominated clean storage employment, with nearly 79,000 workers, followed by 9,800 workers in pumped hydro storage.

On the grid side, apart from smart grids, microgrids led the job generation, totaling 21,500 jobs.

Battery storage alone supported more than 41,000 construction and 14,000 manufacturing jobs.

Employment in storage and grid modernization grew by over 23% by the end of 2024. Battery storage jobs expanded by over 20%, while EV charging employment shot up nearly 38% in just four years.

The country’s west and south were the largest employers in the storage and grid modernization sector, adding 55,900 and 55,600 jobs, respectively.

California and Texas lead in both clean storage and grid modernization jobs, reflecting large-scale integration of renewables and EV infrastructure.

Clean Vehicle Sector

Despite strong long-term growth since 2020, all regions experienced modest declines in 2024, with the Midwest experiencing the most significant drop (-4.6%).

California led with more than 70,000 jobs, supported by manufacturing and adoption incentives. Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee also remained major hubs due to their existing auto industry supply chains.

Outlook

At the start of 2025, the clean energy sector was expected to remain the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. economy.

Jobs as wind turbine technicians and solar installers are projected to be among the fastest-growing occupations in the U.S., according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

However, it noted that recent policy changes surrounding the energy sector could put a strain on the continued growth of clean energy jobs in the U.S.

The report noted that, according to a separate research by E2, in the first half of 2025, companies canceled major clean energy-related factories and projects valued at more than $22 billion in the U.S. The policy changes also eliminated 16,500 previously announced jobs in the clean energy sector.

The same report by E2 also noted that the policy changes are placing U.S. workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global clean energy marketplace, which is on track to reach $2.2 trillion by 2025.

According to another report by E2, businesses in the U.S. have canceled or delayed over $14 billion in investments in clean energy and clean vehicle factories since January 2025, due to rising concerns surrounding the future of federal clean energy tax credits and policy.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NHPC-Invites-Bids-for-1.2-GW-Wind-Solar-Hybrid-Power-Projects.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 01:58:24.556933

Transform Byproducts into Power – XCF and Posh Energy intend to deploy Flex-Fuel Gensets at New Rise Reno, converting SAF and renewable diesel byproducts into zero-carbon electricity and unlocking new revenue streams.

Layered Credit Advantage – Hydrogen produced is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Tax Credits, while the clean power generated can reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno’s fuels, boosting the value of its 45Z and LCFS credits, or be sold into the local energy grid to meet rising demand for renewable energy.

Scalable Roadmap – The project is expected to begin with a 100-kW pilot and expand to modular 250-kW units, building toward multi-megawatt capacity.

HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / September 26, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), announces that it has signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Posh Robotics (“Posh” dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno, LLC (“New Rise Reno”) to explore deploying Posh Energy’s Flex-Fuel Gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh’s Flex-Fuel Gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh’s Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno’s SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region’s expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world’s largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno’s byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

XCF’s mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem.

“Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.”

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented:

Posh Energy’s Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power.

“Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.”

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

In a letter to shareholders included in its annual report, the company called 2024-’25 a “challenging year” characterized by geopolitical, economic and regulatory uncertainties.
In its 2024-’25 annual report, Verbio said the company is continuing to invest in the South Bend facility on a progressive basis.
Ethanol production reached 582,610 metric tons in 2024-’25, up from 521,407 metric tons in 2023-’24.
Verbio reported EUR 672.1 million in revenue from its ethanol and biomethane operations, up from EUR 656.5 million for 2023-’24.","Germany-based Verbio SE on Sept. 25 announced the company produced a record 1.2 million metric tons of biodiesel and ethanol during its recently concluded 2024-’25 fiscal year. Biomethane production reached 1,190 gigawatt hours (GWh).

The company primarily attributed the increase in ethanol and biomethane production volumes to operations at its biorefinery in Nevada, Iowa, where production has risen continuously since the beginning of the year.

The Nevada biorefinery is located at the site of the former DuPont cellulosic ethanol plant. Verbio acquired the facility in 2018 and in late 2021 began producing renewable natural gas (RNG) at the biorefinery using corn straw feedstock. The plant commenced commercial production of corn-based ethanol in mid-2024. At that time, Verbio reported the Nevada biorefinery had the capacity to produce 60 MMgy of corn ethanol, along with 2.3 MMbtu of RNG.

Verbio’s 2024-’25 fiscal year began July 1, 2024 and concluded June 30, 2025. In a letter to shareholders included in its annual report, the company called 2024-’25 a “challenging year” characterized by geopolitical, economic and regulatory uncertainties.

While the Nevada plant commenced ethanol production during the previous financial year, Verbio reported that technical problems forced the facility “to stop the ramp-up of ethanol production in order to adjust the processes again.” Operations at the facility, however, are “now back on track.” Verbio also confirmed “the investments in Nevada have been completed” and the company is now focused on optimizing the plant’s capacity and bringing its products to market.

The annual report also briefly discusses operations at Verbio’s biorefinery in South Bend, Indiana. Verbio acquired the South Bend ethanol plant in May 2023, announcing plants to integrate RNG production at the facility. The company in May 2024 broke ground on a conversion project at the facility to enable the biorefinery to produce at least 85 MMgy of corn ethanol and 2.8 billion cubic feet of RNG annually.

In its 2024-’25 annual report, Verbio said the company is continuing to invest in the South Bend facility on a progressive basis. “The process of converting the plant to a combined ethanol and biomethane production plant has begun, and will be implemented on a step-by-step basis,” Verbio said in its report. “In the medium term this will not only result in an increase in production capacity, but will also make it possible to achieve synergy effects and efficiency gains.”

Verbio produced 619,250 metric tons of biodiesel during the 2024-’25 financial year, down from 637,283 metric tons during the previous fiscal year. Biodiesel plant utilization was at 87.2%, down from 89.9%, and biodiesel revenues reached EUR 894.2 million, up from EUR 987.5 million.

Ethanol production reached 582,610 metric tons in 2024-’25, up from 521,407 metric tons in 2023-’24. Ethanol plant utilization was at 72.8%, up from 65.2%. Biomethane production reached 1.19 million megawatt hours (MWh), up from 1.1 MWh. Biomethane utilization reached 60.1%, up from 65.2%. Verbio reported EUR 672.1 million in revenue from its ethanol and biomethane operations, up from EUR 656.5 million for 2023-’24.

The company reported total revenues of EUR 1.58 million for the 2024-’25 fiscal year, down from EUR 1.66 million in 2023-’24. EBITDA was EUR 14.2 million, down from EUR 121.6 million. Verbio attributed the decrease to lower profit margins for ethanol and biomethane due to declining greenhouse gas (GHG) quota prices and to impairment write-downs on inventories.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Verbio_Aug24_62dab94c38.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 01:58:44.773377

It’s about government not as the nemesis of the American Dream, as Republicans would have it — but as its partner.
This is not simply about trade or diplomacy; it marks a new phase of U.S. economic warfare.
In Venezuela, U.S. sanctions contributed to tens of thousands of excess deaths in a single year.","Almost daily, we are regaled with stories about Americans who overcame hardship or adversity through grit and determination — and reaped the rewards of living in the United States. Nary a politician doesn't weave it into their persona and candidacy.

However, there's a flip side to the American Dream – one with profound cultural and political implications. Because if success in America comes from hard work, then if you haven't succeeded, it's likely that you haven't worked hard enough.

In other words, if you're poor or struggling, it's all on you, a result of your laziness or lack of initiative. We rarely discuss this aspect of the American Dream narrative, but it is deeply embedded in our approach to government and poverty. And it may be why Republicans have been ascendant and Democrats have struggled to capture the imagination of voters.

Think about the political consequences, all favorable to Republicans. Because if we are all wholly responsible for our success, then it's natural for voters to ask why they should give the fruits of their labor — their hard-earned money — to those who they say are sitting around and haven't worked for it. “If you are able to work in America, well then you should not be sitting at home playing video games and collecting a check,” said Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO), echoing the sentiments of GOP colleagues during the recent debate over President Trump's tax and spending bill.

According to this line of thinking, when government aids those less fortunate, it enables their moral failings by giving them something they haven't earned – which makes them dependent on government and drains their individual initiative. It explains why Republicans have long sought to impose work requirements on government programs.

It's also the key to understanding white working-class grievance — and why so many have migrated to the GOP. To them, they worked hard, they built America, but as they see it, instead of praising them and protecting their jobs, liberals have created social programs for the undeserving at their expense. It’s why Ronald Reagan’s “welfare queen” trope resonated – that their hard work put food on the table while the poor were using government benefits to buy T-bone steaks.

So it wasn't on them that their standard of living flatlined in recent decades; rather, they were getting squeezed so the government could give away what they earned with sweat and toil to those who hadn’t worked for it. They may be caricaturing liberal intentions and programs, and their perspective may be based on stereotypes about the disadvantaged, particularly minorities, but it's firmly rooted in their understanding of the American Dream.

From the New Deal to the Great Society and onward, Democrats have offered a different interpretation of the American Dream. Yes, they say, it's through individual initiative that Americans can attain success. However, they also argue that there are many reasons beyond individual effort that contribute to someone's failure to succeed — among them bigotry, family circumstances, social conditions, inequality, and historical injustices. Even people who work hard and hold down two jobs, Democrats note, are often unable to free themselves from the weight of these burdens.

As Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote, "" if a man is entered at the starting line in a race three hundred years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.""

The Democratic approach is to level the playing field, creating laws and programs that enable everyone to reach the starting line and prove their merit. Affirmative action was one remedy, but Republicans successfully framed it not as a moral solution to generations of injustice but as an unfair benefit that advantages minorities and women at the expense of white men.

It was in the 1960s that liberalism reached its heyday, when its message resonated most deeply with the American spirit. Through programs such as food stamps, job training, Head Start, low-interest student loans, and Medicaid, President Johnson sought to help what he described as the many Americans who ""live on the outskirts of hope – some because of their poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many because of both.” He made it the nation's moral mission to “replace their despair with opportunity.”

At the time, these programs were very popular – and aligned with the American Dream. But in the decades since, Democrats have been unable to defend them against Republican rhetoric that frames them as giveaways of hard-earned tax dollars to people who haven't worked for it, as violations of the American Dream. Democrats tried to respond by calling these programs ""investments,"" but that's a sterile economic term far from the moral heart of the American voter.

Suppose the Democrats want to regain the majority. In that case, they will need to show that theirs is the party of the American Dream, that anyone who works hard should have a shot at a better life. Most importantly, the government is a moral force that mitigates the disruptions of capitalism, addresses injustices, supports our pursuit of a better life, and provides everyone with a fair chance to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.

They need to show that the American social contract is all about lowering the ladder so everyone can climb it — and not, like the Republicans, pulling it up and leaving fellow Americans behind. It's not about giveaways; it's about opportunity. It’s not about each of us looking out only for ourselves; it’s about all of us looking out for each other. It’s about government not as the nemesis of the American Dream, as Republicans would have it — but as its partner.

It may be what’s behind Mamdani’s appeal: his relentless focus on affordability is essentially a message of making the American Dream more accessible through government action.

Perhaps it's not identity politics or wokeness that cost Democrats the 2024 election. It may simply be a matter of how we define the American Dream.

Leonard Steinhorn is a professor of communication and an affiliate professor of history at American University and the former CBS News Radio political analyst.

In effect, Washington is attempting to coerce a foreign court into reversing a domestic legal process. For a U.S. president to sanction another country’s judges for convicting his political ally is unprecedented—and a direct attack on sovereignty and the rule of law. As a scholar whose work explores the intersections of law, colonialism, and crisis throughout history, I can tell you this charts a dangerous path.

The U.S. has long relied on economic warfare as an instrument of coercion in Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have endured decades of sanctions, embargoes, and restrictions under the banner of promoting democracy. In practice, these measures have devastated civilian populations while failing to produce meaningful political change. The U.S. embargo on Cuba, now over 60 years old, has deprived generations of basic goods and medicines without bringing about the regime change Washington once promised.

But Trump’s Brazil tariffs point to something new. Tariffs, traditionally tools of trade policy, are now being openly weaponized as instruments of political punishment and coercion worldwide. This is not simply about trade or diplomacy; it marks a new phase of U.S. economic warfare.

Supporters of sanctions and tariffs argue that economic pressure is preferable to direct military intervention. However, this framing obscures the reality: sanctions do indeed kill. They disrupt access to food, medicine, and critical supplies, plunging populations into crisis. In Venezuela, U.S. sanctions contributed to tens of thousands of excess deaths in a single year. In Cuba, restrictions blocked humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating suffering at the height of a global health emergency.

By 2024, one-third of the world’s population lived under some form of sanctions regime, with the U.S. responsible for more than 80% of unilateral measures.

These sanctions are rooted in emergency powers, which entail an anti-democratic decision-making process. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) allows the president to declare a “national emergency” and impose sanctions without congressional approval. The IEEPA has been invoked nearly 70 times, with 39 ongoing declarations still in effect. Courts have recently found that tariffs imposed under IEEPA are unconstitutional, yet the Trump administration continues to rely on this tool to justify sweeping interventions.

The legality of economic warfare remains contested in international law as well. Legal scholars have noted that sanctions violate the UN Charter, the Organization of American States Charter, Word Trade Organization rules, and international human rights law. More importantly, they erode the very idea of international legality by replacing global norms with U.S. domestic law.

Economic warfare is often framed as targeted, aimed at individuals or specific sectors. In reality, its effects are broad.

Exclusion from the U.S. banking system deters global financial institutions from engaging with sanctioned nations, effectively forcing international compliance. The result is over-compliance: banks and corporations cut off even legitimate or humanitarian transactions out of fear of U.S. penalties. The chilling effect leaves hospitals without medical equipment, schools without supplies and families without remittances.

Brazil now risks being pulled into this machinery of economic warfare. Tariffs and sanctions in retaliation for a domestic judicial ruling signal a dangerous expansion of U.S. contemporary interventionism. This is a form of collective punishment meant not only to discipline Brazil, but to send a message across the hemisphere: Prosecute U.S.-aligned leaders, and you will pay the price.

U.S. interventionism in Latin America is neither new nor accidental. From the Monroe Doctrine to Cold War interventions, Washington has repeatedly subordinated regional sovereignty to its own interests. What is different today is the legal form. Where once the U.S. sent Marines or backed coups, it now uses sanctions, tariffs and financial coercion to achieve geopolitical control over the region.

For Brazil, the stakes are immense. Its judiciary has acted to hold a former president accountable for attacks on its democracy. To punish that decision is to undermine not just Brazil’s sovereignty but the principle of judicial independence everywhere. For Latin America, this episode is another reminder that U.S. interventionism never disappeared; it has been refashioned through the tools of economic warfare.

Sanctions kill, and yet they persist as key instruments of U.S. foreign policy and economic warfare. To challenge their legitimacy requires moving beyond the legal and political fiction that sanctions and tariffs are legitimate tools of foreign policy. They are weapons of economic coercion that harm the most vulnerable, erode international law, and perpetuate a system of global inequality.

For too long, the U.S. has claimed the right to decide the political futures of Latin America and the Caribbean. The latest tariffs and sanctions on Brazil make clear: unless confronted, this cycle of intervention will continue. But history offers another lesson: Latin America has resisted before, and it will resist again.

The clock is ticking to claim tax credits for clean-energy home improvements.

Green-energy tax credits for cars and homes are wilting fast. Here's how to claim these tax breaks before they're gone.

Time is not on the side of anyone seeking help from Uncle Sam with their electric-vehicle purchase or their home's clean-energy upgrades.

Tax breaks subsidizing these purchases are going away, after President Donald Trump's megabill this summer shortened the time to claim the Biden-era credits.

Car buyers have until the end of the day Tuesday to claim a credit worth up to $7,500 for a new EV, or a tax break on used EVs that would pay up to $4,000.

Homeowners have until the end of the year to claim tax credits connected to solar panels, certain heat pumps, windows and doors.

In some cases, these home-improvement credits may save someone thousands of dollars. That is, if they follow the Internal Revenue Service's rules for the dwindling time to claim the breaks.

These fast-expiring tax credits cut a person's tax bill dollar-for-dollar, said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations for the National Association of Tax Professionals. That's a powerful tax-cutting tool, he said.

Speed counts, yet a wrong move could be costly at tax time. If you make a mistake when you claim the credit, and the IRS ""wants to take it back, that's going to hit hard real fast,"" he added.

People may still be eligible for EV and clean-energy tax incentives through their own state income-tax rules. But that's going to differ across the country.

Here's what to know:

You don't have to drive off in an EV, but you need this

In the final hours of the EV tax breaks, one key issue is when the vehicle was ""acquired.""

To the IRS, ""a vehicle is 'acquired' as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made,"" the agency said. ""A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS added.

In other words, drivers need to ink a deal by Tuesday. To be clear, the ""acquisition"" is a first step but it doesn't immediately guarantee the credit. The vehicle still has to be ""placed in service."" So owners can claim the credit once they have the car, the IRS said. People should still press for delivery as soon as possible, O'Saben said. But there's more.

First, the credit only goes to eligible vehicles. Here's a place to check which cars qualify. Second, the credit is applied at the point of sale, and buyers have to confirm the dealer can apply the credit.

The buyer should be able to get an IRS ""time of sale"" report they can use at tax time, Ingrid Malmgren, Plug In America's senior policy director, previously told MarketWatch.

Finally, buyers need to understand that the income rules for the EV tax break are ironclad. The IRS can take away the whole credit if a buyer is even slightly over the income caps.

The new EV credit goes to individuals with modified adjusted gross income up to $150,000 and $300,000 for married couples. With used EVs, the cap is $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples.

The IRS gives some leeway. A household can apply the income they made in 2025 or 2024 if one amount is over the limit, but one amount is under it.

Even if car buyers can't claim the Biden-era EV-related credits, there is another break they could get: a new $10,000 deduction on car-loan interest for eligible buyers. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" allowed the deduction on cars with final assembly in the U.S. That could include eligible electric vehicles, said O'Saben.

Here's a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration link to determine a car's final assembly, using its vehicle identification number.

There's more time to get breaks on solar panels and home upgrades, but the clock is ticking

There are two different clean-energy tax credits expiring after Dec. 31.

One is a credit geared at big-ticket projects like solar panels, sun-powered water heaters and geothermal heat pumps. The other vanishing break applies to home upgrades that include windows, doors and sealants that can better insulate a home from high and low temperatures.

It's not enough to just pay for these projects and improvements before Dec. 31, said O'Saben. These projects have to be installed, up and running by then.

That means people who want to claim the break need to consider whether contractors can get the job done in that short span, he said.

Sharvil Sheth, Armanino's director of credits and incentives, has been fielding client questions on the residential clean-energy tax breaks and sometimes dialing back their expectations of getting them.

There may be factors beyond their control, like the availability of parts, he said. There's also the risk of moving too quickly, he said. That could backfire if the speed to claim a credit now means extra work - and extra money - to fix a hasty project later, Sheth noted. ""Don't rush into anything,"" he said.

If a newly built home isn't ready for use by the end of the year, that might sink eligibility - even if clean-energy features like solar panels are running, Sheth added.

It's critical to keep good records, Sheth and O'Saben said. That includes contracts and even the stickers on newly-installed windows and pumps. O'Saben said. Utility bills might help too, Sheth said.

The IRS is not going to expect people to submit contractor paperwork with a tax return when they claim the credit, O'Saben said. But the IRS will expect documentation if it questions a claimed credit once a tax return has been submitted, he said.

The examination would likely happen via mail, but in extreme cases, O'Saben said the IRS could dispatch an agent to check whether a taxpayer's solar panels are up and running. That's ""only in cases where they think it's something that doesn't seem right.""

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. – The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) called on Congress to immediately act on a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the federal government open, warning that a shutdown creates more challenges and uncertainty for small businesses. As noted by SBE Council President & CEO Karen Kerrigan about the impact of a shutdown and how business owners are still being challenged to find their footing following years of policy instability and inflationary pressures:

“Small business owners have grown weary of disruption and instability generated by government actions and policy. The failure of Congress to act on a key responsibility means added burdens for entrepreneurs and their employees in terms of stalled loans, halted contracts, delayed permits, and access to federal government agencies so they can resolve important labor or tax-related matters. Moreover, such carelessness drives uncertainty and further erodes confidence in Congress, which already ranks at the bottom in terms of how Americans view key U.S. institutions. Those opposed to the common-sense CR that passed the U.S. House are plainly posturing for political gain. They need to get serious about supporting a stable environment for Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs. Advancing the House-passed CR is a reasonable step to keep the federal government functioning while discussion continues. Entrepreneurs are calling on the saboteurs of stability in Congress to do what’s right by their small business constituents, drop their outlandish demands, and vote favorably on the reasonable plan to keep the doors of the federal government open.”

Trump has clamped down on renewable energy

Environmental groups said Trump was wasting federal tax dollars by handing them to owners of the oldest, most expensive and dirtiest source of electricity.

“Subsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century – and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.''

Solar, wind and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to bring new power to the grid, Kelly and other advocates said. ""It makes no sense to cut off your best, most affordable options while doubling down on the most expensive ones,” Kelly said.

EPA eases pollution rules

The EPA said Monday it will delay seven deadlines related to wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The industry has complained that regulations imposed under the Biden administration were costly and designed to speed the closure of coal plants.

Coal ash, the waste from burning coal, can leach into groundwater and spread toxins. The Biden administration said the rules were aimed at keeping arsenic and lead out of well water, lowering cancer rates and avoiding disastrous spills.

""Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,'' said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign.

The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to “protect America’s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.”

Coal production has dropped steeply

Burgum, who also chairs Trump's National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure ""abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.''

The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there’s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.

Carrboro, North Carolina, is a town with about 21,000 residents located just west of Chapel Hill. It is nowhere near any oceans but claims it has suffered millions of dollars in damages to its 47 miles of roads and town buildings because of more frequent and extreme weather events related to an overheated environment. CleanTechnica readers would not be terribly surprised if that were true. Carrboro is seeking to recover damages for those past harms as well as future ones.

Rather than take its lumps like every other community affected by rain, hail, drought, or wildfires, Carrboro is trying something different. Last December, it sued Duke Energy, alleging the utility has funded and promoted a decades-long deception campaign to diminish the connection between fossil fuels and climate change.

Recently, it amended its lawsuit to add a claim for at least $20 million in damages to its buildings, equipment, and vehicles suffered when Tropical Depression Chantal swept over the town in July of this year, leaving more havoc in its wake. “When you’re dealing with something like the existential threat of climate change, that requires us to make bold moves,” Carrboro’s mayor, Barbara Foushee, told The Guardian.

Decades Of Deception

The idea to bring a lawsuit followed a report by the Energy and Policy Institute last November, which found some of the utility companies that comprise today’s Duke Energy Corporation — including Duke Power, Carolina Power & Light, and Public Service Indiana — were warned about the climate crisis decades ago.

“Although Duke has understood the dangers of climate change for decades, the company actively participated in a far reaching, decades long campaign of deception reinforced the public’s reliance on coal and natural gas. That reliance by the public led to higher greenhouse gas emissions that became the condition precedent to heat waves, heavier rain, more powerful storms, and flooding,” according to Inside Climate News.

Last week, lawyers for Carrboro and Duke Energy spent more than six hours arguing their positions to state court judge Mark A. Davis, who is considering a motion to dismiss the matter filed by attorneys for Duke Energy. The question Davis has to answer is whether the case should proceed to a trial before a jury.

Matthew Quinn, an attorney representing Carrboro, claimed the case is similar to tobacco litigation. “Our theory is that Duke’s massive deception got everybody hooked on fossil fuels, like Philip Morris” and cigarettes, he told the court. At trial, he said the town would present climate attribution scientists — experts who study the link between extreme weather events and climate change — to prove causality to a jury.

Not surprisingly, Duke Energy argued the complaint is baseless and should be dismissed. “There are other emissions sources. There is no way to trace a statement by Duke to a pothole in Carrboro,” its attorney, Hunter Bruton, told the judge. “These are novel claims.”

A Deliberate Campaign Of Lies

The alleged deception began in earnest in the 1990s, Carrboro says in its complaint. That’s when several energy groups, funded in part by Duke Energy, knew fossil fuel emissions were warming the planet but launched a public relations campaign designed to mislead the public into believing that climate change was not real.

Duke was an influential member of the Global Climate Coalition, which falsely claimed in a 1994 edition of Climate Watch Bulletin that “new scientific evidence” showed fossil fuels might help maintain “an essential atmospheric balance” and that “cutbacks in fossil fuel use may actually enhance the greenhouse effect,” the complaint says.

It also alleged that Duke was an active participant in the Edison Electric Institute, a trade organization which knew as early as 1968 that fossil fuels were altering the planet’s atmosphere. In 1991, the Edison Electric Institute ran ads in magazines disputing climate change with messages like, “How much are you willing to pay to solve a problem that may not exist?” and, “If the earth is getting warmer, why is Kentucky getting colder?”

The Edison Electric Institute commissioned a study in 1984 that included two hypothetical news stories from the future — one in which fossil fuel emissions continued unabated and caused devastating impacts, and another in which emissions were reined in and a safer future was secured, the lawsuit says.

Despite these warnings, Duke continued to build out fossil fuel infrastructure, oppose legal limits to planet heating pollution, and support efforts to promote doubt about climate science, the complaint filed by Carrboro alleges.

Duke Energy & Climate Confusion

“They tried to sow confusion about climate change and the fact that there’s a threat that we face in the future,” Howard Crystal, legal director of the Energy Justice Program at the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Guardian. Crystal is an advisor to the town of Carrboro. “The deception continues to be a problem today, now in the form of ‘greenwashing’,” he said.

On social media, Duke has portrayed itself as a leader in bringing on “cleaner energy solutions” despite having one of the largest planned gas buildouts of any company in the US. “They’re still expanding fossil fuels and suppressing renewables — in flat defiance of scientists demanding that we do the exact opposite,” said Jim Warren, executive director of NC Warn. According to one study, Duke Energy in 2021 had the third-largest emissions footprint of any business in the United States.

In the day-long arguments to Judge Davis, attorneys for Duke pursued the useful kitchen sink defense — throw everything you can think of against the wall and hope some of it sticks. “The only way to get exacerbated climate change is to have exacerbated emissions,” they argued. “They have to prove the campaign caused someone to increase emissions.”

Creative Legal Theories

Carrboro’s legal team is breaking new ground in the climate litigation space. It is alleging that damage done to town property constitutes a public and private nuisance because the town no longer has the “use and enjoyment of its property.” The utility’s actions also amount to trespassing by Duke Energy because the floods, wind, heat waves, and storms from climate change “enter and damage” town property.

ICN reports that the lawyers for Duke Energy seemed exasperated by such claims. “We don’t control the weather or the rain or the heat, which they’re alleging is the trespass,” they said.

Matthew Quinn, the attorney representing the town, said Duke Energy must be held responsible for the consequence of their devious behavior, Quinn concluded. “Their position is there are no legal consequences and they can say anything about their business model and parties like Carrboro can’t pursue damages. There is legal redress,” Quinn argued. “Causation should not be misunderstood, and Carrboro’s extreme damages should not be minimized.”

The Proper Role Of Courts

Climate litigation is becoming fairly common these days, with several states and many cities having made legal claims similar to those by the town of Carrboro. The basic information about how the fossil fuel industry suppressed information about carbon emissions is well known.

The industry conspired, colluded, and schemed to hide the truth from the public and disparage climate scientists whenever possible. Almost everyone is now aware of the extent of the lying that has gone on for decades. But the question in a court of law is not whether industry executives are a bunch of despicable shitheels. That is no longer an issue. The question in this case and many others is whether the courts are the right place to have this debate.

Many judges are gun shy about these cases because they feel the questions presented are policy issues that should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government. During the hearing last week, Judge Davis asked pointedly whether the case was about monetary damages or actually a legal maneuver designed to get the court to do what the North Carolina legislature and governor should do.

Davis issued no ruling last week. Instead, he asked attorneys for both sides to submit legal memos that address the issue of “traceability,” that is whether the damages suffered by Carrboro can be linked to the deception campaign outlined by the town in its complaint.

That’s a smart move. He is fully aware that his decision will be appealed no matter what he decides. An appeals court will look to see whether the trial judge covered all the bases properly before rendering a decision.

It is one thing to say that Duke Energy has been run by a bunch of scumbags for decades. It is quite another to say their despicable actions were a proximate cause of Tropical Depression Chantal dumping Biblical amounts of rain on Carrboro earlier this year.

Lawmakers established the federal EV tax credit — also known as the 30D credit — at the end of the George W. Bush administration amid a deepening collapse of the American auto industry.
Kane was one of five co-authors on an October 2024 working paper examining the expanded tax credit.
For that reason, he said the full story of the EV tax credits is ""not yet written.""
But people aren't coming and blowing down the doors and waiting in lines to try to take advantage of this EV tax credit,"" he said.","Washington — The EV tax credit dies today. But its story doesn't necessarily end here.

The $7,500 federal incentive, which had two main iterations over an almost 17-year run, was designed to encourage the production and purchase of electric vehicles in the United States. It expires after the calendar flips past Tuesday thanks to legislation enacted this year by GOP lawmakers and President Donald Trump.

""You were a good patriot, and you lived a tragically short life,"" Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who leads an effort to make EVs less political, said of the program. ""I'd say goodbye to you in Chinese if I could.""

The tax credit was popular and significant in more ways than one. It has been widely adopted to bring down price tags for new and used EVs, and it has been widely debated as a signature policy emblematic of the U.S. auto industry's rocky road to electrification.

The program was a darling of affluent and eco-minded consumers, elected officials eager to steer the U.S. economy toward greener technologies and some China hawks like Murphy who are wary of the rival nation's dominance in the global EV sector. It was also a target for Republicans eager to dismantle all aspects of what they called an ""EV mandate"" from former President Joe Biden.

The credit, according to economists and analysts, had its tradeoffs but was ultimately successful in achieving two main goals: Sparking growth in a nascent product category and helping domestic automakers to keep pace with their foreign rivals. Now the industry faces an EV transition — which most experts say is inevitable — without one of its key federal supports.

""I don't think we're going to have a collapse. I'm not that much of a pessimist,"" Murphy said in a phone interview. ""I'm not sure next year will be a growth year like all the past years have been. But if it's negative, I think it'll be low single digits (EV market share), which will then lead to more growth.""

The growth Murphy referred to was most significant between the start of the Biden administration in February 2021 and the beginning of 2024, when EV sales figures started to become less consistent. Market share has since hovered around 9% but spiked to an all-time high of 11.5% in August with the impending end of the program.

The federal government expanded tax credits for EVs via the Inflation Reduction Act during the middle of that Biden-era growth window, gaining heightened national attention in the process. But the program's story began more than a decade before.

Credit 1.0: Sparking early growth

There were two main phases of the tax credit, according to Corey Cantor, research director for the Zero Emission Transportation Association. The first began in late 2008 and second began in 2023.

""In its early iteration and form, the credit helped jump-start the kind of EV transition here in the U.S., encouraging more and more consumers to consider electric vehicles,"" Cantor said.

Lawmakers established the federal EV tax credit — also known as the 30D credit — at the end of the George W. Bush administration amid a deepening collapse of the American auto industry. The program offered a $7,500 credit for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles.

There was bipartisan support for legislation that led to the program, with the effort led in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois. The credit was folded into a larger clean energy tax incentive package that passed the chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support in October 2008.

That version of the credit, after a legislative tweak in 2009, had a 200,000-vehicle cap for eligibility. Automakers making forays into electrification like Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. could benefit from the incentive only while establishing a foothold with their electrified offerings.

The results — and resulting taxpayer costs — were not immediate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a September 2012 report that ""no manufacturer is near the threshold at which the tax credits will begin to be phased out."" Then-President Obama at one point that year proposed raising the credit to $10,000.

EV momentum developed over time, though, and research points to the tax credit playing an important role. One study from 2016, which surveyed about 2,900 plug-in vehicle owners, attributed ""more than 30% of the (EV) sales to the federal tax credit, with an impact of up to 49% for the Nissan LEAF.""

GM and Tesla were first to hit the ceiling in 2018, triggering a phase-out process that saw the number of tax credits they could offer falling by half every six months until they hit zero. GM found success with the Chevrolet Volt, and Tesla began building its dominance of the U.S. electric vehicle market with the Roadster and Model S.

Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. also eventually hit the credit limit, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

By the end of 2018, plug-in models accounted for 2% of U.S. new vehicle market share for the first time and brought renewed scrutiny to the credit originally designed to foster early growth. GM and Tesla called on Congress to lift the 200,000 cap, and many lawmakers agreed with their position.

Democrats in Congress introduced a bill to remove the cap. So did Republican then-U.S. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, where Tesla has a major presence. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, now the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, introduced legislation to terminate the credit.

""The electric vehicle tax credit largely benefits the wealthiest Americans and costs taxpayers billions of dollars,” Barrasso said at the time. “My legislation levels the playing field for all drivers across America.""

Credit 2.0: Pushing U.S. manufacturers

Supporters of the EV credit won out in the summer of 2022 when Biden and his allies in Congress lifted the cap and set the credit to expire in 2032, though there were new strings attached meant to promote U.S. manufacturing. The expanded incentive succeeded at doing just that, according to economists and analysts.

""The way the credits were constructed really did have an eye specifically towards not just enhancing EV adoption in the U.S. market, but specifically enhancing the adoption of EVs made in the United States,"" economist Reigner Kane said in a phone interview. Kane was one of five co-authors on an October 2024 working paper examining the expanded tax credit.

Kane continued: ""And that does seem to be something, according to our estimates, that the IRA did fairly well at. A lot of the benefits, in terms of additional EVs added to the market, were really coming from these domestic firms — so Tesla, GM, Ford, etc. — and relatively few from foreign firms.""

The Biden administration restructured the credit by splitting it into two parts worth $3,750 each: One for critical minerals sourcing and the other for battery component sourcing, with domestic content requirements getting stricter over time. The administration also required that final vehicle assembly take place in North America for a car or truck to be eligible and set an income cap for buyers — albeit with a big loophole.

Beyond the headline-grabbing 30D credit, the government created an additional $4,000 tax credit for used EVs and another for qualified commercial vehicles, both of which also disappear after Tuesday.

The tax credits boosted new EV registrations by 300,000 in 2023, according to the October study. The researchers estimated that domestic brands sold about 835,000 EVs that year, but would have sold only 525,000 without the credit. That represents a nearly 60% jump.

Foreign firms, by contrast, enjoyed a much smaller boost of about 7,000 units from the credits. They would have sold between 340,000 and 350,000 EVs regardless.

The study also estimated that the credit caused a roughly 3 percentage point increase (8.3% to 11.2%) in EV market share and a 10-point jump (59.9% to 70.5%) in the percentage of U.S.-sold EVs that were assembled domestically.

Those numbers indicate that the Biden administration's expanded version of the EV credits did what the former president and his allies hoped, though critics like Barrasso and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have called out the multibillion-dollar price tag to achieve those results.

Republicans' move to repeal the EV credits through their One Big Beautiful Bill Act will save the federal government about $189.7 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

""The hard-earned money of taxpaying Americans should not cover the cost for the luxuries of the nation’s elite,"" Barrasso said in a February statement after again introducing legislation to end the credits. “Repealing these reckless tax credits from the Biden administration once and for all will stop Washington from giving handouts to our adversaries and high-income individuals.""

His statement was a reference to the fact that EVs are more popular with affluent consumers and that a critical loophole in the credits allowed buyers and automakers to get a $7,500 boost on leased vehicles without any of the income or domestic sourcing restrictions.

The impact of that loophole was significant. That policy design resulted in a 17-point jump (12.2% to 29.3%) in the share of new EVs that were leased rather than purchased, according to Kane and the other researchers.

Murphy, the Republican strategist, said the Biden administration was certainly aware of the loophole. But he guessed that officials decided not to patch it because leases — especially given many buyers' hesitance to commit to a new and unfamiliar powertrain — have become a driver of EV adoption. They also have the power to create longer-term impacts on the market than outright purchases.

""I'm very curious to see how the leasing provision is going to affect the used vehicle market in the next few years,"" said economist Max Maydanchik, one of the October study's co-authors. He pointed out that the U.S. used vehicle market (about 37.4 million units last year) is significantly larger than the new vehicle market (about 16 million).

""The typical lease term is about three years, and a lot of those leased vehicles are going to enter the used vehicle market,"" Maydanchik said. ""Maybe used vehicles that are cheaper are going to be the entry point for a lot of people into EVs.""

For that reason, he said the full story of the EV tax credits is ""not yet written.""

Roll credits: What comes next

Republicans' sweeping election wins last November quickly created a difficult political environment for federal EV support, even as a short-lived bromance between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Trump provided some hope for the credits and other programs.

In the new environment, Murphy explained, automakers shifted priorities to issues that better aligned with GOP leaders: ""They did do some lobbying for (EV supports). You know, they called up and said, 'We think this is really important. And by the way, we want to save our subsidy for our specific plant.' But did they really go to war? They did not.

""Their theory was: 'We're going to get the fuel economy standards lifted and we're not going to have to pay Elon billions of dollars a year in carbon credits. We'd love to keep the credit because we're losing money on EVs, we don't want to piss off Trump on the other stuff.' This was nothing like the kind of full-scale push they're capable of putting on. And I think that was a choice.""

Automakers, especially without stringent Biden-era emissions targets, can now transition to electric vehicles at a more comfortable pace. Several have shown signs of doing just that by scrapping or delaying certain electrified product offerings while still committing to long-term EV manufacturing projects. Many of those projects will rely on the separate federal 45X tax credit — which survived the Trump transition — for production of EV batteries.

In the very short term, demand for electric vehicles has spiked to record levels in the dying days of the EV credits. However, analysts widely expect a lull without those financial incentives.

""Growth moving forward will be slower than many advocates hoped, though continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism. The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, wrote in a Sept. 23 blog post.

Cantor, the ZETA research director, pointed to Germany and the United Kingdom for reference points on what might happen in the U.S. market. Both countries ended their national EV credits in recent years, though the U.K. restarted a similar program in July.

""You basically see a correction in the quarter following, weaker demand than you otherwise would have seen. And then it takes a couple of quarters to get back on the growth track,"" he said of those examples. Cantor also pointed to some places in the United States, like Colorado, that will help buoy EV sales with existing state-level credits.

Dealers around the country, in touch with their automakers and heeding industry predictions, said they are riding out the EV sales highs while preparing for a slowdown.

""We're a little bit nervous because we're not sure exactly how it's going to work out,"" said Walt Tutak, the dealer trade inventory manager at Matthews-Hargreaves Chevrolet in Royal Oak.

""We're watching the inventories. We don't want to go crazy trying to sell them now, because there's still going to be a market for (EVs). But we're sort of playing it by ear because we're waiting to see whether GM is gonna slow down production on anything,"" he added.

Tutak said his dealership usually sells about 90% traditional-gas powered vehicles and 10% plug-ins, but that split has looked more like 70/30 over the last two months. The dealer manager also noted that around 80% of the electric models driven off the lot recently have been leased.

Tutak predicted that ""we're going to probably see a decrease in sales, but it's not going to be as big as some people think."" He added that ""there's a lot of two-year leases out there. And people really enjoy these EVs, so I think they're going to stick with them."" His top-selling EV models have been the Chevy Blazer and Equinox.

Scott Gruwel, president and CEO of Courtesy Automotive Group, painted a similar picture in discussing dealerships for nine different car and truck brands near Phoenix and San Diego.

""We are seeing an uptick in leads, and we are doing a good job of selling this last week and a half — definitely more than normal. But people aren't coming and blowing down the doors and waiting in lines to try to take advantage of this EV tax credit,"" he said.

Gruwel noted that the Phoenix market typically does not have high lease penetration, but ""astoundingly good"" deals meant to offload EVs have caused leases to double above usual levels. ""The idea is to not have too much inventory when this thing goes away,"" he said.

""But we still anticipate having EVs to stock and to sell, and I support that. It might not be as much of a focus, but it's still a part of the game plan,"" Gruwel added. ""It's not like everything drops off a cliff.""

Jim Walen, who owns and operates Stellantis and Hyundai Motor Corp. dealerships in Seattle, said he had mixed feelings about the end of the EV credits.

Walen did not like that the credits largely went to ""rich people"" who could already afford more expensive electric vehicles. He was also frustrated that exclusive EV-makers like Tesla and Rivian Automotive Inc. were eligible for the credits while also collecting, in Tesla's case, ""billions and billions of dollars"" from emissions credits sold to other automakers.

However, Walen also lamented that losing the $7,500 credit would slow industry progress toward making EVs accessible and ""depress sales"" at a time when the car business has already been ""under assault by the Trump administration from Day One"" via tariff policies.

""I'm the largest volume Hyundai dealer in the state of Washington, as well as the largest by retail volume for Stellantis,"" he said. ""My job is to deliver affordable transportation to the masses. And I will say that, overall, this is going to hurt us.""

The state’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program that allows drivers of zero-emissions vehicles to drive alone in the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane expires, effective at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.

With rush-hour traffic jams and clogged freeways a fact of life in California, the stickers act as an incentive for people to buy electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell cars. It’s estimated that 465,000 vehicles across the Golden State have active decals attached to them.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 13 other states have similar incentives in place.

But since the interstate highway system is funded by the federal government, the HOV initiative for zero-emissions vehicles requires federal authorization to keep the program going.

A 10-year extension was passed by Congress in 2015 but it expires at the end of September, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to pass a new extension.

So what happens now?

An official with the California Highway Patrol said the CHP will offer drivers a grace period before issuing tickets.

“The California Highway Patrol’s goal is always to educate the motoring public when there’s a change in the law,” Lt. Matt Gutierrez recently told the Orange County Register. “State law provides a 60-day transition period beginning Oct. 1, during which drivers with a valid clean-air decal will not be cited for driving alone in the carpool lane. After that, driving solo in the carpool lane could result in a citation.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group for the U.S. auto industry, is lobbying to bring the state decal programs back.

“According to consumer surveys, it is one of the primary motivators for consumers to choose an electric vehicle,” said Curt Augustine, the group’s senior director for state affairs. “So maintaining a popular incentive for folks to buy these new cars is important.”

Others say the HOV lanes should be reserved, as originally intended, for car pools and vehicles carrying multiple passengers — especially in light of the adoption of EVs and plug-in hybrids in California.

Some 21.6% of all light-duty new car sales in the Golden State in the second quarter came from vehicles that qualify as zero-emissions, according to the California Energy Commission. California has more than 2.3 million EVs, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the roads, by far the most of any U.S. state.

There’s been some movement on Capitol Hill to revive the sticker program.

In August, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Walnut Creek, in August introduced H.R. 4948, the HOV Lane Exemption Reauthorization Act.

The $212 million project, known as Strengthening Coastal Resilience and the Economy (SHORE), is intended to help India protect its marine ecosystems. These ecosystems, which are vital for industries like fishing and tourism, while also serving as important habitats for plants and wildlife, have been under threat due to coastal erosion, pollution, and urban expansion, according to Good News Network.

The project has shown how international organizations, governments, and the private sector can join forces to protect the environment and local industries while also spurring employment. The project will cover 6,200 miles of coastline in lower India, on which an estimated 250 million people rely for jobs and a place to live, per Good News Network.

""The SHORE MPA program will support India's vision for Integrated Coastal Zone Management while ensuring that the coastal zone's environment, landscapes, and natural values are in harmony with economic development,"" the program's website said.

If successful, the program could serve as a model for coastline management around the world.

Increasing global temperatures and rising seas, along with plastic pollution and overfishing, have posed a unique threat to coastal areas.

In the U.S., approximately 40% of the population lives in coastal counties, according to the EPA.

""U.S. coastal counties face permanent inundation and flooding threats from sea level rise, intense rains, high tide flooding and severe storms,"" the EPA said on its website.

""Many communities are taking steps to protect coasts from climate change. For example, some communities are elevating buildings or constructing barriers to shield people, businesses, and property from flooding and storm surge,"" the EPA continued. ""Others are restoring coastal habitats and using nature-based features to build coastal resilience.""

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In 2025, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier in 2025 granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. in 2024 sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",https://wisconsinpublictv.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap-economy-energy-utilities-blackrock-newyork-20230314.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 20:59:47.634320

Multiple BESS plants are currently under construction in Staten Island, including one on Nelson Avenue The site used to be a home office.
Some battery plants have caught fire before.
""Imagine if this happens in the middle of the night where we're all sleeping,"" said Thomas Oriol who works near one in Staten Island.
Supporters say the batteries used for energy storage have stricter regulations than those consumers can buy from a store.","NEW YORK (WABC) -- We've seen how an e-battery can catch fire and explode in a matter of seconds. That's from a single battery on an electric bike or scooter.

People living in some neighborhoods are now worried about what could happen with hundreds of lithium-ion batteries that are being stored in metal containers near their homes and businesses.

They're called Battery Energy Storage Systems or BESS plants. Power companies are filling metal containers the size of tractor trailers with e-batteries to help supplement the power grid. The batteries store energy and release the energy back to the grid during peak hours.

There are more than 6,000 facilities in New York alone.

Multiple BESS plants are currently under construction in Staten Island, including one on Nelson Avenue The site used to be a home office. It was demolished and replaced with metal containers full of e-batteries and it's located between homes and a gas station.

""I think it's disgraceful and I think it's dangerous,"" said Christina D'Angelis who lives nearby.

""That is a danger in a nice residential neighborhood with a school around the block, people all over and a gas station next door that can explode the entire neighborhood and I can't believe they got it improved,"" said D'Angelis.

Some battery plants have caught fire before. From a large fire in California earlier this year, to multiple fires in New York including one upstate in Jefferson County to another in Orange County in 2023. They burned on and off for days.

""Imagine if this happens in the middle of the night where we're all sleeping,"" said Thomas Oriol who works near one in Staten Island.

By 2030, New York wants to increase the amount of energy it stores from 359 all the way up to 6,000 megawatts. That would be enough energy to power all of New York City for a day.

""It's an absolutely critical source of meeting our electric needs,"" said Kyle Rabin of Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Supporters say the batteries used for energy storage have stricter regulations than those consumers can buy from a store.

And the state recently revised its fire and building code to regulate battery plants.

""I think people would feel very comfortable with this technology, they are some of the best fire codes standards in the country,"" said Rabin.

The new code requires each site to have large scale fire testing to help ensure a fire is contained to its metal enclosure. They also have to have a gas detection system, and a hazmat team on standby in case of an emergency amongst other revisions.

""The systems are no longer set and forget, they're set and maintain,"" said Paul Rogers, a former firefighter who now works for Energy Safety Response Group.

The new state code allows plants to be built 10 feet away from another property.

That's too close for comfort for some people.

Supporters of the new energy technology say that's a minimum distance and local communities can decide whether to change local laws to increase the distance.

That's what the Staten Island Borough President says he's fighting for.

""Accidents can happen, they have happened and we just want to prevent that from happening here this time,"" said Vito Fossella, Staten Island Borough President. ""We're standing in front of a recipe for disaster and an accident waiting to happen.""

The FDNY released the following statement in regards to the energy storage systems:

""Let's be clear, keeping New Yorkers and our first responders safe will always be our top priority - it's what the brave men and women of the FDNY do every single day. At the same time, we are committed to a greener, more sustainable future for all. That's why our fire code for energy storage systems is widely regarded as one of the most robust and strongest in the country - it's considered a national benchmark for safety. We test facilities, enforce standards, and prepare for any potential emergencies like no other city, making our regulations the best fire code for energy storage in the nation.""

The Olkaria EV Plant is among the high-tech projects announced for Olkaria, the other one being a large-scale data center.

Aquilastar has an aim of producing 50,000EV units every year. Additionally, the company seeks to create 13,000 both direct jobs and indirect jobs. This will be achieved with the support of UAE-based Alsayegh Group. Alsayegh Group is a conglomerate with investors in technology, financial services, education, automotive, and oil and gas.

Project Factsheet

Project type: Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing and assembly plant

Location: Olkaria Geothermal Area, Naivasha, Kenya (Within a designated Geothermal Special Economic Zone)

Cost: $150 million

Company: Aquilastar

Unique feature: The plant is seeking to negotiate long-term power contracts with KenGen to be tethered directly to baseload geothermal renewable energy supply. This would make it one of the world’s few EV plants powered by consistent, carbon-free geothermal energy.

Economic implication: Consistent geothermal power supply is expected to offer predictable production costs, potentially giving Kenyan-made EVs a cost advantage over imports.

Location and Size of Project’s Site

The upcoming EV plant will be located in KenGen’s Green Energy Park. This park covers a total of 845 acres at the Olkaria Geothermal field.

Also, the park has been designed to host industrial and non-industrial activities which include offices, data centres, research and development hubs, hospitality amenities, visitor experience facilities, and commercial services.

According to Mr. Alsayegh, the plant will produce up to 50,000 units every year. Furthermore, it will be able to directly employ 3,000 Kenyans and generate another 10,000 indirect jobs while developing a local supply chain for EV accessories in Kenya.

Benefits of EV Adoption to Kenya

Additionally, Aquilastar Managing Director and CEO Barbara Modani Alwena, highlighted that the adoption of EV offers Kenya an opportunity to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel imports. These imports usually cost Ksh600 billion to Ksh700 billion every year.

“This EV plant project is not just unveiling a new product but lighting up a bold vision for the future of mobility, sustainability, and innovation in Kenya,” she stated.

Significance of the Olkaria EV Plant

Lastly, the CEO of KenGen Peter Njenga stated that the EV plant would assist in driving Kenya’s industrialisation goals.

“This is not just breaking ground on a new plant. We are breaking ground on a new chapter of industrialisation in the continent. Its is a chapter powered by clean energy, durable jobs, and local innovations,” Njenga stated.

Also, he affirmed the investors that KenGen is revamping its installations. This is in order to make sure there is uninterrupted power supply, targeting generation of 1,500MW by 2034. 834MW is expected to be generated from geothermal energy.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KenGen-park-ev-scaled-1.avif,N,,2025-09-30 02:59:20.071191

In the US, power demand from data centers is set to double by 2035, to almost 9% of all demand, according to BNEF.
A comic strip taped to his office door makes a dark joke about AI causing the power grid to collapse.
Distance from data centers Next, we determined each LMP node’s proximity to significant data center activity using data from DC Byte.
Cells deemed as being far from data centers were ones in which the LMP nodes had an average distance greater than 50 miles from significant data center activity.","Data centers are proliferating in Virginia and a blind man in Baltimore is suddenly contending with sharply higher power bills.

The Maryland city is well over an hour’s drive from the northern Virginia region known as Data Center Alley. But Kevin Stanley, a 57-year-old who survives on disability payments, says his energy bills are about 80% higher than they were about three years ago. “They’re going up and up,” he said. “You wonder, ‘What is your breaking point?’”

It’s an increasingly dramatic ripple effect of the AI boom as energy-hungry data centers send power costs to records in much of the US, pulling everyday households into paying for the digital economy.

The power needs of the massive complexes are rapidly driving up electricity bills — piling onto the rising prices for food, housing and other essentials already straining consumers. That’s starting to have economic and political reverberations across the country as utilities and local officials wrestle over how to divvy up the costs. Yet those same facilities are a linchpin of US leadership in the global AI race.

A Bloomberg News analysis of wholesale electricity prices for tens of thousands of locations across the country reveals the effects of the AI boom on the power market with unprecedented granularity. Electricity now costs as much as 267% more for a single month than it did five years ago in areas located near significant data center activity.

About two-thirds of the power consumed in the US runs off of a state or regional grid, where the system operator manages the trading of energy. These wholesale commodity costs are passed on to households and businesses on their utility bills, which then include other charges to maintain and expand the network. That can affect even customers who aren’t in close proximity to a data center, since their energy relies on the same grid.

Every day, wholesale electricity prices are measured in real time by Locational Marginal Pricing points on the power grid, called nodes. LMPs are primarily made up of the cost to produce the energy and congestion. Analyzing data from 25,000 nodes used by seven regional transmission authorities, Bloomberg News estimated how much wholesale prices in the lower 48 states have changed since 2020.

Tech companies, now among the biggest and most powerful forces in the world, have staked their future on AI. Data centers — some with a footprint large enough to cover much of Manhattan — are chock full of racks of servers delivering computer power and storage needed to train and run models.

Their power needs are only set to accelerate. In recent weeks alone, Nvidia Corp. said it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to support new data centers, while Microsoft Corp. struck a multiyear deal worth almost $20 billion to get cloud computing power from Amsterdam-based Nebius Group NV using a New Jersey data center. OpenAI and Oracle Corp. forged a partnership to build 4.5 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity, enough energy to power millions of American homes.

“The reliability crisis is here now; it’s not off in the distance somewhere,” said Mark Christie, a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who also served as a long-time Virginia regulator. He said that load forecasts — the expected demand for power on electricity grids — are a key factor pushing up costs, driven by the data center interconnection requests.

The affordability problem extends beyond US borders. Power auction prices in Japan hit all-time highs amid government expectations of an AI boom, while Malaysia is lifting electricity rates for data centers as new facilities tighten supply. In the UK, a report from Aurora Energy Research found that higher demand from data centers could push power prices up 9% by 2040.

Globally, data centers are expected to consume more than 4% of electricity by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. Put another way: If the facilities were a country they’d rank fourth in electricity use, behind only China, the US and India.

In the US, power demand from data centers is set to double by 2035, to almost 9% of all demand, according to BNEF. Some predict it will be the biggest surge in US energy demand since air conditioning caught on in the 1960s. That comes as the grid is already struggling to update aging infrastructure and adapt to climate change.

“Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,” said David Crane, chief executive officer of Generate Capital and a former energy official in the Biden administration. All that demand risks brownout situations in some US power markets within the next year or two, he said.

President Donald Trump, who won election in part because of Americans’ dissatisfaction with higher consumer costs, said on the campaign trail that he would cut electricity prices in half within 18 months of taking office. Yet prices have only risen since his inauguration. His energy chief said this month that soaring power bills are now his biggest concern.

The president has championed America’s AI dominance while also stripping support for new sources of energy like solar and wind farms with his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which some experts say will increase average household energy bills. BNEF forecasts that annual deployment of new solar, wind and energy storage facilities in 2035 will be 23% lower than it would have been without the bill.

Trump has instead focused on unlocking power through expanding the use of coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. In a statement, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers blamed the Biden administration’s climate agenda and “destructive” policies for driving up energy prices.

“President Trump’s actions to unleash American energy are the only reason our country has not experienced blackouts and grid failures that would have occurred” under the prior policies, she said.

PJM Interconnection, the operator of the largest US electric grid, has faced significant strain from the AI boom. The rapid development of data centers relying on the system raised costs for consumers from Illinois to Washington, DC, by more than $9.3 billion for the 12 months starting in June, according to the grid’s independent market monitor. Costs will go up even more next year.

Demand tied to the cryptocurrency boom, new factories and the electrification of the economy, including vehicles and home heating, are also pushing up power bills. The cost of natural gas, the No. 1 power-plant fuel in the US, is increasing thanks to all of this demand. And in the zone that includes Baltimore, the planned retirement of coal plants has increased the price of power by decreasing projected supply.

Baltimore residents saw their average bill jump by more than $17 a month after a power auction held by PJM reached a record high, according to Exelon Corp.’s Baltimore Gas & Electric utility. This year’s auction set another record, which will boost the average power bill in Baltimore again by up to $4 starting in mid-2026.

AI Is Already Wreaking Havoc on Global Power Systems

AI Needs So Much Power, It’s Making Yours Worse

AI Is Draining Water From Areas That Need It Most

There has been a “massive outcry about high energy bills” in the area, said David Lapp of the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, an independent state agency that advocates for residential utility customers. His office fields about 50 calls a week and recently hired a new staffer to help manage the requests for help. A comic strip taped to his office door makes a dark joke about AI causing the power grid to collapse.

Nicole Pastore, who has lived in her large stone home near Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins University campus for 18 years, said her utility bills over the past year jumped by 50%. “You look at that and think, ‘Oh my god,’” she said. She has now become the kind of mom who walks around her home turning off lights and unplugging her daughter’s cellphone chargers.

And because Pastore is a judge who rules on rental disputes in Baltimore City District Court, she regularly sees poor people struggling with their own power bills. “It’s utilities versus rent,” she said. “They want to stay in their home, but they also want to keep their lights on.”

Stanley’s neighborhood is a mix of well-tended houses like his and those that are condemned or abandoned, with broken windows and holes in the walls. He used to work as a hotel manager but glaucoma took his vision almost 20 years ago, leaving him with few employment options.

“They can say this is going to help with AI, but how is that going to help me?” he said from his front steps. “How’s that going to help me pay my bill?”

The analysis of 25,000 LMP nodes examined the relationship between the change in wholesale electricity prices and the nodes’ distance from data centers. The analysis reveals that LMP nodes with increases are more likely to be concentrated near data centers.

The boom highlights a stark trade-off: Data centers devour electricity and water, but also are required for the tech-driven conveniences of the modern era, whether it’s using ChatGPT for queries, getting matched with an Uber driver or seeing streaming recommendations on Netflix. Even some activists who protest widespread development of the facilities acknowledge that their digital lives rely on them.

In 2024, the three biggest US cloud providers — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — spent more than $200 billion on capital expenditures, most of it to construct data centers. To ease the pressure, tech companies are working on ways to speed additional power capacity to the grid while developing better techniques for cooling data centers and chips that use less energy. Hyperscalers are collectively bringing back old reactors, spurring upgrades at existing plants and investing in next-generation nuclear power.

In some US regions it’s clear that data centers are a major influence on the surge in energy costs. They are the largest source of new power consumption in Texas by far. Dominion Energy Inc. — which serves northern Virginia’s Data Center Alley — forecast that its peak demand would rise by more than 75% by 2039 with data centers. It would be just 10% without. Against that backdrop, power costs have become a key issue in this year’s gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey.

Utilities across the US say they are trying to ensure tech firms pay a fair share for the electricity and infrastructure upgrades their data centers require. Some power companies have moved to require tech firms to put up more collateral or pay for specific amounts of electricity, even if they end up using less.

“We believe data centers should pay for the full cost of their power,” Dominion spokesperson Aaron Ruby said in an email. “That’s how we design our rates, and it’s the standard our regulator uses in reviewing them.” Ruby added that infrastructure costs are allocated based on how much it costs to serve each group of customers, with data centers paying an increasingly large percentage of transmission costs.

Calvin Butler, the CEO of Exelon, said the company is pushing for long-term solutions that are fair and bring peace of mind to customers. “While we can’t control every factor driving up prices, we refuse to stand by,” he said in a statement.

For local officials, the effects are becoming urgent. Last week, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro convened the first-ever meeting of representatives from all 13 states served by PJM. Shapiro, a Democrat, warned that if PJM didn’t tackle changes to reign in consumer costs, Pennsylvania could withdraw from the system. New Jersey regulators are studying this and Maryland may do the same.

PJM has said that supply and demand conditions are driving up prices. A spokesman declined to comment further.

As a regional grid operator, PJM not only runs daily markets to trade electricity but is also responsible for transmission planning, and costs for those projects are socialized within the grid. It approved $5.9 billion in new transmission projects in February, attributing the load growth primarily to data centers. PJM also runs a capacity auction to contract to procure power supplies where consumers pay billions of dollars a year to generators to ensure they are available.

“The PJM capacity market will be at its maximum price for the foreseeable future, it could be five or 10 years,” said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, the grid’s official watchdog. He said data centers need to bring their own generation, and those projects should get a speedy approval process.

Some local governments are now rethinking how utility costs are shared and who should pay. In Oregon, lawmakers in June passed the POWER Act, a law designed to help utilities strike fairer deals with data centers and crypto miners.

The issue is especially pronounced in the Portland suburb of Hillsboro, where 15 major data centers are located. Nearly all of Portland General Electric’s load growth has come from commercial customers, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board. Yet over the past decade, residential rates climbed by 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with just 2 cents for large users, he said. Rising home power costs contributed to a wave of electricity shutoffs during a frigid winter last year.

Portland General said there are numerous factors in rate increases. The utility is hoping to have new rates based on the POWER Act for the commission to approve next year “to keep prices as low as possible for our residential and small business customers while supporting growth of data centers as they continue to come online,” said John McFarland, vice president and chief commercial and customer officer.

The POWER Act was designed to give regulators sharper tools to hold large electricity users accountable, said State Representative Pam Marsh, who introduced the bill. She noted that Amazon was collaborative on the legislation, though it ultimately withheld final support. Google did as well.

An Amazon spokesperson said the company works closely with utilities and grid operators to plan for future growth. When special infrastructure is needed, “we work to make sure that we’re covering those costs and that they aren’t being passed on to other ratepayers,” the spokesperson said.

Google supports paying its fair share for electricity to data centers and helping to protect other rate payers, according to a spokesperson. The company said it has been working to use less electricity even as it expands data centers, with Google’s operations delivering more than six times more computing power per unit of electricity than they did five years ago.

A similar debate is underway in the political battleground state of Wisconsin, where Microsoft is developing a massive data center on land once meant to be a plant for Foxconn, until the iPhone supplier dramatically scaled back its highly touted plans. Local residents are already paying higher bills tied to power lines built for Foxconn, according to Tom Content, executive director of the state’s Citizens Utility Board.

Now, with Microsoft’s site requiring 900 megawatts — and an even larger 1.3-gigawatt facility that could go up to 3.5 gigawatts approved for construction farther north — utility We Energies and its parent company told investors it will need to boost its power capacity by about 20% through 2029. The utility, which plans investments to bring 6 gigawatts of new generation online in that time period, has proposed tariffs that force “very large” customers to shoulder the costs of infrastructure built for them, even if they later give up on the project.

Microsoft says it collaborated with the utility in structuring the proposed tariffs.

“We recognize that it’s literally our responsibility to make sure that when we come to a community, when we get connected to a grid, that the cost of the infrastructure that is being dedicated to us, that those costs of service, get allocated to us,” said Bobby Hollis, Microsoft’s vice president of energy.

Still, Milwaukee resident Montre Moore, first vice president at the county chapter of the NAACP, is worried about the impact of future rising prices on the area’s poor and communities of color. His own home heating bill rose from around $118 a month to $160 last winter, and he expects another hike this year. “We are in for a world of hurt that is coming from a rate perspective and from an environmental perspective,” he said.

We, in a statement, said its typical bills are in line with other Midwest utilities, and that its most recent rate approved by regulators wasn’t tied to data centers and instead was related to issues including programs for severe weather and costs from previous projects.

In northern Virginia, Dominion Energy cited data center demand, inflation and higher fuel costs when asking regulators to raise its customer bills by about $20 a month for the average residential user over the next two years. Customers wrote Dominion’s regulators to complain.

One woman from Hampton said she’s an 81-year-old widow with limited income and can’t afford the increase. Another from Virginia Beach said she and her husband are already living paycheck to paycheck. A man in Midlothian said data centers shouldn’t push up bills if they’re not paying their fair share.

Mary Ruffine was shocked to see her monthly bill increase to around $260 from roughly $200. She lives in Arlington, Virginia, an affluent Washington suburb with tree-lined streets shading homes. Her monthly bill increases don’t mean she has to skimp on medication or skip meals. But she doesn’t like that poorer people are shouldering higher bills while some of the richest companies in the world profit.

“I just feel like we are sharing the burden in an uneven way with these corporations that have billions of dollars,” she said. “And so we the people are the ones who are absorbing the costs for these data centers.”

Back in Baltimore, Antoinette Robinson leaned on her walker during a recent afternoon stroll to complain that her high power bills leave her with less than $100 in her bank account at the end of each month. “It’s killing my pockets,” she said.

Stanley says the trees that used to grow on his street were cut down. Without their shade his home gets even hotter in the summer, forcing him to rely more on expensive air conditioning.

The rise in his power bills has him reusing disposable razors 20 times and stretching the supplies for his diabetes and sleep apnea. Sometimes he goes to food banks.

“People shouldn’t have to decide between their gas and electric bill and food,” he said.

Methodology

Change in electricity prices

To examine the impact of data centers on power grids, we first analyzed real-time electricity prices for so-called Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) nodes, using data provided by Grid Status, for the seven Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) where wholesale electricity markets operate in the US. Some areas of the country do not participate in these markets and were not included in the analysis.

LMP nodes are points in a power grid, including substations, power generation facilities and connections between transmission lines, where wholesale electricity is being auctioned off, either in real time or for the day ahead. The analysis only included nodes that had electricity-price data for both 2020 and 2025, as well as a known location so that distance from data centers could be measured. In total, our analysis captured about 25,000 nodes.

For each node, we calculated the difference between the median electricity prices recorded at five-minute intervals for the months of April 2020 and April 2025. We focused on the month of April because US grids generally don’t face additional pressure from extreme weather during that month, like they tend to do during winter and summer months. We replicated the analysis for the months of January and July to confirm that the same pattern held true: the median distance from significant data center activity is shorter for nodes that recorded the highest price increases.

Wholesale electricity prices can be positive or negative. Negative prices generally occur when the supply of electricity is greater than the demand. We considered nodes where prices switched from positive in 2020 to negative in 2025 to have recorded a decrease in prices. Conversely, we considered prices that switched from negative to positive as having increased.

Distance from data centers

Next, we determined each LMP node’s proximity to significant data center activity using data from DC Byte. To define what constitutes significant activity, we used a dynamic threshold of data center live capacity around each node after speaking with power-modeling experts, who indicated the price impact of a data center on a given node varies depending on how much capacity is already operating in the area. To calculate the level of data center activity, we first divided the US into grid cells using H3, a well-established geospatial indexing system, at resolution 4 to create equal-sized areas that cover about 683 square miles. We then calculated the total live capacity within that area as of July 2025, and the distance of each node from 20% of that total capacity.

For the purposes of mapping the data, we split the country into hexagonal cells of 100 square miles each. Only cells where LMP nodes exist are shown. For each cell, we calculated the average wholesale electricity price for April of each year between 2020 and 2025, based on the median prices of all nodes included in the cell. For areas where the electricity price switched from positive to negative, we considered the change as –100%. Cells deemed as being far from data centers were ones in which the LMP nodes had an average distance greater than 50 miles from significant data center activity.

Electricity consumption by state

To estimate data centers’ share of a state’s electricity consumption, we adjusted the total live capacity of data centers in each state to account for utilization and energy efficiency. We converted the capacity values to energy consumption estimates using the following formula: MWh = (capacity) (hours in a year) (utilization rate) * (Power Usage Effectiveness) where capacity is the installed IT capacity, utilization rate is 70% and Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is equal to an average of 1.5.

The calculation assumes that data centers are running 70% of the time and that their PUE — a ratio to determine a data center’s efficiency — is 1.5 on average. These numbers can vary from facility to facility.

Cox’s report also showed that new EV sales set a record at 146,332 units, but grew just 17.7 percent from 2024.
Electric vehicles are no longer viewed solely as cutting-edge or luxury purchases.
Consumers are also more confident about purchasing secondhand electric cars.
Electrek reported that while the company still leads in overall EV sales, its U.S. share dropped to 38 percent in August, the lowest on record.","Used electric vehicles are now the fastest-selling cars in the United States, according to new data from Cox Automotive, marking a milestone for a market that has long hovered on the edge of mainstream adoption. In August, sales of used EVs hit a record 40,960 units, a 59 percent increase compared to the same month last year. Cox’s report also showed that new EV sales set a record at 146,332 units, but grew just 17.7 percent from 2024.

The numbers highlight a shift in consumer behavior. Electric vehicles are no longer viewed solely as cutting-edge or luxury purchases. They are increasingly practical choices for everyday drivers, and buyers are showing a strong preference for the affordability of used models. According to Cox, August’s surge also gave used EVs their largest market share ever, representing 2.4 percent of all used-vehicle sales in the U.S.

Why buyers are turning to used EVs

Price is the biggest driver. While new EVs can still come with steep sticker prices, older models are entering the resale market at significantly lower costs, making them accessible to a wider audience. Many of the EVs sold over the past three years were leased, and Cox data shows those lease returns are now adding to the supply of used vehicles.

Consumers are also more confident about purchasing secondhand electric cars. Worries about battery life and expensive repairs haven’t vanished, but diagnostics and warranties are improving. Recurrent, a company that tracks EV battery health, reports that transparency tools and service programs are making buyers more comfortable with pre-owned purchases. Cox’s Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index also showed wholesale values for used EVs rising 0.8 percent in August, compared to a 0.7 percent increase for the overall used-car market — a sign that demand is outpacing supply.

Federal tax credits have further fueled demand. Buyers are eager to secure incentives that apply to certain used EVs, and analysts told Electric Cars Report that looming changes to those credits have created urgency. For price-sensitive shoppers, the combination of incentives and lower purchase prices has made used EVs far more appealing than new ones.

Meanwhile, new EV growth is showing signs of leveling off. Automakers continue to expand their lineups, and total sales remain strong, but many consumers are cautious about committing to higher monthly payments at a time of elevated interest rates. Hybrids and traditional gasoline models are still widely available, often at lower prices, which keeps new EV adoption from accelerating more quickly.

Tesla’s market share has also slipped as competition grows. Electrek reported that while the company still leads in overall EV sales, its U.S. share dropped to 38 percent in August, the lowest on record. A broader range of choices from established automakers and startups alike is pushing more shoppers into the used market, where multiple brands and models compete for attention.

Looking forward, analysts expect the used EV market to maintain its momentum. More vehicles are scheduled to come off leases, adding to inventory, and consumers who may have been waiting on the sidelines are finding compelling options. That influx could put downward pressure on prices, especially for older models with shorter ranges, but it also means buyers will have a wider selection, from compact sedans to family SUVs. Cars with stronger battery performance, faster charging capability, and transferable warranties are likely to command higher resale values.

New EV growth, by contrast, is likely to moderate once the current rush to lock in tax credits subsides. Automakers are still investing heavily, but buyers may hesitate until charging networks expand further and overall affordability improves. Policy decisions at the state and federal levels will also be critical in shaping the pace of future adoption.

For now, the August sales figures point to a pivotal moment. Used EVs have moved beyond niche status and into the mainstream, attracting buyers who once might not have considered them. The coming year will test whether this momentum is sustainable, but one thing is clear: the second life of the electric vehicle is proving every bit as important to the market as the first.

The grant—titled “Westchester for the Future”—will fund clean energy career training for 50 local individuals, with a focus on creating equitable pathways to employment in the region’s rapidly expanding clean energy sector.

The funding, administered by NYSDOL and supported by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) through its Office of Just Energy Transition, is part of a $5 million statewide initiative to support high-quality pre-apprenticeship and training programs that prepare workers for jobs in renewable energy, building electrification, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and other green industries.

Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said: “Westchester is committed to preparing our residents for the jobs of the future, and this grant is a powerful investment in that vision. By expanding training in clean energy, we are not only opening doors for jobseekers — especially those in disadvantaged communities — but also ensuring our local employers have access to the skilled talent they need to grow. This is about equity, economic opportunity and building a more sustainable future for all of Westchester.”

“This grant allows us to deliver high-impact training that not only meets the needs of the clean energy economy but also ensures underserved populations across Westchester have direct access to these career opportunities,” said WPWDB Executive Director Thom Kleiner. “It’s a win for local jobseekers, for employers, and for the region’s environmental goals.”

The WPWDB will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) this fall to select qualified training providers who will deliver industry-aligned programming and wraparound services—including career counseling, case management, and job placement support. At least 35% of program participants will be recruited from Disadvantaged Communities (DACs), in alignment with NYSDOL equity guidelines.

To ensure job placement pipelines are strong, the WPWDB is partnering with Sustainable Westchester and the Business Council of Westchester’s Clean Energy Action Coalition to identify employment opportunities for graduates. These organizations will help bridge connections between program completers and employers across the region who are seeking skilled talent in the clean energy space.

This initiative builds on Westchester’s commitment to workforce equity and climate resilience and aligns with Governor Hochul’s climate goals under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA).

Regulations finalized under President Joe Biden that assumed more than 50 percent of the US auto market would be composed of fully electric models by 2032 “are a lawful exercise of authority Congress provided to EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles,” Tesla said in a regulatory filing posted online by the US Environmental Protection Agency last week.

The comments come as the EPA considers rescinding a key finding that greenhouse gas emissions from cars and other sources pose a threat to public health. The so-called endangerment finding provided the legal basis for the federal government’s most ambitious efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, including those from automobiles.

It also provided a regulatory framework to support Tesla’s investments in product development and production, the automaker said in its comments.

Tesla said it “respectfully encourages EPA not to rescind the Endangerment Finding, as that finding is lawful, based on a robust factual and scientific record, and has been an established part of federal law for more than fifteen years.”

Other carmakers have urged the EPA to roll back the Biden-era emissions rules, calling them “simply not achievable,” in separate comments submitted by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents nearly all major manufacturers except Tesla.

The EPA’s effort to repeal the endangerment finding is part of a series of actions under President Donald Trump to curtail federal support for electric vehicles, of which Tesla is the nation’s largest seller.

Christian continued, “Coal isn’t going away — it’s a critical part of our energy mix. While U.S. energy policy should be to eliminate all subsidies and let the free market compete, it’s not the reality we live in and not all subsidies are equal: coal production for power provides profits that wind and solar simply cannot. It’s cheaper, more reliable and provides vastly more baseload power per price than wind/solar. In fact, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation, ‘Wind has received 48 times more subsidies per unit of electricity generated than oil and gas, while solar has garnered a staggering 168 times more.’ With smart investments in sources like coal, we can modernize plants, cut red tape, and ensure coal remains a backbone of American prosperity for generations to come.”

Deadline Extensions Proposal and Companion Direct Final Rule Summary

With this action, the EPA is extending compliance deadlines for the effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) that apply to coal-fired power plants. This will allow facilities to respond to increases in demand and provide energy reliability for Americans. At the same time, the EPA will gather more information on implementation of the ELGs to evaluate feasibility and ensure a practical approach to protecting water resources while meeting critical energy demand.

The EPA estimates that the proposal would reduce costs by approximately $30 million to $200 million per year.

Q&A

Why is the EPA taking this action?

This action advances the goals of President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order by ensuring the country has reliable, affordable electricity while protecting our nation’s water resources under the Clean Water Act (CWA). A national energy crisis is impacting the U.S. electric power sector in the form of extraordinary increases in electricity demand driven in part by the artificial intelligence (AI) and datacenter revolution, as well as an industrial and manufacturing resurgence.

The existing compliance deadlines are simply unworkable in this dynamic reality and the EPA is taking action to relieve pressure on electricity producers and the grid. The Agency is committed to giving utilities more time to evaluate and plan for rapidly evolving electricity demand to ensure economic prosperity for the nation now and in the future and ensuring that reliable, high-performing, domestic sources of energy can continue to be counted upon.

Which provisions of the existing ELGs would change and which would not change?

This action would change compliance deadlines for the Steam Electric Power Generating category. It would also add new rule provisions that would allow permitting authorities flexibility to extend compliance deadlines on a site-specific basis due to unexpected electricity demand. While this action would not change the zero-discharge requirements themselves, the EPA is requesting information on technology-based implementation challenges related to the 2024 ELG rule to inform potential future rulemaking to support practical, feasible, on-the-ground implementation of wastewater pollution discharge limits.

How will this action impact the economy?

The EPA’s proposed rule would strengthen America’s position as the AI capital of the world while bolstering industrial competitiveness. At the same time, it prevents higher costs for local businesses, creating opportunities for new investments and growth. When implemented, the proposal would save between $30 and $200 million each year. This means more money in the pockets of American families and more investment and growth opportunities for American businesses.

Will this action make electricity more affordable for Americans?

If finalized, this action would reduce costs for facilities and help with electricity reliability and affordability. The EPA’s current ELGs for wastewater discharges from steam electric power plants are potentially costly to an electric power sector that is struggling with increasing demand as AI is booming, data centers are being constructed and operated around the country, and American industry and manufacturing is resurgent. This action would give utilities more time to evaluate and plan for evolving energy demand for their customers/ratepayers.

Will this action make American electricity more reliable?

This action would keep existing steam electric power plants open and producing electric power, thereby making energy more reliable in America. This helps ensure adequate reserves of energy and reduces the risk of electricity blackouts.

How will this action impact the environment?

The EPA remains committed to ensuring that Americans have access to clean water. For more than 50 years, the EPA has partnered with States, Tribes, and stakeholders to implement the CWA and there have been significant reductions in pollution entering our Nation's waterways. Before the CWA, our surface waters suffered from pollution, with the Cuyahoga River becoming symbolic for catching fire at least a dozen times. Under the CWA, our Nation's waterbodies are now cleaner and safer and support recreation, wildlife, and economic opportunity. The Agency will continue to advance progress under the CWA, including by supporting practical and implementable standards for steam electric power plants.

What pollutants are found in wastewater from coal-fired power plants?

The ELGs for the Steam Electric Power Generating category apply to power plants that burn coal to create steam and generate electricity. These power plants use large volumes of water in their operation and maintenance. Their wastewater is treated before it is returned to the environment to reduce pollutants including selenium, mercury, arsenic, bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

How will this action inform future rulemakings?

The EPA is requesting comment on real-world implementation challenges with the 2024 rule. The EPA will evaluate this on-the-ground information about implementation challenges of the 2024 rule to inform future action that could include rulemaking. Additionally, the Agency is seeking comment to ensure that rulemaking efforts incentivize continued coal-fired generation.

The report compares resource plans for 75 utilities across the U.S.

The environmental group’s Mikaela Curry said the companies rely too heavily on natural gas and not enough on solar and wind energy. She said the utility would need to transition new and existing natural gas generators to hydrogen fuel or implement carbon capture to meet North Carolina’s 2050 carbon neutrality deadline.

Neither technology is currently commercially viable in North Carolina, and existing research does not show that natural gas pipelines can transport hydrogen without major modifications.

“We have proven, available technologies, and we’re not seeing Duke bring them on the grid at the pace and scale that we need,” Curry said.

Across all its territories, Duke Energy ranks second among utilities for the most new natural gas planned by 2035. It's North Carolina and South Carolina companies placed third, behind Georgia Power and Tennessee Valley Authority, with plans to add 3,620 megawatts of natural gas generation during the next seven years.

Curry said the poor grade also reflects risks for ratepayers. Fuel prices caused two-thirds of electric bill increases for Duke Energy Carolinas ratepayers over the last seven years, according to a 2024 report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

“The customers bear those fuel costs, not the utility,” Curry said. “Whereas if you’re bringing solar and battery storage online, there’s no associated fuel costs with those.”

Duke also lost points for not retiring its coal plants by 2030. Last year, state regulators ordered Duke to retire its remaining coal-powered plants by 2036.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers is reshaping America’s energy landscape and national security priorities. These facilities are instrumental in enabling America to maintain its position as a global superpower. Stifling growth in this industry is not an option. We cannot allow an adversary, like China, to lead the world in AI development. The Chinese Communist Party already uses AI to advance its military and geopolitical ambitions. To be clear, this is a race we cannot afford to lose.

Data centers use enormous amounts of energy, placing greater strain on an already over-exerted energy grid. The United States Department of Energy notes that data centers used a little more than 4% of the nation’s electricity in 2023. By 2030, that number is expected to triple to a staggering 12% of domestic electricity use.

Make no mistake, I am fully behind America’s push to remain the world’s AI leader, and I applaud the Trump administration’s efforts to make that possible. This sector can bring thousands of high-paying jobs to America, stimulating our economy and keeping the country competitive in the global marketplace. However, we need a robust energy grid to seize this opportunity. Rolling blackouts and brownouts are becoming more common in markets where poor policy decisions have prioritized renewable pipedreams over reliable sources. If we maintain the status quo, we will be living up to Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

There is no silver bullet when it comes to solving our energy grid crisis. However, a good starting point would be to advance policy solutions that prioritize dispatchable 24/7 energy sources over intermittent ones. We are doing just that in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. A diversified national energy portfolio is the key to longevity, but it must be reliable. While natural gas, coal, and hydropower (region-dependent) can all help to meet this demand, there is another energy source that has the potential to propel our nation into a new generation of global leadership.

Allow me to introduce the nuclear option (no, not the Senate procedural motion). I believe that nuclear energy will have the largest role to play in fueling American AI development, and the time to act is now.

However, for nuclear energy to reach the pinnacle of American energy dominance, two things must happen: debunking the myths of the dangers of nuclear energy and fostering a financial ecosystem that encourages long-term, serious investments in the industry.

Ask anyone to name an incident involving nuclear power, and I guarantee they can cite Chernobyl. That happened nearly 40 years ago and was caused by faulty reactor design and operator error. That Soviet-designed RBMK reactor was destined to fail; we do things a little differently here in the U.S. Our reactors are pillars of stability. The domestic nuclear fleet consists of 54 plants hosting 94 reactors across 28 states. This fleet boasts a remarkable safety record, enabling the industry to operate at the highest levels of reliability and performance.

Private industry has driven innovation in the nuclear space. Partnered with a commonsense regulatory environment, support from milestone-based development programs at the DOE, implementation of the ADVANCE Act, and the reorganization of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, we are well-positioned to expand our nuclear fleet. However, we cannot support this advanced technology with antiquated systems and procedures.

We need a reliable fuel supply chain to power this revolution. Investments in mining, processing, and enrichment are critical to the growth of nuclear power. It would also be irresponsible not to address the storage of spent nuclear fuel and the need for reprocessing. With all the spent nuclear fuel currently sitting across our nation, we could power our current fleet for over 100 years with the right reprocessing.

We can build the fleet of the future, consisting of large reactors, small modular reactors (SMRs), and microreactors, the latter two of which can be scaled depending on demand. SMRs and microreactors also enable the industry to meet consumers where they are and where they will be going forward.

The current political climate, no pun intended, is poised perfectly for expanding our energy capabilities, and nuclear energy will be the catalyst for American excellence for generations to come. For us to achieve this goal, we cannot sit around while our adversaries take advantage of our inaction. Time is of the essence, and I hope my sense of urgency is shared across our great nation.

From the sidewalk, there's nothing to distinguish this house from its neighbors. But there's a tiny clue that something is a little different: a sticker on the electric meter with a Solarize Philly logo.

The owner, Liz Robinson, is the current executive director at the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association, a volunteer-based nonprofit that works to increase solar adoption in Pennsylvania. She's been involved in renewable energy policy in the city and on the state level for decades. Almost 10 years ago, Robinson had solar panels installed on the roof of this house, which she bought as a rental property.

Wearing an ""electrify your future"" T-shirt, Robinson pointed at the digital readout on the meter. ""This is telling me how much electricity is being produced, and even on a cloudy day like today, I'm getting a fair amount of electricity,"" she said. Her small system covers the electricity bills for this property and 60 percent of the bill at her house down the street.

""I thought it would pay for itself in 10 years, but because electricity prices have been rising, it paid for itself in less than nine years,"" she said. ""It's the best defense against a rising electric bill.""

Robinson remembers a time when the dream of widespread renewable energy for Pennsylvania, and not just for scattered individual households, felt within reach. In the early 2000s, the state was a renewable-energy pioneer, passing a law that required a certain percentage of the state's electricity generation to come from alternative energy sources.

In 2010, then-Gov. Ed Rendell boasted about this Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, calling it ""one of the most ambitious of its kind in America"" and praising Pennsylvania as ""a national leader in the field of alternative energy."" Since 2006, Rendell said, the state had made ""remarkable progress,"" citing growth in wind and solar generation.

""The Rendell administration did a lot of work to bring manufacturing into the state,"" said Laurie Mazer, co-founder of Formation Energy, a Philadelphia-based solar developer. ""There really was this moment where Pennsylvania was well ahead of the curve.""

But even as Rendell touted the state's investment in renewable energy, the landscape was changing. In 2004, the same year the state enacted the AEPS law, drilling began on the first gas well in Pennsylvania to use hydraulic fracturing.

The fracking boom birthed a new way of thinking about energy. By 2013, in a speech about climate change, President Barack Obama was hailing natural gas as a ""transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution,"" phrasing that was popular in messaging on natural gas at the time. It was a ""bridge"" from dirty coal to cleaner renewables, a temporary solution that would lower emissions and secure energy independence.

Fifteen years later, that bridge extends endlessly into Pennsylvania's future, with no glimpse of the other side in sight.

Natural gas production is still rising in the United States, and 60 percent of Pennsylvania's electricity generation now comes from natural gas. It's so tied to electricity in some Pennsylvanians' minds that they can't imagine how the state could run without it. State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who represents a heavily fracked district in the southwest, appears on a billboard on the turnpike with this message: ""No fossil fuels, no electricity. Wake up America!""

Only 4 percent of Pennsylvania's electricity comes from renewable energy. Since 2015, that number has only increased by one percentage point, even as states such as Texas, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota and Maine saw significant gains in renewables.

Pennsylvania now ranks second to last in the country when it comes to the percentage of its electricity generated by renewables, and in 2024, the state ranked 49th for renewable energy growth in the U.S. For utility-level solar, Pennsylvania ranked 41st, supplying just over 1 percent of the state's electricity. For residential solar systems like Robinson's, a separate metric from utility-level power generation, Pennsylvania is a middling 26th.

Pennsylvania's reliance on gas is one of the problems at the root of the state's soaring electric bills, experts say, because it means local consumers pay more whenever global gas prices go up.

In Texas, the only state that produces more gas than Pennsylvania, renewable energy's share of the electric market has grown from 12 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2024. And residential electricity rates in Texas are about 20 percent lower than Pennsylvania's, according to June federal figures.

Electricity prices in Pennsylvania continued to rise in 2025, following a sharp increase over the last few years that has hit Pennsylvania households hard. One reason for the most recent surge: data centers and the stress they are likely to put on the grid. New data centers are expected to drive soaring increases in electricity demand over the next five years, according to forecasts from Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission. To power them, investors want to build even more natural gas power plants.

""We have become over-reliant on gas as a transitional fuel, and we continue to argue that it's a transition, yet we are not transitioning,"" said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. ""We continue to build out our delivery system for gas, and we are locking ratepayers in to pay for that system for 30 more years.""

""Clean Energy Now""

Robinson traces the origins of Pennsylvania's failed promise as a leader in renewables to one big shift over the past 15 years.

""The change in the Republican Party is really the story here,"" she said.

When she first started working in the field, moderate Republicans in Philadelphia's collar counties were passionate advocates for conservation initiatives and open-minded about ideas like green energy. As Tea Party candidates and increasing polarization pushed this older generation of Republicans out of office, the legislature became more partisan, more contentious and less willing to compromise.

""It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There's this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind,"" said Rep. Greg Vitali, a Democrat from suburban Delaware County who has served in the state legislature for more than 30 years and is considered an environmental leader at the capitol. ""It goes beyond an intellectual disagreement.""

Vitali, the chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, said there was effective negotiation and ""give and take"" when the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004. That isn't happening now.

One component of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's Lightning Plan for energy reform is a bill to allow community solar, where customers can buy shares in a solar project even if they can't host panels on their own roofs. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in May, but it's now stuck in the Senate, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Senate since 1994.

Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group, said this state of affairs on renewables doesn't reflect the feelings of the public. ""It's less about what Pennsylvanians want, because we've seen time and time again that when asked, Pennsylvanians like renewable energy. Pennsylvanians love solar,"" she said.

The state legislature's paralysis has effectively ceded leadership of energy policy to other forces, said Mazer, the solar developer. ""We haven't played as much of a role as we could have in deciding what our energy future looks like,"" she said.

There's another kind of energy gridlock at PJM Interconnection, the company that manages the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. When it comes to Pennsylvania's emphasis on natural gas generation, PJM is a significant part of the problem, said David Masur, the executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania that has closely tracked the state's lagging investment in renewable energy.

""There's just hundreds of projects in the queue, and something like 98 percent of them are renewables,"" he said.

PennEnvironment estimated that PJM's backlog of unapproved electricity projects could cost Pennsylvanians $12.5 billion in just one year. In January, after filing a complaint against PJM, Shapiro settled with the operator to stop a rate hike that could have tripled energy prices for Pennsylvanians.

If the system were working the way it's supposed to, more solar and wind projects would have been coming online as their costs drop compared to gas. Instead, PJM's delays have created a bottleneck.

""New competition is being blocked by this outmoded, vastly delayed interconnection system,"" Corby said. ""New energy is not able to come online quickly enough to keep our bills down. PJM needs to move a lot more things through the queue a lot more quickly.""

In a statement to Inside Climate News, a spokesperson for PJM, Jeffrey Shields, said the company has reformed its interconnection process, processing 140 gigawatts of capacity since 2023, with 63 more due to be processed in 2025 and 2026. PJM blames the slowdown on permitting and supply chain backlogs, ""none of which are related to PJM,"" and nationwide trends that are beyond the company's control.

""Electricity supply is decreasing while demand is increasing, primarily from data centers, not only in PJM but across the country,"" Shields said.

On a rainy day in May, protestors stood in front of PJM's headquarters outside Philadelphia. Dressed in rain slickers and clutching umbrellas, the protestors held hand-painted signs reading, ""Clean Energy Now"" and ""PJM, lower our electric bills. Connect clean energy.""

As cars zoomed behind him, state Rep. Chris Rabb spoke to the protesters and members of the press about his bill to increase transparency in PJM's decision-making. Rabb, a Democrat, said he believed his bill could attract bipartisan support, a rare feat in Pennsylvania's split legislature.

""The reason I think this might have some legs is because so many of our constituents–rural, urban, suburban–are struggling to pay their utility bills. And it's only going to get worse if PJM continues to operate in this fashion,"" he said. ""I think it can garner some Republican votes, because they have ratepayers, too, who are not happy about the coming hikes. People are going to be mad as hell, right? They're going to wonder who to blame.""

Powering the Future

Data centers built to power electricity-hungry artificial intelligence technology are projected to consume enormous quantities of power, and in Pennsylvania, gas producers see an opportunity to keep extending the ""bridge.""

At Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick's Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh in July, $90 billion in data center deals between tech companies and natural gas and pipeline companies were announced. These investments could lock in gas as the state's primary electricity generator for another generation.

EQT, a natural gas company headquartered in Pittsburgh, said it would become a partner in a plan to convert the old coal-fired Homer City Generating Station into a 3,200-acre artificial intelligence campus with the country's largest gas-fired power plant.

""This agreement ensures long-term energy security for the data center campus, while demonstrating our commitment to powering the future with Pennsylvania gas,"" Corey Hessen, one of the leaders of the Homer City project, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the costs of drilling for gas are going up. ""There's a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings,"" said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. ""It's getting more and more expensive to drill.""

It's also getting more expensive to build natural gas power plants, said Sean O'Leary, senior researcher in energy and petrochemicals at the Ohio River Valley Institute: ""The cost of building a gas-fired power plant has gone up by about two-and-a-half times.""

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built. Trump's massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

And the premise that the bridge was originally built on–that natural gas made sense as a transition to renewables because it emitted fewer greenhouse gases than other fossil fuels–turns out to be far more complicated than the politicians of the 2010s claimed.

Although it's true that burning natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, evidence is growing that its production and transport damages the earth's atmosphere more than previously thought. Methane is a far more potent driver of global warming than carbon dioxide.

Despite all that, both Corby and Robinson see reasons for hope. One of them is residential solar systems like Robinson's, which are small enough to bypass the clogged PJM queue.

""It can come online incredibly quickly. It also takes much less time to build,"" Corby said. ""That's a really intuitive and easy place to look, where we would see the results quickly.""

More Pennsylvanians are clamoring to install solar panels of their own, especially as electricity prices go up. Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. George Otto, a retiree in State College, said he decided to do so after years of watching Pennsylvania politicians fail to make progress on environmental or climate issues.

""It's like pushing a rope to get those guys to move on any of this stuff. And so I figured, if we're not going to be able to do it through them, then each of us can do what we can within our sphere of influence,"" he said.

While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon form of energy generation, it’s not considered renewable energy since it still relies on uranium as a fuel source.
Kim Reynolds has also noted nuclear energy expansion as one of her priorities in advancing Iowa’s energy systems.

Safer also asserted there is a connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons.","Researchers and environmental advocates said nuclear energy plants, like the Duane Arnold Energy Center that may restart in Linn County, have environmental, health and economic concerns that other renewable energy projects don’t carry.

Speaking at a press conference Monday with the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, researchers from across the country said wind and solar energy projects would be cheaper, come online faster and pose fewer risks to Iowan’s health and the environment than reinvesting in nuclear energy sites.

NextEra Energy, which operated the nuclear facility that began decommissioning in 2020, recently received approval from federal regulators to transfer its grid connection rights from three slated solar projects to the nuclear plant. NextEra is still waiting on several permits and licenses before operations to restart the plant can begin.

Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said in the press conference that solar and wind generation are more cost effective than nuclear, and have lower carbon footprints.

Jacobson said in general, nuclear energy facilities are more costly than wind or solar projects and can take 10 to 20 years to start new projects, while solar and wind infrastructure can be built and online in a fraction of that time.

While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon form of energy generation, it’s not considered renewable energy since it still relies on uranium as a fuel source.

While Duane Arnold would be a restart rather than a from-scratch project, Jacobson said it “just makes no sense to go backwards into an albatross technology like nuclear.”

Bill Orlove, a spokesperson for Duane Arnold Energy Center, said in a statement that the possible restart of the plant would help power “Iowa’s growing economy and to help meet America’s surging power demand.”

Some metrics predict U.S. energy demand could grow as much as 25% by 2030.

Orlove said the plant would contribute 600 megawatts of generation, which fits with the Trump administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.

Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has also noted nuclear energy expansion as one of her priorities in advancing Iowa’s energy systems.

Duane Arnold began operations in Iowa in 1975. Orlove said it “operated safely for decades” and provided “reliable energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.” It remains the only nuclear energy site in Iowa.

Safety concerns

Joseph Mangano, the executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project, a non-profit dedicated to the research of low-level radiation impacts on public health, said proximity to a nuclear power plant can lead to higher rates of cancer, infant mortality and pre-term and low-weight births.

“In a discussion about what to do with Duane Arnold in the future, one thing has been missing, and that is, what is the effect on the health of people living near Duane Arnold,” Mangano said during the press conference.

According to statistics Mangano compiled from the Iowa Cancer Registry, rates of cancer in Linn and Benton counties from 1999-2022 were more than 10% above the state average for infants through 39 years old, while rates prior to 1975 when Duane Arnold began operations, were more than 5% below the state average rates.

Research conducted by Mangano’s organization also found that following the closures of eight nuclear power plants, including Duane Arnold, infant mortality rates declined in the area.

“The key point here is that these are just early statistics … there should be no final decision on the future of Duane Arnold unless these statistics, and additional ones, (are) thoroughly analyzed and thoroughly understood by officials and shared with the public,” Mangano said.

Orlove said nuclear plants have “rigorous monitoring protocols” including radiation monitors, to “ensure the safety of employees and the public.”

“The health and safety of the public is always our top priority,” Orlove said in the statement. “… Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s) oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.”

Don Safer, a small modular reactors specialist and the co-chair of Sierra Club’s Nuclear Free Team, said in the call that additional safety concerns exist in the operation of the plant. Safer said the risk for serious accidents due to aging and disused reactors pose “a huge threat.”

Sierra Club report gives Iowa utilities an F for clean energy plans

“About the Dwayne Arnold reactor: restarting it, I can’t say how much of a mistake it would be, how ambitious it is, and how unlikely that they really will be able to get it going again,” Safer said in the call.

Safer said in addition to the risks of operation, nuclear power plants also generate nuclear waste that has been difficult to find storage for across the country.

Safer also asserted there is a connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons.

“If nuclear power does not exist, nuclear weapons have a lot harder time, even in the United States and the other nuclear weapons countries, of keeping itself going, because that’s not a big enough industry to train people,” Safer said.

Duane Arnold is not the only decommissioned plant that might restart. Other projects in the works include Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania, which would reopen to power Microsoft data centers; Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan and Indian Point Energy Center in New York.

Driving this trend, according to researchers is an increase in government funding toward nuclear energy projects, which while initiated under the Biden administration, was protected in the Republican mega-bill that was enacted in July.

Orlove said restarting the plant is a “serious undertaking.”

“We have a dedicated team working diligently to pull together all the necessary pieces to return Duane Arnold Energy Center to service,” Orlove said. “The plant’s possible restart will bring millions of dollars in revenue to the county, the Cedar Rapids Community School District and other districts to fund critical programs and services for residents. It would also bring hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs to the area.”

Many locals, labor unions and communities welcome the economic benefits anticipated with the plant reopening, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported.

Wally Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s conservation and legal chair, opposed the restart of the plant, which he lives near, and said Iowans “should not let that happen.”

“Nuclear power is not the answer to our 21st century energy needs,” Taylor said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2177851416-2048x1535.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 18:02:25.476583

He recently launched the American Energy Dominance Caucus, aiming to enhance the U.S. role in global energy markets while fostering job creation and economic growth.","OPINION:

I got into this work partly because I know energy policy isn’t just some debate for folks in Washington, D.C. It’s about good-paying jobs for workers in Texas and across the country. It’s about the price you pay at the pump, what it costs to heat or cool your home, and whether your lights stay on when the grid is strained. For families, energy isn’t abstract it’s part of daily life. And right now, our energy security is being threatened.

That recent meeting between Russia, China, and North Korea with our friends in India sitting at the tableshould be a five-alarm fire for all of us. A new team is forming, and they want to be the ones who call the shots on the world’s energy. China, especially, has been playing the long game. For years, they’ve worked to corner the market on the minerals and materials that go into batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy technology. They want the world hooked on their supply chains. If we’re not careful, we’ll be buying our energy future from them and paying whatever price they decide to set.

That’s why I recently sat down with India’s ambassador. We talked about how Texas, and America, can be a partner. Texas has always been an energy powerhouse. We pump oil and gas, but we’re also leading the way in wind and solar. That all-of-the-above mix is exactly what India is looking for. By teaming up, we can sell more American energy abroad, create good-paying jobs here at home, and keep India from getting hooked on China’s supply chains.

But we can’t keep shooting ourselves in the foot. When we slap heavy, across-the-board tariffs on friendly nations like India, we don’t just hurt their industries we make it harder for them to buy from us. That pushes them right into China’s arms. Our trade policies need to be smart and aimed at our real rivals, not our friends. This is a tough fight, and we can’t afford to stumble over our own mistakes.

First, we’ve got to unleash our own energy workers. America produces oil and natural gas cleaner and safer than just about anyone else. Our allies want it, and we’ve got plenty to share. But too often, projects to build pipelines or export terminals get tied up for years in red tape. Every delay is a missed paycheck for American workers and an open door for countries like Russia to sell their fuel instead. Every tanker of American LNG shipped overseas is more money in a Texas worker’s pocket and less money in Putin’s war chest. That’s what energy security really looks like.

Second, we need to double down on invention and production here at home. Nobody in the world can out-innovate America. We’ve got the best scientists, engineers, and builders. Let’s put them to work on the next generation of energy: better batteries, safer nuclear, cleaner fuels, smarter grids. And here’s the key: let’s not just design it here, let’s build it here. That means factories, supply chains, and jobs on American soil. If we keep outsourcing production to China, we’ll never be truly secure. If we build it here, we own our future.

This isn’t about choosing between oil and gas or renewables and nuclear. We need it all. Texas has shown that you don’t have to pick sides we’re leading in oil and gas and in wind and solar. That “all of the above” approach is how we keep energy affordable, reliable, and homegrown.

Being the world’s energy leader puts America in the driver’s seat. It means our workers get steady paychecks, our families get lower bills, and our country is safer because we’re not relying on adversaries for what we need.

At the end of the day, this isn’t rocket science. It’s about letting American workers do what they do best: build, innovate, and win. If we unleash American workers, if we work with our friends instead of punishing them, and if we compete head-on with China, there’s no doubt in my mind that America can stay the world’s energy leader and keep our homes running affordably.

That’s not just good policy. That’s peace of mind for every family that wants a fair shot, steady work, and a secure future.

Despite the federal change, the Mayor and BED are continuing their commitment to the City’s Net Zero Energy goal and electrification strategy by sharing that BED will be boosting EV rebates on the purchase or lease of new EVs to $5,000, and $5,700 for income-qualified customers.

These are increases from the current levels of $2,300 and $3,000, respectively. BED plans to make these boosted incentives available through the end of 2026 or as long as incentive funds remain, whichever comes first.

The funds to be used for the boosted rebates are available through Act 44 of 2023 and Act 142 of 2024 -- State of Vermont legislation that enables BED to utilize a portion of its efficiency funds and Thermal Energy Process Fuel funds to bolster electrification programs.

As part of its 2025 planning, BED had reserved funds to increase EV incentives in the event the federal government ended its support for EVs.

BED also has worked collaboratively with the Vermont Department of Public Service to include support for rental weatherization policy implementation in its updated plan for use of the TEPF funds, which was submitted via letters and updates to the Vermont Public Utility Commission on June 18, 2025, August 14, 2025, and most recently August 29, 2025.

In the last two decades, coal mining in the U.S. has steadily declined due to innovations of renewable energy sources, and public opposition to coal due to the myriad of negative impacts coal production has on public health and the environment.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration delayed compliance of health protections for coal miners, and cut free black lung screenings for miners. The Trump administration has also begun rolling back a number of safeguards that limit toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants.

In response, the Sierra Club issued the following statements:

“Georgia already suffers from some of the highest energy bills in the nation. Propping up these outdated coal plants will do nothing but make those bills even higher and add more pollution to our air and water. Georgia Power cannot be allowed to tie our future to the coal industry of the past. We must fight for affordable, clean energy for all of Georgia,” said Sierra Club Georgia Chapter Director Adrien Webber.

“The Trump administration’s reckless actions announced today will hurt the American people, all to prop up the aging and outdated coal industry,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender. “Coal power is now not only the dirtiest form of electricity, it is one of the most expensive, contributing to the rising cost of Americans’ energy bills.

“Donald Trump’s plan doesn’t just saddle us with higher bills, he wants to lease millions of acres of public lands to mining companies and further slash protections for our clean air and water. Rather than investing in clean, affordable energy to power our country, more coal will increase deadly air pollution, poison our water with harmful heavy metals, and drastically worsen the health of our loved ones.

But it still reported a fall in revenues of more than £500m to £6.5bn, according to accounts filed in Singapore.

Sluggish economic growth and flagging consumer confidence were compounded by one-off issues, the company said, including the strength of the pound against the currencies of economies in Asia, where it sells many of its products.

The bagless vacuum cleaner and hand dryer company also incurred one-off costs associated with a global reorganisation that included about 1,000 job cuts in the UK.

The result was a 47% plunge in pre-tax profit to £561m for 2024.

The company’s chief executive, Hanno Kirner, said 2024 had been a “difficult but necessary year of transformation” for the company. As well as axing staff, Dyson also slashed the annual dividend it pays to the family’s holding company.

The payout to Weybourne Holdings, which also houses the Dyson family’s fast-growing investments in agricultural land and farming, declined from £700m to £200m in 2024.

However, notes attached to the accounts reveal that Dyson has since topped up the payments with £225m of dividends spread over January and February of the current financial year.

Dyson founded the company in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in 1991. While it makes most of its products overseas, it does most of its research, development and design of products in the UK, at the company’s facility in the town.

Amid criticism of his decision to move the company to Singapore, particularly in the light of his vocal support for Brexit, Dyson has previously said that the UK will remain a major research and development hub for the company.

The 78-year-old entrepreneur, is among the largest landowners in the UK after investing heavily in farming and cutting-edge food production, while two of his children, Jacob and Sam, are on the board of Dyson Holdings. All three are described as “permanent residents” of Singapore in corporate filings.

The entrepreneur and his family came fourth in the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated fortune of £20.8bn.

In a statement accompanying the results, Dyson pointed to new products launched in 2024, which include a “complete reinvention of the hairdryer” and a haircare-meets-styling range that uses chitosan, a plant-based polymer from oyster mushrooms.

He said: “We are hugely excited about our launches in 2025 and beyond, which bring significant innovations into people’s homes including new wet and dry floor-cleaning technology, robotic technology and purification technology, as well as complete reinventions of our hairdryer and vacuum cleaner formats.”

Products launched this year include the “slimmest vacuum in the world”, which has a diameter of 38mm.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b182eee3abe3504123d0d755ced281a95296f6/144_0_2917_2333/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e69999a3823a4c2a4e2a03e3c549b455",N,,2025-09-29 20:59:37.648507

September 29, 2025

TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said.

Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”

Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.

Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.

“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.

Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.

“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”

Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.

“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”

Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.

Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.

“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”

Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.

Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.

“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”

Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction.

“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://i0.wp.com/sunflowerstateradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Evergy-Lawrence.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-29 20:02:14.212775

Save up to 40% on energy bills with new heat pumps, one system for heating & cooling, rebates & tax credits make them affordable.

Heat pumps are a year-round smart solution. Our guide explains savings, comfort, environmental benefits, and incentives that make them affordable for homeowners.”

— Charles Schoonmaker

NJ, UNITED STATES, September 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Genuine Heating & Cooling has published a new, easy-to-understand guide for consumers. It explains how new air-source heat pumps can significantly cut down on energy costs. These systems also offer both heating and cooling from one unit. The guide points out that highly efficient heat pumps can lower utility bills by 20–40 percent. This is compared to old oil heaters or electric resistance heaters. This applies to heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18–20+ and Heating Seasonal Performance Factors (HSPF) above 9. These systems can reverse their operation. This means they warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. You won't need separate furnaces and air conditioners anymore.

“Many homeowners still think heat pumps are only for mild weather,” the guide explains. “But new models for cold weather now provide full heating even when it's very cold outside, below –13 °F.” This technology works by moving heat, not by creating it. This makes it much more efficient than burning fuel or using electric coils. Heat pumps run on electricity. In New Jersey, more and more electricity comes from renewable sources. So, heat pumps also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This helps shrink a home’s carbon footprint.

Besides saving energy, the guide shows many life advantages of heat pumps. Modern units run quietly, typically 40–55 decibels outdoors. They don't need oil deliveries or propane tanks. Homeowners might qualify for good financial help. The New Jersey Clean Energy Program gives rebates of up to $2,000 for certain heat pump installations. Federal tax credits cover 30 percent of costs, up to $2,000. The guide also says installation usually takes 1–3 days. This includes a professional calculation of your home's needs, picking the right system, and handling permits.

The costs are clear. Installing a single-zone ductless heat pump can cost $4,000–$7,500. Multi-zone systems for an entire home can range from $10,000–$20,000 or more. Replacing an old furnace and central AC with a ducted heat pump costs about $12,000–$18,000. Prices depend on the system's size, how efficient it is, how many zones you need, and how complex the installation is. However, rebates and tax credits significantly reduce these upfront costs.

Following the Love Canal environmental disaster, the U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act1 (CERCLA), laying the legal groundwork for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate, list, and clean up contaminated sites. In 1986, amendments to the CERCLA, known as the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act2 (SARA), stressed the need for permanent solutions and innovative rehabilitation strategies. Several strategies were implemented (e.g., increased stakeholder participation and improved existing tools) to focus on risks to human health. Over time, the EPA’s approach to Superfund cleanup has evolved across different administrations. The first formal emphasis on EJ dates back to 1994 with Executive Order 12898, which directed federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse environmental and health impacts on minority and low-income populations3. More recently, between 2021 and 2024, a suite of executive orders has required federal agencies to further integrate environmental justice considerations into policy development and implementation4,5,6,7,8,9. For example, Executive Order 140086 in January 2021 led to the development of the EPA’s Environmental Justice Action Plan. Superfund remediation efforts incorporated an environmental justice lens underscored in the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council report10 of May 2021. However, in 2025, Executive Order 1415111 terminated some of these initiatives, including directives to dismantle Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) offices and to eliminate screening tools and datasets developed to support environmental justice and equity efforts. Despite these changes, the underlying environmental inequities faced by vulnerable communities remain persistent. This highlights the critical need for independent, data-driven methodologies to guide equitable cleanup and policymaking, regardless of shifting political priorities.

The environmental injustice implications of Superfund sites have always been at the center of attention and controversial debates. These sites pose substantial health and environmental risks to communities, disproportionately impacting historically underserved and socially vulnerable communities (HUSVCs) who may already face additional systemic challenges. Past studies show significantly higher proportions of Black and minority populations adjacent to Superfund Sites12,13,14. Tract-level analysis of the nation showed that Superfund sites in predominantly Black neighborhoods were less likely to receive National Priority List (NPL) designation15. The U.S. EPA has implemented several initiatives to address and adhere to environmental justice principles. In this context, EPA, along with other federal agencies and state governments, has developed a range of tools to support environmental justice analysis and inform decision-making related to site remediation, risk screening, and community engagement. Notable tools include EJScreen16, EnviroAtlas17, CalEnviroScreen18, MyEnvironment19, and Climate Resilience Screening Index20, among others, to protect human health and prioritize HUSVCs. In its latest strategic plan, the EPA delineates its priorities and outlines a roadmap toward addressing climate change and promoting environmental justice21.

Funding for the remediation of a Superfund site is made smoother if that site is listed on the NPL or through the Superfund Alternative Approach (SAA) program. The NPL is defined as “the list of sites of national priority among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the U.S. and its territories”22. The EPA primarily prioritizes NPL sites for cleanup funding and timeline. A Superfund site is included in the NPL through three primary methods: (i) Receiving a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score of 28.5 or higher, (ii) designation of a site by a state, and (iii) issuance of a public health advisory by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)22. The HRS score is a quantitative risk measure based on a scoring framework that considers several factors, including the likelihood that the site has released or potentially will release hazardous substances, the nature of waste, and the exposed people and the environment. There are several gaps in the calculation of the HRS. First, the cutoff score of 28.5 was originally set to cap the initial NPL list at 400 sites23 but remains the selection threshold today. The efficacy and accuracy of the cutoff score of 28.5 in distinguishing high-priority sites from lower-priority ones in the present context remain unverified24. Second, the HRS does not account for variations in community vulnerabilities and capacities.

Superfund sites not on the NPL may potentially receive funding for cleanup using the SAA. Superfund remediation funding is primarily sourced through four mechanisms: (i) funds provided by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP), who is held liable for the cleanup25; (ii) funds provided by the Superfund when the PRP is unable to pay; (iii) federal appropriations, which contribute to cleanups26; and (iv) state government funding, which may include revenues from the excise tax on chemical manufacturers. It is important to note that listing a site on the NPL or addressing it through the SAA opens a pathway for federal involvement and potential access to cleanup resources. However, this designation does not guarantee immediate or full funding. The process of identifying and securing contributions from potentially responsible parties (PRPs) is often lengthy and legally complex. For sites without viable PRPs, federal funding becomes essential. Although the Superfund tax was reinstated to support such efforts, recent reports indicate that revenues have been lower than expected, and funding for orphan sites remains constrained27. These limitations contribute to delays in remediation and prolonged exposure risks for nearby communities.

Environmental justice concerns also arise in the processes of selecting and remediating Superfund sites. For example, some studies24 highlight that sites with cost-effective remediation measures may be excluded from the NPL, while less cost-effective sites are prioritized for inclusion. This exclusion can delay remediation efforts for certain sites, leaving HUSVCs near these locations exposed to hazardous conditions for prolonged periods. Such disparities underscore the need for more equitable prioritization frameworks that consider the unique vulnerabilities of affected communities, irrespective of their NPL status.

Despite continued efforts over the past few decades, critical gaps remain in current practices regarding a practical and standardized system that enables operationalizing environmental justice for listing and cleaning up Superfund sites while accounting for environmental and socioeconomic metrics. The allocation of an additional $3.5 billion to the Superfund through the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act7 offers an opportunity to clean up more sites. However, while the current screening approaches and scoring systems are comprehensive in assessing environmental risks, they fall short in considering the different capacities of vulnerable populations to cope with the risks they face. Here, we propose integrating environmental justice metrics to facilitate informed decision-making. Such integration can inform decision-making frameworks for enlisting Superfund sites in the NPL by prioritizing sites that directly affect HUSVCs.

We conducted spatial analyses of 13,453 Superfund sites across the U.S. to address the following key questions: (1) To what degree are disadvantaged communities overrepresented in blocks hosting Superfund sites relative to non-host blocks at the same geographical scale? (2) Does the extent of overrepresentation of disadvantaged communities in proximity to Superfund sites vary based on the cleanup status of these sites? (3) How can we integrate environmental justice metrics to provide opportunities for sites that do not have adequate funding (not listed in the NPL), allowing for the equitable distribution of resources? Answers to these questions guide the study toward its primary objective, which is to develop the Action Priority Matrix (APM) to support equitable decision-making for allocating resources for cleanup activities.

We spatially analyzed 1336 sites identified as NPL sites, 439 sub-sites within NPL locations, and 66 sites on the SAA program. In addition, we examined 11,612 sites, which comprised both non-NPL and proposed NPL sites. We classified the sites into two distinct categories. The sites listed in the NPL, part of an NPL site, or part of the SAA program were categorized under “Active cleanup” based on their cleanup status. Sites not included on the NPL or proposed to be on the NPL were classified as “No cleanup.” The categories were established to investigate whether disparities vary based on cleanup status. While acknowledging the potential existence of cleanup protocols at non-NPL sites, it is assumed that NPL sites generally receive a substantial portion of the Superfund’s resources.

The results from our analysis are organized into three principal sections. The initial section delineates the composition of communities residing in Superfund host blocks at the national, regional, and state levels. The second section presents the results of the nationwide disparity analysis, where we estimate the overrepresentation of HUSVCs in Superfund host blocks at national, regional, and state geographical levels. Third, we present our proposed APM to facilitate decision-making for prioritizing cleanup and Superfund resource allocation.

Composition of communities residing in Superfund host sites

An estimated 254 million individuals, constituting nearly 80% of the U.S. population in 2015–2019, resided within a 10 km buffer around at least one Superfund site. Almost 60% of these people (148 million individuals or 45% of the US population) lived in blocks where cleanup activities were lacking. These population estimates were derived using a 50% areal containment method, where a block was included if at least 50% of its area fell within the 10 km buffer surrounding a Superfund site. We compared the sociodemographic and socioeconomic composition of populations residing in host blocks to those in non-host blocks at the EPA regional and national levels. The EPA consists of 10 regions, each responsible for the oversight and execution of the EPA’s programs. The regions with their corresponding states are shown in Fig. 1a.

First, we examined sociodemographic attributes such as Black, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, and AIANNH (American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian) populations. The median population of Black and Hispanic people was consistently higher in Superfund host blocks nationally and across most regions (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Notably, we observed higher medians of the Black population at the national level and in EPA Regions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Similarly, the median of the Hispanic population in host blocks exceeded that of non-host blocks in all regions, with the largest regional difference observed in Region 9. In terms of socioeconomic characteristics, the median proportion of the population with low educational attainment was also higher in Superfund host blocks, particularly in Region 9. Due to data sparsity (i.e., blocks with zero values), comparative analysis for Asian and AIANNH populations was limited in several regions.

We examined the racial composition based on cleanup status, that is, NPL (active cleanup) or non-NPL (no cleanup) blocks. The results (Fig. 1c) show a notably higher mean proportion of AIANNH in blocks lacking cleanup activities. Specifically, in Regions 6, 8, 9, and 10, the proportions are more than twice as high as those of blocks with ongoing cleanup activities. Similarly, the proportion of the Black population was also observed to be higher in blocks without cleanup activities across EPA regions. A similar trend is observed for the Asian population across all EPA regions.

Disparities in the exposure of vulnerable populations

We examined disparities in the exposure of vulnerable populations using two metrics: the percent difference disparity metric (Dp) and the ratio disparity metric (Dr). As explained in the “Methods” section, Dp is defined as the absolute difference in the proportion of a population group (e.g., low-income, racial/ethnic minority) between host blocks and the reference geography (e.g., state, region, or nation), expressed as a percentage (Eq. 1). This metric helps indicate the magnitude of over- or under-representation. The disparity ratio (Dr) is calculated as the ratio of the proportion of a population group in host areas to that in reference to the population (Eq. 2). A ratio greater than 1 indicates overrepresentation, while a ratio less than 1 indicates underrepresentation. While Dp and Dr are often correlated, each offers distinct interpretive value, and we report both throughout the analysis to provide a more nuanced understanding of disparity patterns. Disparities were assessed across three categories: (1) all Superfund sites, (2) NPL sites (active cleanup), and (3) non-NPL sites (no cleanup).

Our findings (Supplementary Tables S2–S6) reveal notable disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of Superfund host communities at both national and regional levels. At the national scale, Asian populations exhibit the greatest overrepresentation around all Superfund sites (Dp = 198.6%, Dr = 2.99), followed by the Black population (Dp = 100%, Dr = 2.00). Moving down to the EPA-region level, disparities for the Black population were even more pronounced in comparison to other racial groups. At this EPA regional level, our findings show a pronounced overrepresentation of the Black population in Region 1 (Dp = 857.5%, Dr = 9.58), Region 5 (Dp = 514.6%, Dr = 6.15), and Region 7 (Dp = 428.8%, Dr = 5.29). Meanwhile, regional disparities were also identified among Asian and Hispanic populations. At the state level, overrepresentation was found again to be highest among the Asian population, Particularly in Massachusetts (Dp = 1029.3%, Dr = 11.29), New Jersey (Dp = 872.9%, Dr = 9.73), New York (Dp = 685.4%, Dr = 7.85), and Oregon (Dp = 455.1%, Dr = 5.55). Some notable state-level disparities include the Black population in Massachusetts (Dp = 950.7%, Dr = 10.51), Connecticut (Dp = 606%, Dr = 7.06), and Nebraska (Dp = 596.3%, Dr = 6.96). Notable disparities were also observed among the Hispanic population.

Focusing only on NPL (active cleanup) sites produces a similar hierarchy. At the national scale, the Asian population (Dp = 267.8%, Dr = 3.68) remains the most overrepresented race/ethnicity group, followed by the Black population (Dp = 112.3%, Dr = 2.12) and Hispanic population (Dp = 68.7%, Dr = 1.69). No disparities were observed for AIANNH populations. Disparities at the EPA regional levels were pronounced for Black and Asian populations. Our findings show a pronounced overrepresentation of Black populations in Region 1 (Dp = 929.8%, Dr = 10.30), Region 7 (Dp = 579.7%, Dr = 6.80), and Region 5 (Dp = 547.4%, Dr = 6.47). Regional disparities among Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations were largest in regions 1 and 2. State-level disparities where most pronounced overrepresentation was found among the Black population in Massachusetts (Dp = 1110.7%, Dr = 12.11), Nebraska (Dp = 983.4%, Dr = 10.83), Connecticut (Dp = 593.7%, Dr = 6.94), and Minnesota (Dp = 583.8%, Dr = 6.84). Some notable state-level disparities include the Asian population in Oregon (Dp = 683.3%, Dr = 7.83), and Utah (Dp = 435.2%, Dr = 5.35), Hispanic population in New York (Dp = 412.4%, Dr = 5.12), and AIANNH population in Indiana (Dp = 95%, Dr = 1.95).

By contrast, non-NPL (no-cleanup) sites reveal a different emphasis: the Asian population are still nationally overrepresented (Dp = 207.9%, Dr = 3.08), yet the most striking regional disparity is for the Black population in Region 1 (Dp = 1269.1%, Dr = 13.69) and the Hispanic population in the same region (Dp = 864.1%, Dr = 9.64). Region 10 is the lone area where the Asian population overrepresentation is not observed.

We illustrated these sociodemographic disparities based on cleanup status (Fig. S2). The scatter plot illustrates the disparity percentage for each geographical region on two axes: NPL (active cleanup) on the x-axis and non-NPL (no cleanup) on the y-axis. The 1:1 line of equality serves as a benchmark for parity; in an ideal scenario, observations would cluster at or near this line, signifying negligible differences between the two cleanup statuses. Deviation from the line, therefore, indicates inequity, with points situated above it revealing regions in which disparities are more pronounced around non-NPL sites, an outcome representing the most acute environmental justice concern. Our results show that most points (geographical regions) cluster well above the diagonal for AIANNH populations. Among the Hispanic population, a majority of points are also above the line but spread more evenly, except for a few points, such as Region 2 and Maryland. Among the Black communities, most points sit below the line of equality except for some notable geographical regions (e.g., South Dakota, Region 10, Wyoming, Kentucky, and Idaho). Finally, for Asian populations, most points cluster along the line of equality.

We also examine the disparities in the representation of populations identified as “disadvantaged” between Superfund host blocks and non-host blocks. Our findings (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables S7–S11) reveal significant disparities in the presence of disadvantaged communities within Superfund host blocks at the state level.

Nationally, the analyses identified no overrepresentation of disadvantaged populations in all Superfund categories. At the EPA regional levels, the disparity (all) was particularly pronounced in Region 4 (Dp = 52.7%, Dr = 1.53) and Region 1 (Dp = 42.6%, Dr = 1.43). Substantial disparities at the state level were found in Nevada (Dp = 251.4%, Dr = 3.51) and Vermont (Dp = 183.1%, Dr = 2.83).

The disparity analysis for NPL (active cleanup) also showed no overrepresentation of disadvantaged populations nationally. At the EPA regional levels, the most significant disparities were found in Region 5 (Dp = 55.3%, Dr = 1.55), followed by Region 2 (Dp = 50%, Dr = 1.50) and Region 9 (Dp = 37.5%, Dr = 1.38). Notable state-level disparities for this category were found in Maryland (Dp = 241.1%, Dr = 3.41), Vermont (Dp = 214.3%, Dr = 3.14), Nebraska (Dp = 166.8%, Dr = 2.67), Indiana (Dp = 146.5%, Dr = 2.47), and South Dakota (Dp = 102.4%, Dr = 2.02).

Lastly, disparity analysis for non-NPL (no cleanup) was performed. At the national level, the disadvantaged population was overrepresented by 5.8% (Dp = 5.8%, Dr = 1.06). Notable disparities at the regional level were found in Region 5 (Dp = 59.2%, Dr = 1.59), followed by Region 9 (Dp = 19.1%, Dr = 1.19), and Region 7 (Dp = 10.8%, Dr = 1.11). The largest state-level disparities were found in Nevada (Dp = 251.4%, Dr = 3.51) and Minnesota (Dp = 137%, Dr = 2.37).

Proposed action priority matrix (APM) for allocation of cleanup resources

We adopted the Eisenhower (importance-urgency) matrix to develop a multi-attribute APM (Fig. 3) that incorporates environmental justice into decision-making for Superfund site cleanup. Madani28,29 proposed using this matrix for public policy agenda setting and identifying the most prioritized policy actions and interventions with respect to the resource (e.g., financial, time, political capital, public support) limitations in the real world. By considering the disproportionate risk that disadvantaged communities are facing, our proposed APM facilitates a more equitable agenda-setting regarding the cleanup of Superfund sites. Each geographic unit (e.g., state, region) is placed into one of the four distinct cleanup classes based on the Superfund Exposure Score (SES) it receives and disparity, i.e., the degree of the overrepresentation of disadvantaged populations in blocks with Superfund sites relative to those without Superfund sites at the same geographical scale (disparity). These classes are as follows (Fig. 3): (1) balanced cleanup (Low-Low: low superfund exposure score and low disparity percentage), (2) focused cleanup (Low-High), (3) broad-based cleanup (High-Low), and (4) urgent cleanup (High-High). The quadrant boundaries are designed to be dynamic to ensure the cleanup strategy is adaptive, responding to the nuanced differences across geographical units. This flexibility allows policymakers to calibrate the matrix based on the scale of analyses, the level of resources available, and the socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics of the targeted geographic scale and community engagement. Considering these factors in delineating quadrant boundaries allows for targeted strategies for cleanup. Several studies from a wide range of sciences, including geography, health, and climate adaptation, have adopted the Eisenhower matrix, specifying their own approaches to dividing quadrants, providing decision-makers with a framework to effectively prioritize tasks30,31,32,33,34. In this study, states are included within the matrix as an initial step to present an overarching framework. However, for targeted actions, it is essential to conduct the analyses at a higher resolution (i.e., county level) by recalculating both SESs and disparity percentage accordingly. Including counties within the matrix allows for more granular assessments that may be utilized to ensure resources are allocated to local areas where Superfund site cleanup is needed most.

In addition, we propose action items for each classification within our matrix at the local, corporate, academic, and federal levels (Table 1). This multi-level approach is designed to emphasize the importance of engaging multiple actors in addressing environmental justice concerns in Superfund remediation. While we highlight the potential value of collaboration, we acknowledge that Superfund cleanups are frequently marked by stakeholder conflict and competing priorities. As case study research has shown31, PRPs often have financial incentives to contest liability, delay remedial action, or challenge stringent cleanup standards, which can limit the speed and scope of remediation. Despite these constraints, the action items in our matrix are intended to provide a structured starting point for discussion and policy coordination, even in settings where consensus is difficult to achieve. Geographical regions in the urgent cleanup quadrant require the highest level of prioritization within the APM. At the local level, once the EPA investigation reports are disseminated to the state and communities, the CERCLA mandates an opportunity for public participation, particularly in the planning and selection of remedial actions35. In addition, state and local government officials are encouraged to bolster preparedness and provide venues for education to ensure informed feedback. Finally, two-way communication should be established, and education on contaminants and remediation methods should be provided through partnerships with different organizations. Specifically, partnerships between researchers and community members can enhance the effectiveness of educational workshops and support community-driven research. At the corporate level, private companies in charge of remediation should be incentivized to hire locally. Finally, at the federal level, transparency should be a primary focus to share progress regarding cleanup efforts and streamline funding and permitting processes.

In the analysis, we defined the boundaries of the quadrants based on the national medians of the disparity percentage (59.7%) and the SES (0.74%). Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between disparity percentage and SESs aggregated at the state level across the U.S. The findings reveal seven states within the urgent cleanup quadrant. Among these, Nevada (SES = 0.82, Dp = 251.4%), Maryland (SES = 0.84, Dp = 141.1%), Illinois (SES = 0.87, Dp = 71.7%), and Indiana (SES = 0.80, Dp = 73.5%) yield the highest disparity percentage and SESs. These high SES values reflect the extensive presence of Superfund sites near population centers. New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana were found to be the most populous states within this quadrant. The same states were found to be home to a substantial proportion of the disadvantaged population in Superfund host blocks. Our results suggest that prioritizing sites in these states could help address racial disparities through the equitable allocation of resources. For instance, in Nevada, the total population characterized as disadvantaged is approximately 1 million individuals, or 30.6% of Nevada’s population. In Maryland, approximately 0.9 million individuals, or 14.4% of Maryland’s population, are identified as disadvantaged. New Jersey yields a disadvantaged population of 2.1 million, constituting 22.1% of New Jersey’s population.

Within the focused cleanup group, Vermont (SES = 0.41, Dp = 182.1%) yields the highest disparity percentage and SESs. However, the disadvantaged population within 10 km of a Superfund site in this state was relatively low, with 0.09 million individuals. Wisconsin and Iowa emerged as the most populous states within this quadrant, home to 0.94 million (16.2% of Wisconsin’s population) and 0.49 million (15.6% of Iowa’s population) disadvantaged individuals, respectively.

States that fall within the Broad-based Cleanup quadrant exhibit high SES but lower Dp. This combination suggests that while disadvantaged populations may not be disproportionately affected in relative terms, a significant segment of the overall population, including both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged groups, is exposed to potential environmental hazards. These are states where exposure is widespread and systemic, requiring broad, coordinated, and sustained intervention strategies. For example, California, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire all fall within this category. California has an SES of 0.89 and a Dp of 7.1%, while Florida has an SES of 0.82 and a Dp of 29.2%. These states also have some of the largest absolute numbers of disadvantaged individuals living near these sites: 14.7 million people in California, which represents 37.4% of the state’s population, and 8.4 million in Florida, accounting for 40% of its population. Although the relative disparities may be moderate or low, the scale of exposure highlights the urgency of broad-based action. States in this quadrant would benefit from strategies that combine technical cleanup with inclusive engagement and education. Expanding voluntary cleanup programs and providing incentives for local governments and private stakeholders to take proactive roles can accelerate progress. Incorporating environmental justice education into public school curricula can raise awareness and foster long-term advocacy. Enhancing local emergency preparedness efforts is crucial, particularly in regions where Superfund sites are vulnerable to additional risks from natural hazards, such as flooding or wildfires. Transparent, accessible communication platforms can help ensure that affected residents are kept informed and involved throughout the remediation process. Public-private-academic partnerships may also be especially valuable in these states, where scale and complexity demand both technical expertise and grassroots collaboration.

In contrast, the Balanced Cleanup quadrant comprises states with both low SES and low DP values. This indicates relatively minimal exposure and low disparity. States like Montana (SES = 0.57, Dp = 0), Arkansas (SES = 0.35, Dp = 0), and Wyoming (SES = 0.42, Dp = 0) fall within this group. Although these states may not face immediate or severe environmental justice challenges related to Superfund sites, it is critical that this does not lead to complacency. These areas can take proactive steps to preserve environmental quality and promote long-term community resilience. Recommended actions in these states include maintaining robust environmental monitoring systems to detect any emerging risks. Proactive outreach and community engagement, despite the current low levels of exposure, can foster awareness and build trust, laying the groundwork for rapid response if future issues arise. Supporting community-led initiatives, such as citizen science programs or local advisory committees, can strengthen local capacity and foster environmental stewardship. Finally, these states should work to integrate Superfund site information into broader planning efforts, such as climate resilience strategies or hazard mitigation plans, to ensure long-term sustainability and equity.

The disproportionate exposure of HUSVCs to Superfund sites is often the result of a combination of historical, social, economic, and political factors. These factors include historical discrimination and segregation practices such as redlining and discriminatory zoning laws that have systematically pushed HUSVCs to less desirable areas, often in proximity to Superfund sites36. The limited economic capacities of members of HUSVCs often restrict their housing options, reducing their ability to relocate and increasing their likelihood of residing in areas with low property values37. In addition, members of HUSVCs often lack the political power and representation necessary to influence decision-making processes. Although many Superfund sites originated from historical leaks, spills, or illegal dumping that predated modern hazardous-waste siting regulations, these legacy releases continue to have long-lasting impacts on surrounding communities.

Our study aimed to develop an APM that provides a robust and practical basis for equitable decision-making in allocating resources for cleanup activities. We propose that the initial step towards equitable distribution of resources for Superfund site remediation involves identifying HUSVCs that may benefit the most from cleanup activities. To achieve this goal, we calculated disparity percentages and SESs to position U.S. states within our matrix.

We not only highlight the prevalent environmental justice issues but also underscore the need for an equitable approach to resource allocation for remediation. The development of the APM, as proposed in the study, is a step toward advancing such an approach. From the findings of this study and similar studies, we raise a critical question: why has the overrepresentation of AIANNH, Black, and disadvantaged populations’ proximity to Superfund sites remained unaddressed in resource allocation? Traditional approaches, where NPL designation determines funding allocation, are insufficient in addressing challenges faced by HUSVCs. The APM we propose here offers a practical mechanism for addressing these existing issues by integrating environmental justice and equity attributes. We provide an equity-based tool for the just and equitable allocation of resources for Superfund remediation.

The study’s findings can inform a wide range of policies aimed at preventing future forms of inequity. For instance, our study findings can enhance the effectiveness of several EPA equity priority actions38 by providing data-driven insights that can inform decision-making. By integrating the disparity percentage and superfund saturation scores, agencies can better assess community impacts, target capacity-building efforts, and engage with HUSVCs more effectively. Additionally, our metrics can inform civil rights compliance and strengthen community science initiatives.

The findings from this study provide actionable insights for developing policies aimed at reducing environmental inequities. Agencies could utilize the metrics along with the APM proposed in this study to design policies that identify and prioritize communities disproportionately burdened by Superfund sites. These metrics and APM could be used to determine areas requiring immediate remediation or to inform preventive measures that address systemic disparities. This data could be integral in shaping equitable resource allocation strategies within federal programs, including Justice40, as well as at the state and local levels.

In addition to policy development, the findings can enhance decision-making processes for entities involved in NPL listing and remediation. By integrating the disparity percentage and SES into resource allocation frameworks, agencies can ensure remediation efforts are directed toward communities with the greatest need, based on both environmental and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Our metrics can also facilitate the development of new HRS scores that are scaled for the varying vulnerabilities and capacities of communities. Adjustments to the existing HRS scores could incorporate these metrics to better reflect cumulative impacts and the unique challenges faced by underserved communities. Practical implementation could involve the development of geospatial tools or dashboards that visualize these metrics, thereby supporting transparent and equitable decision-making.

The results also provide a framework for equity-focused community engagement. By leveraging these metrics and the APM, agencies can better align their capacity-building efforts and funding with the specific needs of disadvantaged communities. For instance, targeted outreach programs could involve HUSVCs in the decision-making process, empowering them to advocate for their priorities. Strengthening partnerships with local organizations and stakeholders would ensure that interventions are both culturally sensitive and community-informed, fostering trust and collaboration between communities and agencies.

Beyond their immediate application to Superfund remediation, these metrics and the APM have broader implications for addressing systemic environmental justice issues. These metrics and the APM could inform climate adaptation strategies, helping to address the cumulative impacts of environmental hazards and climate change in disadvantaged communities. They may also advance civil rights compliance by identifying areas where potential systemic discrimination exists and supporting the development of targeted strategies to address inequities in environmental decision-making.

Applying the proposed APM could lead to several measurable outcomes for HUSVCs. By identifying areas with the most pressing needs for Superfund remediation, the matrix can potentially mitigate health disparities resulting from prolonged exposure to hazardous substances. It can inform strategies to address the cumulative impacts of climate change, particularly in communities already facing vulnerabilities due to their proximity to Superfund sites. The matrix also supports targeted resource allocation, enabling decision-makers to prioritize interventions that provide the greatest benefit to disadvantaged populations.

Future research should address the practical challenges of implementing the APM, including the complexities of intergovernmental coordination necessary for Superfund remediation on Tribal lands. These challenges encompass jurisdictional conflicts, cultural considerations, and resource constraints, which require a nuanced understanding and collaborative approaches to overcome. We recommend future research to refine the APM for site-by-site decision-making, enabling more precise prioritization at finer spatial scales. This approach could enhance its utility for addressing localized disparities and tailoring remediation strategies to specific community needs. Further studies should also explore barriers to implementation, such as logistical, institutional, and policy-level constraints, and identify strategies to overcome them.

Although our results are informative, they are not without limitations. The presence of military bases among Superfund sites potentially complicates substantive interpretations of our results becuase the active-duty military population and civilian population in a given area may differ with respect to their demographic attributes. Our analyses do not consider the spatial distribution of Superfund sites, which could be located away from population centers, and our results may be sensitive to the buffer distance used in the study. To maximize consistency with the measurement approach used in EJScreen, we applied a 10 km buffer distance in our analysis. Future research should assess the sensitivity of our results, which are based on high-quality publicly available data sources, when alternative buffer distances are applied. However, it is important to note that the consistency between our results and those found in previous studies suggests that our substantive results would be robust to alternative buffer distance specifications.

Input data

The 2015–2019 American Community Survey (ACS) data was used to examine demographic compositions at the Census block group geographical level. In this study, “blocks” will be used as a shorthand throughout the paper to refer to Census block groups. Census data extracted from the ACS includes the proportion of the population in each respective block that is non-Hispanic Black (Black), non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians (AIANNH), non-Hispanic Asian (Asian), Hispanic (any race) (Hispanic), low-income (personal income 200% below the federal poverty threshold in the last 12 months), and without a high school education (persons ages 25+ without a high school diploma). Here, we consider racial minority groups, including Blacks, Asians, Hispanics (any race), and AIANNH, as HUSVCs. The HUSVC indicators align with those used in previous literature. They are available via various screening tools used to assess social vulnerability, such as the Social Vulnerability Index by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention39. The analysis included a total of 217,289 blocks within the contiguous U.S.

In addition to census data, we employed the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)40 to identify “disadvantaged communities”. This tool assesses regions nationwide, evaluating significant burdens across categories, including climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, wastewater, and workforce development. The CEJST employs a ranking system based on percentile thresholds, where the 90th percentile is a cutoff for most burdens. According to the CEJST, a census tract is designated “disadvantaged” if it meets one of the following criteria: (1) resides in a tract that surpasses thresholds for at least one burden, or (2) is in land within federally recognized tribal boundaries. CEJST employs a ranking system based on percentage thresholds to identify disadvantaged communities. Specifically, communities are considered disadvantaged if they are located in a census tract that meets the thresholds for at least one of the tool’s categories of burden. The threshold is typically set at the 90th percentile for most burdens, meaning the top 10% of census tracts for each burden are designated as disadvantaged. Each category of burden in the CEJST tool (e.g., air pollution, water pollution, energy burden) has its own distinct threshold criteria based on available data. For example, in the case of air pollution, the threshold is based on the 90th percentile of particulate matter concentration in census tracts. For energy burden, it is the top 10% of census tracts with the highest percentage of household income spent on energy costs. The CEJST disadvantaged designation is assigned at the census tract level. To apply this designation at a more granular level, we assumed that all blocks within a disadvantaged Census tract are considered disadvantaged. While this assumption introduces some generalization, it enables a meaningful comparison and spatial overlay between social disadvantage indicators and the exposure-based metrics used in APM. Moreover, communities located within federally recognized tribal boundaries are automatically designated as disadvantaged, regardless of whether they surpass the thresholds for individual burdens. While these automatic designations are aligned with federal priorities and commitments, it is important to consider the potential implications of bias within the analysis. Automatically designating tribal lands as disadvantaged could result in skewing results by inflating the representation of burdens or masking heterogeneity within tribal lands. For instance, some tribal areas may not meet the same burden thresholds as other disadvantaged tracts but are still included in the analysis due to the automatic designation. Moreover, a study argues that current federal screening tools, including CEJST, often fail to capture Indigenous-specific environmental justice concerns adequately41. Conversely, the automatic designation does not differentiate between levels of burden among tribal lands, potentially obscuring areas that require greater intervention. Nevertheless, this automatic designation is a recognition of systemic inequities faced by tribal lands.

Data on active Superfund sites in 2023 was sourced from the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) Database42, an official repository of Superfund site data. The SEMS database consists of the locations of all sites, given by either their address or latitude and longitude. They were geocoded based on available addresses using Geocodio43 for sites consisting of only addresses. The generated corresponding coordinates were then plotted onto a map using the XY table-to-point tool in ArcGIS Pro (version 3.1.3). From the database, we analyzed a total of 13,453 sites consisting of 1,336 sites identified as NPL sites, 439 as sub-sites within NPL locations, 66 sites on the SAA program, and 11,612 sites, which comprised both non-NPL and proposed NPL sites.

Host block selection

Three distance-based approaches are widely used in environmental justice scholarship to approximate the number of people living in close proximity to environmental burdens. These include (i) the 50% areal containment method, (ii) the Boundary intersection method, and (iii) the areal apportionment method37,44,45. These methods use the locations of facilities to assess the sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics of all geographical units within a uniform specified distance. However, each method has its own limitations. In this study, we apply the 50% areal containment method to classify blocks as either a host or a non-host (Fig. S1). Specifically, blocks in which at least 50% of the area is intersected within a 10 km buffer are designated as hosts. While the selection of buffer distances is inherently subjective, we use a 10 km radius, aligning with the proximity scoring approach used by EPA’s EJScreen 14. All spatial analyses were performed using ArcGIS Pro (version 3.1.3).

Disparity analysis

We analyzed block-level data for superfund host blocks at the state, EPA regional, and national levels and compared them with non-host blocks on the same geographical scales. We used EPA regional levels in our analyses to inform the EPA regional offices regarding disparities found in their respective regions.

The disparity percentage calculations used in the study are consistent with the method previously employed by Vahedifard et al.46. In our analyses, the disparity percentage (Dp) represents, in percentage terms, the extent to which each vulnerable group of interest is disproportionately overrepresented in host blocks relative to non-host blocks within the same geographical scale. For instance, to calculate the disparity of the disadvantaged population in State A, we use the following equation:

$${D}_{p}(\%)={\left[\frac{\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,\left({{\rm{host}}}\right)-\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,({{\rm{non}}}-{{\rm{host}}})}{\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,({{\rm{non}}}-{{\rm{host}}})}\right]}_{{{\rm{State}}}\; {{\rm{A}}}} \times 100$$

(1)

Equation 1 quantifies the disparity in disadvantaged population proportion between host and non-host blocks, within a specific state (State A). The disparity is calculated by dividing the difference in the percentage of the population in the host that is disadvantaged and the percentage of the population in the non-host that is disadvantaged within a given state (State A) by the percentage in the non-host that is disadvantaged within the same state. This approach was used to calculate Dp at each geographical level used in the study. Here, we calculate the disparity for two additional categories of Superfund sites. Disparities for blocks hosting NPL sites relative to non-host blocks (Active cleanup) and disparity for blocks hosting non-NPL sites to non-host blocks (No cleanup).

In addition to quantifying percentage differences between host and non-host blocks, we also calculate a disparity ratio. This ratio compares the percentage of a population in host blocks to the percentage in non-host blocks within a given geographical region, as defined by:

$${D}_{r}={\left[\frac{\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,\left({{\rm{host}}}\right)}{\%{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,({{\rm{non}}}-{{\rm{host}}})}\right]}_{{{\rm{State}}}\; {{\rm{A}}}}$$

Superfund exposure score

The study introduces the SES, a metric designed to assess the proportion of the population in a given geographical region that resides within the combined buffer zones when multiple Superfund sites are present. A higher SES indicates a great level of exposure for the population relative to the total population of the region, thereby providing an equitable measure to compare regions with potentially heightened exposure. The SES for state A is calculated using the following equation:

The EIA attributed the decline to rising mining costs, increasingly strict environmental regulations and competition from other sources of electric power generation.
As part of Monday’s announcement, the EPA proposed a rule to give coal-fired power plants extended deadlines to comply with environmental guidelines for mercury emissions.","WASHINGTON — More than 13 million acres of federal land is open for coal leasing, the Interior Department announced Monday as part of a coordinated effort with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department to increase the domestic production and use of a fuel source that’s been declining in the U.S. for years.

The amount of land the Interior Department made available for coal extraction is triple the amount called for in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July.

Trump has long prized coal as “beautiful,” “clean” and “abundant” despite much of the world moving away from the fossil fuel in favor of cleaner sources of energy such as natural gas, wind and solar. In April, he signed four executive orders — to end the moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining imposed during the Biden administration, to exempt some coal plants from various emissions standards, to legally challenge state laws obstructing energy production and to promote coal's use as a power source for artificial intelligence data centers.

According to the International Energy Agency, coal power plants generate 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and are the largest single source.

“President Trump promised to put American energy workers first, and today we’re delivering,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement Monday, in which he also announced a reduction in the royalty rate coal producers have to pay for mining operations along with a plan to recover mining waste infused with critical minerals.

In accordance with the tax and spending bill the president signed over the summer, the royalty rate for coal producers dropped to 7% from the previous rates of 12.5% for surface-mined coal and 8% for underground coal. The Interior Department is also working with the U.S. Geological Survey to map mine waste and speed up projects that could help recover critical minerals like uranium, zinc and tellurium, which are used in defense technologies and manufacturing.

“We are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,” Burgum said.

Environmental groups immediately decried the federal agencies’ moves.

“The Trump administration’s reckless actions announced today will hurt the American people, all to prop up the aging and outdated coal industry,” Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender said in a statement Monday, shortly after the Trump administration’s coal announcement.

“Rather than investing in clean, affordable energy to power our country, more coal will increase deadly air pollution, poison our water with harmful heavy metals and drastically worsen the health of our loved ones,” she said. “If this dangerous agenda continues to advance, years from now we will look around at failing health outcomes, skyrocketing bills and a decaying environment, and there will be one man to blame: Donald Trump and his Republican enablers.”

Intended to strengthen domestic supply chains and increase the production of American energy, the expansion of federal lands for coal mining was announced Monday during a meeting of the National Energy Dominance Council, where the EPA and Energy Department also announced actions to spur coal's production and use as an electricity source.

The Energy Department announced it will invest $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate America's coal industry,” according to a press statement. Of that, $350 million will go toward recommissioning and retrofitting coal-powered electricity plants.

An analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Administration earlier this year found U.S. coal production in 2023 was less than half of what it was in 2008. The EIA attributed the decline to rising mining costs, increasingly strict environmental regulations and competition from other sources of electric power generation.

As part of Monday’s announcement, the EPA proposed a rule to give coal-fired power plants extended deadlines to comply with environmental guidelines for mercury emissions. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin also announced he is requesting information on compliance viability, saying meeting environmental rules established during President Joe Biden’s administration to control wastewater pollution might disincentivize the use of coal.

The proposals reverse several rules the EPA finalized last year when Biden was in office, including the requirement that existing coal-fired plants reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2032. In 2024, the agency had also strengthened its rules for coal-fired power plants to reduce toxic metal emissions and to reduce wastewater discharge pollutants such as coal ash that could leak into groundwater.

The EPA said its proposals would save Americans $200 million annually in electricity costs.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, energy prices are rising at double the rate of inflation. The most recent Consumer Price Index found electricity prices had risen 6.2% in August compared with a year earlier, whereas overall inflation was up 2.9% over the same period.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/coal_mine_expansion,N,,2025-09-29 17:02:01.907789

30%: BYD Brings A Familiar Playbook To Japan

BYD Mount Fuji

The people of Japan have very specific tastes when it comes to cars. Small-engined kei cars rule the day, and due to persistent challenges around natural resources and power generation, plug-in cars have never really caught on over there. And when buyers go ""foreign,"" they go with premium luxury brands, usually European ones.

But compact size, fuel economy, affordability and reliability rule the day, and few outsider brands have been able to meet those needs. And most EVs you see there are overwhelmingly Teslas, punctuated by the occasional Nissan Leaf. (I've been to the country twice, and I've never once seen a domestic-market Toyota bZ4X, for example.)

The thinking was that if any EV or plug-in hybrid newcomer could break into Japan, it'd be BYD. But Bloomberg's progress report on BYD's two years of sales in that country indicates things aren't going so hot. So now, BYD is pulling a familiar move to drive up sales: fire-sale price cuts.

The automaker sold just 5,300 vehicles between January 2023 and June this year despite opening its 45th sales location in Japan, introducing a fourth EV model and touting plans to debut an electric ‘kei’ car in late 2026.

The moves have done little to ignite demand and BYD is now turning to discounts—a practice that’s put it front and center of an industry crackdown in China—to try and boost sales. The company is offering discounts of up to ¥1 million ($6,700) that, in addition to government subsidies, can slash sticker prices by as much as 50%. Its Atto 3 retails for just under ¥4.2 million.

It has a decent little lineup there: the Sealion 7 and Atto 3 crossovers, the Seal sport sedan and the Dolphin compact. But the upcoming kei car-sized EV will certainly be the missing piece. And even then, it's hard to say if BYD can pull people away from their proven Hondas, Daihatsus and Suzukis.

But then again, the Japanese new car market is relatively small. About 4.5 million new cars were sold there last year, compared to about 16 million in the U.S. So why does BYD care so much?

According to that story, it's about sending a message:

“Winning Japan isn’t the point; leaving a mark is. Earning even a sliver of recognition from the most demanding customers in the world matters for BYD,” [Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida] said. “What they really want is to have a track record of doing business in Japan with the world’s most discerning, quality-conscious customers, even if it’s not economically rational.”

This isn't just about sales, in other words. It's about BYD's rise in the world, wanting to be taken seriously as a global giant on par with General Motors and Toyota and the Volkswagen Group. (This is also why I think U.S. sales of Chinese cars are inevitable, and will probably be led by BYD.)

But as that story points out, the price-slashing carries serious risks. It hurts resale values and profits, as well as dealers and suppliers. The Chinese government has had to crack down hard on those practices. BYD may move the needle in Japan a bit by doing this, but the costs of doing so are abundantly clear.

60%: Why Car Sales Are An Economic Warning In America

I had a professor in college, a longtime former Wall Street Journal editor, who said that cars and houses are a good barometer for any economy. If people aren't buying cars and they aren't buying houses, your economy is kind of cooked.

The third quarter of 2025 ends in a few days and car sales look to be strong during that period. Scores of buyers rushed out to seize the EV tax credit while they could, while others took advantage of other aggressive deals on new cars of all sorts.

But I'm not alone in wondering what happens in Q4, when those deals are gone, and buyers are left with average new car prices hovering around $50,000 still. Here's the Wall Street Journal with more:

CarMax, the biggest seller of used cars, said Thursday that its sales and profit plunged in the latest quarter. The company’s results, which sent its stock tumbling 20%, is the latest in a series of unsettling developments in an industry under strain from President Trump’s tariffs and carmakers’ recalibration of expensive electrification strategies.

“The consumer has been distressed for a little while. I think there’s some angst,” CarMax Chief Executive Bill Nash told analysts on a call Thursday. Consumers with better credit profiles “seem to be sitting on the sidelines,” Nash said.

Ford said this week it was offering lower interest rates to buyers with the weakest acceptable credit histories as it tries to unload unsold F-150 pickups, its bestselling model. Honda said it was scrapping an electric Acura SUV after just one model year. Other brands are offering steep discounts on EVs to capture buyers before a federal tax credit expires next week.

The EV sales surge driven by the end of the tax credit, the WSJ writes, is ""masking weakness in the overall market."" But tariffs, still-high interest rates, general uncertainty and high prices across the board may portend bigger issues than we all yet realize.

90%: Mercedes Develops Low-Carbon Aluminum

It might be back to gas here in America, but automakers are under the gun in Europe to cut their carbon footprints and go net-zero emissions in the coming decades. That doesn't just mean zero-emission cars—it means cutting the CO2 output through the entire supply chain. (We have more about that this week on InsideEVs, too.)

Here's a cool development from Mercedes-Benz, via Reuters:

Aluminium made with renewable power and from recycling is helping luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz cut CO2 emissions in the production of its new line of electric vehicles, part of a wider effort to decarbonise operations, executives told Reuters. Mercedes uses the low-carbon aluminium, developed in partnership with Norwegian metals producer Norsk Hydro, opens new tab, to make its new electric CLA model.

The collaboration is an example of how makers of premium consumer products may pay extra for raw materials in return for a more environmentally friendly profile, executives of both companies said.

""There are, of course, extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium,"" said Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of Mercedes-Benz's procurement and supplier quality. ""Sustainability and desirable products, such as the ones we produce, simply go hand in hand,"" he said.

While these technologies do represent a cost premium at the outset, they are expected to decline in price over time.

I do think that in many cases, buyers in America went for EVs because that's where the best deals were, and not so much because of their desire to break up with gasoline. (Realizing those benefits usually comes later.) So what happens in Q4 if the tax credits are gone, fewer EV models are on sale and deals on cars of all sorts are harder to find? Or maybe automakers will keep incentives strong through the end of the year, and the ""real"" results will be seen in January 2026.

The Evolving Global Landscape of Nuclear Security

Lauren Sukin and Rohan Mukherjee

This roundtable examines sources of change in the rapidly evolving global nuclear order. Quantitative expansion combines with qualitative doctrinal changes to challenge traditional deterrence frameworks. Emerging security arrangements such as AUKUS, the Washington Declaration, and expanded NATO–Indo-Pacific ties illustrate evolving alliance strategies, while adversarial cooperation among Russia, China, and North Korea heightens risks of coordinated nuclear coercion. Across democratic and authoritarian systems alike, domestic politics increasingly influence nuclear decision-making, shaping perceptions of credibility, creating proliferation pressures, and dampening arms control prospects. Essays in this collection analyze six regional loci—Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, China, and the Korean Peninsula—highlighting two themes: the centrality of domestic political drivers and the cascading effects of nuclear dynamics across interconnected states and regions. Together, this analysis offers a two-level framework for understanding and addressing the complex challenges confronting today’s nuclear order.

The past decade has witnessed a rapid and complex transformation in the global nuclear security landscape, driven by both quantitative and qualitative changes in nuclear capabilities, doctrines, and strategic alliances. The expansion of nuclear arsenals, shifts in deterrence strategies, and the increasing entanglement of domestic politics with nuclear decision-making have collectively reshaped the foundations of the nuclear order. China’s significant nuclear buildup and North Korea’s continued advancement in missile and warhead technology exemplify the quantitative expansion of nuclear capabilities. Meanwhile, evolving doctrines—such as India’s and Pakistan’s shifting nuclear postures and Russia’s persistent nuclear threats in the context of the Ukraine conflict—illustrate qualitative changes that challenge long-standing assumptions about strategic stability.

Traditional extended deterrence dynamics are being redefined. The Trump administration’s antipathy toward alliance commitments, coupled with a broader shift in US global engagement, have raised concerns about the credibility of American security guarantees across the world. While these developments have the potential to unravel long-standing ties, several nascent relationships centered on deterrence are emerging to face the next nuclear challenges. The AUKUS pact, initially involving Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and now incorporating France, signals an evolving security framework in the Indo-Pacific. Similarly, the Washington Declaration between the United States and South Korea and the formation of a US–Japan–South Korea Trilateral Secretariat reflect growing efforts to reinforce deterrence against North Korea, while NATO’s increased coordination with Indo-Pacific partners suggests an expanding strategic footprint and common recognition of China as a threat. The durability and effectiveness of these arrangements, however, remain uncertain as global nuclear competition intensifies.

Adversarial nuclear cooperation has also become a defining feature of this emerging nuclear era. The strategic alignment of Russia, China, and North Korea—evidenced by military coordination, arms transfers, and political signaling—raises concerns about the possibility of simultaneous regional crises or coordinated nuclear coercion. Whether through explicit collaboration or parallel actions, these states’ nuclear strategies increasingly challenge the US-led security architecture.

This evolving multipolar nuclear environment underscores the need for a reassessment of existing deterrence frameworks and strategies. In this issue of the Texas National Security Review, we offer a collection of essays that reflects on the ongoing political and strategic changes in these increasingly interconnected nuclear environments.

Beyond broader geopolitical shifts, domestic political factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in shaping nuclear policy. In democratic societies, public opinion and political polarization can both shape the nuclear future. Divided discourse in the United States on arms control with Iran or extended deterrence to Europe show how US credibility can be undercut by domestic politics. In South Korea, Poland, and elsewhere, tenacious public support for nuclear proliferation and nuclear sharing have already begun to raise questions about these countries’ nuclear futures. Meanwhile, in Sweden and Finland, domestic debates between nuclear deterrence and disarmament played a role in these states’ recent accession to NATO.

Authoritarian states also factor domestic drivers into their nuclear decision-making. In China, the centralization of power under Xi Jinping has led to a nuclear policy increasingly shaped by internal political priorities, raising questions about future arms control prospects. In Russia, Vladimir Putin’s historical revisionism shows the importance of understanding the individuals with authority over nuclear arsenals—and the role of the bureaucracies that stand between them. Meanwhile, Kim Jong Un has revised North Korea’s nuclear doctrine to further protect against decapitation strikes and has officially rejected the idea of Korean unification. The essays in this collection each probe and shed light on the domestic determinants of the ongoing evolution in global nuclear order.

Informed by a conference hosted by the Phelan United States Centre at the London School of Economics and Political Science in June 2024, each essay in this collection examines the evolving nuclear security environment in one of six central loci: Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, China, and the Korean Peninsula. The authors’ viewpoints are diverse, providing an expansive and inclusive look at global nuclear policy and exploring how different countries and regions are tackling major new developments in nuclear security. The result is a geographically expansive but cohesive review of the global nuclear order.

The essays also highlight important implications for policy. In particular, each essay offers insights into the complex political dynamics between the United States and various nuclear stakeholders—be they treaty allies, partners, or adversaries of the United States.

Collectively, the essays point to two major themes shaping nuclear policy today. First, domestic politics remains an understudied, but critical, driver of nuclear policy. For example, Do Young Lee demonstrates that—despite the initial success of the Washington Declaration—the South Korean public’s confidence in the credibility of US extended deterrence has declined, and attributes this decline to diverging US and South Korean interpretations of North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy. This divergence has generated major disagreements between Washington and Seoul about both the threat environment and the appropriate strategies to address it.In their discussion of the Middle East, Nicole Grajewski and Jane Darby Menton similarly point to the powerful role of Iranian domestic politics. The recent attacks on Iran’s nuclear program by Israel and the United States have dramatically heightened Tehran’s sense of vulnerability, reducing political barriers to nuclear proliferation that have previously served as valuable guardrails.

Domestic politics also lie at the heart of China’s ongoing vertical proliferation, as Nicola Leveringhaus demonstrates that strategic and internal political rationales combine to explain Xi Jinping’s nuclear decision-making. Centralization of decision-making in foreign and security policy issues has elevated the status of nuclear weapons and contracted the domestic community of nuclear strategists while also diminishing their influence on nuclear decision-making. This “more CCP-aligned, paranoid, younger, and strategically less informed Chinese expert community” may have adverse implications for arms control.

Domestic politics also affect coordination between allies and partners in the nuclear realm. Jacklyn Majnemer evaluates tensions between the United States and its allies over NATO’s nuclear future, arguing that effective deterrence requires satisfying the political concerns of nuclear sharing states. As the Trump administration’s talk and actions perpetuate a rift between the United States and its European allies, squaring US interests with the demands of European nuclear deterrence is likely to become more challenging.

A second theme that emerges from these essays is the way in which the globally interconnected nature of nuclear politics can lead to cascading effects on nuclear policy and strategy. Leveringhaus suggests that expanded security cooperation between Russia and China in the conventional realm could prompt a deepening nuclear relationship, better positioning Beijing to manage its diversifying strategic deterrent. She further argues that China’s nuclear buildup is driven by perceived vulnerability to quantitative improvements in the US arsenal, including ballistic missile defense and conventional counterforce capabilities. This situation raises important questions for policymakers on how their actions could either slow or accelerate an interactive cycle.

Many of the roundtable contributions point to second-order effects of US-China competition on the global nuclear landscape. Debak Das, for example, argues that US-China competition and the AUKUS deal have contributed to major new developments in India’s nuclear posture. In what he calls “a cascade effect of reactionary vertical proliferation,” US-China competition fuels a Chinese nuclear buildup that prompts efforts in India to shore up second-strike capabilities. This chain of events in turn exacerbates the India-Pakistan security dilemma, making recurring South Asian military crises more dangerous and more difficult for US policy to manage. Lee explains the complex effects of China’s nuclear buildup on both US and South Korean military policy. While Washington is increasingly prioritizing deterring China, Seoul remains wary of pushing away its biggest trade partner and fears becoming entrapped in a US-China conflict. J. Luis Rodriguez argues that Latin America reacts to competition between the United States, Russia, and China, noting in particular that the United States has viewed cooperation on nuclear energy and space technology between China and several Latin American countries as a potential security threat. Finally, Grajewski and Menton discuss how US-China competition affects the nuclear energy market—and shapes resulting proliferation risks—among multiple states in the Middle East, producing developments that can draw the US into regional conflicts. These essays emphasize the need for more scholarly and policy attention to the downstream effects of US-China nuclear competition on second-order dynamics that shape the nuclear environment in important ways.

Together, these essays identify significant challenges to the contemporary nuclear order. They present a two-level framework for understanding the domestic and international drivers of ongoing evolutions in nuclear security. Restoring balance to the nuclear order will require efforts on multiple fronts. First, to maintain strategic cohesion, the United States and its allies should be attentive not just to international considerations, but also to domestic political questions and perceptions at the heart of nuclear decision-making. Second, where possible, the United States may benefit from engaging domestic actors in adversarial systems to promote shared understandings of the global risks of nuclear proliferation and of more assertive nuclear postures. Third, these essays demonstrate that nuclear decisions cannot be made in bilateral or regional vacuums. Thinking about the global nuclear order as an interconnected whole and mapping out the downstream risks of decisions will enable policymakers in the US and elsewhere to better appreciate the cascades and feedback effects that might undermine their policies in the future.

2. Growing Divergence: North Korea’s Evolving Nuclear Strategy and the US–South Korea Alliance

Do Young Lee

In response to North Korea’s escalating nuclear and missile threats, the US and South Korea have taken measures to reinforce extended deterrence: the Washington Declaration, the Nuclear Consultative Group, and the enhanced visibility of US strategic assets around the Korean Peninsula. Despite these steps, South Korea’s public confidence in US extended deterrence commitments has declined. This article argues that this decline is rooted in growing divergence between US and South Korean interpretations of North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy and the appropriate responses to it.

On April 26, 2023, US President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit and adopted the Washington Declaration.1 The declaration was designed to reassure South Koreans that the US extended deterrence commitment to South Korea remains steadfast in the face of North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats. Washington adopted the declaration in the hope of curbing South Korean support for nuclear armament and encouraging Seoul to faithfully comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The declaration outlines specific measures, including the establishment of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) and the regular deployment of US strategic assets—such as nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs)—to the Korean Peninsula. As part of the implementation of the Washington Declaration, the USS Kentucky made a historic port call to South Korea in July 2023, marking the first visit to South Korea in forty-two years by a US SSBN.2

Despite these measures, public opinion polls conducted by three South Korean research institutions following the Washington Declaration revealed results that deviated from US expectations.3 In 2024, South Korean respondents’ support in these polls for indigenous nuclear weapons stood at 72.8 percent,4 66.0 percent,5 and 70.9 percent,6 marking decreases of 3.8 percent, 5.8 percent, and 4.2 percent, respectively, from 2023. On average, 69.9 percent of South Koreans favored acquiring nuclear weapons, a 2.1 percent rise from the previous year. Although the Washington Declaration and the implementation of follow-up measures have been widely promoted, support for South Korean nuclear armament has continued to increase.7

Confidence in the US security guarantee appears to be related to these shifts in public opinion. One of the three polls showed that the percentage of South Koreans who believe Washington would use nuclear weapons to defend their country, even if North Korea could strike the US mainland, dropped from 51.3 percent in 2023 to 39.3 percent in 2024.8 In another time-series poll conducted since 2021, when respondents were asked to choose between hosting US troops and possessing their own nuclear weapons for national defense, more respondents selected the second option (possessing nuclear weapons) than the first option (hosting US troops) for the first time in 2024.9 This marked decline in public confidence occurred after the Washington Declaration was adopted.

What accounts for the recent decline in South Korean confidence in US extended deterrence? Addressing this question requires careful analysis of significant shifts in North Korea’s nuclear strategy and doctrine over the past few years. The increasing distrust from South Korean respondents stems from a widening gap between US views and South Korean views on North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy and appropriate countermeasures. Pyongyang appears to have recently made a significant shift in its nuclear strategy, aimed at countering the conventionally superior South Korean and US combined forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula.10 Consequently, North Korea is currently assessed to have adopted a more aggressive nuclear posture on the Korean Peninsula, one that envisions preemptive nuclear use far more actively than in the past.11 While Washington maintains that its existing extended deterrence commitment is sufficient, South Koreans posit that the US has not adapted to these changes, raising doubts about America’s resolve and capability to address the evolving North Korean threat.

Evolution in North Korea’s Nuclear Strategy

Under Vipin Narang’s famous classification of nuclear strategies (or nuclear postures), a catalytic strategy seeks to catalyze military or diplomatic intervention—typically from a third party—when the state’s vital interests are threatened by an external adversary.12 Applying this typology to North Korea, Narang explained that Pyongyang initially adopted a catalytic strategy.13 That is, North Korea aimed to employ its nuclear weapons to prompt intervention from its patron, China, or to induce Beijing to act as a crisis mediator during conflicts on the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, Narang predicted that if China were no longer perceived as a reliable patron, North Korea—facing the conventionally superior US–South Korea combined forces—would likely shift to an asymmetric escalation strategy.14 Indeed, over the past few years, North Korea’s nuclear strategy appears to have evolved into asymmetric escalation, incorporating its core characteristics.15

Asymmetric escalation is designed to deter conventional attacks by enabling a state to quickly escalate to the first use of nuclear weapons against the adversary.16 An asymmetric escalation posture has three key features: (1) the threat of first use of nuclear weapons; (2) explicit intention to employ nuclear weapons tactically against an adversary’s conventional forces and the delivery platforms to achieve this; and (3) pre-delegation of authority to military commanders for nuclear weapon use.17

North Korea’s stance on a “no first use” (NFU) policy has shifted significantly. Previously, Pyongyang consistently portrayed its nuclear forces as defensive. For example, the 2013 North Korea nuclear law describes its nuclear weapons as “just means for defense” to cope with the US’s increasingly hostile policy and nuclear threat.18 The nuclear law also states that the primary role of these weapons is to deter and repel enemy aggression and attacks on the state.19 Additionally, it clarifies that Pyongyang would neither use nor threaten to use nuclear weapons first against nonnuclear states like South Korea unless they participate with a hostile nuclear power like the US in acts of aggression and attack against North Korea.20 In September 2022, however, North Korea enacted a new law that significantly pivoted away from its original NFU-oriented stance. Under the section titled “Conditions of Using Nuclear Weapons,” the new law stipulated five circumstances under which nuclear weapons could be used: “1) in case an attack by nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction was launched or drew near is judged, 2) in case a nuclear or non-nuclear attack by hostile forces on the state leadership and the command organization of the state’s nuclear forces was launched or drew near is judged, 3) in case a fatal military attack against important strategic objects of the state was launched or drew near is judged, 4) in case the need for operation for preventing the expansion and protraction of a war and taking the initiative in the war in contingency is inevitably raised, 5) in other case an inevitable situation in which it is compelled to correspond with catastrophic crisis to the existence of the state and safety of the people by only nuclear weapons is created.”21

Notably, the law allows North Korea to use nuclear weapons first if an external attack on the state “drew near is judged”—that is, is deemed imminent—or during wartime to prevent further escalation and secure victory. The circumstances it describes are so broad that they could allow Pyongyang to resort to preemptive nuclear attacks at virtually any time, based on arbitrary judgments that will not be transparent to external observers and actors trying to deter North Korea.22

Illustrating the second characteristic of an asymmetric escalation strategy, in 2021 Kim publicly acknowledged for the first time that North Korea was developing tactical nuclear weapons and declared that “producing smaller and lighter nuclear weapons for tactical uses” would be one of several key strategic goals in his country’s five-year military development plan (2021–25) for a nuclear weapons program.23 The following year, North Korea began efforts to operationalize tactical nuclear weapons for actual war-fighting missions. In September 2022, Kim ordered the expansion of the operational roles of tactical nuclear weapons and the acceleration of their deployment.24 In late December 2022, the North Korean leader directed that “[n]ow that the South Korean puppet forces who designated the DPRK as their ‘principal enemy’ and openly trumpet about ‘preparations for war’ have assumed our undoubted enemy, it highlights the importance and necessity of a mass-producing of tactical nuclear weapons and calls for an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal.”25 In 2023, Pyongyang unveiled its tactical nuclear warhead and a range of tactical nuclear platforms designed to target South Korea.26 Since 2022, North Korea has significantly increased the number of test-firings of short-range ballistic and cruise missiles that exclusively target South Korea.27 North Korea has clearly signaled its intention and ability to carry out aggressive tactical nuclear operations against South Korea, if necessary, using these short-range systems.28

The recent evolution of North Korea’s nuclear strategy also clearly reflects the third characteristic of an asymmetric escalation strategy. In recent years, Pyongyang transitioned from its original assertive nuclear command and control (NC2) system, wherein Kim held all centralized power, to a more delegative system. Specifically, North Korea’s 2013 nuclear law specified that the state’s nuclear weapons “can be used only by a final order of the Supreme Commander [Kim Jong Un].”29 In contrast, Pyongyang’s new delegative system seems to be intended to ensure nuclear retaliation against a surprise attack on the North Korean leadership. Notably, the 2022 law stipulates under the newly added section of “command and control of nuclear forces” that “the state nuclear forces command organization” shall assist the North Korean leader in “the whole course from decision concerning nuclear weapons to execution.”30 The section also stipulates that if Kim’s NC2 is incapacitated due to an enemy attack, “a nuclear strike shall be launched automatically and immediately . . . according to the operation plan decided in advance.”31 The core of this reform is to transfer pre-authorized control of the nuclear button to designated individuals.32

Pinpointing the origins of this evolution is beyond this study’s scope, but a few plausible explanations emerge. First, as Narang’s theory suggests, a weakening of North Korea’s trust in China as its security patron may be a contributing factor. The strained relationship between the two communist allies in recent years lends plausibility to this explanation.33 Second, South Korea’s domestic politics may have played a role. The conservative Yoon administration, which took office in May 2022, adopted a more hardline stance toward North Korea than its predecessor, the Moon Jae-in administration.34 Notably, Pyongyang enacted its 2022 nuclear law just four months after Yoon’s inauguration. Third, South Korea’s military modernization has significantly weakened the effectiveness of North Korean conventional artillery attacks, shifting the conventional balance of power in favor of the South.35 This shift may have prompted Pyongyang to adjust its nuclear strategy, utilizing its nuclear forces more actively for political and military purposes within the Korean theater. Fourth, lessons drawn from Russia’s threat of nuclear first use in the Ukraine war might have driven North Korea’s shift.36

The Growing Cacophony

North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy has created a rift between Seoul and Washington in their threat perceptions and their approaches to the evolving North Korean threat. Table 1 examines differences in South Korean and US perceptions of five issues. The allies agree on only two issues.

Note: The values in this summary table represent an overall average perspective that includes both public and elite perceptions from the two states. The terms “increased” and “not increased” use 2021 as a reference point, when North Korea’s nuclear strategy began to evolve in earnest.

South Korea

South Korean leaders and experts across the political spectrum have grown deeply concerned about Pyongyang’s nuclear evolution toward a more offensive and aggressive posture. In particular, they are highly sensitive to North Korea lowering the threshold for nuclear use in various scenarios, believing that the likelihood of North Korea’s nuclear use—ranging from peacetime to crisis and wartime—has significantly increased.37 In January 2024, President Yoon criticized Pyongyang, stating, “The North Korean regime is an irrational group that has legalized the preemptive use of nuclear weapons as the only country in the world to do so.”38 In December 2022, Wi Sung-lac (now the first National Security Advisor under the new Lee Jae Myung administration) assessed that North Korea was extremely escalating its threat to South Korea through test-firings of various types of nuclear missiles.39

South Koreans are concerned that as North Korea’s nuclear strategy grows more aggressive, Pyongyang may be more inclined to undertake military actions on the Korean Peninsula, such as localized provocations or even large-scale invasions. In other words, with North Korea now possessing a more offensive nuclear doctrine and a range of supporting tactical nuclear weapons, Pyongyang could become more emboldened to use military options. Former South Korean Vice Minister of National Defense Baek Seung-joo warned that North Korea, having gained confidence from the legalization of nuclear weapons, might be preparing for localized provocations similar to the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010.40 South Korean experts have also frequently examined a scenario in which North Korea rapidly occupies disputed islands in the Yellow Sea. These experts warn that North Korea could coerce South Korea into recognizing these already lost islands as a fait accompli, either by threatening a limited nuclear attack or launching an actual “escalate to de-escalate” nuclear attack.41

Moreover, influential South Koreans warn that North Korea’s new nuclear law could signal the prelude to full-scale war. In January 2024, Kim Jong Un ordered a constitutional revision to specify “the issue of completely occupying, subjugating and reclaiming South Korea and annexing it as a part of the territory of our republic in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.”42 In light of this development, a South Korean expert argued that the new nuclear law reflects a dangerous ambition of “forceful absorption and unification through nuclear means,” adding that “North Korea has never abandoned its goal of unification.”43 President Yoon stated, “North Korea has enacted a new nuclear law for first nuclear use to reunify [the Korean Peninsula] under communism.”44 Then-opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung stated a few days after North Korea’s new nuclear law was released: “I think this is a shocking and serious situation, because it appears North Korea has revealed its intention to use nuclear weapons not just for defense, but even for a preemptive attack.”45

Seoul believes that to effectively counter North Korea’s evolving threats, Washington must significantly enhance the specificity of its extended deterrence commitments to South Korea. For example, South Korea wants the US to more concretely outline in advance how it would respond to North Korean aggression under specific scenarios. The information requested by South Korea includes the specific types of nuclear assets to be deployed, the locations of these assets, and the operational processes to be employed.46 The rationale is this: Seoul believes that if the US were to explicitly and concretely detail its nuclear commitments and publicly announce their establishment—while keeping implementation details confidential—Pyongyang would be more likely to trust that US retaliatory actions would be carried out as specified, and would thus be deterred from launching nuclear or conventional attacks against South Korea. Stated differently, Seoul perceives American ambiguity as weakening the credibility and effectiveness of extended deterrence. Some South Korean experts contend that the US should formally codify that if North Korea launches a nuclear strike against South Korea, Washington will automatically intervene and immediately retaliate with nuclear strikes.47

The Yoon administration sought to address the lack of concreteness in US extended deterrence by enhancing the viability of US nuclear commitments and specifying implementation plans.48 Seoul’s efforts bore fruit with several tangible results, including the endorsement of the Washington Declaration, the establishment of the NCG, the convening of multiple subsequent NCG meetings, the advancement of the alliance’s conventional-nuclear integration (CNI) initiative, and the adoption of the US-ROK Guidelines for Nuclear Deterrence and Nuclear Operations.49 However, many South Korean elites and citizens remain dissatisfied and continue to demand groundbreaking measures, including the redeployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to South Korea, the introduction of a NATO-style nuclear sharing arrangement, and the addition of a “nuclear attack protection clause” to the US-ROK alliance treaty.50

Finally, Seoul believes that North Korea now poses a fundamentally different type of threat, and stresses the need to maintain the current strength and role of the United States Forces Korea (USFK) to deter it. Most South Koreans view the existing US military presence as the basic, minimum requirement for effective extended deterrence. Some argue that more American deterrent assets should be dedicated to South Korea’s defense, including the redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea and the permanent or semipermanent stationing of US strategic assets on South Korean soil.51South Korean leaders also advocate limiting the USFK’s role to defending South Korea from North Korean incursions, fearing that expanding it beyond the Peninsula could undermine US extended deterrence. For example, when asked if South Korea would assist a US defense of Taiwan during a Chinese attack, President Yoon stated that such a scenario would likely provoke North Korea’s opportunism. He emphasized that the primary focus of the South Korea–US alliance should be maintaining a strong defense posture against North Korea.52 This stance reflects

South Korea’s long-standing view of North Korea as a more immediate threat than China. South Korea’s position that USFK should concentrate exclusively on deterring North Korea also reflects its concern that it could be drawn into unwanted military conflicts beyond the Peninsula. Specifically, apprehension is growing among South Korean experts that if USFK engages in a military confrontation with China in the Taiwan Strait, then South Korea might also be pulled into the conflict.53 Some might argue that the so-called division-of-labor approach—where South Korea takes the lead in deterring North Korea on the Peninsula while USFK reorients toward other regional contingencies—which the Trump administration is said to be pursuing, would shield South Korea from the risk of entrapment.54 South Korean experts reject this view, however, warning that US bases in South Korea would likely become targets of Chinese attacks, thereby drawing South Korea into an unwanted conflict.55

The United States

The US interprets North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy and its implications quite differently from South Korea—as shown in table 1, the two allies’ views align on only two out of five key aspects. Like Seoul, many in Washington have raised concerns that Pyongyang’s evolving strategy increases the likelihood of a nuclear first use, citing the country’s 2022 nuclear law.56 Moreover, North Korea’s continued advancement and diversification of its nuclear weapons are viewed as further exacerbating this risk. Narang, then-Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, emphasized in a 2024 speech that North Korea’s ongoing nuclear developments are pushing it to recklessly threaten South Korea and increasingly the US.57

The US also acknowledges that North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy raises the potential for localized military provocations by Pyongyang. In other words, Washington agrees that Pyongyang’s evolution has heightened the likelihood that North Korea will use nuclear coercion to achieve economic, political, and even military objectives. The 2023 analysis by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on North Korea, produced in January 2023 and declassified in June of the same year, serves as a key resource for understanding the US perspective. The document analyzes the potential purposes for which North Korea might use its nuclear arsenal through 2030.58 It assesses as “high” the likelihood that nuclear weapons could be used for coercive purposes and notes that Kim “may use limited military force to raise tensions as a means to press key foreign governments into adopting positions favorable to his objectives, confident that his growing nuclear capabilities will deter any unacceptable retaliation or consequences.”59 The 2025 ODNI annual report does not directly address how North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy affects its behavior, but it does note that “Pyongyang is expanding its capacity for coercive operations and using new tactics as it becomes more confident in its nuclear deterrent,” highlighting the Kim regime’s growing assertiveness fueled by its advancing nuclear capabilities.60

The ODNI’s annual report and some American experts point to an increasing likelihood that North Korea could launch low-level attacks against South Korea, including shelling disputed islands in the Yellow Sea and resuming provocations along the Northern Limit Line. The experts view these potential local provocations as attempts to maximize the effectiveness of coercive threats for political or economic gains.61 Many in Washington, however, assess that coercive nuclear threats are highly unlikely to lead to a full-scale invasion undertaken to reunify the Korean Peninsula under communism.62 For example, the 2023 ODNI analysis mentioned above notes that North Korea’s nuclear use “to seize territory and achieve political dominance over the Peninsula . . . will be much less likely than the strategy of coercion.”63

Washington’s assessments of the situation have led to a position that differs from Seoul’s regarding the need for a significantly more explicit commitment to extended deterrence. Washington does acknowledge some need for greater specificity, which has led to the establishment of the NCG and efforts to push for a CNI initiative.64 While striving to enhance the specificity of its extended deterrence commitments, however, the US has also expressed opposition to additional measures sought by Seoul, such as the redeployment of nuclear weapons and the adoption of nuclear sharing arrangements.65 Fundamentally, Washington wants to maintain a degree of ambiguity, out of concern that overly explicit commitments could increase the risk of being drawn into a nuclear war.66 Such commitments could limit Washington’s flexibility to employ alternative options, such as massive conventional retaliation or a decapitation strike aimed at eliminating Kim Jong Un.67

Moreover, Washington believes that overly specific commitments would be counterproductive, emphasizing the value of calculated ambiguity.68 This stance rests on the belief that ambiguity forces adversaries to constantly guess about US red lines and retaliation methods, keeping nuclear response a possibility even in unlikely scenarios. This, in turn, promotes caution in adversarial decisions about whether to invade and thereby strengthens deterrence.69 Additionally, Washington believes that excessively specific and detailed nuclear commitments for numerous scenarios could undermine the credibility of extended deterrence. If North Korea concludes that a US deterrent nuclear threat in a particular scenario is exaggerated or a bluff, it might doubt the credibility of all other US nuclear commitments.70 Therefore, Washington prefers to avoid overly detailed or specific declaratory language in favor of ambiguous commitments.

Finally, Washington views the current size and military capabilities of the USFK as substantial and sufficient to deter North Korea. The Trump administration is reportedly even considering withdrawing about 4,500 troops from the 28,500-strong USFK,71 signaling that it wants Seoul to take on a greater role in countering North Korea.72 In this context, the US appears to regard permanent stationing of strategic deterrent assets or the redeployment of nuclear weapons to South Korea as politically unwise and militarily redundant.73 A former US official at the National Security Council, for example, argued that redeployment of these assets is unnecessary and would undermine extended deterrence. The official remarked that redeployment would be akin to announcing that “we will use nukes in Korea rather than engage our homeland. . . . We have to say our homeland is also threatened along with your homeland.”74

The Trump administration has signaled that it is considering shifting USFK’s focus from strictly deterring North Korea to also incorporating broader missions beyond the Korean Peninsula.75 In May 2024, Elbridge Colby, who was later appointed as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, told South Korean media that the USFK’s role should shift toward countering China.76 Colby being named to the Pentagon’s number three post has raised concerns in Seoul that Washington will want a broader regional role for USFK than Seoul prefers—a divergence that could further weaken South Korea’s confidence in US extended deterrence.77

Conclusion

North Korea’s nuclear strategy has evolved; as conditions have changed, the US and South Korea have diverged in their interpretations of this change. This growing divergence explains the recent sharp decline in South Koreans’ confidence in US extended deterrence: South Koreans believe that the US is downplaying the significance of North Korea’s evolving nuclear capabilities and posture, and failing to take appropriate measures to address the new threats this development poses.

Pyongyang also appears to be exacerbating intra-alliance discord by selectively threatening Seoul with nuclear first use while refraining from doing so toward the continental US. Pyongyang’s announcement that it is no longer seeking reconciliation with South Korea and the deployment of various short-range nuclear and conventional platforms targeting the South seem calibrated to instill maximum fear in Seoul.78 How the US effectively responds to North Korea’s divergent threats will be pivotal in ensuring credible extended deterrence for Seoul.

Since the start of the second Trump administration, American policymakers have increasingly viewed North Korea’s nuclear threat to South Korea and its threat to the US homeland as distinct challenges. Washington has signaled that it may prioritize the “defense of the US homeland” while gradually shifting deterrence responsibilities on the Korean Peninsula to Seoul.79 This bifurcated approach would provide the US with greater strategic flexibility in the Indo-Pacific region, especially to counter China’s regional ambitions.

This approach, however, could encourage North Korean nuclear provocations or military adventurism, which could backfire if a crisis then requires deeper US involvement in military contingencies on the Korean Peninsula. It could also backfire if such a development, in turn, were to create strategic openings for China to move more assertively in the Taiwan Strait or the East China Sea, with negative consequences for stability elsewhere in the region. American policymakers, therefore, should move away from the belief that retasking USFK to focus on the Chinese threat must involve redeploying them outside the Korean Peninsula. Instead, American leaders should recognize that credible extended deterrence can be achieved on the Korean Peninsula and across the region by maintaining current USFK force levels or with minimal withdrawals.

South Korea can also serve as a strategic outpost for countering China’s regional dominance. This scenario is particularly important for addressing China’s growing maritime assertiveness in the Yellow Sea, which has become increasingly apparent in recent months.80 Indeed, concerns are mounting among both South Korean and American experts that China is seeking to transform the Yellow Sea into a “second South China Sea.” Beijing has recently installed large floating steel structures—claimed to be aquaculture cages—in the Provisional Measures Zone (PMZ) established between South Korea and China. These actions echo China’s previous pattern of converting what were originally weather-monitoring stations in the South China Sea into military installations.81

Therefore, a more appropriate approach would be to maintain the overall size of the USFK while restructuring its current Army-centric composition—centered around the Eighth Army—and gradually increasing the proportion of naval and air forces equipped with enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. This strategy would allow Washington to simultaneously pursue three objectives: (1) maintaining robust extended deterrence on the Korean Peninsula; (2) checking China’s pursuit of regional hegemony; and (3) reassuring Seoul of Washington’s unwavering commitment. Furthermore, by enabling USFK to assume multiple missions that counter both North Korea and China simultaneously, this approach would also contribute to the Trump administration’s purported pursuit of greater strategic flexibility for USFK.82

3. The Domestic Politics Behind China’s Strategic Force Improvements

Nicola Leveringhaus

China’s nuclear expansion is occurring at a time of major domestic political change, with implications for its nuclear weapons strategy. Domestic changes of note include defense reforms, a contraction and politicization of China’s strategic community, as well as sustained top-down interest in commemoration of China’s nuclear weapons past, such as the “Two Bombs, One Satellite” program. These domestic political changes represent an unprecedented elevation of the national, social, and political value of China’s nuclear weapons by the CCP in the Xi era. How should others in the region and beyond best respond to these changes? The article ends with some thoughts on foreign state engagement with China as Beijing expands and elevates the domestic importance of its nuclear arsenal.

China’s strategic force is undergoing vast and unprecedented levels of improvement. There is a compelling explanation for this: Chinese military modernization, which spans decades, now yields visible results, bolstering national strategic deterrence. Xi Jinping, the current Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader, today commands the most powerful military since the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949.83 Chinese strategic capabilities have become more accurate, mobile, and diverse across the air, sea, land, space, and cyber domains than ever before. These strategic assets include an estimated 600 nuclear warheads; vast numbers of intermediate-range conventional missiles, including the DF-26, which has dual-use/ “hot swappable” warhead functions; an emerging operational nuclear mission for bombers; and since 2020, the world’s largest navy, which includes six Jin-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).84

China’s strategic force improvements are happening in real time and constitute an unsettling new technological reality for the US and its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. Indeed, since 2024 the US frames China as part of a “multiple nuclear challenger problem,”85 an alteration to the “two-nuclear-peer” framing in 2023 that pitted China alongside Russia, with newer predictions that China might have at least 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035.86 Excellent scholarly literature explains recent changes in Chinese nuclear capabilities in relation to United States capabilities, specifically how US strategy might be unintentionally fueling China’s nuclear expansion, suggesting that a dangerous entangled security dilemma dynamic is emerging between the states.87 Yet much less literature discusses wider domestic political changes and how these shape Chinese nuclear thinking today.88

Evolving Chinese Strategic Capabilities

In the last five to six years, Chinese strategic forces have become much more mobile, precise, and diverse in their operationality in at least three areas.89 First, China now has sea-based nuclear deterrent capabilities, having deployed (since 2015) six Jin-class SSBNs with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to the South China Sea. External estimates suggest that China seeks around ten SSBNs in total, with improved anti-detection capabilities (making the SSBNs quieter) as well as heightened readiness through a desired continuous-at-sea ability. This Chinese effort reflects a wider push among states in the Indo-Pacific to secure deterrence at sea: North Korea, India, and Pakistan are all developing—to varying degrees of success—SSBNs.

A second advancement relates to intermediate missiles like the DF-26, which are within range of Northeast Asia as well as India and Guam. The warheads on these missiles can be changed quickly from a conventional to a nuclear role, hence the “hot-swappable” element. While this element allows greater flexibility in response to an attack,90 analysts worry that it could confuse the enemy and lead to inadvertent escalation in a crisis.91

A third advancement relates to new missile silo bases for longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the DF-41. The three new Chinese silo bases were identified using commercial satellite imagery in 2021.92 These sites are situated in northern China, specifically Jilantai in Inner Mongolia, the northwestern city of Yumen, and Hami, near Yumen. Chinese officials continue to deny that these sites are silo bases, labeling them windmills instead. Silo bases are important to survivability because they harden and protect missiles from an incoming strike; if these silo fields were to be filled, they could in total house over 300 ICBMs, such as the DF-41, which could reach the continental US.

Today these technical developments give the CCP leadership more strategic options than ever before, including for doctrinal transformation should Beijing desire such change in the future. It remains unclear whether these new capabilities translate into a transformative shift away from assured retaliation and China’s declared “no first use” (NFU) pledge.93 It is therefore useful to look beyond technical changes to political indicators to interpret China’s changing approach to nuclear weapons.

Domestic Politics and Nuclear Weapons in China

Within the last decade, the Chinese leadership has centralized control over foreign and security policy initiatives and debates, with important effects on Chinese nuclear policy and strategy. First, the CCP has elevated the national social and political value of its nuclear weapons to an unprecedented degree, precisely at a time when China’s capabilities and options are expanding rapidly. Second, China’s domestic nuclear expert community has contracted, with fewer senior nuclear strategy experts debating and shaping nuclear policy and strategy in China.

The public elevation of nuclear weapons in China today is evident in CCP commemoration of its own strategic weapons history, which focuses on the Two Bombs, One Satellite program [两弹一星, liang dan yi xing] that resulted in three major scientific achievements: China’s atomic test in 1964, its hydrogen test in 1967, and a satellite launch in 1970.94 Another focus for commemoration is the Third Line / Front [三线, Sanxian], a massive industrial and civil defense project from the Mao era that moved strategic assets and defense industries away from vulnerable coastal and city areas inwards into mountainous and inaccessible areas to ensure survivability in the event of major war.95 China actively draws on both past events, invoking the “spirit” [精神, jing shen] of the Two Bombs, One Satellite and Third Line programs to incentivize ordinary Chinese citizens and scientists working in strategic sectors in China (from high-speed rail to space).

This commemoration comes at a time when Xi has also openly reinforced the present-day value of China’s strategic weapons with a stated aim in 2022 to build “a strong system of strategic deterrence.”96 Earlier closed-door speeches by Xi in 2012 and 2014 to China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Forces (PLARF, then named the Second Artillery) reportedly reinforce how important the force is to both China’s security as well as its national rejuvenation as a great power.97 Xi has also made clearer in public statements where the CCP sits in the nuclear decision-making process, reaffirming that the Party’s Central Military Commission (CMC) and Standing Politburo make the ultimate decision for any use (or threat of use) of strategic weapons, hence the party mantra that “the CMC leads, the theatre commands fight, and the services equip.”98

The anti-corruption campaign has also reinforced centralization. In 2023, under the banner of the anti-corruption campaign, former PLARF commander Li Yuchao and his deputies Liu Guangbin and Zhang Zhenzhong, as well as another former commander of the Rocket Force at the CCP National Congress, General Zhou Yaning, were removed from power. Corruption is broadly defined, from practical concerns over the purchase of substandard technology and faulty operation of weaponry like missiles, to fears around external leaks of information and disloyalty to the Party. The Party has also sought to increase control through political education campaigns within the PLA.99 These individual high-profile expulsions and political education campaigns speak to domestic efforts to centralize and purge strategic military bureaucracies from corruption and shore up a deeper sense of loyalty to the Party.100

Defense reforms also occurred in 2015 and 2024, expanding the operational mission mandate and force status of China’s nuclear deterrents, especially its missiles.101 The first of these reforms, in December 2015, elevated the status of China’s land-based strategic nuclear and conventional forces, renaming them as the PLARF. This change can be understood as part of a wider effort to elevate the public status of these forces in domestic politics and their role as important markers of great power. Indeed, from 2017 onwards, Xi Jinping started to talk much more openly about his ambition for China to possess a top-tier world-class military, in which possession of a credible strategic arsenal would be key.102 In the April 2024 reforms, China established four new “arms” (Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, Information Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force) to support the four services (PLA, PLAAF, PLAN, and PLARF).

Amid these reforms, Xi has spoken of an enlarged operational mission for the PLARF. Traditionally, the PLARF has been tasked to focus on retaliatory missions, namely counterattack (striking after the enemy has struck [后发制人, houfa zhiren]). Yet recent reporting in China suggests that new declared roles have been recently added to the PLARF beyond counterattack, including “counter-balancing” and “winning wars.”103 Strategic counterbalancing seems to reflect a geopolitical rather than technically driven assessment in Beijing that, in an increasingly hostile and difficult external security environment, more weapons would have a stabilizing effect between China and its main competitors.104 Less is known from open-source information about whether “winning wars” includes using nuclear missions as opposed to other nonnuclear strategic assets in the cyber/space/advanced conventional domain to achieve this goal.105 The talk of “winning wars” may be an attempt to talk up emerging capabilities and keep the PLA incentivized in the coming decades of military modernization, or it may simply be a signal attempting to intimidate the United States.

Collectively, these domestic political changes represent an unprecedented elevation of the national, social, and political value of China’s nuclear weapons by the CCP in the Xi era. By CCP design, the past, present, and future of China’s nuclear arsenal matters more domestically and politically than ever before.

The second domestic political change relates to a shrinking of the nuclear expert community, including established and more senior Chinese arms control experts, since 2012.106 This community includes national weapons engineers, physicists, think tank analysts, and academics in fields such as international relations. Under former leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, these actors contributed to national debates around China’s nuclear strategy and posture, and conducted exchanges with foreign counterparts through dialogues and knowledge exchange. This expert community facilitated China’s signature to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, and many were participants in dialogues with the United States, such as the discontinued Lab-to-Lab dialogue of the 1990s, or bilateral Track 1.5 dialogues run by the Pacific Forum.107 Yet the influence of these Chinese actors has seemingly waned in the Xi Jinping era.108 Several Chinese domestic experts, for example, did not anticipate examples of Chinese expansion, such as the construction of the silo bases identified through open-source commercial satellite imagery in 2021.109 As China’s military builds up, the level of informed insight that can be offered by this community of outward-facing experts—particularly of mid- to senior-level experts—seems to be shrinking.

This contraction can be attributed in part to practical factors, such as constrained mobility during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and the reality that some of China’s senior nuclear experts are now reaching retirement age.110 The contraction also reflects broader restructuring of the domestic expert landscape in the Xi era and reorganization of disciplines within Chinese academic institutions. For example, the rise of party committees in universities has increased, as have changes to the study of international relations within one of the top-tier universities based in Beijing, Tsinghua University, where, for example, the study of national security is separate from area studies.111

The domestic environment in which Chinese nuclear strategy is debated has become more centralized and politicized. The effects of these changes are as yet unknown. The near-term outcome of this contraction could be a more CCP-aligned, paranoid, younger, and strategically less informed Chinese expert community capable of engaging on nuclear issues with outsiders. As higher education has come under tighter political control, newer scholars may face greater domestic political scrutiny over what they say and write, limiting the potential for candid conversation in dialogue with foreign counterparts. Although we should not assume that this will make Beijing uninterested in arms control, or that a younger, more politically focused expert community will support larger forces and changed nuclear doctrine, the environment today prioritizes—to an unprecedented level—CCP preferences. More effort might be required to build shared understanding of nuclear strategy between Chinese experts and foreign counterparts. And it may be that a more centralized emerging nuclear community will narrow space for debate on force development, deployment, and use, or will reduce interaction between informed Chinese participants and outside actors on risk reduction and crisis management. Perhaps because the opportunities will be narrower as policy evolves, continued engagement is likely to be increasingly important.

Interaction Between China and the United States

China has become increasingly clear in outlining how specific US technologies affect its own strategic choices. Even decades ago, in the late 1990s, high-profile Chinese figures like former ambassador Sha Zukang never minced his words in calling out what he considered the damaging effect of US ballistic missile defense in Asia on China’s small nuclear arsenal.112 Chinese fears about the US deepening its commitment to missile defense continued into the 2000s following US abrogation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2003. More recently, in the 2010s and 2020s, these concerns have sharpened—still centered around damage limitation capabilities (missile defense), but with additional interest in conventional counterforce strikes in US nuclear strategy, evident in the 2018 and 2022 US nuclear posture reviews (NPRs)113 as well as the US decision to withdraw from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. The US decision around INF especially was seen in Beijing as a deliberate effort by the US to increase its conventional counterforce capabilities in the Northeast Asian region to counter Chinese theater-level missiles in the region.114 Work in 2024 by Li Bin and Wu Riqiang argues that three specific sets of technology undermine China’s nuclear deterrent: the high kill probability of US missile defense interceptors in coordination with US allies in the region; US anti-submarine warfare limiting China’s emerging SSBN capability; and a US space-based system (Ground Moving Target Indicator) to track Chinese mobile missiles.115

Yet China’s nuclear deterrent has only recently ballooned to deal with the external concerns and challenges above. Why did China take so long? Here domestic political considerations, combined with lessons from other nuclear powers, might offer some insight. As noted earlier, since 2012 nuclear weapons have assumed greater political and social value and prestige, especially when attached, as they are by Xi, to China’s wider road to revival and national rejuvenation as a great power. China might also be looking to the experiences of other nuclear weapons states in managing their relations with the US. This includes Russia as well as other nuclear weapons states like India and North Korea. Yet how lessons drawn from nuclear decision-making in Russia, India, and North Korea might have shaped—actively or inadvertently—contemporary Chinese strategic decisions remains poorly understood.

Challenges and Responses from the US and Wider Region

US and regional responses to evolving Chinese nuclear strategy have so far focused largely on technological advancements rather than domestic politics. This approach has led to calls for US nuclear strategy to go beyond counterforce (military locations) targeting to include countervalue (population centers) targets in China as well.116 Other experts recommend a buildup in US nuclear forces once the United States is no longer bound by the New START Treaty (likely from February 2026), as well as increased regional nuclear commitments to allies and a return to controversial capabilities featured in the 2018 NPRs such as the sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N).117 Others have called for the US to adopt a sole-purpose nuclear doctrine (but not NFU) as part of a transition to an active denial strategy, one that would also require allies to do more in terms of conventional deterrence.118 It is unclear whether attempts by the US State Department in the Biden era to discuss NFU with China will continue in the second Trump administration. The 2024 speech by Vipin Narang, then–acting US secretary of defense for space policy, makes clear that the United States will continue to seek dialogue and forms of risk reduction.119 All of these recommendations and approaches will likely have implications for long-standing discussions over mutual vulnerability—something long desired in Beijing, but something about which Washington has so far resisted official declarations.120 In the immediate term, US partners and allies in Asia appear concerned that as China’s nuclear arsenal expands, Beijing will increasingly become more confident in its ability to deter the United States’ use of nuclear weapons.121 For Taiwan, this confidence might lead China to initiate conventional conflict, without fear of escalation to nuclear use from the US.122 Outside the region, US commitments to the security of NATO because of the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine have filtered into the Asian regional security context, with Asian allies concerned about the ability and political will of the US to operate in multiple theaters simultaneously.

These fears reinvigorate preexisting domestic debates around nuclear weapons proliferation for some, as well as new deployment options in an extended deterrence for others. In South Korea, extended deterrence was reaffirmed in April 2023 through the Washington Declaration between the US and South Korea, but debates over the reliability of that commitment remain.123 In Japan, China’s growing military capabilities and assertiveness have contributed to closer cooperation with the US over missile defense, continued consultation through the US-Japan Extended Deterrence Dialogue, and internal debates about nuclear sharing and conventional precision-strike options.124

Wider multilateral US partner and allied responses to changes in Chinese strategic power have started to take shape. For example, AUKUS has catalyzed closer scientific, legal, political, and military discussions among Australia, the UK, and the US, a significant shift regardless of whether the arrangement delivers specific outputs on the timetable announced. Extending new partnerships into AUKUS Pillar II (emerging technologies), perhaps incorporating Japan and South Korea, could have a compounding effect in terms of scientific cooperation.125 Put bluntly, China cannot re-create these multi-state global arrangements in strategic technology.

Conclusion

China’s nuclear expansion is occurring at a time of major domestic political change, with implications for Chinese nuclear strategy. These developments prompt a rethinking for foreign governments as to how best to engage with China in the nuclear domain.

Above all, foreign discussions with China on nuclear strategy will likely be shaped by and tethered to the ideological party and political preferences and the worldview of Xi Jinping to a higher degree than before. Indeed, strategic concepts are being contested already, such as preferences in China and Russia for the term “political stability” over “strategic stability.”126 Engagements around arms control should therefore factor in not just technical assessments and awareness of Xi Jinping’s own statements on nuclear matters—as they likely do already—but also potential domestic political costs and pressures for Chinese counterparts. However, opportunities for engagement also exist, such as upgrading the P5 (Permanent Five of the UN Security Council) nuclear glossary of terms and expanding discussion in a P5-wide context around pre-missile launch notification built on actions China has taken unilaterally recently, as well as with Russia.

A domestic political lens for understanding the evolution of China’s nuclear arsenal also highlights that there may be utility in appealing to arguments around concepts like mutual vulnerability and NFU because they have strong political, rather than simply military, value for China. Yet these concepts will need to be discussed carefully, busting historical myths where necessary. For example, the historical scholarly record now shows that during the Cold War US-Soviet strategic stability—as it was then conceived—was not straightforward, not least because Soviets did not feel mutual vulnerability was enough.127 Bringing in examples from American or European historical experiences may be less sensitive and could help reduce overconfidence around the strategic value of mutual vulnerability.

As demonstrated in this article, current-day emphasis in China on historical commemoration showcases how politically valuable China’s strategic capabilities have become, and exclusively technical assessments of the balance of forces or nuclear posture miss these dimensions. Domestic political changes also matter for gauging which geopolitical arguments and by whom matter to China, especially beyond the US-China lens. As China enters a new era with respect to its nuclear forces, it is important to consider not just technologies and capabilities, but the wider domestic changes afoot.

4. Cascades of Competition: Southern Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and AUKUS

Debak Das

Nuclear stability in Southern Asia is being shaped by different layers of competition in the Indo-Pacific. This article highlights two dynamics that are shaping nuclear competition in the region. The first, within Southern Asia, is states finding space to escalate at lower levels of conflict to address nuclear and military asymmetry. Pakistan is seeking to create space to escalate at lower levels of conflict against India, while India is doing the same against Pakistan on one side and China on the other. The second dynamic is a cascade of reactionary vertical proliferation that is occurring in the Indo-Pacific as a result of China and the United States’ strategic competition. While Washington and Beijing are responding to each other’s nuclear arsenals, India is responding to China’s arsenal, and Pakistan is responding to India’s nuclear modernization. The technology transfers and submarine proliferation in the Indo-Pacific precipitated by AUKUS are intensifying this dynamic.

Nuclear security in Southern Asia is at a crossroads. The two nuclear dyads in the region—India and Pakistan, and China and India—are on different trajectories. While the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan has maintained the status quo despite occasional crises between the states, the competition between India and China has led to new doctrinal and structural changes in New Delhi’s nuclear and conventional force postures. This shift is informed by two elements. The first is that the rise of China as a revisionist threat in the Indo-Pacific has precipitated the convergence of different multilateral constellations of states—aimed at checking Beijing—that include India. And second, and more importantly, China’s recent territorial threat to India along the 4,057-kilometer-long disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) has led to significant changes in India’s conventional and nuclear forces.

There are two dynamics within the region that pose the biggest nuclear challenges to South Asia and the Indo-Pacific. The first, within Southern Asia, is the dynamic of states finding space to escalate at lower levels of conflict to address nuclear and military asymmetry. Pakistan is seeking to create space to escalate at lower levels of conflict against India, while India is doing the same against Pakistan on one side and China on the other. The second dynamic is a cascade effect of reactionary vertical proliferation that is occurring in the Indo-Pacific region. This second effect is a result of China and the United States’ strategic competition leading to nuclear modernization and vertical proliferation. The United States is reacting to China’s nuclear modernization, while China is increasing its nuclear forces to remain competitive with Washington. Meanwhile, the qualitative and quantitative increase in Chinese nuclear forces has led to an Indian response to shore up its second-strike capability and maintain a minimum deterrent against Beijing. Furthermore, Pakistan is, in turn, responding to India’s force modernization by strengthening its own nuclear forces and creating new spaces of asymmetric escalation against India to ensure that New Delhi’s modernization does not leave Pakistan at a strategic disadvantage. Nuclear submarine and other advanced military technology transfer arrangements between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (under the AUKUS agreement) have only added to this dynamic, with increased insecurity and uncertainty in the Indo-Pacific.

Creating New Spaces of Escalation: Doctrines and New Rocket Forces

Nuclear modernization in the India-Pakistan dyad has seen both sides seek to match the other at every level of the ladder of escalation. Pakistan’s nuclear forces have about 170 nuclear warheads; air- and ground-launched cruise missiles; and a host of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles.128 Its doctrine of “full-spectrum deterrence” accounts for the first use of short-range battlefield nuclear weapons—like the Hatf IX Nasr—against India’s conventional forces in a limited battlefield scenario. For Pakistan, this doctrine has been aimed at addressing its conventional military asymmetry with India.

Pakistan’s doctrine of full-spectrum deterrence seeks to ward off the possibility of conventional war with India. As Gen. Khalid Kidwai, one of the architects of the doctrine, stated: “Nasr, specifically, was born out of a compulsion of . . . some people on the other side toying with the idea of finding space for a conventional war, despite Pakistan’s nuclear weapons.”129 Specifically, this doctrine has targeted India’s ability to conduct conventional operations against Pakistan in response to lower-level—especially sub-conventional—escalation. Recent statements by Pakistani officials (including Gen. Kidwai) have led to concerns that Islamabad has now reduced the minimum range of its nuclear weapons to zero meters.130 This means that beyond tactical nuclear weapons, Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal might now include sub-kiloton nuclear projectiles like the Cold War–era Davy Crockett recoilless guns, or nuclear land mines that could either be detonated in place or travel very short distances.131

India has sought to match Islamabad with conventional and dual-use weapons at lower levels of escalation. New Delhi’s steady development of counterforce weapons systems—which are responsive, accurate, and shorter-range—has led scholars to believe that India’s “no first use” (NFU) doctrine may no longer apply to a conflict with Pakistan.132 This belief stems from the perspective that counterforce weapon systems tend to be associated with first-use nuclear doctrines. India might be tempted to move toward a counterforce nuclear doctrine that could match Pakistan’s potential use of battlefield nuclear weapons against conventional Indian forces. Such a strategy would aim to check Pakistan’s ability to use tactical nuclear weapons, thereby creating a space for conventional Indian responses to sub-conventional attacks from Pakistan. During the 2019 India-Pakistan crisis, for example, India responded to a terror attack on its territory at Pulwama with a conventional air attack on Balakot in Pakistan. Speaking about the potential threat of Pakistani nuclear escalation in response to India’s strike, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked, “What do we have then? Have we kept our nuclear bombs for Diwali (the festival of lights)?”133

In May 2025, when India and Pakistan fought a near-war conflict for four days, it became clear that both sides believe that they have carved out space under the nuclear umbrella to conduct conventional operations against each other. India now considers its new doctrine to be one of assured conventional response against sub-conventional terror attacks on its territory. After the conflict ended, Prime Minister Modi stated that New Delhi would not “tolerate any nuclear blackmail,” affirming that sub-nuclear conventional operations against Pakistan might be the new normal.134

India is increasingly demonstrating that it has two different strategies for its two nuclear competitors, and New Delhi’s nuclear strategy toward China has been considerably different. This is not surprising given that in this nuclear dyad, India is at the weaker end of conventional military asymmetry. Recent border skirmishes between the two states along the LAC in the Himalayas have led to territorial and military losses for India. Since the violent clashes in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, New Delhi has lost at least twenty army troops in combat against the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) forces, and has lost access to twenty-six of sixty-five patrolling points in Eastern Ladakh.135

Sino-Indian skirmishes along the LAC have continued intermittently since 2020, with the last major one in December 2022.136 Despite India’s military reinforcements at the LAC—with 50,000 additional troops deployed at the border since 2020—and plans to raise a new mountain division aimed at China, skirmishes continue to take place.137

To tackle the conventional military asymmetry against China, India is raising a new Integrated Rocket Force (IRF) aimed at creating space for conventional escalation against China.138 The IRF will be a conventional missile force with short- and long-range cruise and ballistic missiles, and India’s newly developed Pralay short-range (150–500km) ballistic missile is expected to be the mainstay of this force.139 Using a rocket force dedicated to conventional military action will likely allow India space to militarily engage the PLA along the LAC without escalation to the nuclear level. This room for conventional escalation has become increasingly important given China’s building of critical military infrastructure along the LAC, including a motorable bridge over the Pangong Tso Lake, underground bunkers, and hardened shelters for armored vehicles.140 Opening this space for conventional action by India will be central to its ability to deter and counter greater Chinese military action.

Key to this strategy is that both India and China have stated NFU policies. These policies have led to an expectation that any Sino-Indian confrontation at the conventional level would remain nonnuclear—assuming both sides conform to their stated nuclear doctrines. Scholars now doubt, however, whether either India or China would conform to their NFU pledges in time of war or crisis.141 India’s development of nuclear delivery capability suggests a hedging strategy that is aimed at maintaining strategic stability, continuing its overt commitment to its NFU pledge, and increasing its options to strike China if and when necessary.

India’s recent nuclear modernization has increased its ability to target China’s mainland; its Agni-V intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has a stated range of 5,000 kilometers.142 In March 2024, New Delhi successfully tested MIRV (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) technology on an Agni-V missile. This technology is aimed at bolstering India’s second-strike capability, and intended to hold Chinese cities at risk with an increased ability to penetrate Beijing’s missile defenses.143 India’s developing MIRV capability is designed, therefore, to establish a secure mutual nuclear vulnerability with China. This approach will help its IRF operate at the conventional military level—an expected solidification of strategic stability that will thus create space for conventional crisis escalation.144

Proliferation Cascade: From the Indo-Pacific to Southern Asia

The United States’ focus on competition with China in the Indo-Pacific has directly impacted nuclear stability in South Asia. While scholars previously suggested that a “strategic chain” connects Pakistan, India, China, and the United States, the relationship between these states today reflects more of a cascade of reactionary vertical proliferation.145 This dynamic is distinct from the Cold War–era nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, and is closer to a system of “spillover effects” from the nuclear modernization of one state to another.146 Indeed, it not clear that any of these states is aiming to attain nuclear superiority over the other. Rather, each is attempting to mitigate nuclear asymmetry and keep up with the force modernization of its adversaries.

This cascade has, at its start, the United States, which is currently modernizing its nuclear arsenal to address the two-peer nuclear threat posed by Russia and China.147 Next, China is increasing its nuclear forces and building new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos and nuclear submarines, seeking to address its nuclear asymmetry with the United States. Meanwhile, India’s increasingly hostile relationship with China has led it to focus its nuclear modernization efforts to address its increasing asymmetry with Beijing’s nuclear forces. Finally, India’s qualitative and quantitative improvements to its nuclear forces are increasing perceptions of nuclear asymmetry with Pakistan, leading to Pakistan’s nuclear force modernization and diversification in response.

In 2024, the United States announced that it has a stockpile of 3,748 nuclear warheads.148 Additionally, the US is conducting a wide-ranging nuclear modernization program that includes new warhead designs and weapon types.149 Competing with China is emerging as a critical pillar of the United States’ nuclear strategy. More than 60 percent of the United States’ ballistic missile submarine patrols occur in the Pacific and are aimed against China and North Korea.150 Furthermore, the United States’ 2023 bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission recommended that Washington increase the size and scope of its nuclear arsenal to “address the possibility that China will field large-scale, counterforce-capable missile forces that pose a threat to US strategic nuclear forces on par with the threat Russia poses to those forces today.”151

Suggestions of an expanded US strategic and tactical nuclear arsenal, along with wide-ranging advancements in missile-defense capability, have had an effect on China, which has responded to the United States’ strategic posture by significantly expanding its own nuclear forces.152 A recent report shows that Beijing is in the process of building about 350 new ballistic missile silos alongside numerous new strategic nuclear delivery systems.153 The total number of Chinese missile brigades has also increased. Beijing’s expanding silo-based ICBM force will increase its second-strike retaliatory capability, and China is expected to possess around 1,000 warheads by 2030.154 Additionally, China is developing more advanced nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and road- and rail-mobile ICBM systems, and has already deployed MIRVs on its ballistic missiles.155 According to military and diplomatic officials in Washington, this expansion of Chinese nuclear and missile arsenals might be with a view toward seeking qualitative and quantitative parity with the United States.156 From Beijing’s perspective, these developments are a result of the United States’ overt characterization of its relationship with China as one of “competition.”157 For the immediate future, as China aims to keep up in its competition with the United States, it is likely to continue with its nuclear force modernization and expansion.

China’s nuclear and missile advancements have led to response from India. New Delhi’s nuclear force development has been aimed toward addressing its asymmetry with China.158 With most of its deployed nuclear force already able to target all of Pakistan, India’s next generation of nuclear force development is aimed at mitigating the threat from Beijing. Its Agni family of land-based IRBMs—soon to be armed with MIRV-ed and MaRV (maneuverable reentry vehicle) warheads—is aimed at targeting different parts of China. While there has been no official confirmation on the next version of the missile, Agni VI, this version is expected to have a range of between 9,000 and 12,000 kilometers, with a three-ton nuclear payload.159 Beyond the Chinese mainland, this missile will aim to give India the capacity to strike Chinese targets—aircraft carriers and SSBNs—in the central Pacific Ocean and the southern Indian Ocean.160

In addition to increasing the capabilities of its land-based ballistic missiles, India is also increasing its sea-based nuclear capability, with the aim of having a more secure and dispersed second-strike capability against China and building up a greater naval footprint in the Indo-Pacific. In August 2024, the second SSBN of New Delhi’s nuclear triad, the INS Arighaat, was commissioned, substantially increasing India’s nuclear strike capacity.161 Along with India’s first SSBN—the INS Arihant—the Arighaat now forms a strategic naval force that will likely conduct regular deterrence patrols in the Indo-Pacific. India is building three more SSBNs that will be larger than the first two.162 Currently, India’s two SSBNs are armed with the K-15 Sagarika SLBMs, which have a range of 750 kilometers, a short range that severely limits India’s ability to strike China from the sea. To address this problem, India’s next two SSBNs will be armed with the K-4 SLBMs, with a striking range of 3,500 kilometers, and the yet-unnamed fifth SSBN is expected to carry the 5,000-kilometer-range K-5 SLBM.163

Finally, India’s nuclear force modernization and expansion of its nuclear forces has led to vertical proliferation in Pakistan. Pakistan is developing new delivery vehicles with the goal of seeking parity with India on the nuclear front, and its fissile materials and weapons arsenal are expected to continue growing.164 Its development of diverse delivery systems seeks to ensure that if India does abandon the NFU vis-à-vis Pakistan, it will not be able to conduct a “splendid” first strike (that is, a strike in which all of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are attacked, thus nullifying Islamabad’s ability to strike back). Pakistan’s building of road-mobile transporter erector launchers (TELs) and sea-launched cruise and ballistic missiles is aimed at dispersing its nuclear force to counter any such possibility.165

Additionally, in keeping with the dynamic of creating space for low-scale nuclear escalation to deter conventional attacks as a part of its full-spectrum deterrence strategy, Pakistan has developed ground-, air-, and sea-launched nuclear-capable short-range cruise missiles.166 Islamabad has also deployed tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs) in the form of the 60-kilometer-range Hatf IX Nasr ballistic missile. Pakistan’s TNWs have been developed to counter India’s “Cold Start” doctrine, which aimed to conduct proactive conventional military operations on Pakistani territory in response to sub-conventional attacks on Indian territory.167 Through both its nuclear doctrine and its development of advanced nuclear-delivery systems, Pakistan has sought to ensure that it is able to compete with India’s nuclear abilities, even if those capabilities may now be driven primarily by China’s actions.

This cascade of proliferation results directly from the United States’ competition with China. The more Washington centers the Indo-Pacific in its nuclear strategy, the more downstream effects there will likely be on other nuclear states, whether they are either directly in competition with the United States or with a rival that is also impacted by US nuclear strategy.

AUKUS and the Nuclearization of the Indo-Pacific

The United States has significant direct and indirect effects on the proliferation of nuclear and missile systems across the Indo-Pacific. Its AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom and Australia will give Canberra conventionally armed nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) in service of a “free and open” Indo-Pacific. While Pillar One of AUKUS deals with nuclear submarines, Pillar Two provides for the United States to share key technology (related to hypersonic missiles, electronic warfare, artificial intelligence, and advanced cyber capabilities) with its allies.168 This technology sharing, motivated by strategic competition with China, may lead to several downstream effects that are likely to intensify the risks of naval competition and proliferation in the Indo-Pacific and Southern Asia.

Consistent with the cascade dynamic, China will feel pressure to respond to AUKUS. Its Foreign Ministry has described the deal as a “wrong and dangerous path” that will “only motivate an arms race, damage the international nuclear nonproliferation regime, and harm regional stability and peace.”169 Of course, the AUKUS deal by itself will not lead to these outcomes. But China’s response to AUKUS likely will. Beijing’s new SSBNs—especially the Type 096—have made considerable qualitative technical advancements that make them a formidable change in the Indo-Pacific.170 A proliferation of United States, United Kingdom, and Australian SSNs because of AUKUS in the Indo-Pacific might put China’s six-boat SSBN force—and its second-strike capability—at risk. This dynamic could lead to a considerable increase in the number of Chinese SSNs and SSBNs developed over the next few years—a development that would, in turn, likely impact India’s projected SSBN and SSN force.

India’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific primarily focuses on its side of the western Indian Ocean and South Asia. However, it has a long-standing commitment to keeping the sea lines of communication free and open from the Gulf of Aden to the Straits of Malacca. Increased militarization of the Indo-Pacific via proliferation of nuclear submarines and other naval deployments by China—even if simply a response to AUKUS—will prompt India to develop its own naval capacity, and particularly, to consider an increase in its nuclear submarine force, specifically SSNs. Currently, India builds its own SSBNs but has leased out Akula-class SSNs from Russia intermittently since 1987. India plans on inducting one such leased SSN into its fleet by 2028 and is reportedly considering leasing a second submarine from Moscow as well.171 In addition, in 2024, India announced that it has started a program to build its own indigenous SSNs. The first of these submarines is expected to be deployed by 2037 and will, crucially, lead to increased Indian independence in the field of naval force projection.172

Once all five of India’s planned Arihant-class SSBNs are deployed and India moves toward a continuous-at-sea deterrence posture—as other navies with a similar force structure have—there will be a broader question of how this force operates and interacts with China’s nuclear submarines and forces in a nuclear-crowded Indo-Pacific. Will the QUAD grouping (which includes India, Japan, Australia, and United States) coordinate their naval strategies and SSN deployments in the Indo-Pacific? How will the United States and its allies view India’s use of leased-out Russian Akula submarines in the region?

Finally, an increased Indian naval force with nuclear submarines—both SSNs and SSBNs—is likely to threaten Pakistan’s access to and freedom of navigation in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Islamabad has been developing the sea-leg of its nuclear forces and has developed a nuclear-capable Babur sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) with a range of 450 kilometers to be deployed on its diesel-powered Agosta 90B submarines.173 An increase in India’s submarine forces may prompt Pakistan to consider increasing its naval forces as well. Importantly, the AUKUS deal has set a precedent for China to lease or sell nuclear-powered attack submarines to Pakistan if both states decide to pursue that path. Given Beijing and Islamabad’s long history of nuclear and missile cooperation—and common interest in checking India—this scenario could become more likely.

The United States needs to consider the downstream consequences of its Indo-Pacific nuclear strategy. Introducing more nuclear-powered submarines through other states and potentially deploying nuclear-armed cruise missiles on its own SSNs to enhance its ability to use tactical nuclear weapons in the Indo-Pacific will generate responses from its immediate nuclear competitors, whose responses will have their own effects on others.174 This scenario might continue—and exacerbate—proliferation and modernization cascades across the Indo-Pacific region.

Conclusion

Analysts suggest that the Indo-Pacific is “at the cusp of a new missile age, driven by perceptions of rising insecurity.”175 If this is true, then the dynamics leading to this insecurity must be understood. There are three main drivers of proliferation and insecurity in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific: the dynamic of creating spaces of escalation under the shadow of nuclear weapons; proliferation cascades resulting from great power competition; and the risk of naval buildup precipitated by AUKUS.176 Each of these drivers share underlying elements—reaction-driven vertical proliferation and modernization of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems—that amplify regional insecurity and must be addressed.

Thus far, competition has been the driving force behind United States–China tensions, intensifying the security dilemma between both states.177 This dynamic is now generating spillover effects in other regions, like South Asia. From the United States’ perspective, then, deemphasizing the nuclear aspect of its competition with China in the Indo-Pacific could have a stabilizing effect on the unfolding regional cascade of proliferation.

Central to nuclear delivery-system proliferation and modernization is the question of nuclear posture. The expansion of nuclear delivery systems in both China and India—with varying ranges, payloads, and accuracies—suggests that these states are reducing the threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons and might each be tempted to abandon their NFU policies in the future.178 Scholars have suggested that NFU policies might not hold much weight anyway—that is, they are “cheap talk” when it comes to a war or nuclear crisis.179 So far, however, both China’s and India’s NFU policies have had greater weight because they are coupled with nuclear postures characterized by a lack of numerical and qualitative capacity to strike their adversaries first. These capacities are now changing, such that both China and India might possess first-strike capability soon. This development may tempt both states to abandon their NFU policies. If more first use-oriented weapon systems are introduced in the Indo-Pacific, rather than states simply shoring up their second-strike capabilities, we might see more of a Cold War–type arms race dynamic among the region’s nuclear weapons states.

Finally, given the proliferation of missile systems and nuclear submarines, there is growing risk of serious accidents and inadvertent escalation. During the Cold War, nuclear missile submarines collided with each other in the ocean, sometimes significantly damaging each other.180 More recently, in 2009, two nuclear-armed SSBNs—the British HMS Vanguard and the French Le Triomphant—collided deep in the Atlantic Ocean.181 A greater number of SSNs and SSBNs in the Indo-Pacific will only raise the likelihood of such accidents. On the missile front, in 2022, India accidentally fired a supersonic BrahMos cruise missile into Pakistan.182 The missile was not armed, and a major escalation was averted, but the incident highlighted the risks of inadvertent escalation among nuclear adversaries, emphasizing the need to have better missile safety management and crisis communication. Widespread missile proliferation in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia is therefore another area where mechanisms will be needed to mitigate the risks of rising insecurity.

5. MENA at the Threshold? Proliferation Risks and Great Power Competition

Nicole Grajewski and Jane Darby Menton

This article situates the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in the global nuclear order, emphasizing how the region has both challenged and spurred adaptations in international nuclear governance for decades. It then examines two pressing contemporary issues: the uncertain trajectory of Iran’s nuclear program after Israeli and US military strikes in June 2025, and the anticipated expansion of nuclear energy across MENA, which could also result in more countries with capabilities that would be conducive to pursuing the bomb. Both developments underscore the difficulties of managing nuclear latency in a conflict-prone region, where tensions among local actors inflect nuclear decision-making. While there are opportunities to mitigate these challenges, and principles that policymakers should follow in addressing them, nuclear aspirations are likely to remain a prominent feature of MENA’s security landscape so long as underlying tensions between regional actors remain unresolved.

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) occupy a unique and volatile position within the global nuclear order. At the heart of this dynamic lies a long history of challenges to international nuclear governance, coupled with Israel’s status as the region’s sole nuclear-armed state and the only MENA country that operates outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a position that has both resulted from and contributed to the region’s pervasive security dilemmas. Israel’s undeclared arsenal; proliferation attempts in states including Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Syria; and regional counterproliferation practices, including kinetic attacks on nuclear infrastructure, have fueled insecurity and motivated latent nuclear ambitions across MENA for generations.

Today, the region faces two nuclear challenges that demand urgent attention from policymakers and scholars alike. First, as this article goes to press in early July 2025, the long-simmering Iranian nuclear crisis appears to be at an inflection point. For years, Iran has been a “threshold state,” meaning that it would be capable of building nuclear weapons relatively quickly if it chose to do so. Efforts to contain the program diplomatically stalled after the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J",https://tnsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7642581-downsized-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 18:03:18.163727

Specifically, section 1822 of the FY26 House NDAA would enable the commercial best practice of permitting advance payments and allow Federal agencies to access cutting-edge technologies more quickly.
However, as the conference considers section 863 in the FY26 House NDAA and section 836 in the FY26 Senate NDAA, we encourage you to carefully consider the implications and unintended consequences of the IP mandates included in these provisions.
The Chamber thanks you for your work on the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act.","Dear Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Member Smith:

As the House and Senate work over the coming weeks to reconcile differences among each chamber's respective version of the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stands ready to work with you to advance policies that ensure our servicemembers have the capabilities and certainty they need by making it easier for American businesses of all sizes to work with the Department of War (the Department).

Among the many provisions we support, we highlight the following:

Acquisition Reform: We applaud both the House and Senate for taking crucial steps to address the burdensome, outdated acquisition process within the Department. The Chamber has long supported multi-year procurement contracts and efforts to involve businesses of all sizes in the acquisition process.

Additionally, the Chamber supports section 1832 of the FY26 House NDAA to create a “data-as-a-service solutions for weapons system contracts."" This approach would give the Department flexibility in identifying the intellectual property (IP) required to sustain a program over its lifecycle, while also adjusting to the ever-evolving threat landscape.

We also support efforts to reform the foreign military sales process. As the Chamber testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 15, 2025, “the foreign military sales process is cumbersome and after nearly three decades of attempts, no meaningful reforms have been made. Together, industry and government can change that.”[1]

[1]https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/to-receive-testimony-on-the-department-of-defense-responsibilities-related-to-foreign-military-sales-system-and-international-armaments-cooperation

Accordingly, we are encouraged by section 908 of the FY26 Senate NDAA that provides a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Cooperation within the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to focus on the execution of contracts and section 1259 of the Senate text that establishes a foreign military sales continuous process improvement board that would include industry experts not employed by the Department or registered as federal lobbyists.

AUKUS: The U.S. Chamber is proud to be one of four U.S. industry associations serving on a working group related to the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS). We are encouraged to see both the House and Senate texts recognize the vital importance of this partnership in deterring threats in the Indo-Pacific region, as industry needs consistent and strong demand signals from all three AUKUS member governments to make meaningful investments and ensure the pact’s success.

Space: To maintain America’s leadership in space, the Chamber continues to encourage commercial innovation, private-public partnerships, and a supportive regulatory environment. Specifically, section 1822 of the FY26 House NDAA would enable the commercial best practice of permitting advance payments and allow Federal agencies to access cutting-edge technologies more quickly. This section will let Federal agencies lock in favorable pricing and leverage services over time and as-needed, rather than being constrained by fiscal year–end deadlines. We commend the House for section 1604 that directs the Secretary of the Air Force to establish the tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking (TacSRT) program as a program of record, and the Senate for its language in section 1505 that requires competition from multiple vendors to maximize resilience and interoperability with Department of War systems in the acquisition of space-based data. The Chamber also supports provisions in section 1605 of the House text and section 1502 of the Senate text to study national needs for future space launch capacity.

PFAS: We applaud the House for including language to delay the deadline for phasing out Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) used by the military. Additionally, we support several provisions in the Senate text including:

Section 315 granting authority to the Department to destroy or dispose of perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances;

Section 316 to modify restrictions on procurement or purchasing of personal protective equipment for firefighters;

Section 318 to repeal the restrictions of DoD’s procurement of certain products containing PFAS, including nonstick cookware, furniture, and carpets; and section 319 to repeal the temporary moratorium on incineration by the Department of PFAS and AFFF.

The Chamber believes the NDAA would be improved if amended in several key areas:

Protecting Intellectual Property: The U.S. Chamber shares the goal of ensuring our warfighters have the tools necessary to fight and win on the battlefield, which includes the ability to maintain and repair weapons systems. However, as the conference considers section 863 in the FY26 House NDAA and section 836 in the FY26 Senate NDAA, we encourage you to carefully consider the implications and unintended consequences of the IP mandates included in these provisions. We are concerned that the inclusion of these mandates would unnecessarily harm our traditional defense companies, deter non-traditional and commercial firms from entering and sustaining the defense industrial base, chill investment, and stifle the defense tech innovation that the Department seeks. If adopted as drafted, this language would make the broader private sector less inclined to serve the defense market, reducing competition and risking slower sustainment and repair.

Instead, we urge the conference to adopt the “data-as-a-service"" approach included in the House text. Additionally, we believe the Department already has existing authorities[2]

[2]https://www.ndia.org/-/media/sites/ndia/policy/ip-and-data-rights/ip-and-data-rights-white-paper.pdf?download=1?download=1

with regards to data rights and IP that can help achieve the same goals.

Non-Traditional Defense Contractors: We welcome efforts to broaden industrial participation in the defense industrial base. However, we caution the conference against putting into law any language that favors any sector or business type. A level playing field, open to small businesses, mid-tiers, commercial innovators, and traditional defense suppliers alike, is essential to ensure that the industrial base can operate on a wartime footing. An open, competitive market that welcomes every capable supplier is essential to mobilize at speed and deliver for the warfighter.

Cybersecurity: The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) expires on September 30, 2025 and requires reauthorization. Without renewal, the U.S. will face a more complex and dangerous security landscape. Important provisions of CISA 2015 include:

(a) a framework that enables private entities to share cyber threat information with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework, which allows defenders to improve their security measures and complicates attackers' operations;

(b) protections for businesses related to public disclosure, regulatory issues, and antitrust matters, which encourage the timely exchange of information between public and private entities without fear of legal repercussions; and

(c) strong measures to safeguard privacy and civil liberties, ensuring that the sharing of information does not infringe on the rights of individuals.

The Chamber advocates for a multi-year reauthorization of this essential law. Both the private sector and the government need certainty, including the ability to allocate resources for long-term cybersecurity planning and implementation. House and Senate leaders and the Trump administration have expressed strong support for reauthorizing CISA 2015.

The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP) also expires September 30, 2025. Inaction on its reauthorization will disrupt, stall, and unwind meaningful progress made by state and local cybersecurity entities and professionals that are protecting our nation’s most critical assets. Nation-state actors are persistently targeting U.S. critical infrastructure and systems at the state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government levels, seeking to conduct espionage, disrupt essential services, and erode public trust. State and local governments overseeing the function of essential services and infrastructure, such as energy, water, transportation, and healthcare, among others, are in dire need of federal support. Without continued funding, state and local governments will be left without the support necessary to engage in meaningful efforts to improve cyber resilience in support of the American citizens who rely on these services. The Chamber supports full reauthorization of the SLCGP.

Protecting Americans from Russian Litigation: U.S. businesses are being unfairly targeted in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Russian courts, for their good faith compliance with U.S. sanctions and export controls. U.S. law currently provides no protection for enforcement of foreign judgments that are issued due to such compliance, which often spurs from companies exiting the Russian market (or related contractual activities). The Chamber urges inclusion of Senate Amendment 3903 in the FY26 NDAA to protect U.S. businesses by closing the loophole in U.S. federal law that allows enforcement of these foreign judgments and functions as a Russian countersanction.

Housing: America’s housing market continues to suffer from a severe shortage of over 4.7 million homes[3]

[3]https://www.uschamber.com/economy/the-state-of-housing-in-america

, which has created cascading economic and social challenges impacting both the civilian and military workforce. To help address the housing crisis, we encourage the conference to include Senate Amendment 3777, the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act, in the FY26 NDAA.

Second Chance Act: As we work to address America’s workforce needs, the Chamber continues to support reauthorization of the Second Chance Act and encourages the conference to include Senate Amendment 3435 in the FY26 NDAA. This will help increase career training and employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals giving these individuals second chances while reducing recidivism, driving economic growth, and bolstering the workforce.

The Chamber thanks you for your work on the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act. We believe passage of this bipartisan legislation is critical to both keeping our nation safe and meeting America’s national security commitments.

Sincerely,

Neil L. Bradley

NJ, UNITED STATES, September 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Genuine Heating & Cooling has published a new, easy-to-understand guide for consumers. It explains how new air-source heat pumps can significantly cut down on energy costs. These systems also offer both heating and cooling from one unit. The guide points out that highly efficient heat pumps can lower utility bills by 20–40 percent. This is compared to old oil heaters or electric resistance heaters. This applies to heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18–20+ and Heating Seasonal Performance Factors (HSPF) above 9. These systems can reverse their operation. This means they warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. You won't need separate furnaces and air conditioners anymore.

“Many homeowners still think heat pumps are only for mild weather,” the guide explains. “But new models for cold weather now provide full heating even when it's very cold outside, below –13 °F.” This technology works by moving heat, not by creating it. This makes it much more efficient than burning fuel or using electric coils. Heat pumps run on electricity. In New Jersey, more and more electricity comes from renewable sources. So, heat pumps also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This helps shrink a home’s carbon footprint.

Besides saving energy, the guide shows many life advantages of heat pumps. Modern units run quietly, typically 40–55 decibels outdoors. They don't need oil deliveries or propane tanks. Homeowners might qualify for good financial help. The New Jersey Clean Energy Program gives rebates of up to $2,000 for certain heat pump installations. Federal tax credits cover 30 percent of costs, up to $2,000. The guide also says installation usually takes 1–3 days. This includes a professional calculation of your home's needs, picking the right system, and handling permits.

The costs are clear. Installing a single-zone ductless heat pump can cost $4,000–$7,500. Multi-zone systems for an entire home can range from $10,000–$20,000 or more. Replacing an old furnace and central AC with a ducted heat pump costs about $12,000–$18,000. Prices depend on the system's size, how efficient it is, how many zones you need, and how complex the installation is. However, rebates and tax credits significantly reduce these upfront costs.

Tuesday is when the FAST Act's HOV exemption for EV drivers ends.
In California, EV drivers will not be ticketed for HOV lane violations until 60 days after the exemption expires under the California Vehicle Code.
In September, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., introduced companion legislation to extend the authorization for certain alternative fuel vehicles to use HOV lanes.
“Congress should pass this HOV extension plan before the September 30 deadline and keep current — and future — EV drivers in the fast lane.”","More than a million electric vehicle drivers are about to lose access to a key perk.

Starting Wednesday, unless they have the required number of passengers, EV drivers in 12 states will no longer be able to use high-occupancy vehicle lanes once a provision in the 2015 U.S. highway and infrastructure bill ends with the conclusion of the federal fiscal year.

Here’s what you need to know:

In Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia, single drivers of EVs can use high-occupancy vehicle lanes, according to the U.S. Energy Department's Alternative Fuels Data Center. The programs vary from state to state, with some drivers gaining access through a decal and others with special permits or transponders.

Initially authorized through the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act, low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles with a single occupant have been allowed in HOV lanes since 2005. In 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation, or FAST, Act extended the ability for states to allow EVs’ carpool lane access for 10 years.

Ordinarily, HOV lanes are only accessible to vehicles with at least two or three passengers, but the FAST Act granted an exemption from that rule to incentivize the adoption of low-emissions and energy-efficient vehicles.

By increasing EV adoption, states were able to improve air quality and ease congestion in regular traffic lanes, while EV drivers were able to cut their commute times — helping justify the cost difference of an EV compared with a traditional gas-powered car, according to the Electric Vehicle Association.

Tuesday is when the FAST Act's HOV exemption for EV drivers ends.

States that allowed the clean vehicle exemption will start to enforce the federal HOV occupancy rule of at least two or three passengers starting Wednesday, according to the U.S. Transportation Department. In California, EV drivers will not be ticketed for HOV lane violations until 60 days after the exemption expires under the California Vehicle Code.

Penalties for drivers who violate HOV lane rules vary from state to state but usually result in a ticket and demerit points on the driver's license. In California, the penalty for illegally driving in the HOV lane is $490, according to the state's Department of Transportation. In Arizona, the minimum fine is $400, according to the state's DOT.

Yes. In August, U.S. Reps. Greg Standon, D-Ariz., and Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., introduced the HOV Lane Exemption Reauthorization Act to extend the HOV lane exemption program under the Transportation Department through 2031.

In September, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., introduced companion legislation to extend the authorization for certain alternative fuel vehicles to use HOV lanes. Co-sponsored by Sens. John Curtis, R-Utah, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., the bill would amend Title 23 of the United States Code that regulates the national highway system.

In the House, the legislation is stuck in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In the Senate, it is currently with the Committee on Environment and Public Works. The bills are unlikely to get traction amid a larger federal funding fight that could shut down the government at the end of Tuesday.

The HOV Lane Exemption Reauthorization Act is supported by the Center for Transportation and the Environment; the Electric Drive Transportation Association; the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association; the Renewable Fuels Association; The Transport Project; the Zero Emission Transportation Association; and the main auto industry trade group the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

“What could be less controversial than cleaner air through lower emissions; faster commutes; and a program that encourages customers to choose advanced vehicle technology?” Alliance for Automotive Innovation President and CEO John Bozzella said in a blog post earlier this month. “Congress should pass this HOV extension plan before the September 30 deadline and keep current — and future — EV drivers in the fast lane.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/EV_HOV_lane_access,N,,2025-09-29 17:03:05.727704

California, in tax year 2023, filmed 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit.
Altogether, the buyers in those top three states claimed a total $1.5 billion in federal EV tax credits that year.
So, with the elimination of the $7,500 federal credit, EV buyers would have to hang onto their vehicles longer to justify the higher purchase price from the outset.
At this point, it’s unclear exactly how losing the tax credit will impact the new EV market.","If you’re really still thinking about buying a new EV, you need to drop what you’re doing right now.

Although it’s been creeping up for a little while, you know how it goes: Some folks are still in the market for an EV, but haven’t yet pulled the trigger before the $7,500 federal tax credit expires on September 30. Well, it’s September 29, so if you really are still on the fence, here’s a piece of advice. Stop what you’re doing, and take advantage for the literal hours you have left to do so.

For everyone else, this point is more a period of reflection than anything else. After President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, he set a ticking clock for the US government’s — and taxpayers’ — subsidy of new, American-built electric cars and trucks. But how much did Americans actually take advantage of the federal tax credit? Thanks to a new analysis over at LendingTree, we have a better idea.

In tax year 2023 alone, the last year in this particular study, some 487,990 American EV shoppers saved a combined $3.3 billion. No surprises as to which EVs rounded out the top three choices among those buyers (Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3 and Chevrolet Equinox EV) or which states filed the most claims (California, Texas and Florida — the three most populous states).

California, in tax year 2023, filmed 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit. That is by far and away the highest total, representing nearly one-third (32.2%) of all claims that year across the US. Texas, even being in second place, saw 38,870 claims (or 8% of the total by comparison). Florida came in close to Texas with 30,090 claims (6.2%). Altogether, the buyers in those top three states claimed a total $1.5 billion in federal EV tax credits that year. The average amount of new-vehicle credit was $6,709 of the maximum $7,500, as not all buyers had the sort of tax liability necessary to actually claim that upper limit.

Ostensibly, the tax credits were supposed to help interested buyers cope with the higher up-front costs compared to an equivalent internal combustion vehicle. With the federal incentive disappearing, high-priced EVs are going to be a tougher sell, especially as all new vehicles continue to get more expensive with each passing year. Whether you’re shopping for either type of vehicle, though, the calculus of ownership boils down to up-front costs versus what you’ll spend over the time you plan to keep the vehicle. So, with the elimination of the $7,500 federal credit, EV buyers would have to hang onto their vehicles longer to justify the higher purchase price from the outset.

At this point, it’s unclear exactly how losing the tax credit will impact the new EV market. By extension, any changes in the fortunes of the new car market could also affect the used market, so values could be all over the place as we all adjust to the new reality. While the federal tax credit will be gone after tomorrow, September 30, some states may still keep their credits in place, too, so you may still be able to save some money…just not as much as you’ve been able to these past few years.",http://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tesla-EV-Tax-Credit-Countdown.webp,N,,2025-09-29 16:03:14.757827

,Texas American Energy ,2025-09-29 19:42:32+00:00,RealClearEnergy,All of the Above Energy or Best of the Above: Conservatives' Way Forward | RealClearEnergy,Stephen Perkins,,,,,https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2025/09/29/all_of_the_above_energy_or_best_of_the_above_conservatives_way_forward_1137846.html,"In recent years, conservatives have proudly championed “all of the above” energy as the most practical path for meeting energy demand, strengthening reliability, and lowering emissions.
With the world’s energy demand surging at unprecedented rates, limiting our energy resources is self-sabotage, not prudence.
An all-of-the-above energy approach does not mean pursuing all energy sources without a strategy, nor does it mean ignoring affordability and reliability.
Hydropower, geothermal, and other energy sources will also play integral parts in meeting our energy demand and satisfying the energy trilemma.
The future of American energy is all of the above: the only correct foundation for an affordable, reliable, and clean energy landscape.","In recent years, conservatives have proudly championed “all of the above” energy as the most practical path for meeting energy demand, strengthening reliability, and lowering emissions. Yet, during a House hearing regarding recent actions by the Department of Energy, “all of the above” seemed to morph into “best of the above.”

Of course, we shouldn’t support every energy source simply for the sake of inclusivity or box-checking. But if we’re serious about solving the energy trilemma –affordable, reliable, and clean–we need every tool available. With the world’s energy demand surging at unprecedented rates, limiting our energy resources is self-sabotage, not prudence. The proliferation of AI is here, which mandates an era of rapid “energy addition,” in the words of Secretary Chris Wright.

An all-of-the-above energy approach does not mean pursuing all energy sources without a strategy, nor does it mean ignoring affordability and reliability. In fact, an all-of-the-above strategy inherently produces a more affordable and reliable energy landscape.

Take my home state of Texas, for example. The world leader in oil and gas, Texas also leads the country in wind energy production and had a record year for solar installations in 2023. In fact, during hot summer days in June of this year, wind and solar provided more than 40% of the electricity for necessities like air conditioning. Since Winter Storm Uri caused widespread blackouts across the state, we’ve put considerable work into bolstering energy reliability and resilience–ensuring we would never again experience what we did in February 2021.

Texas remains one of the best examples of a successful all-of-the-above strategy, but it’s not the only state taking advantage of renewable energy sources while maintaining traditional energy. Iowa, for example, is a leader in wind energy, producing nearly 60% of its electricity with wind power. This is in addition to – not at the expense of – its significant natural gas industry. In fact, this combination has allowed Iowa to routinely produce more energy than it consumes, meaning the state can contribute to regional power grids.

Diversifying our energy portfolio is not just good for reducing emissions or protecting our environment. Just like anything else, putting all our eggs into one basket – or one energy source, in this case – is a recipe for energy insecurity and disaster. Just as environmentalists promise that wind and solar could meet all of our energy needs, relying entirely on fossil fuels would be a grave mistake. Promoting a strategy that takes advantage of all available energy sources where they work best will pave the way for a more abundant future. By relying on a multitude of sources for our energy needs, we’re more prepared in the event of one source going offline.

Arguments against all of the above ignore the reality that we need more energy, period, and we should pursue this goal with all the tools in our arsenal. It’s time to set aside our preconceived notions or biases when it comes to certain forms of energy: we need every source in our arsenal if we’re going to meet our historic energy demand, keep prices for families low, and stay competitive globally. In particular, renewable energy demand and deployment is exploding worldwide, but China is currently dominating these markets. This poses a massive threat, so we must prioritize beating China in energy deployment on the world stage. To that end, we should not be focused on picking winners and losers in the energy market, but rather focus on robust permitting reform to unlock all American energy.

While renewables like wind and solar are inherently intermittent sources, they are remarkably affordable, quick to install, and provide clean energy to the grid. Natural gas, in turn, is a highly reliable and affordable energy source, while producing 50% fewer emissions than coal. In fact, the shale boom has done more than any other tactic to reduce energy-related emissions. Clean and reliable nuclear energy will be instrumental to meeting our energy demand, but there is still work to be done to ensure we can cost-effectively and quickly build new nuclear projects. Hydropower, geothermal, and other energy sources will also play integral parts in meeting our energy demand and satisfying the energy trilemma.

Limiting choice and interfering with the direction of the market is the exact opposite of a conservative approach to bolstering American energy. By unleashing the power of all energy sources, we’re ensuring that our energy grids are more robust and more secure in the face of extreme weather events and other external factors.

The future of American energy is all of the above: the only correct foundation for an affordable, reliable, and clean energy landscape. The Trump Administration and Congress must work to make this strategy a reality for the American people.

As the deadline approaches, some customers are reportedly jumping at the opportunity to buy an EV before the tax credit is gone.

“We knew with the Sept. 30 deadline, it was now or never, so we did it,” Dan McGrath of Cincinnati told The New York Times. ”The car became much more affordable with the tax credit.”

Thousands of others are making the same decision. According to data obtained by the Times, EV sales increased 18% last month to nearly 150,000 vehicles. Industry experts predict another jump this month.

Automakers to embrace more hybrid and gas vehicles

Analysts, however, expect EV sales to begin to decline after the current surge, and auto manufacturers are likely to shift production toward more hybrids, as well as gas and diesel vehicles.

Tesla and Rivian, meanwhile, may endure rough patches as the tax credit expires. They gained billions from electric vehicle subsidies under the Biden administration and currently offer no gas or diesel vehicles.

However, industry analysts suggest that sales may eventually rebound, as they did in Europe after EV subsidies expired in some EU nations a couple of years ago. But in the short term, they said it’s likely a gloomy outlook for EVs.

“Next year could be a pretty dreadful year for EVs in this country,” Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, said earlier this month.

Automakers have cut production of some EVs, suspended or canceled new models and shifted toward more gasoline and hybrid automobiles.

Shifting policy prompts change

Eliminating the tax credit marks the end of an embrace of cleaner energy under former President Joe Biden and the introduction of new policies under Trump.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress largely oppose subsidies for EVs, and Trump has expressed skepticism toward climate change science. He has dubbed Biden’s former policies on energy the “green new scam.”

Electric cars with performance, range, and tech that deliver on promises

For years, automakers have promised that EVs would change the way we drive. Too often, the reality has fallen short. Range anxiety, glacial charging times, and uninspiring cabins left many shoppers skeptical. But 2025 and 2026 models are different. This new wave of electric vehicles doesn’t just check the boxes they’re genuinely desirable machines. After driving them back-to-back, here are five EVs that prove you don’t need to compromise excitement for electrification.

Why does this matter right now?

The EV market is in a tug-of-war between ambition and reality. Consumers are wary after hearing stories of chargers that don’t work and ranges that vanish in winter. Yet the latest crop, including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E GT and Lucid’s Air Pure, shows that manufacturers are finally addressing these pain points. These vehicles combine fast charging, confident range, and tech that feels genuinely useful. They’re here at the exact moment when the $7,500 EV tax credit is expiring for many models, meaning buyers are scrambling to make decisions quickly.

Consider the Lucid Air Pure: whisper-quiet on the highway, cathedral-like inside, and capable of over-the-air updates to stay current. Or the Kia EV6 GT-Line, which can add hundreds of miles of range in the time it takes to do your grocery run. These cars are arriving just as shoppers demand evidence that EVs can truly replace their gas-powered counterparts.

How does it compare to rivals?

Each of these five goes head-to-head with rivals and proves competitive in ways that matter:

Ford Mustang Mach-E GT: Muscle-car acceleration with family-friendly practicality. Against Tesla’s Model Y, it feels more emotional and less clinical.

Kia EV6 GT-Line AWD: Blends real-world usability with charging speeds that shame more expensive German brands. Compared with the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the EV6 leans sportier and more premium. (See: Acura ADX vs BMW X1 and Audi Q3: Which SUV Wins?)

Polestar 3: A minimalist Swedish design with German-like chassis seriousness. It rivals BMW’s iX but feels less ostentatious and more grounded.

Genesis GV60: Premium quirk with delightful design cues. More playful than a Mercedes EQE SUV and significantly less expensive.

Lucid Air Pure: Highway serenity and cutting-edge software. While Tesla still has the network advantage, Lucid proves luxury EVs can be innovative without compromise.

Even compared with the competition’s brightest, these five hold their ground. They are not future promises, they’re here, and they’re good.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

These EVs suit a wide spectrum of buyers. Commuters who demand quiet luxury will gravitate toward the Lucid Air Pure. Enthusiasts wanting muscle-car vibes will love the Mach-E GT. The Polestar 3 appeals to drivers who want minimalist elegance and European precision. Kia’s EV6 GT-Line hits the sweet spot for families balancing price and practicality, while the Genesis GV60 caters to those seeking premium style with a playful edge.

Who should skip? Road-trippers outside of strong charging networks may still find EVs inconvenient. Those needing heavy towing or large cargo capacities will be better served by traditional SUVs and trucks, at least until EV infrastructure catches up.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term story here is that EVs are finally maturing. Over-the-air updates ensure cars like the Polestar 3 and Lucid Air Pure won’t feel outdated in three years. Ford, Kia, and Genesis are all expanding their software cadence, so buyers can trust their investments won’t stagnate. This marks a turning point: EVs that deliver not only on eco-credibility but also on excitement.

The industry has promised “the year of the EV” for a decade. This lineup suggests it’s finally happening. Automakers who fail to offer this combination of performance, charging, and comfort will risk losing buyers not only in the short term but also in the critical long game.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/09/5evs.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-29 17:03:10.205787

With more than 10 active coal power plants in Texas, this delay would add more than 2,800 tons of coal ash wastewater pollution to our environment – a 122% increase.

In 2024, the EPA updated the Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) to include stronger protections against coal ash wastewater pollution that enters streams, creeks, and lakes. Coal ash wastewater discharges contain heavy metals and toxins like mercury and arsenic that can cause increased risk of liver and kidney damage, cardiovascular illnesses, cancers, and developmental delays in children.

The Biden-era rule would require coal-burning power plants to eliminate these harmful discharges by 2029, or else commit by the end of this year to cease burning coal by 2034. Today, the EPA under the Trump Administration proposed extending both the compliance deadline and the end-of-year notice deadline—meaning coal plants would be allowed to continue discharging toxic wastewater under weaker standards for several more years.

According to the Sierra Club’s Trump Coal Pollution Dashboard, a delay of last year’s ELG updates would add over 325,000 tons of toxic pollution to public waterways nationwide every year – a 64 percent increase.

In response, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Organizer James Perkins issued the following statement:

“Today’s proposal sends a clear message: people’s health simply doesn’t matter to our federal government. Communities across Texas are pleading for cleaner air and water, but the EPA’s latest slap in the face will give wealthy polluters more time to comply with basic cleanup requirements for dangerous coal ash pollution of our water. Keep in mind they’ve already had enough time to prepare for this deadline – why should they get more if our health is on the line?

Actions by the Energy and Interior departments and the Environmental Protection Agency follow executive orders Trump issued in April to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Environmental groups denounced the actions, which come as the Trump administration has clamped down on renewable energy, including freezing permits for offshore wind projects, ending clean energy tax credits and blocking wind and solar projects on federal lands.

Under Trump’s orders, the Energy Department has required fossil-fueled power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep operating past their retirement dates to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The latest announcement would allow those efforts to expand as a precaution against possible electricity shortfalls.

Trump also has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands. A sweeping tax bill approved by Republicans and signed by Trump reduces royalty rates for coal mining from 12.5% to 7%, a significant decrease that officials said will help ensure U.S. coal producers can compete in global markets.

‘Mine, baby, mine’

The new law also mandates increased availability for coal mining on federal lands and streamlines federal reviews of coal leases.

“Everybody likes to say, ‘drill, baby, drill.’ I know that President Trump has another initiative for us, which is ‘mine, baby, mine,’” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at a news conference Monday at Interior headquarters. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Energy Undersecretary Wells Griffith also spoke at the event. All three agencies signed orders boosting coal.

“By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,” Burgum said.

Zeldin called coal a reliable energy source that has supported American communities and economic growth for generations.

“Americans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable,” he said.

Trump has clamped down on renewable energy

Environmental groups said Trump was wasting federal tax dollars by handing them to owners of the oldest, most expensive and dirtiest source of electricity.

“Subsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century – and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.’'

Solar, wind and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to bring new power to the grid, Kelly and other advocates said. “It makes no sense to cut off your best, most affordable options while doubling down on the most expensive ones,” Kelly said.

EPA eases pollution rules

The EPA said Monday it will delay seven deadlines related to wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The industry has complained that regulations imposed under the Biden administration were costly and designed to speed the closure of coal plants.

Coal ash, the waste from burning coal, can leach into groundwater and spread toxins. The Biden administration said the rules were aimed at keeping arsenic and lead out of well water, lowering cancer rates and avoiding disastrous spills.

“Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,’' said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to “protect America’s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.”

Coal production has dropped steeply

Burgum, who also chairs Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure “abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.’'

The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there’s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.

“As electricity demand skyrockets, smart energy policies that help keep the lights on are more important than ever,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “Today’s announcements give electric co-ops important flexibility to reliably meet growing energy needs at a cost local families and businesses can afford. In recent years, misguided energy policies have forced essential power plants off the grid, while electricity demand surged. We thank the administration for moving swiftly to respond to growing energy needs with an emphasis on new tools, flexibility and a pro-energy policy agenda.”

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation projected that peak power needs are expected to increase 17% over the next 10 years, and newly announced projects—particularly data centers—will drive that number even higher. In the meantime, more than 115,000 megawatts of always-available generation—enough to power about 100 million homes—is expected to retire over the next decade.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association is the national trade association representing nearly 900 local electric cooperatives. From growing suburbs to remote farming communities, electric co-ops serve as engines of economic development for 42 million Americans across 56 percent of the nation’s landscape. As local businesses built by the consumers they serve, electric cooperatives have meaningful ties to rural America and invest $15 billion annually in their communities.

The more young people are energized about the future of American energy production, the better for our future.
Even more so, we need an optimistic energy workforce that sees American energy as an opportunity to win, not a problem to be solved.","Throughout the first nine months of the Trump Administration, “energy dominance” has been the agenda. To win the artificial intelligence (AI) race, ensure energy reliability for Americans, and beat China on the world stage, we need more energy – period.

But we can’t do it without America’s young people. Fortunately, it’s a dynamic time to get involved with the energy sector—from robust American leadership in traditional energy sources to developments in advanced nuclear technology to a burgeoning geothermal industry. Adding electrons to the grid has never been more exciting.

Because of all these developments and exploding energy demand, the energy sector continues to grow, and we need promising talent to join its ranks. Innovative companies across the country are hiring young people to craft the future of American energy. Oklo, for instance, is in the process of building next-generation nuclear reactors. Fervo Energy is harnessing the heat under the earth’s crust to produce geothermal power. First Solar is establishing American supply chains and manufacturing for solar panels. Deploying a diverse array of energy sources to fuel Americans’ lives will foster a more secure grid and increased reliability.

Many young Americans, though, don’t know about the work going on in the energy industry. Or, worse, they have a deep misunderstanding of how energy is produced and why we need it. Flipping on a light switch is one thing. Understanding where our precious energy comes from is another thing entirely. In our national discourse, a false dichotomy of “100% renewables” versus “drill, baby, drill” has emerged, deeply dividing politicians and the American people.

Rather than limiting our energy choices, pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy will best serve our energy sector and our nation as a whole. With American leadership in all forms of energy—from traditional sources to renewable technologies—we can lower electricity prices, dominate emerging technologies, and reduce global emissions. Every energy source has trade-offs, but by analyzing each through the trilemma of “affordable, reliable, and clean,” the right balance can be achieved.

This message must be shared with our nation’s young people. Energy literacy, defined by the Department of Energy as “an understanding of the nature and role of energy in the world and daily lives,” is crucial to our energy dominance agenda. We cannot achieve affordable, reliable, and abundant energy without a robust and dedicated workforce and talent pipeline. The more young people are energized about the future of American energy production, the better for our future.

Importantly, universities and trade schools across the country will be instrumental in fostering the next generation of American energy workers. Educators should focus on teaching students about real-world implications and the potential of American-made energy to drive solutions to environmental challenges.

For instance, America’s young people should know that our nation led the world in emissions reductions, largely thanks to the shale boom and natural gas production. Young Americans should be proud that in Chicago, engineers built the world’s very first nuclear reactor. Recent leadership in geothermal energy capacity should excite young Americans.

Our nation needs more energy workers—everything from technically skilled electricians to nuclear engineers with college degrees. Even more so, we need an optimistic energy workforce that sees American energy as an opportunity to win, not a problem to be solved. The next great energy innovation could already be an idea in a young American’s mind. It’s time to unleash it.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/young-male-teacher-giving-a-science-class-presentation-envato.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 16:02:22.209861

“AI data centers and advanced manufacturing are at the core of America’s economic future, but they can’t run without reliable, affordable power,” Rep. Barr said on Sept. 25. “The SPEED and Reliability Act cuts red tape and builds the transmission lines we need to lower costs and ensures we stay ahead of China in the race for AI.”

Under the current National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) program, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are supposed to coordinate on designating broad corridors for transmission development, with the goal of streamlining siting and permitting for high-impact transmission lines in the national interest, the lawmakers said.

Thus far, though, the process hasn’t resulted in a single transmission project due to widespread opposition to the approach, they added.

“We cannot wait a decade plus for individual transmission lines to be approved if we don’t want to fall behind China and our adversaries,” said Rep. Peters. “This bill will lower costs for consumers, improve reliability, and help secure America’s energy independence.”

The SPEED and Reliability Act would reform the NIETC program by removing the ability of the U.S. Energy Secretary to designate corridors, and would centralize environmental reviews at FERC.

The bill also would include additional guardrails to protect customers, benefit local communities, and respect state authority, according to a bill summary provided by the congressmen, such as allocating costs only to customers that benefit, using a minimum specified list of electric reliability criteria, along with specified economic benefits.

Among other provisions, the SPEED and Reliability Act also would allow FERC to issue a construction permit for individual national interest transmission lines that reduce grid congestion, improve reliability, and provide a clear set of economic and reliability benefits to customers, the summary says.",,N,,2025-09-29 16:04:27.477278

The inherent advantage of SSLSBs in energy density requires further validation through pouch cell testing. Due to the increasing application of battery integration with the chassis in electric vehicles, the limited design space necessitates consideration of volumetric energy density. While meeting gravimetric energy density requirements, it is crucial to ensure that battery volume matches the compartment space. Similarly, the confined spaces in unmanned aerial vehicles and wearable devices require evaluating whether volumetric energy density meets application demands alongside gravimetric energy density considerations. For applications requiring high power output, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, and rapid charging capabilities, as in electric vehicles, the power density and fast-charging performance of SSLSBs still require improvement. This necessitates addressing the poor conductivity of sulfur species and ion transport limitations within the battery. Regarding cycle life, SSLSBs face challenges associated with volumetric expansion and non-uniform lithium metal deposition, which compromise battery integrity. In the subsequent discussion, we will examine the technological breakthroughs required for SSLSB applications based on their existing limitations, with the aim of identifying viable strategies to overcome these challenges.

Power density and fast charging

The power density and fast charging of SSLSBs are influenced by multiple factors. On the one hand, there is the voltage limitation, which is determined by the inherent battery system of SSLSBs. Compared with the discharge plateau of traditional lithium-ion batteries, the average discharge plateau of SSLSBs is reduced by nearly 46%. To achieve the same output power, it relies on larger output currents or series-parallel structures. Currently, many devices have requirements for output voltage (such as electric vehicles and electric aircraft). Fortunately, Direct current to direct current converter (DC-DC) technology122 can be used to boost the voltage of single cells, but this process also causes approximately 10% energy loss. Benefiting from the significant advantage of SSLSBs over traditional lithium-ion battery systems in specific capacity, the energy loss for achieving higher output voltage is within an acceptable range. On the other hand, considering the electrochemical reactions and the migration processes of electrons and ions occurring during battery operation, the pivotal determinant lies in the ionic conductivity of both the SSE and the cathode (Fig. 3a). Unlike liquid electrolytes, ion transport in the solid phase is more complex, leading to reduced ionic conductivity. Additionally, due to the inherently poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, the electron transport pathway heavily relies on conductive additives incorporated into the cathode material123.

Material and structure modifications of SSEs can directly and significantly enhance the ionic conductivity of Li+ migration within battery systems. In the Li6+xP1–xGexS5I (LPGSI) electrolyte system, aliovalent substitution enhances the performance of SSE124. Germanium (Ge) substitution induces structural modifications and site disorder, leading to a reduction in the activation energy barrier for ion migration and an enhancement in ionic conductivity (Fig. 3b), thereby achieving an ionic conductivity of up to 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm−1. By adding fillers and other components, the ionic conductivity of SSEs can also be improved. For instance, the implementation of composite electrodes has been employed for Li+ transport enhancement. The incorporation of barium titanite into PEO polymer electrolytes generates an inherent polarization field125, which provides a robust driving force for Li+ transport, thereby accelerating Li+ migration (Fig. 3c). This approach not only enhances lithium-ion transport and accelerates redox reaction kinetics but also establishes strong chemical interactions between macroscopic charges and LiPSs, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and significantly improving the cycling stability of SSLSBs.

In addition to the ionic conductivity of SSEs, the sulfur cathode component represents another critical aspect that requires attention in SSLSBs. The redox reactions at the cathode necessitate simultaneous electron conduction and ion migration. However, due to the insulating nature of sulfur, the solid-solid sulfur conversion reaction can only occur at the triple-phase boundary between the SSE, active material, and carbon126. This results in sluggish reaction kinetics, which significantly limits the power density and fast-charging capabilities of the system. The acceleration of electrochemical reactions through redox-mediated molecular processes or the introduction of redox reactions to facilitate the conversion between active species127,128 are considered promising strategies for enhancing the power density and fast-charging capabilities of SSLSBs. Recent research advancements have demonstrated a rapid solid-state sulfur redox reaction facilitated by Li6PS5I glassy solid electrolytes (GSE)126. Based on the reversible redox reaction between I− and I2/I3−, the GSE not only functions as a superionic conductor but also serves as a surface redox mediator, promoting sluggish reactions at the solid–solid phase boundary, thereby significantly increasing the density of active sites (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, accelerating the conversion between sulfur species through redox-mediated molecules or introducing redox reactions represents a viable strategy for enhancing electrochemical kinetics, thereby improving the power density and fast-charging capability of SSLSBs. The study revealed that the LiI-enriched domains formed after charging can effectively sustain the ionic conductivity of the cathode129. Building upon the research findings of enhanced ionic conductivity in solid-state Li−S cathodes through LiI/Li2S synergistic effects, the research team proposed a strategy to construct both microscopic and nanoscale ion conduction pathways to ensure high power density130,131. They synthesized a Li2S–Li2O–LiI cathode with active materials dispersed in an amorphous matrix, wherein Li2O–LiI provides nanoscale ion conduction pathways and activates Li2S during cycling130. In addition to the incorporation of external redox mediators, the molecular redesign of active species and the construction of conductive frameworks in cathodes can effectively enhance redox kinetics and improve electrode impedance132. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN)133, as a conductive polymer matrix, exhibits higher electrical conductivity. By anchoring sulfur within the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) framework, the formation of Li2S is effectively prevented, significantly accelerating redox kinetics. Furthermore, the utilization of residual N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) strengthens the C–S bonds, enabling a quasi-intercalation reaction. Consequently, solid-state Li−SPAN batteries demonstrate superior rate performance compared to liquid Li−S batteries even at room temperature. Three-dimensional porous covalent organic framework (COF)-derived nitrogen-doped carbon integrated with two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) was designed as an electronically conductive sulfur host material134. The well-aligned porous framework provides continuous channels for electron transport (Fig. 3e). It should be noted that for the method of accelerating kinetics via redox mediating molecules, the range design of redox potential must be carefully considered. Otherwise, excessively activation potentials of mediating molecules will cause additional energy loss135. Additionally, introducing inactive materials without capacity contribution to improve ion and electron conduction in sulfur cathodes may dilute the sulfur ratio in the cathode, thereby affecting the energy density. This aspect requires special attention in engineering optimization.

In addition to the inherent ionic conductivity of SSEs, the design of thin electrolytes can directly shorten the ionic transport distance between the positive and negative electrodes of SSLSBs, thereby enhancing the power density. During the preparation of traditional SSEs, reducing the thickness of SSEs makes it increasingly difficult to maintain their mechanical stability. In particular, for inorganic electrolytes136, sulfide SSEs may suffer from weak inter-particle bonding and direct fragmentation during direct pressing, while oxide SSEs are more prone to cracking as independent thin films due to their inherent brittleness. Introducing flexible polymers as supports is an effective solution, which can provide mechanical strength and support structures for inorganic SSEs. For example, the composite SSE film137 prepared by incorporating carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber into LPSCl enables continuous preparation at a thickness of <50 μm. In-situ filling of polymer electrolytes and lithium salts into the 78Li2S–22P2S5 thin inorganic electrolyte not only achieves a self-supporting structure but also reduces porosity, increasing the original thin SSE conductivity by 2.7 times.

Polymer-based SSEs can also endow SSLSBs with the ability to adapt to deformation, facilitating their application in flexible wearable devices120. A flexible SSLSB assembled with a crosslinked gel electrolyte based on PEO and PAN employs a PAN fiber network design to simultaneously address issues of ionic conduction, mechanical strength, and LiPSs shuttling138. This flexible SSLSB maintains a capacity retention rate of over 96% after 1000 bending cycles. Flexible matching of electrodes is also of great importance. All-solid-state polymer electrolytes can also endow SSLSBs with flexibility, offering higher safety and stronger capability to prevent LiPSs shuttling compared to gel-state polymer SSEs. However, some all-solid-state polymer electrolytes exhibit low Li+ conductivity at room temperature, typically requiring operation at high temperatures (>60 °C) to achieve ionic conductivity sufficient for power output139,140. This limitation consequently restricts the application scenarios of polymer-based SSLSBs under ambient conditions. Interestingly, there is an integrated approach that can solve the temperature issue by integrating a photothermal conversion system into the battery structure141. This system effectively generates heat through carrier non-radiative recombination within silicon nanoshells, with the generated heat subsequently transferred rapidly to the battery system via a copper core. Through solar irradiation, the converted thermal energy enables enhanced reaction kinetics in SSLSBs. Due to the poor thermal conductivity of polymers, ionic conductivity tends to be non-uniform during temperature variations, which readily induces inhomogeneous lithium deposition. Incorporating two-dimensional boron nitride (BN) nanosheets into PEO-based SSEs can synergistically enhance the ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal transport of PEO-based SSEs, thereby improving cycling stability under temperature fluctuations139. Given that the ionic conductivity of polymer-based SSEs is dependent on segmental motion142, maintaining an amorphous state is particularly crucial for ensuring ionic conductivity at and below ambient temperatures143. The incorporation of plasticizer components144 enables the polymer electrolyte to maintain a completely amorphous state across a wide temperature range extending to subzero conditions, thereby facilitating rapid Li+ conduction and stable interfacial chemistry in batteries at low temperatures.

In addition to the solid-solid transition reactions at the cathode and SSEs, the interface also significantly influences fast charging performance. Indium trifluoride (InF3) was employed as a bifunctional initiator to facilitate the in-situ polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane (PDOL) electrolyte145. The interaction between InF3 and lithium metal promotes the formation of a hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) enriched with lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium-indium alloy. This structural modification effectively enhances Li+ kinetics and mitigates the impedance effects at the anode interface.

Cycling performance

To achieve long cycle life in SSLSBs, it is essential to consider factors such as active material loss and degradation of battery components146. The primary manifestations of battery component damage include (Fig. 4a): (1) Volume changes in the electrode during charge-discharge cycles of solid-state Li−S cathodes, which can readily compromise the cathode structure and damage the conductive ion network through repeated expansion and contraction, resulting in excessive polarization and capacity loss. (2) Degradation of SSEs, typically occurs during charging processes. This phenomenon may lead to electrolyte penetration and subsequent short-circuiting. Although inorganic SSEs exhibit higher modulus, they remain susceptible to dendrite penetration issues.

In the field of liquid Li−S batteries, self-healing strategies have been extensively employed to mitigate the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect in the cathodes147,148,149,150,151. In SSLSBs, self-healing approaches are recognized as an effective strategy to mitigate the degradation of SSEs. SSE self-healing predominantly relies on the intrinsic self-healing properties of materials, which are primarily attributed to reversible chemical bonds and hydrogen bonds within the material system152, typically based on polymer matrices. A novel polymer-based quasi-solid-state electrolyte has been successfully synthesized153, demonstrating remarkable interfacial stability during prolonged cycling. This enhanced performance is attributed to the incorporation of reversible S–S bonds and hydrogen bonds within the polymer matrix (Fig. 4b). The significantly lower activation energy of S–S bonds compared to hydrogen bonds facilitates the rapid self-healing process, which exhibits a high self-healing efficiency of approximately 95.3% within an exceptionally short recovery time of 5 min (Fig. 4c). In cathodes based on sulfide SSEs, carbon materials can enhance electron transport but accelerate the oxidative decomposition of sulfide SSEs. Introducing non-conductive polar host mesoporous matrices (such as SiO2) can suppress electrolyte decomposition via non-conductivity154. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between the high-polarity surface and S/Li2S avoids sulfur detachment, maintaining stable conductive pathways. In this work, the electron conductivity issue is addressed by constructing three-dimensional conductive networks with different carbon materials. Additionally, introducing hybrid ion/electron conductive transition metal sulfide VS2 into the cathode to form a core-shell structured cathode architecture with sulfur coated on VS2 nanosheets can mitigate degradation of the SSE155. Layered VS2 acts not only as an electron conductor but also provides Li+ transport channels. This structure reduces the surface contact between electron-conductive components and the SSE in the cathode, thereby suppressing SSE decomposition during charging and enabling stable cycling performance with high sulfur utilization.

During the electrochemical reaction process, the delamination at the electrolyte/electrode interface can be effectively mitigated through the implementation of self-healing strategies. The modification of PEO through the Michael addition strategy, utilizing self-healing poly(β-amino ester)s with comb-like topology and multiple functional groups, not only facilitates the formation of rapid Li+ transport channels but also endows the electrolyte with self-healing capabilities156. Solid-state polymer electrolytes based on poly(ether-urethane) demonstrate enhanced interfacial contact and self-healing capability at the interface, maintaining 93% of their capacity after 700 cycles157 (Fig. 4d, e). Furthermore, this issue can also be mitigated through the physical confinement and regulation of sulfur distribution. Sulfur-carbon composites prepared by sulfur vapor deposition (SVD) method enable uniform distribution of submicron-scale sulfur materials within carbon pores158. When sulfur and discharge products are confined in the porous carbon matrix during cycling, interfacial separation caused by volume changes is avoided, ensuring high-capacity retention. This regulation strategy, which requires no additional framework introduction, achieves a high sulfur loading ratio of up to 83.3%. To address the issue of electrode damage induced by volume variations, the integration of elastic polymers with SSEs has been demonstrated to effectively accommodate the substantial volume changes experienced by lithium metal anodes during cycling159. Such materials not only strengthen mechanical integrity but also maintain stable contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing cycle life160. Moreover, the construction of rapid and stable ion and electron transport pathways within the cathode is particularly crucial for the cycling stability of SSLSBs161,162. Nanostructures and novel material compositions have also been pivotal in advancing the performance metrics of SSLSBs. For example, the incorporation of Li2S and carbon nanotubes in composite electrodes has been demonstrated to improve the electrocatalytic activity for polysulfide conversion163,164,165. The use of nanostructured materials not only enhances the surface area for reactions but also facilitates better ionic and electronic pathways, further contributing to longer cycling life166,167.

Effective interface engineering can mitigate issues of poor interfacial contact and enhance the electrochemical stability of the battery. Innovative approaches involve the use of coatings or surface modifications on the sulfur particles to optimize electron transport and polysulfide interaction with the electrolyte168,169,170. These interface improvements can lead to better redox kinetics and more effective utilization of sulfur, directly impacting the overall lifecycle of the batteries. The incorporation of multifunctional additives can effectively enhance the electrolyte’s performance, thereby preventing the detrimental penetration of lithium dendrites that may cause structural damage to the electrolyte, especially in polymer electrolytes. Researchers171 have proposed a multifunctional additive, C60, which, when incorporated into PEO, effectively mitigates lithium dendrite growth and penetration by reducing the high interfacial energy of lithium. This mechanism is responsible for the stable cycling durability observed over 1000 hours. Additionally, researchers172 have employed salt additives as a strategy to artificially induce the formation of an SEI layer with enhanced mechanical integrity and lithium-ion conductivity, thereby mitigating the detrimental effects of lithium dendrite formation on polymer electrolytes. Although SSLSBs have significantly mitigated the dissolution and shuttling of LiPSs compared to their liquid counterparts, this phenomenon persists in polymer and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, leading to capacity degradation. However, the suppression of LiPSs shuttling is relatively more straightforward in solid-state batteries, as the application of a functional coating on the cathode can effectively inhibit the shuttling effect37.

Real energy density

Most of the current literature predominantly focuses on evaluating energy density or capacity based on the mass of active materials in cathode, while neglecting the significant proportion of inactive components within the entire battery system. These inactive components, which may include SSEs, current collectors, conductive additives, and packaging materials, contribute to the substantial discrepancy between the practical and theoretical energy densities of SSLSBs.

Table 1 presents energy densities of SSLSBs referenced to battery components rather than active materials. Notably, the practical energy densities considering non-active components are significantly lower than the theoretical values: the theoretical gravimetric energy density of SSLSB is ~2600 Wh kg−1, and the theoretical volumetric energy density173 is ~2800 Wh L−1. In the surveyed literatures, the practical energy densities referenced to the positive electrodes174,175 only reach approximately half of the theoretical values, while the highest practical gravimetric energy density referenced to both positive and negative electrodes176 is around 1000 Wh kg−1. When additionally considering the SSE, the practical energy densities177 are limited to 505 Wh kg−1 and 557 Wh L−1. Current laboratory-scale energy density evaluations primarily use coin-cell configurations for verification. However, in practical applications, essential components such as current collectors and encapsulation materials (beyond electrodes and electrolytes) must be considered, particularly in industries with urgent demands for high-energy-density batteries (e.g., electric vehicles). They require high energy densities not only at the electrochemical system level but also at the entire device level.

To evaluate the discrepancy in practical energy density between SSLSBs at the device and material levels, we developed a simplified solid-state Li−S pouch cell model. By systematically varying some key parameters, we investigated the influence of sulfur content and inactive components on the practical device energy density. Furthermore, we analyzed potential strategies for enhancing energy density at the device level. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, we investigated a single-layer solid-state Li−S pouch cell configuration, which comprises encapsulation materials, current collectors for both cathode and anode, SSE, lithium metal anode, and sulfur cathode. The sulfur cathode consists of elemental sulfur, SSE, and electronic conductor materials. In this model, several assumptions were established: (1) The active materials exhibit 100% theoretical capacity; (2) The side materials and tabs of the pouch cell were neglected, with all materials assumed to be perfectly aligned in a 1:1 area ratio and in intimate contact. (3) The average voltage of the discharge platform is 2 V.

Based on the aforementioned considerations, we establish the following parameters: sulfur loading (x, mg cm−2), sulfur ratio (y), and SSE thickness (z, µm), and subsequently calculate the total areal mass of the cell (mg cm−2). The obtained results are presented in Table 2. For the current collector’s areal mass, we adopt reference values from commercial current collectors (current collector density of cathode: 8.96 g cm−3, thickness: 17 µm; current collector density of anode: 2.70 g cm−3, thickness: 12 µm). Assuming that the electrochemical reaction can completely convert the sulfur in the cathode, in the solid-state Li−S pouch cell model with a negative-to-positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) of RN/P (where RN/P ≥ 1), the areal mass of lithium metal can be calculated based on RN/P and the theoretical capacities of lithium and sulfur. It is assumed that the SSE has a density of ρ g cm−3, with an areal mass of 0.1ρz mg cm−2. The cathode comprises active material (sulfur), ion-conducting component (SSE), and electron-conducting material (e.g., carbon). Assuming the sulfur component accounts for y of the mass, the remaining cathode components contribute x/y(1−y). Encapsulation material is also considered, with commercial aluminum laminate film as reference (density: 1 g cm−3, thickness: 114 µm). The total areal capacity of the cell can be determined by multiplying the sulfur’s theoretical capacity with its loading, yielding 1.675x mAh cm−2. Given an average discharge voltage of 2 V, the overall energy density of the pouch cell can be calculated using Formula 1,

where the energy density is expressed in Wh kg−1, where the numerator represents the areal capacity of the pouch cell and the denominator corresponds to the total areal mass of the battery.

The energy density variations of pouch cells were investigated by systematically controlling the parameters of x, y, z, and ρ, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Considering that the density difference of SSEs affects the results, to make the trend more realistic, we referenced the densities of classic SSEs with different densities: Li3PS4 (LPS, ρLPS = 1.88 g cm−3), LAGP (ρLAGP = 3.56 g cm−3), and LLZO (ρLLZO = 5.07 g cm−3). Energy density variation curves with different ρ parameters were plotted while adjusting x, y, and z parameters. Here, the effect of RN/P was initially ignored and set to 1. To study the impact of sulfur loading on energy density, experiments were pre-set under conditions of 60 wt% sulfur content and 50 µm SSE thickness. Results show that sulfur loading exhibits an approximately linear relationship with energy density, and the influence of electrolyte density is minor. Under these conditions, when sulfur loading exceeds 8.6 mg cm−2, the energy density of the overall device reaches 500 Wh kg−1.

Subsequently, with parameters of 7 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 50 µm SSE thickness, we investigated the effect of sulfur content, revealing a distinct nonlinear curve. This curve indicates that increasing the sulfur ratio significantly enhanced the energy density of pouch cells at lower sulfur ratios, but this trend gradually diminished with higher sulfur ratios. The influence of electrolyte density starts to become significant, and the gap in energy density widens with the increase of the sulfur ratio. This is because when the sulfur ratio is the independent variable and the sulfur loading is fixed, a high sulfur ratio reduces the mass of the cathode, thereby enhancing the impact of inactive components (especially the electrolyte). Analysis of energy density variations across different sulfur ratio ranges (from 10 wt% to 100 wt%) shows that, taking the LPS electrolyte curve as an example, the growth contribution ratios are 35.43% for sulfur ratios increasing from 10 wt% to 20 wt%, 33.26% from 20 wt% to 40 wt%, 15.88% from 40 wt% to 60 wt%, 9.30% from 60 wt% to 80 wt%, and 6.11% from 80 wt% to 100 wt%. Notably, increasing the sulfur ratio in the cathode significantly enhances energy density at low sulfur contents, with diminishing returns as the sulfur ratio increases. At 60 wt%, 84.59% of the total curve growth is achieved. Furthermore, a high sulfur ratio is accompanied by a reduction in the amount of ionic and electronic conductors within the electrode, which tends to cause poor interfacial contact, leading to increased impedance and even preventing sulfur from participating in electrochemical reactions. Thus, optimization strategies need to be carefully balanced. Maintaining the sulfur ratio at an appropriate level can not only increase the overall energy density but also avoid the regulation of internal interfaces and particle distribution in cathodes with excessively high sulfur ratios, thereby reducing manufacturing process costs.

In addition to the parametric influences of the sulfur active material, we have investigated the impact of the SSE, which represents one of the most critical components in SSLSB. Within the model, the SSE contained in the cathode has already been accounted for in the sulfur ratio. The SSE discussed herein refers specifically to the separator layer between the cathode and anode. Under the parameters of 7 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 60 wt% sulfur ratio, the influence of SSE thickness ranging from 1 µm to 500 µm on energy density was investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that energy density exhibits a trend of rapid decline followed by a gentle decrease as the SSE thickness increases. The SSE density also significantly affects energy density within a wide range. When the thickness exceeds 40 µm, the energy density difference caused by electrolyte density variations becomes more pronounced. At LPS thicknesses of 200 µm, 100 µm, 50 µm, and 20 µm, the energy density shows enhancements of 69%, 119%, 157%, and 187%, respectively, compared to the 500 µm baseline. Thinner SSE thickness leads to more significant enhancement in energy density, achieving nearly a twofold improvement. This observation highlights the necessity of applying thin SSEs in high-energy-density SSLSBs. Finally, we estimated the volumetric energy density using reference values of x = 7, y = 60 wt%, and z = 50, assuming a uniform area for all components and a 1:1 mapping from sulfur mass ratio to volume ratio. The calculation used the volumetric specific capacities of sulfur (~1800 Ah L−1) and lithium metal (~2060 Ah L−1), yielding a volumetric energy density of 499 Wh L−1 under these conditions. This is because the thickness of the encapsulation material accounts for nearly half of the total cell thickness, leading to the lower volumetric energy density.

In practical applications, multi-layer pouch cells with stacked electrodes exhibit higher energy density compared to single-layer electrodes. To address this, we extended our model to evaluate the energy density variations in multi-layer solid-state Li−S pouch cells (Fig. 5c). In the extended model, we introduced the variable n to represent the number of layers, with the number of SSE layers serving as the reference for the pouch cell layer count. Additionally, all electrodes except the outermost ones were considered to have double-sided active material loading. The variations in each component for multi-layer solid-state Li−S pouch cells are summarized in Table 3.

Subsequently, the values of sulfur loading, sulfur ratio, SSE thickness, and RN/P were assumed to be 7 mg cm−2, 60 wt%, 500 µm, and 1, respectively. The data from Table 2 were then incorporated into Formula 1, yielding the simulation results presented in Fig. 5d. It is evident that a rapid growth region emerges during the process of increasing the number of layers. Specifically, the dual-layer pouch cell design exhibits a direct 24.38% improvement in energy density compared to the single-layer design, exceeding the target value of 500 Wh kg−1. Meanwhile, the quadruple-layer pouch cell design achieves a 41.64% enhancement in energy density over the single-layer configuration. Notably, the energy density variation from a single layer to four layers has reached 70.18% of that from a single layer to twenty layers. This indicates that excessive layer stacking is unnecessary for enhancing overall pouch cell energy density, while highlighting the necessity of multi-layer electrode designs to achieve energy densities of 500 Wh kg−1 and beyond.

In practical batteries, excess lithium metal is often required for cell assembly. We defined the parameter RN/P to represent the N/P ratio and investigated its impact on solid-state Li–S pouch cell performance. Based on the above results, taking LPS electrolyte as an example, we set parameters of 7 mg cm−2 sulfur loading, 60 wt% sulfur ratio, and 50 µm electrolyte thickness to investigate the influence of RN/P on battery energy density. As shown in Fig. 5e, the effect of RN/P on energy density is limited for both single-layer and multi-layer pouch cells. We attribute this to the fact that the ultra-high specific capacity of lithium metal results in the increased mass having a minimal impact on the cell. In the four-layer pouch cell model, the energy density with RN/P = 1.5 decreased by only 3.92% compared to that with RN/P = 1. Additionally, side reactions such as electrolyte decomposition during battery cycling also affect the practical energy density. These scenarios may either contribute extra capacity or cause capacity loss, but their common feature is that they do not change the overall mass of the cell. Therefore, to make the model more consistent with real-world conditions, we introduced a function f(c) to account for these effects. The result of this function can be directly incorporated into the energy density calculation formula as a variable multiplied by the numerator. The function f(c) can describe the deviation between the actual released capacity and the theoretically designed capacity during a complete discharge cycle, similar to the coulombic efficiency during battery cycling, which corrects capacity changes caused by side reactions. This function needs to be formulated based on the target battery system and fitted using extensive battery cases and data. Undoubtedly, if this function and model can directly predict capacity changes throughout the battery’s life cycle from the perspective of material design, it will provide valuable insights for the design of SSLSBs.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43246-025-00918-9/MediaObjects/43246_2025_918_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-29 19:01:06.898429

Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive.... What's more, sales of used EVs this year through June increased by 34% over the year-earlier period, while the market for new EVs only ticked up a tad.

Bloomberg goes on to note that while the end of a $7,500 federal incentive this month is expected to curtail already sluggish new EV sales in the U.S., the loss of a maximum $4,000 credit on used EVs isn't projected to have the same negative effect. That's because used EVs and used gas-powered vehicles are closing in on price parity. A used EV at $34,700, Bloomberg reported, is about even with a used gas-burner at $33,800. The EV isn't as old, nor is it likely to require as much maintenance going forward. What's not to like?

Fears about EV ownership — ranging from range anxiety to concerns about the potentially high cost of replacing batteries — have obviously been eased by the sheer number of vehicles that have hit the road, validating the technology. Real-world experience has enhanced the reputations of EVs, batteries are lasting longer than originally anticipated, and the prices have become right.

The appealing stickers on used EVs are of course not all a positive story. These vehicles are aggressively depreciating, establishing a buyer's market for those interested in taking the plunge. Bloomberg cites a Ford Mustang Mach-E GT buyer who picked up a 2024 model for $33,000. Original price? $55,000. Of course, that degree of decline means that in the used market, complaints about EV affordability are being resolved. In fact, it almost makes more sense to hold off on a new EV purchase because, as Bloomberg reports, a lot of vehicles that were first leased three years ago are now hitting the market.

There is no used EV market without a new EV market, so a natural question to ask in the face of this relatively optimistic news is, ""Will a collapse in sales and leasing of new EVs undermine growing used sales?"" That will be something to keep an eye on over the next year or two. One might expect a reduced supply of new EVs coming into the used-car market to bid up prices, reversing or stalling the trend that Bloomberg noticed, sending buyers back to gas vehicles even if they want to give EVs a shot.

One other factor to take into account is that although the situation for new and used EVs is better than it was a decade ago, they still occupy a niche. Total EV sales in 2024 made up about 9% of the U.S. new-car market, according to Kelley Blue Book. New cars remain overwhelmingly powered by petrol, as do used cars.

Conclusion EPA’s actions mark a notable reorientation of NSR permitting policy.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced two significant reforms to its New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for major sources of air emissions. First, EPA is developing a rule to revise its interpretation of the definition of “begin actual construction” under NSR regulations, with a proposal expected in 2026. Second, EPA has rescinded its long-standing “Reactivation Policy” through a memorandum issued by Administrator Lee Zeldin on 18 September 2025 (Zeldin Memo). These actions mark shifts in the regulatory landscape for project development and facility restarts under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

These permitting reforms arrive at a moment when energy demand, particularly due to artificial intelligence (AI), data center growth, and electrification, is projected to surge sharply over the next five years. US data center power demand alone is projected to grow from 25 GW in 2024 to over 80 GW by 2030.1 Given this backdrop, the timing of EPA’s shifts on air permitting is likely to have outsized implications for developers of fossil-fuel-fired power plants, large industrial and manufacturing facilities, electric utilities, state and local permitting authorities, and community stakeholders.

Preconstruction Rule: Redefining “Begin Actual Construction”

Under the CAA, new or modified major stationary sources must obtain an NSR permit before it may “begin actual construction.”2 EPA’s regulations define “begin actual construction” as “the initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit…include[ing], but not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.”3 Historically, EPA has sometimes applied this definition broadly, most notably in its 1986 “Reich memo,” which implied that construction of structures accommodating emissions units could be considered “actual construction,” even if no emissions units were installed.4

In contrast, a 2020 draft guidance issued during the previous Trump administration expressed a narrower interpretation, emphasizing that NSR permitting should be triggered only by physical on-site construction of emissions units themselves, not general building or site preparation.5

In September 2025, EPA responded to a request from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department regarding a proposed semiconductor facility.6 The developer sought to construct the “core and shell” of a building—its foundation, steel superstructure, and external walls—prior to receiving an NSR permit. EPA concluded that construction of structures not specifically configured for emissions units did not constitute “begin actual construction” and could proceed without an NSR permit, provided no emission units, foundations for such units, or related piping were installed.

EPA emphasized that the Reich memo reflected an overly expansive interpretation and confirmed that the agency intends to clarify its position through rulemaking. Specifically, EPA plans to propose and finalize a rule in 2026 to revise the regulatory definition of “begin actual construction.”7 Until then, EPA will continue to apply its interpretation on a case-by-case basis, guided by the principle that nonemissions-unit construction does not, on its own, trigger NSR requirements. EPA has not identified any specific criteria it will rely on for its case-by-case analysis, which could raise the possibility that environmental groups and other nongovernmental organizations could seek to halt construction that they claim is proceeding without an NSR permit based on the prior EPA interpretation.

EPA’s rulemaking is expected to bring clarity to project developers who often seek to advance construction schedules while awaiting permit decisions. A narrower definition of “begin actual construction” may enable developers to undertake certain preparatory building activities without risking an NSR violation. However, EPA has emphasized that construction activities undertaken before a permit is issued remain “at risk,” as permitting authorities retain discretion to deny permits or require additional controls.

Rescission of the Reactivation Policy

Since the late 1970s, EPA has applied its “Reactivation Policy” to idle facilities, presuming that sources shut down for two or more years were permanently closed and thus subject to NSR permitting as newly constructed sources if restarted. Facility owners could rebut this presumption by showing intent to restart at the time of shutdown, based on factors such as maintenance activities, operator statements, and the cost of reactivation. The policy was most comprehensively articulated in the 1999 Monroe Order.8

In Port Hamilton Refining and Transportation LLP v. EPA, 87 F.4th 188 (3d Cir. 2023), the Third Circuit rejected EPA’s application of the Reactivation Policy to require a prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permit before restarting a long-idle refinery in the US Virgin Islands. The court held that the CAA unambiguously limits NSR applicability to construction of new sources and modifications of existing sources, not mere operation. The decision followed the court’s earlier reasoning in EME Homer City Generation that the PSD program does not extend to “operation.”9

Administrator Zeldin’s 18 September 2025 memorandum formally rescinds the Reactivation Policy nationwide.10 EPA now recognizes that restarting an idle facility does not constitute “construction” under the CAA and will not, by itself, trigger NSR permitting requirements. Instead, EPA will apply NSR only where a restart involves a “major modification”—a physical or operational change that increases emissions above regulatory thresholds.

The Zeldin Memo also stresses the importance of nationwide consistency and makes clear that EPA regional offices should no longer apply the Reactivation Policy in permitting or enforcement. State and local agencies are encouraged to align with this approach, though stricter state laws may still apply.

The rescission provides significant regulatory relief for operators of idle facilities, eliminating a policy that EPA itself acknowledged was subjective and inconsistently applied. Owners of facilities seeking to restart operations will no longer face automatic NSR permitting obligations absent a qualifying modification. Nevertheless, sources must still carefully evaluate whether changes undertaken in connection with a restart amount to a major modification that triggers NSR.

Conclusion

EPA’s actions mark a notable reorientation of NSR permitting policy. The forthcoming preconstruction rule promises greater clarity on when physical construction may begin without an NSR permit, while the rescission of the Reactivation Policy resolves long-standing legal and practical uncertainties for idled facilities. Together, these reforms could expedite project development timelines and facilitate restarts of dormant sources, though state permitting authorities—which may have different views and interests than EPA—retain broad discretion to enforce NSR requirements where modifications increase emissions. As data center capacity, AI model training, digitalization, and electrification drive electricity demand upward, clarity around when construction triggers permitting, and when restarting a source requires NSR, will matter more than ever.",https://files.klgates.com/images/_wbmanaged/elnr_wbc_socialimage_372384.png,N,,2025-09-29 16:03:01.727280

On Sunday, the Motley Fool news service published a story with the headline: Could Buying Wolfspeed Today Set You Up for Life? A possible answer: $1,000 worth of Wolfspeed shares at Friday’s close would have been worth $18,000 at Monday’s high.

Trading was halted for Wolfspeed at 11:59 a.m. with shares trading at $14.97, up $13.76 or 1,137%. On Monday, Wolfspeed filed an SEC Form 25, which is a document used to delist its securities. An SEC spokesperson declined to explain the trading halt.

A company filing a Form 25 must issue a press release and post notice on its website of its intention to delist no fewer than 10 days before delisting becomes effective under Rule 12d2-2. Wolfspeed’s website does not have such a press release.

Company officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

The Motley Fool report noted that some speculative investors believe that “the worst-case scenario” is already priced in for the bankrupt company. The story notes Wolfspeed’s strategy of replacing ordinary silicon with silicon carbide might be a winning formula since the “carbon-toughened version of the simple material can be used for higher voltage applications like solar inverters and electric vehicles, since it tolerates higher levels of heat. It’s also just more power-efficient.”

More than 95% of the value of Wolfspeed stock was expected to be eliminated through the bankruptcy process, along with significant reductions in debt held by company creditors. But some investors in the company’s shares obviously believe the emerging company has good prospects.

It is building a $5 billion manufacturing plant near Siler City, aided by federal subsidies approved during the Biden administration. The goal was to promote U.S. chip manufacturing, but the Trump administration has criticized many such projects originating during Biden’s term.

Barring a last-minute deal, government funding will expire on Wednesday, launching a shutdown and possible reductions in force across federal agencies. President Donald Trump plans to meet with the top four congressional leaders this afternoon to discuss a funding extension.

The White House Office of Management and Budget directed agencies last week to consider RIFs as part of their shutdown “lapse plans.” These RIFs would be in addition to standard furloughs and should target programs that do not have alternative sources of funding and are “not consistent with the president’s priorities,” the OMB memo states. In a statement last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed doubt that any such RIFs would be permanent. “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today,” he said.

OMB earlier directed agencies to submit updated lapse plans by Aug. 1, but many do not appear to be available online yet. The National Science Foundation’s plan from 2023 would have furloughed nearly 80% of its employees, while NASA’s plan would have furloughed more than 90%.

If Congress passes a continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown, interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy has directed the agency to “work toward” the spending levels in the House’s funding proposal for fiscal year 2026, according to Ars Technica. That proposal would cut NASA’s Science Mission Directorate by 18%, compared to the 50% cut in the president’s budget request and near-level funding in the Senate proposal. Meanwhile, a report released today by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) states that NASA has been implementing cuts from the president’s budget request since early summer, disregarding congressional intent concerning funding levels.

Scientific societies protest grantmaking executive order

More than 50 scientific and medical organizations urged Congress last week to block key elements of the grantmaking executive order President Donald Trump issued in August, arguing that it will increase politicization of federally funded research and add inefficiencies to the grantmaking process. “The EO does not advance the administration’s goal of implementing Gold Standard Science,” reads the letter sent by the societies. (Multiple AIP Member Societies signed the letter.)

The letter asks Congress to ensure that independent peer review “remains the cornerstone” of scientific grantmaking, “such that the most meritorious proposals are funded in this and all future administrations.” Trump’s order states that agencies may use peer review methods for grantmaking on an advisory basis but places ultimate decision authority in the hands of political appointees. The letter also asks Congress to reject the order’s requirement that science agencies permit “termination for convenience” in all grants, warning of a chilling effect for research that could be perceived as controversial. Finally, the letter calls on Congress to block the order’s directive for agencies to prioritize research proposals from academic institutions with the lowest indirect cost rates.

Jacob Helberg to be under secretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment; and

Thomas DiNanno to be under secretary of state for arms control and international security.

Senate Republicans confirmed the first bloc of nearly 50 nominees two weeks ago after modifying the chamber’s rules to allow confirmations in groups instead of one at a time. Democrats had been using the old rules to severely slow down votes on Trump’s nominees. Some of the nominees in the second bloc had advanced out of committee more than four months ago.

In fact, policymakers should increase park entrance fees to more closely reflect the demand to visit.
As a result, National Parks are experiencing some major problems such as deferred maintenance, overcrowding, worse environmental outcomes, and underfunding.
More accurate pricing for entrance fees can help address these issues and more.","September 27 was National Public Lands Day. To celebrate, the National Park Service (NPS) advertised free admission to national parks that normally charge an entrance fee. Most NPS sites offer free admission every day of the year.

A more appropriate term for the NPS to use would be “unpriced,” because while visitors didn’t have to pay an entrance fee on Saturday, the money required for NPS operations still came from somewhere. Theoretically, the money lost from entrance fees on National Public Lands Day was made up for through other sources, such as congressional appropriations.

But it’s not just on September 27 when most of the NPS’s funding comes from Congress. In FY25, their total request from all funding sources was $4.81 billion, of which $3.6 billion was discretionary. In 2024, the estimated revenue from recreation fees was only $355.5 million. Significant funding also comes from other sources like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and donations.

Some might say that this seems right; the people of the United States have decided (through their representatives) that we want to have national parks. So, it’s fair that all Americans pay for the NPS’s budget through tax dollars.

Yet some Americans will never visit a national park but still pay roughly $20 per year, on average, toward the NPS budget through taxes. Proponents argue that non-visitors should contribute to the NPS budget because they still receive some utility from just knowing that the national parks exist, but whatever utility that may be is trivial in comparison to that of a park visitor.

NPS has tried to address these problems by charging entrance fees and other types of user fees at some of the most popular sites. For example, the most expensive parks to enter, such as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, charge an entrance fee of $35 per car per week, which is still an extremely cheap price.

In fact, policymakers should increase park entrance fees to more closely reflect the demand to visit. Current prices haven’t even kept up with inflation. As a result, National Parks are experiencing some major problems such as deferred maintenance, overcrowding, worse environmental outcomes, and underfunding. More accurate pricing for entrance fees can help address these issues and more.

National parks have often been called “America’s best idea.” If Americans truly feel this way, then park visitors should be expected to pay a reasonable user fee.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1370171185-1-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:02:57.791282

The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition formed to change that.
Meeting people where they are “The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition works because it blends trusted, high-quality tax preparation with the deep community connections of our outreach partners,” said Matt Hetherwick of Accounting Aid Society.
“Congress of Communities participates in the tax coalition because the residents we serve need access to affordable tax preparation and clear information about all the benefits available to them,” said Amanda Holiday.
By centering trust, access, and community leadership, the Detroit Tax Credit Coalition is helping families file for the future—and keep more of what they’ve earned.","When tax season arrives in Detroit, the stakes are high. More than 40% of the city’s children live in poverty, and the tax code is one of the surest, fastest tools for putting money into family budgets. Refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) can return thousands of dollars to eligible households—often enough to pay down debt, purchase a reliable vehicle, or take a first step toward homeownership. Yet every year, Detroit families leave an estimated $80 million in tax credits unclaimed—too often because filing feels confusing, costly, or out of reach.

The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition formed to change that. Launched in 2021 with support from a group of funders led by The Kresge Foundation, the coalition’s mission is straightforward: make it easy, trustworthy, and free for low- and moderate-income Detroiters to file taxes and receive every credit they’ve earned.

A coalition built on trust—and results

The Coalition builds on a 2017 effort spearheaded by Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan’s office. Today, United Way for Southeastern Michigan facilitates the steering committee alongside the City of Detroit and two tax preparation leaders—Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency—while a network of community organizations carries the message deep into neighborhoods.

“The key to increasing the number of Detroiters who file taxes and claim their credits comes down to three things: awareness, trust, and access,” said Megan Thibos of United Way. “Our central website, GetTheTaxFacts.org, offers clear information and a unified scheduling tool, and our VITA partners operate dozens of convenient sites so help is close to home.”

An evaluation by the University of Michigan estimated that in 2021–2022, the coalition helped Detroit families claim more than $6.5 million in Child Tax Credits that otherwise would have been missed—evidence that coordinated outreach and high-quality preparation can move real dollars into household budgets.

Meeting people where they are

“The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition works because it blends trusted, high-quality tax preparation with the deep community connections of our outreach partners,” said Matt Hetherwick of Accounting Aid Society. “We meet people where they are—geographically and in terms of trust—so no one is left behind because they didn’t know help was available or feared they couldn’t afford it.”

Wayne Metro’s Ricky Palitti underscored the impact: “Partnership makes it possible to reach as many people as we do. The result is real impact, saving families hundreds of dollars each in filing fees and putting more money back into household budgets where it’s needed most.”

For neighborhood partners, participation is about aligning with community priorities. “Congress of Communities participates in the tax coalition because the residents we serve need access to affordable tax preparation and clear information about all the benefits available to them,” said Amanda Holiday.

In HOPE Village, Executive Director Jeffrey Jones said tax help is core to the mission: “This work is a vital resource to our community. We exist to mitigate disparities in wealth, health, and education—and the coalition’s approach advances that priority.”

Breaking down barriers to benefits

Access is often blocked by multiple, overlapping hurdles. “Families may not know what they can claim, they may mistrust financial systems, or they may face practical challenges like transportation, language, or technology,” said Hetherwick. “We address this by offering free, trusted services in community settings; training outreach partners to share accurate, culturally relevant information; and providing in-person, drop-off, and virtual options. We invest in long-term relationships so residents know there’s reliable help year after year.”

Wayne Metro complements tax services with wrap-around support. “Our agency helps clients tackle other life needs that can stand between them and the credits they’ve earned,” said Program Manager Tameka Gray.

United Way targets common misconceptions. “Some families mistakenly believe they aren’t eligible,” Thibos said. “For example, grandparents raising grandchildren may qualify even when the children are not biological. We’ve added a trilingual flyer in English, Spanish, and Arabic, made our website and scheduling tool available in Spanish, provide 1:1 navigation for issues like IDs, and are exploring transportation support next year.”

Reaching the hardest to reach

The coalition’s outreach strategy is layered and persistent. “Mass outreach through text messaging and targeted digital ads casts a wide net and makes it easy to click straight through to schedule,” said Thibos. “Community-based outreach kick-starts word-of-mouth networks. And for those who are hesitant or face barriers, our team offers personalized navigation.”

Congress of Communities focuses on multiple touchpoints. “Research shows people need to see information several times before acting,” Holiday said. “We set up at community events, send texts and emails to members, and use social media—often handing out free books to encourage conversations and promote literacy at the same time.”

For HOPE Village, accessibility and presence are the rule. “Be accessible and show up in a variety of places,” said Jones. “That’s how trust is built.”

Virtual access and language capacity round out the approach. “Virtual appointments have been a game-changer, and our bilingual team members help ensure those whose first language isn’t English receive the assistance they need,” said Palitti.

Policy progress—and what’s next

The coalition pairs on-the-ground services with policy advocacy. Recent progress includes the 2023 expansion of the Michigan EITC, which quintuples the state credit and puts millions more dollars into family budgets. Even amid a volatile policy environment—with recent federal changes increasing the Child Tax Credit by $200 per child alongside cuts to SNAP and Medicaid—partners remain focused on expanding eligibility and benefit amounts for both the EITC and CTC over time.

Implementation work continues year-round: strengthening existing outreach partnerships, building new ones, expanding tax prep capacity, and learning from data to improve resident experience. The invitation is open. If your organization would like to collaborate, email taxes@unitedwaysem.org. To learn more or schedule a free appointment, visit GetTheTaxFacts.org.

Why it matters

When families file, children thrive. A maximum EITC can exceed $10,000 (state and federal combined), with an additional $1,700–$2,200 per child from the CTC—dollars that stabilize households and unlock opportunity. By centering trust, access, and community leadership, the Detroit Tax Credit Coalition is helping families file for the future—and keep more of what they’ve earned.

The aluminium, which is sourced through a collaboration with Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian metal producer, is utilised in the construction of Mercedes-Benz’s new electric CLA model.
Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of Mercedes-Benz’ procurement and supplier quality, said: “There are of course extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium.
The companies chose not to disclose a detailed cost analysis but stated that the production of the new CLA resulted in a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the previous non-electric model.

The initiative is part of the luxury automaker’s broader strategy to decarbonise its operations.

The aluminium, which is sourced through a collaboration with Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian metal producer, is utilised in the construction of Mercedes-Benz’s new electric CLA model.

Executives of both companies told the news agency that the collaboration serves as an illustration of how premium consumer goods manufacturers are prepared to incur higher costs for raw materials to achieve a greener image.

Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of Mercedes-Benz’ procurement and supplier quality, said: “There are of course extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium.

“Sustainability and desirable products, such as the ones we produce, simply go hand in hand,” he said.

The companies chose not to disclose a detailed cost analysis but stated that the production of the new CLA resulted in a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the previous non-electric model.

Norsk Hydro’s CEO Eivind Kallevik said decarbonising supply chains can incur considerable costs, yet by establishing partnerships, the financial burden can be shared, ensuring it does not fall solely on manufacturers or consumers.

Moreover, he remarked that the premium on the metal’s price is not discouraging buyers, even in the recent challenging market for aluminium, which has been experiencing subdued economic growth.

The aluminium produced for Mercedes-Benz at Norsk Hydro’s Aardal plant in Norway is associated with 3 kg of CO2 emissions per kilogram of aluminium, significantly lower than the global average of 16.7 kg, the companies added.

This reduction is partly achieved by incorporating 25% aluminium scrap into the mix, which decreases the need for primary metal produced through “energy-intensive” methods.

As part of its “Ambition 2039” strategy, Mercedes-Benz said that it aims to incorporate aluminium with a 90% reduced carbon footprint compared to the European average into its vehicles by 2030.

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.
Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024.
Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.
Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.","Car buyers are rushing out to buy electric vehicles as the clock ticks down on a tax credit program allowing them to save thousands on new and used cars.

The federal EV (electric vehicle) tax credit is ending on September 30. The program, which allows EV buyers to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new vehicle and up to $4,000 on a used vehicle, was originally slated to last until 2032, but President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is bringing it to a close years earlier.

According to an analysis from the Detroit Free Press using data collected from Cars.com, approximately half of buyers considering an EV purchase are accelerating their purchases to try to get them in before the deadline.

The website told the outlet that demand for new EVs on its site are up by 33 percent when compared to a year ago, and up 22 percent for used EVs over the same time period.

In August, Cars.com conducted a survey asking its customers what was motivating them to buy EVs, and nearly 75 percent of the 950 respondents said that the federal tax credit was a ""major or contributing factor"" to their decision.

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.

Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024. In 2024, EV sales were up 7 percent over the number of vehicles sold in 2023.

The laboratory found that, cumulatively, more than 7.3 million plug-in EVs have been sold in the U.S. since 2010.

Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.

""As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,"" Cox said in its report.

Some experts predict that interest in EVs will come to a halt once the tax incentive ends on the 30th.

Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.

He predicted that there will be ""almost no buyers"" after the 30th because EVs are typically priced higher than gasoline vehicles.

Tim Horvick, the owner of San Tan Ford dealership in Phoenix, told CBS News that the end of the credit is a concern for him, and admitted ""it could be challenging"" to move EVs once the incentive expires.

Cars.com's Detroit bureau chief had a different take, telling the Detroit Free Press that even after the deadline, buyers will still be able to take advantage of incentives offered by state and local governments. He added that car manufacturers like Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hyundai are already planning to roll our new, lower-priced EV models.

In fact, lower prices for EVs, at least in the immediate aftermath of the tax credit expiration, may be on the way. Assuming there is a significant drop-off in EV sales beginning in October, car manufacturers who produce EVs will have to consider how to price their supply of the vehicles amid a sharp decline in demand.

In 2019, and an EV tax credit for Tesla and General Motors ended, both car companies responded to the decrease in demand by cutting prices, according to CNN.

If prices are cut, it won't likely stay that way longterm. Manufacturers are likely going to cut back on the production of EV models to ease the supply pressure to lower their prices.

While some analysts are more pessimistic than others about the fate of EVs, a survey by Cox found that, for more than half of prospective EV buyers, saving money with a tax credit isn't their main interest in purchasing an EV.

According to Cox, 65 percent of those prospective buyers said they planned to buy regardless of the tax credit, and only 20 percent said they would instead choose to buy a gas or hybrid vehicle.

The same survey found the respondents still hoping to buy an EV were more concerned with the fuel and maintenance savings, vehicle performance, and with environmental concerns than their potential savings via a tax credit.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/24/11/54/GettyImages-1392610598.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:36.024951

If you’ve been to a dealership the past couple of months, you may have noticed more drivers expressing interest in electric vehicles (EVs). One reason is that the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill means that the federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September.

For those looking to buy an EV, there are several things to consider regarding eligibility and finances.

An Increase in Sales

“EV inventory is selling fast,” said Justin Fischer, automotive expert at CarEdge. “As buyers rush to take advantage of federal incentives before they expire, EVs are selling faster than gas-powered models for the first time ever.”

According to Fischer, CarEdge Insights shows a 62-day supply of new EVs in September and a 37-day supply of used EVs. Per Fischer, once incentives expire on Sept. 30, don’t expect big manufacturer incentives until December’s year-end sales.

Buyers: What To Know Now

Here are three things every buyer should know now with the credit ending.

The federal tax credit for new and used EVs ends after Sept. 30. As noted by Kiplinger, you must purchase before the deadline to claim up to $7,500 for a new EV or $4,000 for a used vehicle.

Eligibility rules still apply. In fact, Fischer said many EVs don’t qualify, and recommended buyers check the government’s fuel economy website to learn more. This may be especially helpful given that there’s been a great deal of confusion over the federal tax credits, who qualifies and how exactly they work.

Do your homework. If you’re ready to buy an EV, make sure you know what you qualify for and whether your finances are in good enough shape to afford a vehicle. Keep in mind that some state and local incentives might remain in effect even with the federal credits ending.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-of-electric-vehicles-at-charging-stations_iStock-1393199281.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:20.446507

From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery.
But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us.
Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.
The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.","On Saturday, folks across the country celebrated Public Lands Day. Each year, Public Lands Day is a chance to celebrate the open spaces that make Nevada extraordinary. From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery. They provide clean water and wildlife habitat, preserve Indigenous cultural sites and Indigenous homelands, drive Nevada’s outdoor recreation economy, and offer places for families to hike, camp, hunt, and recharge.

But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us. They’re moving through Congress right now, and if passed, they could forever reshape our landscapes.

Two pieces of legislation in particular deserve Nevadans’ attention: the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act (SNEDCA), which was scheduled to be heard in Congress on October 1 but has since been postponed, and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which is advancing rapidly on Capitol Hill, having just passed out of House Natural Resources on September 17. Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.

SNEDCA is being promoted as a balanced bill that conserves lands while allowing for development. Supporters point to provisions that designate certain areas as protected. But Nevadans should look closely. At its core, this bill is a sweeping public lands sell-off.

SNEDCA would open tens of thousands of acres in Clark County for disposal, turning our desert into a land bank for real estate developers. SNEDCA doubles down on a sprawl approach to development at a time when we desperately need smarter planning, water conservation, and genuine climate resilience. We know that sprawl raises costs for working class folks, both directly and indirectly, and detracts from mass transportation services. This bill fails to guarantee any of the land proposed for disposal would actually be used for affordable housing.

The consequences are not abstract. Development on this scale fragments wildlife habitat, threatens desert tortoise populations, and paves over landscapes that recharge groundwater and absorb carbon. Once developed, these lands cannot be restored. We lose them forever.

This is exactly the type of land sell-off Nevadans pushed back against during the federal reconciliation process, when proposals to liquidate Nevada’s deserts raised alarm bells statewide, and indeed, across the country.

At the same time, another bill moving through Congress threatens Nevada’s lands in a different way. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.

Under current law, mining companies must demonstrate a valid mineral discovery before they can use federal land for waste dumps or processing. This safeguard ensures that sensitive lands are not simply commandeered for industrial use without scrutiny. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would gut that requirement, allowing companies to dump toxic mine waste on public lands without ever proving that valuable minerals exist.

For Nevada, home to more mining activity than any other state, the impact would be staggering. The result would be more toxic pollution on public land, more scarred landscapes, and less accountability for corporations.

Taken together, SNEDCA and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act represent a one-two punch: one bill sells off Nevada’s lands to developers, while the other makes it easier for mining companies to pollute what’s left. Both bills prioritize corporate profits over community well-being, over Tribal sovereignty, and over the conservation values Nevadans have fought to uphold for decades.

We know what happens when we fail to protect public lands. Red Rock Canyon, Avi Kwa Ame, and Gold Butte did not gain protections by accident. They were defended through years of community organizing, advocacy, and public outcry. Tribes, conservationists, recreationists, and everyday residents came together to demand that these landscapes be safeguarded for future generations. If Congress approves SNEDCA or the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, we risk unraveling decades of progress in a matter of months.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Nevada can pursue genuine conservation and responsible economic development without selling out our public lands. We should be expanding access to parks and trails, supporting Tribal stewardship of ancestral lands, and protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change. We should not be doubling down on extractive and short-sighted policies.

The choice before us is clear. We can allow corporations and their lobbyists to dictate the future of Nevada’s open spaces, or we can stand up for the values that make our state unique.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-scaled-e1759166037351-2048x1225.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:04.102934

“But Massachusetts has an opportunity to accelerate the deployment of solar in the next five years in spite of those attacks,” Robertson said at a roundtable in Boston. “Massachusetts was an early leader in solar, but we ran into growing pains that brought the industry to a virtual standstill for several years.”

Tax incentives that have saved thousands of dollars for people in the U.S. looking to install home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations like solar panels, or to purchase electric vehicles are set to expire at the end of this year.

The federal residential clean energy tax credit is slated to expire at the end of this year, and the clean energy investment tax credit is scheduled to end after 2027.

Healey said the tax credits have “helped make the electricity we need fast and affordable.”

“The (Trump) administration has slowed down permitting timelines and created other political roadblocks to energy development. They’ve imposed tariffs on materials that are needed for this industry and other industries, including gas turbines to transformers to steel, and this is going to contribute to delays and also to the raising of costs,” the first-term Democrat said.

Industry leaders said elected officials in Massachusetts should reform clean energy permitting to speed up solar projects.

Bronte Payne, senior manager for policy at Sunrun, a renewable energy company, said lawmakers should establish automated, instant permitting in cities and towns where projects are code-compliant and meet safety requirements.

“Automated permitting helps more solar and storage get installed faster and reduces the cost,” Payne told Healey and her deputies.

Healey signed legislation in November that she argued accelerated clean energy development by reforming siting and permitting processes.

The law established a 12-month deadline for municipal permitting for wind, solar, storage, and electric infrastructure. It also required municipalities to issue a single permit at the end of their process.

Robertson said there is no other state in the country where industry officials “can say that a project that we start permitting in 2026 can know that it will have a permit.”

“There is an increasing number of towns where solar and storage is effectively off limits. Your administration’s leadership has broken through this barrier to establish a new system with a standardized, data-driven approach to solar siting and much more predictability on timelines and outcomes,” Robertson said to Healey.

Nick d’Arbeloff, a senior member of the commercial team at ReVision Energy, said solar energy delivered 5,000 megawatts of energy, or $8.2 million in savings for ratepayers in Massachusetts, on June 24, the hottest day of the summer.

Massachusetts has about 5.8 gigawatts of installed solar, d’Arbeloff said.

“Supporting residential solar is essential for affordability, equity, and our broader clean energy goals,” he said.

TotalEnergies is selling 50% of a portfolio of combined 1.4 gigawatts (GW) installed capacity in a transaction valuing said portfolio at $1.25 billion, the supermajor said on Monday.

Thanks to the transactions and the bank refinancing currently being finalized, TotalEnergies will receive a total of $950 million at closing of the sale.

Included in the sale are six utility-scale solar assets with a combined capacity of 1.3 GW, and 41 distributed generation assets totaling 140 MW, primarily situated in the United States. The electricity production of these projects has either been sold to third parties or will be commercialized by TotalEnergies, the French major said.

Unlike other European majors such as BP and Shell, which have outright reduced spending on renewables, TotalEnergies has a strategy to reach a

12% profitability target for its Integrated Power business. This means that TotalEnergies would typically divest up to 50% of its renewable assets once they reach commercial operation date (COD) and are de-risked, which allows it “to maximize asset value and manage risks.”

“Aligned with our strategy, this transaction unlocks value from newly commissioned assets and further strengthens the profitability of our Integrated Power business,” said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies.

In the United States, solar projects could see significant slowdown going forward, due to the Trump Administration’s policies, the industry warned earlier this month.

In a report hailing the installation of close to 18 GW in new capacity—including battery storage—over the first half of the year, which constituted 82% of all new capacity additions, the Solar Energy Industries Association also warned that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has substantially changed the medium-term outlook.

The U.S. solar industry risks losing 44 GW in new capacity additions by 2030 as a result of the current Administration’s policies, SEIA said.

Residential electricity prices rose by 25% during his term in office. States across the country are looking at ways to stop or reduce the increases. But it may be too little too late, as reliable coal plants are being shut down and replaced by costly new systems that magnify the demand growth issues.

PJM Auction Prices Hit Record Highs

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator of 13 states, had its capacity auction clear at record-setting prices as electricity demand is rapidly increasing while supply growth is limited. Growing supply is made more difficult by significant delays in connecting new generation projects to the PJM grid and the retirement of coal power plants. PJM has warned states against prematurely retiring power plants and replacing them with solar and wind units. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation has also stressed in its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment that solar and battery additions have made the resource mix less flexible and more variable.

The 13 states in the PJM Interconnection recently met to discuss the situation, as states are seeing electricity prices increase. For example, this year, energy prices increased across Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with PPL Electric getting a 16% rate increase and JCP&L getting a 19.6% increase. According to 69WFMZ, in Pennsylvania, regulated utilities like PPL Electric are prohibited from owning electric generation. Its electricity is purchased through a series of competitive auctions through PJM.

Electricity Price Increases Enter into the New Jersey Governor’s Race

Beginning in June, New Jersey residents were to receive a 20% increase in electricity prices, resulting mainly from the state’s most recent capacity auction. According to Consumer Energy Solutions, every year in February, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) holds an energy auction that sets the wholesale electricity price that NJ customers pay if they have not chosen a third-party energy supplier. The auction is held yearly to help lessen price volatility. The auction prices apply to about one-third of the state’s supply each year, as they are combined with prices from the previous two years’ auctions. Similar to PJM’s capacity auction, the NJ auction received record-high prices as the state closed its last two coal-fired plants in 2022 and divested its fossil-fuel generating stations in 2023.

NJ state policies, however, have exacerbated the supply problem. Governor Phil Murphy set a goal to make New Jersey’s electricity production fossil-free by 2035 and instituted other decarbonization policies, such as phasing out fossil-fuel plants. New Jersey is also a net importer of electricity from other PJM states, as it does not produce enough electricity in-state to meet demand, forcing it to buy expensive power from the regional grid. According to Gabriella Hoffman in RealClear Energy, it is estimated that NJ Governor Murphy’s green transition plan to wind, solar, battery power, and electric vehicles, if fully implemented, would result in $1.4 trillion in lost income, or $140,000 per average New Jerseyan over the next 25 years. Some family energy bills in New Jersey have exceeded $500 per month.

Via CFACT, while Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican challenger for NJ Governor, wants to overturn Murphy’s green energy mandate, ban expensive offshore wind, diversify the state’s energy sources to include nuclear and coal, and withdraw New Jersey from a multistate carbon tax plan known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Democratic candidate, Mikie Sherrill wants to continue with the failed policies of Governor Murphy to the detriment of affordable energy. And, to gain an edge, she is twisting the words of Mr. Ciattarelli regarding tax increases.

Via Hoffman, the 20% rate hike that was supposed to take effect in June was delayed until September 30, after the height of the air conditioning season. On August 14, the BPU also announced a $100 Residential Universal Bill Credit to help lower bills in September and October, essentially disguising the cost of the new utility bills until after the NJ Governor’s election in November.

Nevada Public Utility Commission Approves New Charges

Some Nevada residents are expecting higher utility costs due to the state’s Public Utility Commission’s approval of a demand charge and net metering changes for NV Energy, a major Nevada utility serving over 1.4 million customers. In April 2026, NV Energy will add a monthly demand charge of $20 based on an average customer’s bill and will make changes to its net metering policy, affecting rooftop solar systems. The plan is to calculate credits for energy returned to the grid from rooftop solar systems every 15 minutes of peak usage each day, rather than monthly.

According to regulators, most residential and small business customers of NV Energy will see lower bills, adding to their already comparatively low rates. Through June, Nevada’s average retail price for residential customers was about 60% lower than California’s price and 22% lower than the U.S. average price. Last year, Nevada generated 53% of its electricity from natural gas, its smallest share in 19 years, with solar contributing 31%. Nevada imports natural gas from neighboring states like Utah.

In 2019, Nevada lawmakers set a 100% zero-carbon emission energy mandate by 2050 under former Democratic Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. To achieve zero-emission energy by 2050, Nevada has phased out its coal plants. That means rate payers are paying for the coal plant retirements and their replacements, requiring the build out of a whole new system. Pushing for an accelerated green energy transition while phasing out reliable energy sources like coal is linked to rising utility costs and reliability issues.

According to Utility Dive, renewable advocates are against the change for net metering, saying that it would erect further barriers to renewables adoption because it would reduce annual solar customer compensation by $136. Depending on how the compensation is calculated, non-solar rooftop customers could be subsidizing rooftop customers, particularly if they are compensated at retail rates where they do not pay for the use of power lines.

Depending on usage, Advanced Energy United indicates that the demand charge could be higher than NV Energy indicates. It calculates that the new demand charge could add $27 per month to the bill of a customer using five kilowatt hours and $38 per month to customers using six kilowatt hours. NV Energy claims the new charge will not make a major difference to the new bills of an average NV Energy customer because the utility is moving some parts of the volumetric rate into the daily demand charge. Via KTNV Las Vegas, the purpose of the demand charge is to incentivize customers to decrease their overall energy usage by spreading out their energy usage and avoiding simultaneous operation of numerous appliances, which would result in less strain on the power grid during times of peak demand.

California Passes Bills to Supposedly Lower Energy Costs

According to The Hill, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several climate and clean energy bills supposedly to “lower electricity costs, stabilize the petroleum market and slash air pollution.” The measures include legislation to increase climate credits on utility bills, expand regional power markets out West, and add $18 billion to the California Wildfire Fund. The cap-and-trade program, renamed “cap-and-invest,” was also extended through 2045.

Analysis

Energy consumers in states across the country are facing higher bills as the grid becomes strained by additional demand, particularly from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification. Unfortunately for consumers, utilities are ill-equipped to deal with these challenges because of prohibitive permitting policies and state renewable portfolio standards that incentivize intermittent wind and solar generation over natural gas and coal. To prevent consumers from being burdened with rising costs, states need to adopt “best of the above” approaches to energy policy that let the market dictate which sources are optimal to meet rising demand.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bigstock-A-Woman-Inspects-A-Dollar-Mone-445270193.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:02:47.179918

It’s connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.
The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action.
Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years.
Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.","So you’re booking your flight, and just when you’re about to check out, the airline asks if you’d like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight’s pollution. Or, maybe you’re an environmentally minded person, and you’ve heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.

Are they worth it? Let’s explore.

Why planes are so pollutive

A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That’s about the amount of pollution you’d save if you swore off meat for 17 months.

Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space — additional warming that isn’t typically included in a flight’s emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.

Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel — biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel — is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.

“Aviation is the problem child,” Vitry said. “Aviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.”

That’s where carbon offsets come in.

What is a carbon offset?

A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It’s connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.

The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).

They’ve gotten popular enough that there’s an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.

Do the offsets work?

Vitry doesn’t think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.

“Unfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation’s climate problem,” she said. “You can’t clear your climate conscience with an offset.”

Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn’t stop your flight’s emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can’t possible absorb all the emissions it’s supposed to.

Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years. She said some offset schemes are overcounted by 10 to 13 times their actual value.

“There’s so much over-crediting on the offset market, so many credits that either don’t represent any emissions reductions at all or represent just a small fraction of what they claim,” Haya said.

She said that’s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it’s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. “The buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,” Haya said.

Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don’t say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project. But she said “high-quality” carbon credits can play an important role where emissions are unavoidable.

Manning said offsets have to be permanent, transparent, and unable to exist without the offset funding.

“When carbon is done correctly, it can provide a credible, immediate way to account for the emissions that travelers cannot otherwise reduce. We all create emissions at some point and it is certainly better to take action to compensate for it than to do nothing,” she said.

Several airlines that offer offsets did not respond to requests from AP to talk about their use. One that did, Southwest Airlines, said in a statement that it does not plan to rely on carbon offsets to help it reach a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

What are you some other options for offsetting your air travel?

Fly less, take the train if you can, and pack light, Manning said.

If you have to fly, think about cutting your emissions in other ways, Haya said.

Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.

“We have an ethical obligation not to fly unless we really have to,” she said.

The school system was awarded $7.1 million earlier this year through the federal Clean School Bus Program to replace 25 of its diesel buses with zero-emission, battery-operated buses. The district, which applied for the money last year, must contribute around $3.4 million of its own funds under a grant stipulation that requires districts to foot 30% of related costs, board members said.

The board’s facilities subcommittee voted 2-1 last week to pay for the buses with the combined federal and local funding, with members Clay Moise and Ralph Brandt voting in favor and member Michael Pedalino opposed. The full board will vote on the plan Wednesday.

In their application for a grant through the Environmental Protection Agency’s $5 billion electric bus program, which launched under the Biden administration, Jefferson Parish officials said the switch will likely save the district around $2.3 million annually in fuel and maintenance costs. The district was awarded the funds in January, and the school board voted in April to accept them.

The Trump administration earlier this year paused funding for several environmental programs, including the clean bus program, causing delays for school districts that planned to purchase new buses. Federal courts have blocked the freeze, but the Trump administration challenged the rulings, making the future of many such programs uncertain.

Changing out diesel buses for electric ones is a growing national trend for school districts, many of which are making the change out of environmental concerns or with the hope of saving money on fuel and maintenance costs.

High up-front costs associated with purchasing an electric vehicle, which can often be twice as much as a typical diesel bus, have also remained a barrier for most districts. Pedalino said that even with help from the EPA’s grant program, he worries about the potential burden on local taxpayers.

“If the grant covered 100% of everything, I’m sure it would probably have an easier road to pass because we wouldn’t be taking resources out of our general funds to pay for it,” he said.

Moise disagreed, saying that the money to cover the buses will come out of an existing district fund for bus maintenance costs.

“Taking advantage of this program is in the best interest of our students,” he said, adding the projected savings mean Jefferson Parish will “have money left over to push into the classroom.”

If the board approves the grant, the district is expected to purchase the vehicles over a period of two years at a cost of around $370,000 each, board documents show. The grant will also pay for 25 charging stations.

In its grant application, the district said that converting to electric school buses will “profoundly impact the community of Jefferson parish,” which has been heavily impacted by pollution attributed to offshore oil extraction. The summary also says that replacing the district’s diesel buses with electric ones is projected to reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by 383 tons annually or by 6,130 tons over 15 years.

If funded, the project “can serve as a blueprint for successful zero-emission journeys for other fleets,” it adds.

The number of electric school buses in the U.S. has grown rapidly, with Louisiana helping to lead the way. Several school districts, including East Baton Rouge, Livingston and Rapides, have received EPA grants to purchase the vehicles.

More than 12,000 electric buses were being used by school districts nationwide as of June 2024 – up from nearly zero in 2017, according to data from Climate Central, a nonprofit that seeks to find solutions to climate change. Around 300 of those buses were reported to be in use in Louisiana, more than in most other states, though fewer than South Carolina and Florida.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a4/da4c9c0e-9a91-4459-86b2-cdee90931417/659dde0f6cc3a.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:28.719283

A consortium of public and private partners announced a plan last week to explore expanding nuclear power production and energy storage in Kansas.

Midwest utility provider Evergy, Washington-based TerraPower, and officials at the Kansas Department of Commerce are partnering on a proposed project to locate a nuclear reactor and energy storage system somewhere in Evergy's Kansas service territory.

TerraPower, a nuclear power company founded by Bill Gates, is proposing a Natrium power plant in Evergy’s Kansas territory.

“Our Natrium technology features a next-generation reactor with enhanced safety and efficiency, paired with utility-scale storage to ensure grid resilience,” TerraPower President/CEO Chris Levesque said in a Sept. 23 press release. “The TerraPower team is excited to advance conversations with Evergy, state leaders, and local communities on the opportunities that the Natrium reactor and energy storage system brings to Kansas.”

TerraPower described its Natrium technology as a 345-megawatt electrical (MWe) sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with a molten salt-based energy storage system.

TerraPower said the agreement will allow the company to evaluate site-specific characteristics for the potential power plant, while exploring the plant’s technical design and ability to support Evergy’s customers.

""Nuclear energy has been part of Evergy's generation mix for decades, and this next step will allow us to explore the opportunity to add reliable, non-carbon emitting advanced nuclear energy in the state of Kansas,"" Evergy Chairman and CEO David Campbell said in a press release announcing the memorandum of understanding. ""This agreement supports our all-of-the-above energy strategy and will allow us to evaluate the cost, technology, and feasibility of potentially deploying Natrium advanced nuclear plants.""

Evergy operates the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generation Station in Burlington, Kansas, about 95 miles south of the Kansas City metro area. The plant, which opened in 1985, generates 1,200 megawatts of electricity and is currently the only nuclear reactor in Kansas.

""My administration has always supported an 'all-of-the-above' approach when meeting the energy needs of Kansas citizens and businesses,"" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly. ""We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state, and I'm pleased we're using innovative methods to do just that.""

According to TerraPower, site selection will be based on many factors, such as community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the site's ability to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.

Kansas' U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, both Republicans, are included in the project's supporters, citing the project's ability to potentially reduce electric costs to consumers.

""Expanding the use of nuclear energy strengthens U.S. energy independence while bringing down electricity costs for Kansas rate payers,"" Moran said in the release.

Marshall described nuclear as ""the way of the future.""

""Nuclear produces reliable, clean power — and a lot of it,"" Marshall said. ""I'm excited about the prospect of welcoming TerraPower's Natrium reactor to Kansas and look forward to helping bring this project to fruition so that Kansans can have safe, reliable, and affordable energy.""

Capital News Service

New federal policy is aimed at addressing the nation’s wildfire crisis by boosting timber production, but some experts say it’s not expected to have a major impact in Michigan.

There are more than 2.5 million acres of national forest in the Northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula, but most forestland in Michigan is owned by the state, local governments and private entities and individuals.

The policy change is reflected in federal actions such as President Donald Trump’s “Empowering Commonsense Wildfire Prevention and Response” executive order and provisions about the sale of timber and long-term contracts by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

For example, Trump’s “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” executive order was promoted as a way to prevent wildfires by reducing fuel loads in high-risk areas.

In part, it requires federal agencies to update guidance to speed up timber delivery and delay or suspend regulations to expedite permitting and reduce environmental reviews.

In addition, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins issued a memorandum stating that her department’s future efforts will promote the production of timber, remove hazardous fuels and remove trees damaged by natural disasters.

Supporters of the policy change say it also will provide a major boost for the U.S. timber industry, as well as preventing wildfires.

However, some experts, including Shivan Gc, an assistant professor in the Michigan State University Department of Forestry, criticize the new policy as more focused on the economy than on the environment. She researches forest economics and environmental policy.

Gc said the policy change may increase timber production in the short term but that she doesn’t expect a big impact on the economy, especially in Michigan, since it primarily applies to federal land.

That includes areas managed by the U.S. Forest Service (under the Department of Agriculture) and the Bureau of Land Management (under the Department of the Interior), and does not apply to state or private forests.

David Prince, the forest planning and operations manager at the state Department of Natural Resources, also said the law will apply only to federal forests and will not affect state and privately owned forests.

Prince said there are three federal forests in Michigan: the Huron-Manistee National Forest in the Northern Lower Peninsula, the Hiawatha National Forest in the eastern and central UP and the Ottawa National Forest in the western UP.

Michigan has almost 4 million acres of state forest.

According to Gc, federal forests make up about 31% of the nation’s total forestland. The non-federal forests are owned mostly by private individuals and companies, with roughly 11% managed by state and local governments.

“These (federal forests) are not distributed evenly across the country,” said Gc. “So, if you think about the Rocky Mountain region or Pacific coast, a large percentage of those forests are federally owned, versus Michigan, where 62% of the forests are privately owned.”

Thus, the new policy’s on-the-ground impact in a state like Michigan may be limited, experts say.

The question of the policy’s economic scope will lead directly to specific government actions on federal forestlands.

Gc said, “So these kinds of treatments probably may be like active forest management kind of strategies, which are going ahead and identifying areas that need to be thinned and then removing excess dead trees or downed woody material from the forest floor.

“Those create hazardous fuel buildup, so removing those should have some positive effects on forest health.

“But that also depends upon how much will be removed. And if you hit that sustainability balance, then it could have negative effects on wildlife or sensitive species,” said Gc.

While the new federal policy prioritizes timber production and fire suppression, a more scientific and balanced strategy, according to Gc, would focus on a different set of priorities.

“If you focus more on the environmental aspect of it, then you’d probably frame it a little bit differently,” she said, “Not just opening up forests for timber production or increasing timber harvest, but maybe focusing more on science, like fire management science or ecological aspects of it.”

It also would take into consideration and incorporate the public’s view and not reduce public comment, she said.",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FORESTS-PHOTO.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 13:02:52.969019

A comparative analysis of these figures reflects that GE Vernova boasts a strong solvency position, which should enable it to fulfill its commitment to invest $9 billion in cumulative research and development (R&D) and capital expenditures through 2028.

As part of this plan, the company has plans to invest $600 million in its U.S. factories and facilities over the next two years (as mentioned in a January 2025 press release). GEV also plans to invest a total of nearly $20 million to expand capacity at its Grid Solutions facilities in Charleroi, PA, which will support the smooth integration of renewable electricity across the United States.

On the other hand, SMNEY ended June 2025 with cash and cash equivalents worth $9.64 billion. On the other hand, its current debt totaled $1.72 million, while its long-term debt amounted to $2.48 billion. A comparative analysis of these figures reveals that Siemens Energy maintains a strong solvency position, which, in turn, should enable the company to execute its manufacturing facility expansion plans effectively and meet the growing electricity demand. These plans include the company’s goal, as of September 2025, to invest approximately $257 million to expand its transformer factory in Nuremberg, Germany.

As far as growth catalysts are concerned, rising demand for both offshore and onshore wind continues to strengthen the outlook for the broader wind industry, as renewables increasingly outcompete fossil-fuel power on cost. This trend positions GE Vernova and Siemens Energy to benefit, as both companies advance their expansion efforts in the wind market.

In September, GEV received an order from Germany’s Enertrag to supply seven 6MW, 164m turbines, among others. In the same month, GEV announced that it clinched an order from Germany’s Prokon Regenerative Energien eG to repower a wind farm with eight 6MW-164m turbines in the second quarter of 2025.

On the other hand, in June 2025, Siemens Energy Berlin delivered its 2000th SF6-free 8VM1 Blue GIS to the monumental Hornsea 3 wind farm in the North Sea, developed by Siemens Gamesa. These are indicative of the solid demand that both GEV and SMNEY’s products enjoy in the wind industry.

Apart from the growth characteristics of the wind energy industry, increasing demand for efficient grid and storage solutions, along with the rising use of non-fossil energy sources such as nuclear, has also been driving growth for GEV and SMNEY.

Risks of Investing in GEV vs SMNEY

Both GE Vernova and Siemens Energy face shared risks in the wind industry, particularly offshore wind, where rising material costs, supply-chain bottlenecks, and regulatory hurdles have strained project economics and slowed deployment. Compounding these challenges, U.S. import tariffs introduced in early 2025 threaten to further inflate raw material and installation costs while extending project timelines — a key downside risk for wind-focused stocks like GEV and SMNEY, which are already navigating a fragile supply landscape and facing pressure to meet ambitious targets.

Beyond the issues related to the offshore wind market, both these companies are vulnerable to the high volatility in cost and availability of raw materials required for manufacturing renewable energy products, including steel, copper, and rare earth elements. This can compress margins and affect the final cost of their equipment and services.

In total, the administration has interfered with just above 62 percent of approved offshore wind energy.
Indeed, federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths.
Without the stable, long-term contracts that offshore wind projects would have provided, ratepayers are left at the mercy of volatile fossil fuel markets.
Finally, all of us can help educate our communities on the critical importance of offshore wind development to the health of our environment and our communities.","The United States has an abundance of reliable offshore wind blowing off its coasts, enough to power the country five times over. Over the last few years, the United States has advanced offshore wind development, issuing leases across its three coasts and approving 11 projects capable of generating enough electricity for seven million homes. However, starting on Inauguration Day, President Trump halted all new leasing, permitting, and approvals for offshore wind energy, which stopped any new wind projects. Since then, attacks against offshore wind have escalated, with the president signing legislation to rapidly phase out and otherwise restrict access to tax incentives while rescinding funding for port redevelopment and transmission upgrades.

Now the administration is interfering with approved projects in the Atlantic: Of the five projects under construction, two were ordered to immediately cease construction, with only vague justifications provided (one project has since been allowed to resume construction and the other was recently temporarily lifted by granting a preliminary injunction); one project had a necessary federal permit revoked; and the federal government has started a process to voluntarily remand the approval of three other projects. In total, the administration has interfered with just above 62 percent of approved offshore wind energy.

Together, these actions jeopardize billions of dollars in private investment, thousands of good-paying jobs, and several gigawatts of clean electricity that grid operators and states are counting on to keep the lights on and meet clean energy mandates.

At the same time, federal officials have engaged in false rhetoric, portraying offshore wind as unreliable and environmentally damaging and repeating unfounded claims about harm to whales without identifying any credible evidence to back up their statements. Indeed, federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths. Collectively, these actions send a chilling signal to investors and developers that the federal government is hostile to business, undermining confidence across U.S. industries and discouraging the commitments needed to cut costs, expand supply chains, and grow the economy.

The immediate consequences of these rollbacks harm consumers and grid reliability. With offshore wind sidelined—and increasing numbers of power-hungry data centers—the East Coast could be forced to lean more heavily on natural gas, exposing families to the same price spikes that have already driven up winter heating and electricity bills. Without the stable, long-term contracts that offshore wind projects would have provided, ratepayers are left at the mercy of volatile fossil fuel markets.

One of the projects that was ordered to cease construction, Revolution Wind, was poised to deliver 704 megawatts of clean energy to Rhode Island and Connecticut next year. The stop order for Revolution Wind, which was recently overturned while an underlying lawsuit challenging it proceeds, will force Rhode Island and Connecticut consumers to rely on more expensive fossil fuels, driving electricity bills up by at least $500 million each year. And because offshore wind delivers power when demand is often high in the winter months, losing this supply weakens the grid and increases the risk of blackouts during extreme cold.

Offshore wind remains the largest untapped clean energy resource, with the potential to deliver gigawatts of reliable power right where it’s needed most. Early returns are demonstrating the benefit of offshore wind: The South Fork Wind project off Long Island has exceeded production goals, reliably delivering power when needed most.

Defending offshore wind will take a village, with a role for everyone, ranging from states and Congress to each and every one of us.

A critical step is fighting back—in the courts and in Congress. Developers and states have already filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s stop work order and permitting and leasing ban, and the outcome of these cases will be critical in determining whether key projects can move forward. At the same time, Congress must act to restore the $679 million in rescinded offshore wind funding and protect future federal investments that are essential for building out the industry. Even where direct authority is limited, Congress can exert soft power through oversight hearings, public pressure, and funding priorities to push back against these cuts.

Governors and state legislatures also have a central role. States must defend their clean energy solicitations and contracts, ensuring that planned projects are not abandoned. States can move forward with transmission projects that lay the groundwork for future offshore wind integration. They should also continue investing in ports and supply chain readiness to keep the region competitive and prepared and support research and technology development that improve the responsible deployment of offshore wind. Above all, offshore wind must remain a cornerstone of state energy strategies, even in the face of federal hostility.

Finally, all of us can help educate our communities on the critical importance of offshore wind development to the health of our environment and our communities. In the face of anti–offshore wind rhetoric from the president and his administration, it is important to understand the facts and help maintain support so that offshore wind can proceed once federal roadblocks are relieved.

Attacks on offshore wind aren’t just a clean energy setback; they are also direct hits to family budgets and our ability to keep the lights on as electricity demand soars. Organizations and individuals across sectors must join forces to raise the alarm that stopping offshore wind will result in higher bills, greater blackout risks, and stalled climate progress, all because of reckless federal hostility.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-09/rhode-island-wind-turbine-construction-2156801158.jpg?h=060ec7d7&itok=4F1pYdwY,N,,2025-09-29 13:01:38.179359

Climate change is straining America's health care system: Study

Wealthy households are more likely to flee hurricanes and flooding than other households: Study

Extreme weather events can devastate communities. Now, a new study finds that it can also have long-term effects on a community's demographics that may hinder its ability to respond to future weather disasters.

The study from the University of Vermont, published in the journal Population and Environment, found that higher-income households left their communities at a higher rate than other households after hurricanes and damaging floods.

""Hurricanes had an impact on both net migration of people and net migration of income,"" said Mahalia Clark, lead author of the study.

The study examined anonymous IRS data from 2011 to 2021 to examine human migration and household income, and overlaid county-level data on weather-related property damage from data housed at Arizona State University.

""There hasn't been a ton of research that looks at how multiple different climate hazards affect human migration in the U.S.,"" said Clark. ""There's even less on that migration's economic impacts.""

Some regions experienced a different response to hurricanes and damaging flooding. The study found that the Northeast, for example, had fewer higher-income households leaving impacted communities.

""In the Northeast, we might be seeing those higher-income households being more responsive to this emerging threat,"" Clark said.

The study found that hurricanes had more of an impact on migration rates than other extreme weather events, but flooding had the highest impact on the income migration rates in affected areas.

""This suggests that you have either more higher-income households leaving, or fewer higher-income households arriving in those places,"" Clark said. ""On average, the household income of the people leaving is higher than the average household income of people coming in.""

Governor Candidate, small business owner, energy expert Brett Hulsey unveiled the Positive Energy Plan(PEP) yesterday before the wisconsinclimatemarch.org.

“My Positive Energy Plan makes Wisconsin better for my family and yours. PEP gives our families good clean jobs, less air pollution, and lower energy and grocery bills for a better future,” said Hulsey, who founded Better Environmental Solutions, an affordable housing, energy and environmental, and general contracting firm in 1995.

“We will move forward to implement Gov. Tony Evers Climate Change Action Plan due out later this year, but we need to move the deadlines up to 2030 because immediate action is needed,” said Brett. “Our families should not have to worry about higher food costs, killer heat waves, deadly rains and floods, losing crops and cows, and poisonous air from carbon pollution, according to the WI Department of Natural Resources.”

The Positive Energy Plan will also build on Governor Thompson’s Climate Change Action Plan from the 90’s, make all Wisconsin government buildings produce more energy than they use as Brett did with grocers across the state.” The seven Green Grocer stores taking action reduced 4 million pounds of CO2 emissions and save 2.3 million kilowatt hours of electricity next year, equal to taking 328 cars off the road.

Brett Walks the Talk for Good Union Jobs

Brett has worked with Master Electrician and IBEW member Dan McGrath to install appropriate and controllable LED lights in dozens of remodeling projects.

“Brett knows what he is doing and walks the talk of clean jobs and energy,” said Dan McGrath of Mainstage Lighting of Madison. “He keeps me busy and wants to put every union electrician in Wisconsin to work with his Positive Energy Plan that will relight every government building in the state.” Brett wants to expand apprenticeship programs so workers can get paid to learn trades needed to build the Positive energy future.

He also worked with Madison Area Technical College to set up training for biofuel plant operators.

Brett’s Positive Energy History

Brett designed and helped build a passive solar addition on the left side of his westside 1930’s Madison farmhouse at 110 Merrill Crest Dr. to accommodate his two kids and family. He used recycled newspaper insulation, Wisconsin barnwood on some of the floors and light colored roofing to reduce cooling costs.

Brett also helped build one of America’s first positive energy homes for energy expert Amory Lovins in western Colorado in 1982. This 4,000 square foot home pumps 18,000 watts of clean solar electricity back onto the grid. The added solar and energy efficiency costs paid for themselves in less than a year, making the home both comfortable and beautiful.

Over 40 Year’s Energy Efficiency Experience

Brett’s energy efficiency experience started as an Energy Conservation Advocate in the Volunteer in Service to America Program (VISTA) in the Carter Administration in Alaska during the Energy Crisis in 1978-1979, earning $396 a month.

“Helping residents and Native Tribes all over Alaska make their homes more energy efficient not only saved them money, it saved lives,” said Brett, whose great-great-grandmother was Native American. “The winters there are brutal and too many people freeze to death.”

County Board, National Positive Power Leader

Brett pushed positive power programs on the Dane County Board for 14 years and was on the National Association of Counties(NACo) Energy, Environmental and Land Use Steering Committee.

Brett spearheaded efforts to build two bioplants to treat 20,000 cow’s manure to make biogas and remove phosphorous to reduce water pollution and uncontrolled cow methane.

Brett pioneered efforts working with utilities and Johnson Controls to make county building more efficient, increase comfort for nursing home patients, and save tax money.

Helped write and pass the first NACo resolution to address climate change in a cost-effective manner.

Brett’s Farm Family Roots Help Him Reach Farmer

Growing up in Oklahoma, Brett worked on his family farm and as a cowboy in Kansas. In Wisconsin, he worked with the WI Corn Growers to build two advanced biofuel plants and promote low carbon fuels, and the WI Soybean Association to start the WI Biodiesel Association, attempting to build a soybean processing plant for producing food and fuel.

“Working on my family’s farms, I understand that protecting farmers and their families protects Wisconsin’s future and landscape,” said Brett. “I worked on federal Farm Bills to create the Conservation and Wetland Reserve Programs that protect millions of acres of habitat critical for fish, wildlife, reducing flooding, and providing cleaner water. Wetlands are nature’s sponges and an acre can store up to 1 million gallons of floodwater.”

For his work, Brett was one of the first civilians to win the prestigious FEMA Distinguished Pubic Service Award for using wetlands to control floods.

Brett’s Family and Education

Brett attended UW-Madison, holds a Master’s in Natural Science and Science Education from the University of Oklahoma, attended engineering graduate school at Dartmouth College, studied Wildlife Biology at Colorado State, and has a B.A. in Political Economy from Middlebury College, VT, where he captained the Cross Country Running Team.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-09-29 14:03:58.229708

ALSO: Brunswick commissioners respond to calls for clean water, apply for grant

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Air Quality approved dust control plans for wood pellet manufacturer Enviva and wood-chipping company Basaga International. The new regulations follow two confirmed complaints in the last year from nearby Sunset Park residents about wood-dust pollution.

Enviva has been manufacturing wood pellets since 2011 in North Carolina and is known in Wilmington for their large white dome storage facility at the Port of Wilmington. Though most citizen complaints are directed at Enviva, the state has identified Basaga, a wood-chipping facility operating at the port since 2022, as a “reoccuring source” of dust pollution as well.

In June 2024, NCDEQ required both companies to adopt fugitive dust-control plans. “Fugitive dust” is the term for particulate matter that becomes airborne from non-point sources, meaning it does not come out of a traditional vent or stack. At the Port of Wilmington, this dust primarily consists of small wood particles escaping during the loading and handling of Enviva’s wood pellets and Basaga’s wood-chip processing.

Wood dust can lead to short-term health problems, including respiratory irritation that can pose a heightened risk for people with conditions like asthma, but long-term effects are still being studied.

The newly approved plans by DEQ outline a step-by-step procedure for Enviva and Basaga International employees to prevent wood dust from leaving the Port of Wilmington site.

Key to Enviva’s plan is enhanced monitoring during ship loading, where associates must record wind speed and direction every three hours. If winds from the west exceed 10 miles per hour, a second observer must be deployed to watch closely for dust. If any fugitive dust is observed leaving the property or if a citizen complaint is received, employees are immediately required to stop work until the dust source is investigated and fully mitigated.

Furthermore, the company must maintain a detailed fugitive dust complaint log of all incidents and actions taken, with the entire plan subject to an annual review by DEQ. The plan also imposes a two-year record-keeping requirement for all operational documentation and stipulates Enviva must cross-reference on-site dust observations with official wind data from the Wilmington International Airport.

“Enviva has been proud to be part of the Wilmington community since 2016,” a spokesperson for the company told Port City Daily. “Over the years, we have continued to build relationships, listen to feedback, and take action to be a responsible and engaged neighbor. Enviva remains committed to being a strong partner in the communities where we live and work.”

The Basaga International dust-control plan is strictly focused on controlling emissions from its wood chipping operations. The plan centers on reducing dust at the source, primarily through the regular application of water or chemical suppressants to stockpiles and work areas to cut back the likelihood of particulates going into the air. This may involve stopping chipping activity when weather like high winds makes dust control difficult. Like Enviva, the company is required to keep detailed records of all incidents and actions, and the entire plan is subject to annual DEQ review.

Port City Daily reached out to Basaga International for comment on the implementation of the dust control plans but did not received a response by press.

Ivy Miller, a resident of Sunset Park, has dealt with the persistent problem of fugitive wood dust for years. She and a neighbor have sent nearly 50 complaints to NCDEQ over the last decade, including letters to the attorney general’s office, which she said have gone unanswered.

“It’s definitely not fun,” Miller explained. “It makes you not want to sit outside, but at some point, you feel pressure you’re going to give up because there’s nobody really holding anybody accountable.”

Miller and her neighbors have dealt with the wood dust accumulating on their homes, in their yards and coating their vehicles. She and other neighbors have also experienced health issues, including heavy sinuses and congestion, which they attribute to the exposure.

Miller explained the dust decreased for a few months when NCDEQ first issued requirements for the management plans in June 2024, but the particulates still continue to pollute the neighborhood.

“There were weeks where we didn’t see anything, but, suddenly, there’d be like two or three days in a row where you see sawdust every morning,” Miller stated. “You wake up and the car, you can see it’s just covered.”

As far as the dust management plans go, Miller is not convinced they will solve the problem.

“I just honestly don’t really think they care,” Miller said about the companies. “Enviva has tried to give us money through gift certificates for Winnie’s [Tavern] down the road and car washes and house washes and I’ve told them, ‘No, I want you to figure out the problem because I moved here before you guys did, and you’re ruining our environment.’”

According to an NCDEQ spokesperson, both Enviva and Basaga will be required to be in compliance with their respective fugitive dust control plans by Oct. 18. The agency will monitor compliance through inspections spurred by new complaints.

NCDEQ has not assessed any civil penalties against Enviva in the last year, but has previously for air quality violations.

The Enviva plant in Sampson County has received five air quality violations from NCDEQ since opening in 2016 for emitting too much carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, resulting in fines in excess of $148,000.

Widely considered the world’s largest wood pellet producer, Enviva operates four plants in North Carolina collectively generating roughly 2.3-million metric tons of wood pellets annually. They are shipped overseas, primarily through the Port of Wilmington. These plants — located in Hertford County, Northampton County, Sampson County, and Richmond County — have all undergone or sought capacity increases since they began operation.

Most notably, the Northampton plant received an expansion permit from NCDEQ in 2019 to boost its production to 780,000 tons of pellets per year, while the Hertford County plant was permitted in 2023 to increase its capacity to 630,000 tons per year. These expansions are coupled with the required installation of new pollution control devices, such as regenerative thermal oxidizers, which destroy air pollutants using heat.

The wood pellet industry is sustained by large subsidies provided by the United Kingdom and the European Union. The UK and EU, starting with a 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, classify the burning of wood pellets as a renewable and zero-carbon energy source, allowing European utility companies to access billions in financial incentives. Although the U.S. also classifies wood pellets as renewable biomass, it provides no comparable subsidies, driving the domestic industry to focus on European exports.

The renewable classification propels international demand, as evidenced by the fact that nearly all wood pellets produced by Enviva are exported to power plants overseas. As a result of this system, Enviva has received approximately $7.7 billion in cumulative net revenue from the start of its public reporting in 2014 through the end of 2023.

In addition to the foreign incentives, North Carolina has provided taxpayer-backed funds to attract and retain Enviva’s operations. State and county economic development grants, including Job Development Investment Grants and One North Carolina Fund awards, total over $7 million for the company’s North Carolina plants since 2011.

However, these revenue streams did not prevent the company from collapsing under its own debt. Enviva filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2024 to restructure about $1 billion. The company’s financial issues stemmed from unfavorable contracts with overseas utility companies and operational issues at its plants. No longer a publicly traded company, Enviva emerged as a private entity in December 2024, having eliminated more than $1 billion in debt and secured new financing from private equity firm American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VIII.

Despite the subsidies powering the industry, the environmental classification justifying them remains controversial. Environmental educator and conservationist Andy Wood explained that claims of “renewable” and “carbon-neutral” wood pellet biomass energy are not entirely accurate. While trees eventually do grow back, he said it can take 50 years or longer for a forest to re-absorb the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere from burning wood pellets.

“It’s harming the climate in two ways: One, burning wood pellets releases more carbon dioxide than burning natural gas or coal,” Wood stated. “The other is, we’re burning trees that, when left to their homes, sequester existing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. So we’re cutting ourselves twice — and we are paying a company to do it.”

Wood, along with other environmental advocates from the Dogwood Alliance, the Southern Forest Conservation Coalition, the Alliance for Cape Fear Trees, and Save Sledge Forest, held an informational tour for the public on the Cape Fear River recently to discuss Enviva’s operations locally and in the state. Environmental advocates have held similar cruises in the past — Port City Daily last attended in 2021.

Anita Cunningham, executive director of the Southern Forest Conservation Coalition and resident of Robeson County near the Enviva facility, spoke during the tour about the impact of the Enviva plant in Robeson County. Cunningham also serves as the co-director of the NC Climate Solutions Coalition and was appointed in 2024 to serve on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.

She previously led grassroots opposition through the Robeson County Cooperative for Sustainable Development, achieving a victory by successfully stopping the proposed Active Energy wood pellet plant (a company distinct from Enviva) in Lumberton in 2022.

Cunningham explained the Robeson community’s struggles with persistent noise pollution from tree debarking as well as particulate matter expelled from the Enviva plant.

“If [particulates] covers their yards, their homes, cars, plants and flowers,” Cunningham stated. “It’s gonna be harmful to you and your community, your health and welfare and your ability to live freely and enjoy your life at your home.”

California now has 68% more electric vehicle (EV) charging ports than gas pumps statewide, according to the California Energy Commission (CEC).

That’s 201,180 publicly available and shared EV charging ports throughout the state, California Governor Gavin Newsom said.

“With this expanding public network, EV chargers are becoming ubiquitous in California,” said CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Our goal is to make driving an EV a no-brainer choice for Californians. They are fun to drive, never need an oil change, don’t cause smog and it’s getting easier to charge your vehicle with public EV infrastructure.”

California’s publicly available EV chargers can be found at convenience stores such as Love’s Travel Stops, Jacksons Food Stores, 7-Eleven, Circle K and more. They are also available at various grocery stores, parking lots, workplaces and sports facilities.

Federal tax incentives for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are set to end on Sept. 30. After that date, tax credits of up to $7,500 for eligible new electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles, and up to $4,000 for qualifying used models, will no longer be available. Additional credits of up to $1,000 are also available for installing home charging equipment and battery storage systems. This expiration is the result of decisions made by the Trump administration.

California state agencies, however, continue efforts to speed up EV charger installation and plan for increasing grid demand. These efforts include:

Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible, workplace and at-home charging installations, including in multi-family complexes, throughout the state.

Prioritizing shovel-ready fast-charging installations for the funding incentives available through the CEC’s grant solicitation programs.

Developing the ZEV Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive plan that lays out the overall infrastructure strategy to meet California’s zero-emission transportation goals.

Establishing charger reliability standards.

Meanwhile, at the federal level, other recent updates aim to further support EV infrastructure growth. In August, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced revised rules for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which had been paused earlier this year for review. The new guidance streamlines approvals, increases state flexibility and removes several planning and consultation requirements.

These changes may reduce regulatory and planning burdens for businesses, including convenience stores, that are eligible to host charging stations. By encouraging site-host-owned locations and simplifying the approval process, the revisions could make it easier for retailers to participate in the NEVI program and expand the public charging network.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-09/background/ev-sign.jpg?VersionId=61nfLcWlg6rvsL1RXFZnuMuoAeNWXb5g,N,,2025-09-29 12:07:28.055829

CARFAX reported a sharp surge in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in September in the U.S. They said consumers rushed to take advantage of federal tax credits for new and used EVs before they expire at the end of the month. EVs and hybrids are selling about 30 per cent faster than they were at the start of the summer, based on the company’s data.

“EV and hybrid sales are spiking, yet prices remain stable,” said Patrick Olsen, Editor-in-Chief at CARFAX, in a statement. “For shoppers considering a purchase, experts say now is the time to act.”

According to CARFAX, the Inflation Reduction Act included EV and some plug-in hybrid incentives. A $7,500 tax credit is offered for new models and $4,000 for used. Congress voted to eliminate the credits, with Sept. 30 as the deadline for eligible purchases to qualify.

A recent Cox Automotive report is forecasting a record 410,000 EVs will be sold in the third quarter. That’s a significant increase — of 21.4 per cent — year-over-year, and up more than 30 per cent compared to Q2. The federal tax credit was considered a “key catalyst” for EV adoption.

“This shift (away from the tax credit) will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, in a statement.

Cox Automotive is anticipating that EV sales will slow notably in Q4, but long-term sales growth will continue.

Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, this week exposed the malign influence of the fossil fuel industry’s climate denial operation and its infiltration of the Trump administration in a comment submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency. Whitehouse’s comment was filed during the same week that President Donald Trump attempted to spread pro-polluter falsehoods at the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking before world leaders in New York City, Trump falsely claimed that renewables “don’t work” and that climate change is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Whitehouse submitted the comment in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding, a 2009 scientific determination by EPA that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare that provides a legal bedrock of U.S. climate policy. Repealing the endangerment finding would fly in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence and set the stage for rolling back emissions standards for motor vehicles, power plants, airplanes, and more, making it easier to pollute.

“This sham regulatory proceeding can only properly be understood against its backdrop: a multi-year, multi-billion dollar, semi-covert campaign of climate denial fraud by fossil fuel interests; and its related multi-year, multi-billion dollar, semi-covert campaign of dark-money political influence and corruption,” wrote Whitehouse.

Whitehouse’s opening in the comment letter details the fossil fuel industry’s orchestration of the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans’ energy agenda, and the industry’s corrupt mission to use the power of government to kill America’s clean energy industry. Whitehouse wrote:

“With this sham proceeding, climate denial fraud has metastasized inside government, with an arm of the operation operating within the halls of government, allowing fossil fuel interests to capture and exert official government agency power. A long and sordid history of agency capture, aka regulatory capture, resounds through the literature of economics and administrative law; this sorry episode of climate denial fraud is its latest and perhaps worst chapter. Consider it fraud-by-government.

“The climate denial fraud operation has never had the goal that its statements be true; only that the falsehoods be loud and persistent enough to confound rational public debate; and that it provide a rhetorical structure for the political forces influenced and/or corrupted by its dark money operation. Those persistent falsehoods and related rhetoric litter EPA’s work here.

“The tactics of the climate denial fraud operation, now deployed from within government, remain the same: an embrace of fake science, propagated by a small stable of reliable climate deniers; deployment of fake proceedings that resemble legitimate proceedings but aren’t; and behind it all the power of fossil fuel industry’s pressure to ram the falsehoods home and protect its free-to-pollute business model. This is a simulacrum of a regulatory proceeding, not a real one.”

The rollback of the endangerment finding, if finalized, would constitute a formal denial by EPA that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare—a position that defies years of scientific evidence, agency precedent, and Supreme Court rulings. To justify the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin relied on a pseudoscientific Department of Energy report written by known climate deniers with close ties to fossil fuel and polluting industries. Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.

“In a world where climate change is causing homeowners to face gut-wrenching financial decisions as insurance premiums and nonrenewal rates soar; farmers to endure massive crop losses from flood and drought; and families to suffer grocery ‘climate-flation,’ food insecurity, displacement, and even illness and death, EPA’s Proposal, with its legal and factual deficiencies, deserves zero credence. As a product of the fraud-by-government stage of the fossil fuel industry’s linked climate denial fraud and dark money corruption operations, it merits condemnation,”Whitehouse’s letter concluded.

Whitehouse and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led the entire Democratic Caucus in a separate comment letter demanding the Trump Administration withdraw its legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding. The 47 senators comprising the Senate Democratic caucus called the repeal of the climate and public health protection a “dereliction of duty” and a “blatant failure to protect the American people.” Whitehouse has also launched an investigation into the extent of fossil fuel and related entities’ improper influence on the Trump Administration’s proposed roll back of the endangerment finding.

Whitehouse has long been the Senate’s leading voice exposing the corruption of the fossil-fuel-funded climate denial operation and the fossil fuel industry’s long-running covert operation to profit off the American people while damaging the economy and wrecking the planet.

The terms staffers are forbidden from using include: climate change, green, decarbonization, energy transition, sustainability, sustainable, subsidies, tax breaks, tax credits, and carbon footprint.

Also on the banned word list is the term “emissions.” According to the report, the term apparently implies some level of negativity, despite the neutrally worded dictionary definition. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases aren’t simply emissions, though, but instead can be regulated as air pollutants.

The EERE was established in the late 1970s after several government agencies were rolled into one. The office was a response to the 1973 energy crisis, which had sent oil prices skyrocketing. The intent of the EERE was to foster renewable energy and energy efficiency in an effort to stabilize the American economy from price shocks that can roil commodity markets, like oil and gas.

President Trump and his appointees have decided to bet the American economy on expanded use of those commodities.

Fusion energy has the potential to deliver abundant, affordable, carbon-free power, and New Mexico will now play a central role in making that future a reality,” said Heinrich, Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and founder of the Senate Fusion Caucus.

“I’m proud to announce that Pacific Fusion has chosen Albuquerque for its new 225,000-square-foot research and manufacturing campus,” said Luján,a member of the Senate Committee on Science, Commerce, and Transportation.“Their technology is built off innovations from Sandia Labs and will continue to advance our state’s leadership in clean energy. This investment will create hundreds of good-paying jobs, strengthen our local economy, and ensure New Mexico continues to lead in innovation. This is another example of how New Mexico is attracting cutting-edge industries and strengthening our state.”

The company’s state-of-the-art research and manufacturing facility will house Pacific Fusion’s Demonstration System, producing more fusion energy output than all the energy stored in the system by 2030, and is expected to start manufacturing operations before the end of the year.

Heinrich and Luján have long supported clean energy innovation. Both lawmakers helped author and pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has created a manufacturing renaissance in the state and established New Mexico at the center of the nation’s clean energy future – and opposed Trump and Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill, which sunsets critical investments in clean energy. Senator Heinrich also founded the Senate Fusion Caucus.

There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs.","Hello, and welcome to Decoder! This is Nilay Patel’s show about big ideas and other problems. I am not Nilay Patel, though I have long wanted to be him.

I am Joanna Stern, the senior personal technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, author of the upcoming book I AM NOT A ROBOT (releasing spring 2026), and, once upon a time, a cofounder of The Verge. I’m the last Monday guest host filling in for Nilay while he’s out on parental leave with his adorable new son, and I’m very excited to be talking today to Ford CEO Jim Farley.

I’m a longtime Decoder listener and my favorite episodes are car episodes. I might not own a gas-powered Mustang convertible like Nilay — I’m not cool enough — but I did, in fact, lease my first EV, a Ford Mustang Mach-E, back in 2023. I think car CEOs are currently facing some of the most fascinating and complex challenges in both tech and business.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

So when I was asked to guest host the show I said, “That’s it, car CEOs.” And Jim was at the top of the list. Jim was on this show once before — his first appearance was in May 2021. And, well, a whole lot has changed in the past four years. Actually, a whole lot has changed in the last four months. The second Trump administration’s barrage of tariffs, trade wars, and a whole lot more, just to name a few.

For Ford, it’s an especially critical moment. Last month, the company announced what it calls the Ford Universal EV Platform, an all-new manufacturing process that the company is calling a “Model T moment” for EVs. That’s because it should, in theory, allow Ford to produce cheaper EVs in a more efficient manner than it does with its current lineup, including my Mach-E. You will hear Jim say “last week” a few times — that’s because we taped this episode in August just after their announcement.

It’s also not just tariff troubles for Ford. There’s the general weakening of demand for EVs in the US, the loss of the federal tax credit, and rising competition from low-cost Chinese competitors like BYD and Xiaomi.

One thing I love about talking to Jim is that he’s honest about it all. You’ll hear him say in plain terms that China is, in some respects, miles ahead of the West when it comes to some parts of its EV industry. And this major multibillion-dollar gamble on a Ford Universal EV Platform isn’t a done deal. You’re going to hear him say the word “risk” quite a lot in this conversation, and how this major manufacturing and strategy pivot could very well fail.

Jim had quite a lot to say about rebuilding the manufacturing base of blue-collar workers here in the US to compete with China — and even AI. Plus, he didn’t shy away from what he’d like to see from the Trump administration on tariffs. He says specifically, “We’re just asking for a fair fight.”

And don’t worry, I didn’t forget to do my best Nilay impression with a bunch of Decoder questions. Is Ford considering Apple’s CarPlay Ultra? (His answer is so great on that one.) How does Jim Farley make decisions? And, most importantly, do I stick with the Ford Mach-E when my lease is up next summer? I also couldn’t let Jim go without hitting him with a special call-in question from an old friend who’s technically not supposed to be working right now. I think you’re going to really like that one.

Okay, hopefully you’re in your car listening to this: Ford CEO Jim Farley, here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Jim Farley, you are the CEO of Ford Motor Company. Welcome back to Decoder.

Great to be here with you, Joanna.

Thank you for coming on my show. Obviously, this is not my show, this is Nilay’s show, but I want to give you some background. I listen to Decoder all the time, and I love Nilay’s car CEO interviews. But often I find myself saying, “Nilay, why didn’t you ask that question?” So, when he asked me to do this, I said, “That’s it, I’m going to bring on car CEOs. And I’m going to ask the questions I want.”

I see.

[Laughs] So you were last on the show in May 2021. Things have changed considerably in the world, in technology, in the country, and at Ford. I want to talk about all of those things. But something also changed for me. In 2023, I got a Mustang Mach-E. I leased one.

Thank you.

And that lease is up next summer.

Ah, I’ll be reading about your decision process.

Well, that’s going to inform a lot of this conversation because I wanted to give you the chance to be the world’s best car salesman to the most annoying customer. I think that’s just going to set a lot of the backdrop of this conversation.

[Laughs] I love it.

Last month, you said at a press conference that the Mach-E is not so great, that it’s not the future of Ford. Why should I stick with a Ford EV next time?

Well, we just won the revised Model Y versus Mach-E drive evaluation by a pretty respected magazine. I’m still pretty proud of the Mach-E. We knew what we knew then (five years ago) and we now know what we know now. Those are, as you said, two different things.

I would say that in the second inning of product development, Ford really understood the opportunity to serve the EV market more fully than we did several years ago and we executed a product with the right approach based on those lessons. That’s with the consumer, because we’ve learned what consumers are willing to live with and not — like charging on the fly — as well as where in the market Ford should participate and put its limited resources. I think you’re going to find that the Ford EV product range will be much sharper, more specific, and more valuable to customers than it was when you last shopped.

Let’s dig into the news you just announced, which is that you have something called Ford Universal EV Platform. What is that, and when is it coming? More specifically for me, will it be out next August, and will I be able to get that kind of new Ford versus an upgrade to my Mach-E?

You’ll learn a lot more about the first product. It’s a platform that will be out in 2027. We learned so much from the Mach-E. We’ve been number two to Tesla. We’re a long way behind them, but we’re number two in the US market in EV sales. EV sales aren’t the most important metric, but it does give you an indication that Ford has learned a lot and has served a lot of wonderful customers like you. We have all of the data coming off the vehicle, so we have learned a lot about customers.

We believe the platform that we shared in Kentucky is a breakthrough approach for developing and delivering an affordable, electric platform to customers, where we’ll develop and launch several vehicles over the subsequent few years and show that we can have a profitable vehicle that’s sustainable in terms of the company’s resources and made in the US. But in order to compete with the likes of BYD, who we think are among the best in the world, we had to completely reinvent the platform for the customers.

There’s a lot to that. I’m sure we’ll get into it, but in short, the evolution revolution of our thinking was to develop a vehicle for manufacturability, to radically reduce the cost and the complexity of the vehicle with all new thinking that is not embedded in a traditional car company. To do that, we needed all new talent, and we needed them to be separate from Ford, separate from our IT solutions that we used to develop and release parts, and separate from a philosophy standpoint about how to radically simplify the vehicle. This is all to really get back to the basics of Ford and Henry Ford’s idea of a “universal car.”

Our first body style will be a pickup, but it’s really not a pickup. I would say it’s a new silhouette. What I mean by that is that it has more room than a RAV4, the best-selling passenger car in the US. That doesn’t include its frunk and pickup truck bed. It is very fast, it’s rear-wheel drive, it’s super fun to drive, and it has a digital experience that no one’s seen — at least that we’ve seen — even in China. The digital experience is quite different for customers. I think the whole package is something that has not been offered in the US or anywhere else to date. I think this first product is quite revolutionary.

And this first product is what you’re going to have out in 2027?

Yes, exactly.

You’ve mentioned BYD, which is a Chinese competitor that is making low-cost, very high-tech EVs. Here in the US, you’re up against Tesla and GM. You mentioned that you have the second-best-selling EV, but GM seems to have had some real luck with the Equinox EVs, and they’re quickly taking off because of price.

Absolutely.

Is the move to put this new platform out against this backdrop enough? Is it enough to compete both here and in China?

For us, it could be. Globally, no,, it’s not enough. In North America, it’s absolutely the right strategy, but it’s not our complete strategy. GM has 14 nameplates, we have three. We came out with our vehicles four or five years ago, and it’s coming out with them now. So, our product cycle is completely different. What I mean by that is we’re about to launch our second generation of products, and it has its first 14 out now. I hope it outsells us. If I were GM with 14 nameplates, it should easily scale. I personally didn’t think we would be number two for three years with our simple lineup, but it seems to have worked so far in the first inning.

The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry. There’s no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we’ve seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China. They have 20 million units locally, and about 11 million are EV or [extended-range EVs], So half that market. We’re barely at a million vehicles here in the US. That’s one tenth of China’s volume. Europe’s only twice as big as us, so that’s maybe only one fifth. China’s successful for good reason. It has great innovation at a very low cost.

For example, it bet on [lithium iron phosphate] technology, not these expensive lithium batteries. There’s hundreds of companies, and they’re all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies. It’s new brands. It’s BYD and Geely, and companies like Nio and Xiaomi, many of which have never been in the car business before, and that’s a big advantage for them. In China, the brands that are winning are indigenous brands. They’re not global automotive companies, they’re really Chinese companies. To beat them, we need a completely different approach. It’s not the number of vehicles you have or the price you offer the customer. Everyone’s going to have affordable EVs. If you sell an affordable EV in the US for $30,000 but it costs you $50,000 to make, you could say you have an affordable EV, but that’s not a sustainable business.

Three or four years ago, we saw this affordable customer duty cycle changing with our sales. It became very obvious to me that we had to go outside of Ford, create this maverick group, give them resources and stay out of their way, but make sure that they deliver on a completely new approach because the Chinese are so formidable, they have so much support from the government, and their customers have such a high expectation for the digital experience that an incremental approach from Mach-E would never work.

I love you telling it to me real straight here. It’s exactly what I was thinking. In some ways I’m driving a dinosaur, right? That’s the whole reason I leased a number of years back.

Smart move.

I want to go back to price. I was charging at an Electrify America station in Connecticut recently, and four out of the six stalls had these Chevy Equinox EVs. I asked this woman how she likes hers. She said she liked it, but the thing she was really talking about was the price. She said, “We like this car and the price so much that we actually got two.” And she pointed to her husband who’s in the other stall. I’m not thrilled that this type of family’s taking up all these stalls, but it’s fine. I forgive them.

I’m wondering if just getting that price down so that EVs can finally take off in lower, more affordable areas is one of your motivating factors right now.

To your point, I think it was inevitable that government support would wane. It was inevitable that the duty cycle wound up being EV customers who use their car for commuting and shorter trips, and occasionally taking a longer trip. This happened in the 1910s over 100 years ago. Steam was 30 percent, electric was 30 percent, and the rest was internal combustion engines. A few years later, it was totally different.

Back then you could not call which technology would win. It’s the same now. The EVs came at the high end, and I would say $40,000 is expensive now for most people. We don’t talk about it in the car business because more than two-thirds of the cars sold in the US are used. We never really talk about those two-thirds, but their average price is around $30,000. The average new car is obviously much higher than that. Most of the five-year-old vehicles that people are driving around in the US are going to be around $30,000. This is the most important part of the EV market. It’s not expensive Lucids and Teslas. That’s all interesting, but what is really going to move this market is a non-government-subsidized, affordable EV that people can afford, and that’s at a lower cost to use than a used Model Y because there’s a lot of those around.

For people in America who have a tough time with all their demands, want to go on vacation, want to put their kids through college, and want to have a house or whatever, $30,000 is the most they want to spend. I think that customer you met is very typical. Sorry to use a baseball analogy, but this next inning is completely different from the first one, where the fitness of the companies doesn’t rely on the government, and we have to innovate.

I said it last week, and I’ll emphasize it now: there are no assurances that we can do this. No one has ever built a car in three pieces. No one’s offered their own electric architecture at this price. We’ve never done it. We’ve never had two large unit castings and high quality. No one’s done it. Tesla’s talked about it, but it hasn’t done it. In fact, our manufacturing process has radically moved on beyond what Tesla’s ever shown in its unboxing. So, there’s a lot of risk here. This is not a guarantee that Ford’s going to get this done.

You’ve segued really nicely into my next set of questions, which are the Decoder questions. You’ve set out to build something, and now you’ve got to figure out the structure to build it. You said you had to create a maverick group that was separate from Ford, separate in terms of IT. Now, you’ve got to take this skunkworks engineering team, which I believe is in California, and you’ve got to bring that into the big castle that is Ford.

Yes.

How do you think about integrating these new skunkworks ideas into this bigger system? Have you mapped out how that’s going to happen?

Yes. We’ve been working on that for a couple years now. One of the things that really helped us in that regard was that Alan [Clarke], the leader of this Universal EV Platform team, was free to have Ford people on his team but had the right to say no to anyone. So, he went through a very rigorous process. He’s had the team that scouts for the manufacturing process for all this new stuff for three to four years.Of course, we’ve been listening to them. We have a lot of good experience at Ford, too, that knows how to handle risk in supply chain and risk in manufacturing and new processes like the one we use with aluminum F-150. It’s a different problem, but the same process of risk elimination. It’s a plan that has come together.

It’s important to have a plan, but you get out of the plan pretty quickly because of surprises. The supplier isn’t as good as you thought, they’re running late, or software for a module is running late. Then, you have to really de-risk. The way we’re thinking about it is, “Let’s make a simple one first. Let’s not try to add all the complexity. Why don’t we just make one color, one version, one spec at the beginning, and massively simplify the task for everyone? What is the basic level of software capability?”

We don’t need all the singing and dancing, hands-free automation at launch. Maybe we focus BlueCruise on a simple operating domain like high-speed safety, with hands-off highway operations for the autonomy solution. Then gradually, as we verify the delivery of that base capability — whether it’s the vehicle structure, the manufacturing process of the suppliers, or even automation — we start to introduce more complexity and capability over time when we feel comfortable. That makes it stressful for the go-to-market team because, frankly, they don’t know what they’re going to be selling in a year and a half. But that’s the only way we’ve found to do this.

I want to stay on some more Decoder questions, and call you out. In your first Decoder interview in 2021, you dodged the question, “How do you make decisions?” In fact, I was listening to the episode in my Mach-E last week and just screaming, “Jim, you didn’t answer.” You answered about the company’s strategy, but you didn’t answer how you specifically make decisions. I feel like you’ve had to make some big decisions here with this new platform. So, how do you do it?

Let’s just be specific. In this case, I looked at the wiring loom in the Mach-E. It’s a beautiful wiring loom, but it’s 70 pounds heavier than the Model Y’s wiring loom, and it’s $200 a battery to carry that wiring loom around. I just had to ask myself the question, “Can my team do it?” Taking the wiring loom as a metaphor, can my team beat BYD?

I went to [Executive Chairman] Bill Ford, the board, and my team. I said, “I love you guys, but I don’t think we can do this.” The decision I arrived at, which was highly informed by meeting Doug Fields, was that we had to do it completely separately. Doug is a Model 3 chief engineer and worked on the car project at Apple. He was one of the first-generation software designers in AOS. He also designed the Segway early in his career. He’s been at the forefront of a lot of technology revolutions time and time again. I asked him, “Why can’t Ford do it?” He’s like, “Jim, your part release system, your IT, your CAD design systems are 25 years uncompetitive. There’s no way you can beat BYD with that. You need real expertise.”

BYD has vertical integration with the batteries. Its batteries are 30 percent cheaper than what we can buy from CATL. For us to beat that battery, to even be in the neighborhood in terms of cost, we have to radically redesign the efficiency of the motors, gearboxes, and inverters on the EV side so it uses 30 percent less battery. We can’t beat BYD’s vertical integration on the cost of battery. The only way we can beat it was with innovation on the draw of the battery.

When I got the list of inventory from Doug about what we have to do to beat BYD, even three to four years ago, it became very obvious to me that I had to look my team in the eyes and say, “Eventually we’re going to come back to you for the industrialization of this product. But for now, leave these people alone, trust that they don’t have any prejudice in coming up with something better. If you want to get mad at me, you can come into my office and shout at me, but don’t waste their time.”

I talked to Bill, and I also do Gemba. I go in person for every big decision I ever make. I went to that teardown and looked at every piece. I looked at the number of fasteners in a Model Y. It was literally a third of the fasteners that go into a Mach-E. From a customer standpoint, you won’t tell the difference, but from manufacturability and cost standpoints, fasteners are an output metric for how elegant your engineering solution is. When I looked at those fasteners and the wiring loom, I knew I had no choice because I gemba walked and talked to people who knew. I can’t put the company’s future at risk by making people happy. I have to do the right thing. That’s how I approached that particular decision.

Can I interrupt you quickly to tell me what gemba is?

Gemba is something that I fell in love with at Toyota. Gemba is “genchi genbutsu,” which is a Japanese phrase for “go and see with your own eyes, learn with your own eyes.” It’s actually the five senses. The idea is that before you make a big decision or want to understand a problem, you have to go and see the real problem and where the waste is. It’s a tool in problem solving.

In my case, the waste was that wiring harness, those fasteners, all the welds, the front and rear structures that’ll eventually get displaced by unicasting. You see the waste. You look at it, you ask the engineers: “Why do we have this waste? Why do we use a 25-year-old parts release system?” As a leader, you get down on the floor and you ask them the basic questions, so you can visualize your decision. That’s what gemba is.

Love that. Didn’t know that before. I need to practice gemba, clearly.

Let me back up here. You have to restructure your company, but it also seems like you’ve been talking about restructuring the economy. You’ve been talking about a refocus on the “Essential Economy,” or the blue-collar jobs that are the backbone of this country.

You wrote a LinkedIn essay in June about the focus of AI on white-collar productivity, but that we need to do the same for blue-collar work. How are you thinking about automation at Ford?

There’s a complete crisis in the country that’s not being talked about. People like Mike Rowe will talk about it, but we have a crisis that’s not in the public debate. We have a 500,000 construction worker shortfall. We have a 500,000 factory worker shortfall. We don’t have enough people in emergency services to support our society when things go wrong. Firemen, ambulance workers, medical workers, plumbers, and electricians — the frontline people that make our society run that many of us take for granted.We call this the Essential Economy.

We see this at Ford because we’re on the edge of this software-defined vehicle, but we’re also a heavy manufacturing industrial company. Whether it’s a technician shortage in our dealerships to work on these vehicles or the factory worker shortage, I really learned as a leader during the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike what a crisis we have as a country. I see it with our customers. Plumbers and electricians are constantly trying to get young people into those vocations, and there’s no training. The trade schools and apprentice programs that our grandparents had that made this country so great are not there anymore. We’re very vulnerable as a country.

The productivity of those essential workers, as you said, is way behind that of white-collar workers. Automation, AI deployment, and everything else that has happened for white-collar tools, it’s not the same for blue-collar work. There’s very little training. Companies like Ford, thankfully, have enough resources that we can put our backs behind this problem with trade schools and scholarships, but our society isn’t doing it. In fact, we’re going to have a conference here in Detroit in the fall where we’re going to gather other companies that have the same problem and really see it — solution providers, academics, and creative people in government — and we’re going to try and start working on this problem.

Is it a Farm Aid or medical crisis like COVID? No, it’s more. In a way, it’s just as threatening to our society. The way we’re thinking about it is that we’re going to walk the walk and invest heavily. We have been. We spent about $1 billion on the dignity of the workplace and safety in our plants. We’ve modernized our buildings. We’re investing in trade schools and scholarships to recruit technicians for vehicle repair as well as our factories.

But this is a society problem. The one that bothers me the most is cultural. We, as a culture, think that everyone has to go to an Ivy League school to be valuable in our society, yet we all know that our parents and grandparents made our country wonderful because of these kinds of jobs. There’s incredible dignity in emergency services, and people can have wonderful careers. But our society doesn’t celebrate those people like they do the latest AI engineer.

That’s exactly what I wanted to ask you. This seems like such a reversal of decades of messaging in America that said “Get out of manufacturing and go to the office.” Is your advice to this next generation to actually go get a job in manufacturing?

I think it would help all of us as a society. Look, my son [Jameson] is 17. He’s a senior in high school. He’s got every opportunity that you could ever imagine. He doesn’t have to worry like most people. I made sure that he had a summer job where he learned how to weld, to fabricate, to really work with his hands, and relate to people. And he can make a choice. I have no prejudice for Jameson. If he turns out to be the greatest welder or a mechanic working on our Super Duty diesel engines, I will be so thrilled as a parent. I think we all need to look at ourselves and decide what kind of society we want to build in America. Let’s say that we’re getting into war somewhere. Google’s not going to make the boots, but Ford will. To defend our own country, we need these people.

Now, we’re having critical issues. The average ambulance is 15 years old. We do not have enough emergency care people. Look at what firemen are having to go through in California with smoke and their own health. These are very dangerous jobs, and we have a shortage. It’s going to affect all of us in a lot of annoying ways. We need to really get serious about readjusting our expectations for our kids, younger people, and our country to give them opportunities to grow. And these are great jobs. A factory job at Ford could make way over $100,000 a year, and you can bridge into a lot of other things. My grandfather was a factory worker at Ford, and he became a Ford dealer in his 60s. Think about the possibility. He was an orphan, he had nothing. He never went to college. It didn’t matter to him.

I’m really excited and energized about this. It’s a much bigger problem than fixing Ford and making it a world-class company. It’s important for our country. We need to focus on this just as much as the new exciting AI and the new social media dance on Instagram. Let’s get busy working on these important problems.

I do have a call-in question from a guest caller.

Nilay Patel: Hey, Jim, it’s Nilay. I’m very excited to be calling in with this question. As you know, I’m a Mustang guy. I have a 2021 Mustang GT convertible. It’s one of my favorite cars ever. People love this car because it’s so easy to mod and tune. You can just reprogram the engine control unit (ECU) to make the car go faster. But with the new version of the gas Mustang, the one with all the screens running on your new platform, the ECUs are locked. People can’t just reprogram them. A lot of enthusiasts attribute the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales to the locked ECUs.

My questions are: Do you agree with that, that the locked ECUs are behind the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales? Do you have a plan to let people unlock the ECUs and tune the car more easily? Thanks for answering the question. Joanna, I’m sure you’re doing a great job.

I have no idea what that question means. So–

[Laughs] I do.

I’m going to set a timer. You get a minute to answer that.

I have this debate with my son, actually, because he has an older Mustang. He didn’t buy the new one for reasons like that. I would absolutely say the drop in sales is not due to that. Actually, we’re doing really well with Mustang. I think we’re the only one left really, which we’re quite proud of. We’re investing a lot in Mustang. I think the thing people don’t get about Mustang is that it’s a global car. It’s the best-selling sports coupe in the world. We outsell Mustang outside of the US than inside the US. When I look at sales for Mustang, I look at globally. The Mustang continues to grow in some of our biggest countries like Australia and Sweden because people want a little slice of that America. Everyone wants to do a burnout.

As far as the vehicle’s tunability, I think the call-in question is outstanding. This is a real dilemma for us, and there’s no easy answer. We want people to modify their cars, but we also have to take quality and privacy really seriously. I think he was talking more about the performance of the vehicle, and over time, our approach would be to give people the option to digitally adjust their vehicle from Ford, so that we can maintain quality but still let the user have their own idea of performance. That’s different for everyone, and I think that vision will come to life in the coming years.

The aftermarket is a real opportunity, but it’s also a big challenge for us because a lot of people like to write software in the control module that controls the powertrain to get better performance. But what they don’t know, and what the user may not be aware of, is that all the reliability and the quality issues that might come up are very expensive. My daughter’s boyfriend is one of these people. He bought a brand new F-150, he’s got a supercharger on it. He recently got a bunch of error codes because he updated the ECU against Ford’s standards, and now he needs thousands of dollars of expensive repairs because the vehicle has started chewing its camshaft. It was great that he could get 650 horsepower out of his EcoBoost F-150. He didn’t think about what he was doing to the reliability of the vehicle, but we have to at Ford.

All I would say is that it’s a tough problem to solve. We always want to give customers a chance to tune their vehicles, but we actually know a lot about the reliability of the vehicle. Are we as a brand going to let our quality reputation suffer to give a person the ability to modify the vehicle? I think that’s a hard compromise for us to make.

I actually understood most of it. I want to move on to the big T in the room: the tariffs. Last quarter, you operated at a loss despite record revenue because you took $800 million in tariff charges in Q2, when tariffs were actually lower than they are now. What are your conversations like right now with the administration?

They’re very important. Ford is the most American company in terms of the quantity of vehicles we make in the US. Over 80 percent of our vehicles sold here are made here. But we also are the largest importer of parts. The discussion we’re having with the administration today covers three policy areas: tailpipe emissions, tax policy, and especially tariffs. On tariffs, the biggest issue is the $2 billion bill for our imported parts. Because we make the most in the US, we import the most parts. We have a lot of stackable tariffs. There’s fentanyl tariffs, [Section 301 tariffs] from China. We have steel and aluminum tariffs that are now over 50 percent. There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs. They all stack up. So, we have this layering of all these imported parts.

To make an F-150 affordable, there are a lot of parts we can’t make locally, like wiring looms and fasteners. There are thousands and thousands of parts that we have to import because we can’t even buy them in the US. If we did, the vehicle would be $100 to $200 a month too expensive for customers. Our discussions with Washington, D.C. are really clear: “Look, we both agree. Let’s strengthen US companies like Ford that have bet on America. We have more UAW jobs than anyone, but don’t penalize us for trying to make the vehicle affordable.”

We’ve had very productive discussions with the Department of Commerce, the president himself, and the whole administration on how to come up with a way to minimize this $2 billion bill so that we are advantaged as a company. Originally, they were thinking that there would be high tariffs for finished automotive vehicles. Fifty percent of all vehicles bought in the US are imported through a port or a rail across a border. Now, it looks like the standard tariff will be about 15 percent and 12.5 percent from Japan. That’s not a fair fight. We’re just asking for a fair fight. If you’re going to allow people to import with 15 percent tariffs, which includes their parts in the vehicle, but you put a 50, 60, 70 percent tariff on the aluminum steel that goes into our US-made vehicle, let’s work on a process for tariff relief that would allow us to do that and still make the vehicles affordable.

That’s what we’re talking about with the administration. They’re extremely open, and they’re extremely supportive of us. They’re also making a lot of policy changes on tailpipe emissions and tax. Look at the EV credits as an example. We can get to that if you want. But the tariffs are the most critical for our profitability. About 20 percent of our profit has evaporated now because of these parts tariffs. We’re highly engaged with the administration. I remain very optimistic that we will find a solution, but it is very expensive.

I wanted to ask about the EV credits because between the tariffs and the EV credits going away, it feels like this administration is on your side. Yet, you are also adding more jobs than ever to manufacturing here in the US. You’re doing the things the president wants.

Yes. I do generally believe that those three policy areas are very important. Joanna, we didn’t feel like we should get a $7,500 check on an EV to make the transition successful. We do need support for the production tax credit on batteries, so that we could be competitive with China because it has such a huge advantage, and we do need to onshore that IP to start really scaling battery manufacture. You can’t ship a battery overseas. It’s very heavy and it’s not a good shipper, which we say as a shipper.

We have gotten a lot of support from them for making batteries here in the US. The PTC credit is very important. We have changed our EV investment to not depend on the consumer tax credit from the government, and we’re fine with that. Other countries like China and in Europe do support their EV consumers. We didn’t really expect that at Ford. We’re kind of a “lift ourselves up by the bootstraps” kind of company anyway, so that was something we already did.

But the relief on fuel economy standards is a very important topic that the administration clearly has a point of view on. We want one national standard, and we want to be able to sell what customers really want. Hybrids are really popular now, and so are EVs. I think we’ll find a tailpipe emission standard that is more reasonable and sustainable and not have a bunch of states with unique standards that make logistics for cars a nightmare, since you have to send different states different emission-standard cars. And that’s really expensive for customers, too.

The real area that is super critical for Ford and for companies like Ford that are committed to the US, is tariffs, working through and making adjustments as they and bilateral trade deals get announced. We need to find a landing spot that works for companies like Ford, where it’s a level playing field from a tariff standpoint and the administration accomplishes what it wants to accomplish. We’re not there yet, and that’s why we’re working really hard. I spent a lot of time in DC, and there’s a good reason for it. This is really important for our factory workers, for the future of our country, and for the shareholders of Ford.

I want to come back to me because really this whole podcast is about me, obviously.

[Laughs] Good.

One of the main reasons I decided to get the Mach-E, other than it having good range and me loving the way it drives, was that it had Apple CarPlay. Some of your competitors have abandoned CarPlay. A lot of the newer, upstart car companies, like Rivian and Tesla, have their own software. I want to talk about this new Digital Experience you guys are working on, but I want to just cut to the chase with CarPlay. What about CarPlay Ultra? Are you considering that?

We are. We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one, but we’re very committed to Apple. I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car. We want you, Joanna, and all the customers to bring in their digital life, and make it as easy as possible. We don’t think we should restrict that to make money off the customers. We don’t want it to be a hassle. We don’t think we can design an experience that’s going to displace your phone. At the same time, there are things that Ford is working on to add on top of the Google and CarPlay digital experience, whether it’s automated systems or the way a trip gets planned, that will make it even better.

We’re highly informed by what’s going on in China right now, specifically the customer experience part. An AI assistant in the car, let’s say, is very important for Ford. We think that every customer should have an AI assistant in the car. Not just a voice to move to your phone-based AI system but something specific that you can talk to, almost like a companion. To allow everyone to bring their digital life into the car and have it seamlessly integrated is a more complicated journey for us to execute. Then, put more on top of that, whether it’s productivity software (we’re now up to 1 million Ford Pro subscriptions now), BlueCruise, how you plan a trip, or auto specific things like how your [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] (ADAS) system works and how it integrates into your entertainment system. We believe we have to design something that works with your digital life as well.

It’s a more complicated choice, especially when you look at backcasting it into all of our past vehicles, but I believe it’s a more customer-centric approach. And you will see that, Joanna, in your next shopping trip. You’ll make that choice, we’ll all read about it. That’s our philosophy. Now, other companies have different philosophies, but we believe that our philosophy is the most customer-centric.

But it seems like with the Ford Digital Experience, which you have rolled out to some cars and is based on Android Automotive, that you’re going to have to choose. Are you going to do this Android Automotive experience with the things you’re talking about building on top, or are you going to pick a CarPlay Ultra experience and go all on Apple?

I see what you mean. It’s a really good question. I don’t know where Apple’s going to go. I think Apple has to make a big decision. It’s not a Ford decision, actually. Then, we will decide based on their decision.

You mean that Apple has to make a decision, or are you going to allow this to also run in combination with other infotainment software?

Yes. Not only that, are you going to allow OEMs to control the vehicles? How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?

We’re doing that now for our Pro customers. If you’re a Pro customer, you can limit access to the vehicle on the weekend. Many of our plumbers and electricians have a company vehicle and they’re not allowed to use it on the weekend. We allow speed control now, so you can’t go above the speed limit. Is Apple going to want to do that? If Apple wants to do that, I think we’re going to have a tough time because then the Digital Experience gets really messy, and we’ll have to decide between Google and Apple, to your point.

Now, Google has two different layers. It has Google Automotive Services, which is a curated digital services experience in the car, but it also has Android Auto, which is an operating system that we can build our own experience on top of. So, Google as a platform company gives us both. Apple has a totally different approach. Again, I’ve talked to the Apple team and our team is in contact with them. I think Apple has to decide if it wants control of the entire experience inside a vehicle. If it does and it wants to follow Ultra with the Ultra 2 or whatever is next, then Ford will have to make a big decision.

I know where we would go. We believe ADAS integration with your entertainment system is so critical. In three or four years when you’re flying down the highway with your eyes off the road going 80 miles an hour on Interstate 5 and you’re watching a movie, having a ChatGPT moment, or having a wearable on, we don’t think that a system from a tech company that’s not integrated into the car is going to save your life. So we’ll have to make a choice.

It sounds to me that you’ve been forced with the reality that you’ve got to build your own.

Yes, but the good thing is that now versus when you and I last talked, Android Auto is advancing nicely. We’ve learned a lot about how to build an experience on that. I hear a lot of OEMs say, “Well, it’s about controlling the customer. I don’t want Apple to be able to...” That’s not a big deal for us. We just want it to be easy for customers. But if those companies want to control the vehicle, I think that’s a bridge too far. In that case, we have to invest a lot more in a Ford experience.

I hope that doesn’t happen, by the way. I look at what has happened with Huawei and Xiaomi in China. It’s amazing. Those companies are all in on auto. When you’re a Huawei or Xiaomi customer, you either buy a Huawei system in someone else’s brand or you buy a Xiaomi car, and it’s completely seamless. I wish our tech companies had approached the auto industry that way, but they haven’t. Now we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do.

You said something really interesting about how you want to have an AI companion in the car. I am actually spending a lot of time in the car now talking to ChatGPT. I’m not listening to Decoder. I have my iPhone, it’s coming through CarPlay, it’s Bluetooth paired, and I’ve got my ChatGPT app. I’m not looking at it, it’s safe. I just have it in voice mode and I’m driving to a meeting to meet you. I’ll say, “Tell me what I should know about Jim Farley and where he’s been in the news.” It’s a very interactive conversation, almost like I’m on the phone.

How do you think about this? Does Ford have to be a part of that relationship?

It’s a good question. I think, yes, especially for anything transportation-related. I want to go somewhere, I want to know about my car and the condition of the car. We either have to be part of the conversation or we have to supply that. Not to be arrogant because of the safety control and the vehicle control, but we actually think we can provide a chat experience that has added value beyond your non-vehicle experience. To your point, we don’t want to burden the customer with two different experiences. That would be really arrogant and really bad for the company.

I think people are starting to realize why you’ve been on this, Joanna. The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that. We have to sort this out really thoughtfully.

Now, in China, Nio has an AI companion in the car. It’s like a physical thing. It’s like a little person, and it works really well. Customers love it. If you look at China being ahead of the West in terms of integrating AI as a companion in your vehicle, early indications are that a well done companion-like functionality from the OEMcan add a lot of value to people’s lives. That’s the direction we’re going. It’s similar to not investing in Level 4 autonomy and robotaxis and putting our effort towards Level 3 automated, eyes-off driving in the AI space. It’s a similar kind of bet. Pick a few places where Ford can add value, but don’t make the customer go backwards. That’s our philosophy.

To be clear , you’re more focused on that highway driving experience right now with BlueCruise?

For sure. Our number one priority is to not be the first one to do eyes-off, Level 3highway driving, but to be the best, most reliable, and the safest, the one you want to use for you and your loved ones. We took all the Argo AI people and we gave them a choice. Do you want to do highway high speed, eyes-off automation? Push a button, watch a movie, or whatever people want to do? We could do this podcast in your car.

All of our AI deployment for autonomous driving is going there because we think that’s a cooler problem to solve for most average Americans than a robotaxi. Even though the robotaxi is a really cool problem — I love being in a Waymo — we think that highway miles are a bigger societal opportunity.

Alright, my last question. You get to play car salesman. It’s next August, I got to get rid of this Mach-E. What do I do?

Oh, you need to buy another Mach-E. We’ve improved it a lot since your last one. It’s a lot more affordable. We have some wonderful new experiences. I’m going to give you a run for your money in terms of value. It’s a really incredible product that we’ve refined over four years. The Mach-E’s we’re making now are pretty radically different from the earlier ones. We have OTA updated your car, and I know what improvements were in that. The new vehicle, the compute power onboard, the efficiency, the quality, and the improvements to the fit and finish are all material enough that I think you should test-drive one and see what we have.

There’s a reason why we just beat the revised Model Y, which is the best-selling alternative — not that you would just use that as your benchmark. I think you’re going to have a lot of fun shopping. I’m going to learn a lot as you go shopping, like the rest of America. What I would love for you to do is wait six months because I want to show you this new Universal car. You’re going to go, “Jim, I’m so glad you told me to wait.”

That’s what you can do for me. You can give me an extension on the lease. This is what you should have been doing for me. This is where I would’ve sold me. I would’ve said, “Extension on the lease, six months, we’re going to give you a good deal Joanna. You’re going to be happy.”

And bridge you to something that no one will be able to offer. You’ll go, “Oh, my god, this is so much better than anything I could buy, including the Mach-E. I’m really glad I waited.” That’s the right approach.

See, I should be working in your dealership. That’s how I would’ve sold it. Well, Jim Farley, thank you so much for spending so much time. I’ve got a ton more questions, but we’ll do this again sometime and have you back on the show.

I don’t think you’re driving a dinosaur either. I think you’re driving a fantastic automobile. I love my Mach-E. Frankly, we’re really proud to have you as the owner, and thank you for being on the podcast. I always enjoy our interaction. I can’t wait to learn more about the ChatGPT experience inside your car. I hope you don’t mind if a few of our software engineers call you.

Yeah, they should call me. Again, this is not sponsored. I have been a very happy Mach-E driver. I’ve been in it a lot this summer. We didn’t get to it, but the charging infrastructure has improved so much. I charge for 30 minutes at Electrify America, and Electrify America has gotten better. Get that CEO on here. I charge, I’m on my way. I drove 350 miles up to New Hampshire last week.

Oh good.

I’ve been happy. We’ve got some software things to deal with. We didn’t really get into that, but it sounds like you’re working on it for me.

We are. That you for the time, Joanna. All the best to you.

You too.

""This approach, if permitted, would open the floodgates to multiple competing 'settlements' among differently aligned intervenors that do not include the utility,"" FPL attorneys wrote.
FPL filed an initial rate proposal in February but scaled it back in the proposed settlement filed Aug. 20.
The counter proposal, which was filed Aug. 26, would have resulted in increases of $867 million in 2026 and $403 million in 2027.
The Office of Public Counsel and its allies said the FPL proposal could lead to cumulative increases over four years of $6.903 billion, while the counter proposal would total $5.241 billion.","Florida Power & Light on Friday fired back at a renewed request for state regulators to consider a ""counter proposal"" to a proposed settlement that would increase the utility's base electric rates.

Opponents of the proposed settlement, including the state Office of Public Counsel, which is designated by law to represent utility customers, want the Florida Public Service Commission to consider the counter proposal. Commission Chairman Mike La Rosa, on Sept. 12, denied the request, but the Office of Public Counsel and its allies are seeking reconsideration of that decision.

But in a 32-page document filed Friday, FPL argued the ""request for reconsideration collapses under even the most cursory scrutiny and falls far beneath the legal threshold required to warrant reconsideration before this commission. Moreover, even assuming… that their request met the standard required for reconsideration, which it does not, the (opponents') arguments are legally indefensible and wholly without merit.""

The sparring about the counter proposal has come as the regulatory commission prepares for the Oct. 6 start of what could be a two-week hearing on FPL's proposed four-year settlement, which it reached in August with numerous businesses and groups. The hearing will include complex financial and technical issues and likely will be contentious.

After the FPL settlement was proposed, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups last month filed a competing settlement proposal that, in part, would lead to smaller rate increases. But La Rosa, acting as a prehearing officer in the case, dismissed the counter proposal, ruling that FPL is an ""indispensable party to any settlement.""

Attorneys for the opponents on Sept. 19 filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the Florida Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a utility would have to be a party to a settlement.

""If the commission were to find that the terms of the (counter proposal) were in the public interest, and that the (counter proposal) would result in fair, just, and reasonable rates, then the commission would have just as much authority to approve it without FPL's consent or over FPL's objection,"" the motion for reconsideration said.

Also, the motion said the regulatory commission's authority to set utility rates is ""not conditioned on any party's approval or absence of objection, including FPL.""

But in the document filed Friday, FPL said ""there simply is no authority or precedent to support the proposition that the commission can resolve a contested matter by approving a settlement or stipulation that does not include the utility in question.""

""This approach, if permitted, would open the floodgates to multiple competing 'settlements' among differently aligned intervenors that do not include the utility,"" FPL attorneys wrote. ""In other words, intervenors representing endless combinations of aligned interests could settle with themselves — all in the same proceeding and without the utility — in multiple versions of 'settlements.' This approach to 'settlement' defies logic because it does not result in the resolution of a dispute between opposing parties — it merely memorializes an agreement among aligned parties.""

FPL filed an initial rate proposal in February but scaled it back in the proposed settlement filed Aug. 20. FPL reached its proposed settlement with the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Energy for Innovation Association; Americans for Affordable Clean Energy; the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy; Walmart Inc.; EVgo Services, LLC; Circle K Stores, Inc.; RaceTrac Inc.; Wawa, Inc.; Electrify America, LLC; Armstrong World Industries, Inc.; and federal government agencies.

The proposed settlement would lead to base-rate increases of $945 million in 2026 and $766 million in 2027, according to the utility. FPL also would collect additional amounts in 2028 and 2029 for solar-energy and battery-storage projects.

The counter proposal, which was filed Aug. 26, would have resulted in increases of $867 million in 2026 and $403 million in 2027. It also would have left open the possibility of FPL seeking increases of an estimated $195 million in 2028 and $174 million in 2029 for generation-related projects that could include solar and battery projects.

The Office of Public Counsel and its allies said the FPL proposal could lead to cumulative increases over four years of $6.903 billion, while the counter proposal would total $5.241 billion.

Along with the Office of Public Counsel, the counter proposal was filed by the groups Florida Rising, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Floridians Against Increased Rates.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/30/1f029fb5-e206-44ef-8986-e704d588a2de/thumbnail/1200x630/a82eb547cc0e2f9a1521316f8539601a/cbsmiami-energy-bill-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:10.751813

Outlook The report projects that cumulative U.S. energy storage capacity will reach 87.8 GW/261.2 GWh by 2029, with growth led by residential and utility-scale storage.","The U.S. energy storage market achieved its strongest ever quarter in the second quarter (Q2) of the financial year 2025, with total installations reaching 5.6 GW/17.8 GWh, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.

The utility-scale segment accounted for 4.9 GW/15 GWh of this total, a 63% year-on-year increase. Texas, California, and Arizona together contributed nearly 75% of this newly installed capacity, each adding around 1.2 GW.

Oklahoma re-entered the utility-scale market with three projects totaling 170 MW, while the national project pipeline has seen some contraction, falling from 1,080 projects in 2024 to 801 in 2025, a 26% decline.

Installations for the residential storage sector increased by 8% quarter-on-quarter, with California, Arizona, and Illinois driving the majority of the growth. The rise is largely attributed to state-level policies such as California’s Net Billing Tariff, declining solar export rates, and additional state incentives in California, Arizona, and Illinois.

Higher-capacity systems are increasingly being adopted in the residential market, which is projected to outpace solar in growth due to high policy resilience, strong attachment rates in markets such as California and Puerto Rico, and continued access to the federal investment tax credit (ITC), particularly under third-party ownership models.

For 2025 alone, residential storage growth is forecast to reach 96% in terms of megawatts and 41% in terms of the number of installations.

CCI Market Gains Momentum

The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) market posted its best second quarter since 2023, driven by commercial solar-plus-storage deployments in California under the state’s Net Energy Metering 3.0 framework.

Storage incentive programs in New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are also contributing to steady growth, although community storage remains limited due to high development costs and policy constraints.

Massachusetts’ upcoming SMART 3.0 program is expected to provide future support, though nationwide CCI capacity is projected to remain under 1 GW by 2029.

OBBBA and Federal Policy

Federal policy developments under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) have preserved ITC benefits for most storage applications but introduced new equipment sourcing requirements that take effect after 2025.

This has led to a rush to begin project construction ahead of the restrictions, temporarily boosting forecasts according to the report. While domestic cell supply is expected to ramp up, supply chain limitations and U.S.–China trade barriers are likely to create challenges.

Distributed storage remains highly sensitive to OBBBA impacts, with the CCI sector potentially benefiting from reduced solar incentives, which could lead to an increase in solar-plus-storage installations. However, growth is expected to remain slow. For residential storage, the decline in solar incentives may accelerate the adoption of virtual power plants and third-party ownership models.

Low Case Forecast and Risks

The low-case scenario forecasts a potential reduction of 16.5 GW, or 19%, in cumulative installations between 2025 and 2029, driven by risks including supply shortages compliant with the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rule, sustained trade barriers with China, and delays in federal land permitting for renewable projects.

In this downside case, utility-scale projects would be most affected, particularly those not safe-harbored in 2025. Residential forecasts would be constrained by uncertainty around FEOC-compliant supply and potential restrictions on third-party ownership qualification for the ITC.

The CCI sector would face further headwinds if the rollout of Massachusetts’ SMART 3.0 program is slow, and costs remain high.

However, the report notes that the final version of OBBBA was less restrictive than the House bill, which had proposed a 60-day construction start window and a 2028 in-service deadline to qualify for the ITC.

As a result, the low-case outlook was raised by 23% quarter-on-quarter compared to the earlier baseline, which had assumed the stricter House version would pass.

Beyond the 2025–2029 outlook period, downside risks remain if gas supply chain bottlenecks ease and permitting restrictions increase for solar and storage projects. These conditions could slow the pace of deployment in the longer term.

Financial and Market Implications

The scale of Q2 2025 installations underscores the growing importance of storage as a vital component of the U.S. energy transition. With 7.6 GW installed in the first half of 2025, the year is expected to set a new annual record for storage deployment.

While policy and supply chain challenges persist, particularly in terms of equipment sourcing requirements and federal permitting, the resilience of the residential market and the dominance of leading states such as California, Texas, and Arizona position the U.S. storage sector for continued growth.

The utility-scale market remains vulnerable to policy and trade uncertainty; however, the extension of the ITC provides a foundation for sustained development over the next decade.

Residential and distributed storage are increasingly adapting through models such as virtual power plants and third-party ownership, ensuring continued deployment even as solar incentives decline.

The CCI segment, though lagging, is likely to see incremental growth supported by state-level incentive programs and the eventual rollout of SMART 3.0 in Massachusetts.

Overall, the report underscores both the opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. storage market. Strong near-term growth is balanced by risks of supply shortages and policy headwinds, but the cumulative capacity of nearly 88 GW by 2029 remains achievable under the base case.

Outlook

The report projects that cumulative U.S. energy storage capacity will reach 87.8 GW/261.2 GWh by 2029, with growth led by residential and utility-scale storage. Utility-scale capacity is forecast to reach 72 GW/259 GWh by 2029 despite a projected 10% year-on-year decline in 2027.

After 2025, which is expected to remain the record year for utility-scale installations, annual deployments are not expected to reach similar levels until 2029. Federal policy will continue to be a significant factor in shaping the outlook.

While the ITC has been extended through 2033, new equipment sourcing requirements and continued uncertainty in global trade are expected to slow growth. The strongest markets for utility-scale deployment will continue to be California, Texas, and other states with favorable storage policies, coupled with high load growth.

The residential segment is expected to remain the most resilient, with growth supported by virtual power plant models and third-party ownership structures, even as solar incentives decline.

The CCI segment is forecasted to experience gradual growth, although the sector will face challenges from high costs and slower transitions to programs that reduce support for solar projects.

The U.S. energy storage market added more than 2 GW across all segments in the first quarter of 2025, marking the highest Q1 on record, according to U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-06-18T121458.313.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:18.195372

This move continues the company’s path to delivering affordable fusion energy, following 50 years of applied innovation at U.S. National Laboratories in New Mexico and California.
“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, Co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion.
Pacific Fusion will receive these incentives as it meets its commitments to create new jobs and make significant capital investments.
The Pacific Fusion headquarters, including three research and development campuses, will remain in California.","Pacific Fusion has selected Albuquerque, New Mexico as the site for its first research and manufacturing campus. The company plans to build the $1 billion campus at Mesa del Sol and expects to create more than 200 high-wage jobs and hundreds of construction jobs. This move continues the company’s path to delivering affordable fusion energy, following 50 years of applied innovation at U.S. National Laboratories in New Mexico and California.

“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, Co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion. “Working alongside the City of Albuquerque, the Governor’s office, and the state’s economic development leaders, we’ve built true partnerships that give us confidence we can move quickly to deliver on the promise of low-cost fusion power.”

Supporting the project is legislation signed by Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller on September 26, 2025 authorizing the performance-based incentives that include: $10 million in Local Economic Development Act funds; $9 million from the State; and $1 million from the City, as well as $776 million in City-issued Industrial Revenue Bonds, abating property taxes over 20 years. Pacific Fusion will receive these incentives as it meets its commitments to create new jobs and make significant capital investments.

“After years of working to build Albuquerque as a hub for energy technology innovation, Pacific Fusion joins a growing number of companies that are choosing our city to literally ‘power’ our future,” said Mayor Keller. “Today is proof of the assertion that we have passed a turning point — that our city is not only on the map, but can define the next chapter of clean energy innovation.”

The Albuquerque campus will house Pacific Fusion’s Demonstration System, with the goal of achieving net facility gain, producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the total energy used, by 2030. Pacific Fusion’s decision builds on New Mexico’s long history of energy innovation and decades of research at Sandia National Laboratories, while adding to the city’s growing clean-tech ecosystem.

“Pacific Fusion’s decision to build in Albuquerque proves our city is ready to lead in the industries of the future,” said the City of Albuquerque Economic Development Director Max Gruner. “This project will bring good jobs, drive innovation, and anchor a clean-energy ecosystem that benefits our entire community.”

Stated the company: “Our Albuquerque campus will build on New Mexico’s legacy in applied physics, including decades of foundational research at Sandia National Laboratories. The state’s expertise in advanced energy technologies, workforce that aligns with our future hiring needs, and capital-efficient environment for large projects make it a natural choice for Pacific Fusion’s strategic expansion.”

Construction on the new Mesa del Sol facility is scheduled to begin in 2026, with manufacturing operations launching before the end of the year.

The Pacific Fusion headquarters, including three research and development campuses, will remain in California. Over the last year, the company has tripled its California-based team to more than 110 employees and also expanded its Bay Area footprint.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/albuquerque_new_mexico_downtown.jpeg,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:34.298436

The words on the DOE list are at the heart of EERE’s mission: It is the government’s largest investor in technologies that help reduce heat-trapping emissions that cause climate change as well as the hazardous pollution from fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to dispute, silence or downplay the realities of climate change.

“Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid — and continue to be conscientious about avoiding any terminology that you know to be misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities,” the directive from acting director of external affairs Rachel Overbey said.

Those instructions apply to both public-facing and internal communications and cover documents such as requests for information for federal funding opportunities, reports and briefings.

In addition to “climate change” and “green,” EERE forbid officials from using “emissions” to avoid the implication that they are a negative. Climate change is caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, which is driven primarily by burning oil, coal and natural gas for energy.

Other terms officials must ditch include “energy transition,” “sustainability/sustainable,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “Carbon/CO2 ‘Footprint’” and “Tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.”

DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new policies come days after President Donald Trump excoriated world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly for pursuing actions to confront rising emissions.

“I’ve been right about everything and I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” he said during his Tuesday speech.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has also sought to impugn climate science by touting a report he commissioned that downplayed the role rising emissions have had in worsening weather extremes. He has endorsed some of the report’s most controversial findings, such as claiming the potential benefits of a warmer planet are undervalued.

DOE has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s efforts to quash renewable energy subsidies and incentives. Last week, Wright canceled $13 billion of funding for renewable energy projects and took shots at wind and solar incentives that the Republican megalaw will quickly sunset after more than three decades of existence.

By Roberto Hugo González

Westlake, Texas — September 2025- Governor Greg Abbott highlighted Texas’ expanding economic influence during the Texas Economic Development Corporation (TxEDC) Investor Summit, held at Hillwood’s Circle T Ranch in Westlake and hosted by Ross Perot, Jr. Themed “Texas Takeover: America’s New Financial Hub,” the summit convened more than 200 business leaders, investors, and officials from across the state and the nation.

In a fireside chat moderated by Glenn Hamer, President and CEO of the Texas Association of Business, Abbott pointed to the advantages driving Texas’ economy. These include a “booming, diversified economy anchored by technology, energy, and manufacturing,” a “young, skilled, and diverse workforce ready to power growth,” and what he described as a “predictable regulatory climate and no state income tax that gives Texas an edge over coastal competitors.”

“We’re cutting red tape and keeping government out of the way so both small businesses and large investors can thrive here in Texas,” Abbott said, according to the Governor’s Office. “The future of finance is no longer limited to New York or California—Texas is leading the way.”

The governor emphasized the Dallas–Fort Worth region’s emergence as a financial hub, highlighting expansions by Nasdaq, NYSE, and multiple Fortune 500 relocations. He was joined on stage by Arun Agarwal, Chair of the TxEDC Board of Directors, and Aaron Demerson, President and CEO of TxEDC, who both underscored the summit’s role in advancing Texas’ global competitiveness.

The program featured panels on venture capital, private equity, and banking, as well as networking opportunities for institutional investors. TxEDC also introduced its new Investor Guide, a resource designed for businesses evaluating expansion or relocation to the state of Texas.

The summit reinforced Texas’ goal of becoming a premier financial center in addition to its traditional leadership in energy, aerospace, and technology.

Economic development leaders from across the Rio Grande Valley also attended. Teclo Garcia, CEO of the Mission Economic Development Office, praised the event: “Thank you, Governor Greg Abbott and your economic development & tourism team, for hosting an outstanding Texas Economic Development Corporation Investor Summit and for delivering a strong message of competitiveness and Texas leadership in innovation and business as we advance.”

Garcia added that it was an opportunity to reconnect with state leaders and colleagues. “It was good to catch up with TxEDC Board of Directors Chairman Arun Agarwal, TxEDC President & CEO Aaron Demerson, Adriana Cruz, Executive Director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and Tourism, and good RGV friend Fernanda S., an industry specialist within the ED&T office, as well as Dr. Valerie G. Segovia. Excellent work on the dynamic meeting and for all the leadership.”

Garcia also noted the participation of other Rio Grande Valley representatives, including Adam Gonzalez and Dalith Cantu, Industrial Development Executive at Cil Commodities Integrated Logistics.

“I am grateful to Ross Perot Jr. for hosting the 200+ leaders from around the state at the beautiful Circle T Ranch,” Garcia said. “Texas is on the right road for economic development.”",https://texasborderbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEDC-Abbott.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 12:09:52.148389

How Newsom handles the energy crisis will weigh heavily on Californian’s pocketbooks, but also on his prospects for higher office.
California fuel prices are inflated by environmental fees and taxes, a requirement for a unique fuel blend that cuts air pollution and dwindling in-state supply.

Newsom, a Democrat in his second and final term, is making a remarkable shift in his approach after leading a yearslong crusade against fossil fuels - which may have ended up being more successful than he intended. California, often home to the country’s highest gasoline prices, is now staring down a potential energy crisis as the industry pulls up stakes.

Chevron Corp. moved its headquarters out of the Golden State, refineries are closing, a key oil pipeline is hemorrhaging money and Republicans are warning that gasoline prices could soon top $8 a gallon ($2.11 per liter).

Newsom has disputed that estimate, but says it’s a top priority to bring down gasoline prices for Californians. The focus comes amid growing speculation that he’s gearing up for a presidential run in 2028.

The cost of living is a top issue for Americans, and steep fuel prices in California have been central to critics’ attacks on Newsom. President Donald Trump has highlighted the issue, there are billboards dotting California highways blaming Newsom and opponents took out a full-page newspaper ad mocking “Gavin’s Gas Station” where prices are “$2 higher than the other guys.”

“Newsom owns this gas crisis,” Brian W. Jones, the Republican leader in the state Senate, said in a statement. “His policies have made it nearly impossible for California refineries to stay open.”

Now Newsom has approved the biggest streamlining of oil permitting the state has seen in decades, enraging environmentalists who say he’s taking a page from Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” play book. His regulators spent months working closely with the industry to come up with avenues to deregulate and increase profits. Lawmakers even discussed giving Texas-based Valero Energy Corp. hundreds of millions of dollars to keep its San Francisco Bay area refinery open.

“This is not an ideological endeavor,” Newsom told journalists this month, applauding the oil drilling legislation, which was part of a larger package of bills seeking to stabilize the state’s energy markets. “We’re in the practical application businesses.”

More oil drilling will allow California to reduce price spikes at the pump while marching forward with a years-long transition away from fossil fuels, his office said. And Newsom’s pivot is only a partial win for the industry. The governor also approved tighter regulations on offshore drilling that will hamper efforts to restart a controversial pipeline north of Santa Barbara. A carbon trading program will force polluters to pay billions of dollars for greenhouse gas emissions over two decades.

As Newsom works to raise his national profile, he has sought to project a more open stance, hosting conservative guests including Stephen Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk on his podcast. He highlights his sense of humor with social-media posts that mimic Trump’s style. How Newsom handles the energy crisis will weigh heavily on Californian’s pocketbooks, but also on his prospects for higher office.

“He has called for the end of an industry that is completely vital in our state,” said Congressman Vince Fong, a Republican who represents oil production hubs in California’s Kern County. “And he is begrudgingly acknowledging the fact that he needs their input.”

California has long been controlled by Democrats and long had some of the country’s most expensive gasoline prices, currently averaging about $4.47 a gallon, more than $1 above the US mean. California fuel prices are inflated by environmental fees and taxes, a requirement for a unique fuel blend that cuts air pollution and dwindling in-state supply.

The current crisis has its roots in attempts to keep prices in check. In 2023 and 2024, Newson signed measures that sought to establish a maximum profit margin for refiners and required that they keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to mitigate the impact of any disruptions.

Two days after Newsom signed the bill on inventories in October 2024, Phillips 66 announced it would close its more-than-century-old Los Angeles refinery by the end of 2025, removing over 139,000 barrels a day of fuel from a market whose top politicians and energy regulator were busy trying to shore up supply.

In April, Valero announced it planned to close its 145,000-barrel-a-day Benicia refinery - about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco - by April 2026. The company cited, in part, an $82 million penalty that local and state environmental regulators imposed in 2024 for violations related to cancer-causing emissions that went unreported.

The state’s largest inland oil pipeline, operated by Crimson Midstream LLC, is losing $2 million a month and could close this year as demand for oil from the few remaining Bay Area refiners slows to a trickle.

Meanwhile, gasoline imports are expected to replace the shuttered refinery output, but the industry has warned it isn’t ready for new emissions regulations at ports.

There is a “new or renewed understanding that all this is intertwined,” Jas Sajjan, the head of government affairs at oil driller California Resources Corp., said in an interview.

Crude capacity

All together, almost one-fifth of the state’s crude-processing capacity is set to vanish in the coming year. Many in California’s fuel industry say it was the Valero announcement that finally got lawmakers’ attention.

“We have a crisis on our hands that may have been self-created,” Democratic Senator David Alvarez said in a May hearing with the California Energy Commission, a powerful state body that sets standards for the industry.

As the risks became apparent, Newsom backed off his attacks on the industry. In April, he sent a letter to the commission, instructing Vice Chair Siva Gunda to work with refiners to ensure affordable and reliable fuel supplies. And regulators began meeting with the oil industry, alongside labor unions and environmental groups, in closed-door sessions to hash out a path forward, according to people who attended the meetings.

The administration has a “firm belief” that refiners “can profitably operate in California - a market where demand for gasoline will still exist for years to come,” Newsom said in the letter.

Two months later, much of the industry’s wishes were incorporated into a 24-page proposal to stabilize California’s fuel markets. The California Energy Commission said Newsom shouldn’t move forward with the profit cap on oil refineries. Gunda also said California should increase fuel imports to make up for refinery closures and stabilize in-state oil production, especially in the once prolific Kern County oil basin.

It came after Gunda made several trips to San Antonio and Houston to meet with officials from Valero and Phillips 66. The companies made it clear that they were focused on profits. Environmental laws weighed on their margins and they were concerned that in-state oil producers would be underpriced by imported oil not subject to the state’s strict environmental regulations, the California Energy Commission said.

Among environmental groups, there was surprise at how receptive lawmakers were to pocketbook arguments being made by the industry. “Fear mongering around price shocks sent legislators scrambling,” said Faraz Rizvi, policy and campaign manager for the Asian Pacific Environmental Network. Oil lobbyists and refiners “smelled blood in the water,” Rizvi said.

California’s looming oil crisis is most apparent in Benicia. Hugging San Francisco Bay, the small town has been home to an oil refinery for more than 50 years. If Valero goes through with plans to shutter its site, it could wipe out 10% of the city’s annual tax revenue.

“I was thinking this is something we would be dealing with in 2035, not 2025,” said City Manager Mario Giuliani, who is planning for budget cuts next year. The town, he said, is a small window into the energy crisis that could soon face the entire state.

Benicia, with the help of the Valero refinery that was once owned by Exxon, has flourished with healthy tax revenues, Giuliani said. In the shadow of the refinery, Benicia grew into an affluent suburb with an attractive waterfront and small-town feel.

But change is coming soon. The town has already stopped paying for July 4 fireworks and an annual Christmas tree lighting due to budgetary constraints. Next year, cuts will be far more severe without Valero, the single largest taxpayer. “It provided that economic blanket to remain a small community,” Giuliani said. “Well, now that is gone.”

A last-minute attempt by lawmakers to pay Valero hundreds of million of dollars to keep the refinery open hasn’t materialized, and the state has six months before the company cuts off a key source of supply to Northern California.

The new reality in California, and Newsom’s pivot, may also usher in an era in which Democrats will seek to work with the oil and gas industry instead of taking an outright hostile stance.

Henry Stern, a Democratic state senator who has championed environmental causes, acknowledged that there’s now an appetite among a diverse range of Democrats for more oil drilling in California, alongside more aggressive climate action.

“It’s strange for me to be talking this way sometimes,” he added.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/29/PDTN/86418668007-newsombg-mojwzj-3-ozjdkjd-4-cabuh-44-shsy.jpg?crop=3996,2251,x0,y290&width=3200&height=1803&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-29 12:08:22.366741

One year after Meta began data center operations at its new campus in Montgomery, Alabama, the tech giant is heading back into the city to expand the site. Last week, Meta announced a $700 million investment would introduce two new facilities and 100 new direct jobs. This move would bring the campus to a total of 1.3 million sq. ft. once complete. Energy used at the site will be matched with 100% renewable energy, in addition to new renewable energy projects that will bring 227 megawatts to Alabama’s electricity grid. “Montgomery has proven to be a perfect home for our data center, and we are excited to be expanding,” the company said in its announcement. Before the end of the year Meta plans to launch its Data Center Community Action Grants program in the region. This annual program will provide funding for technology-focused projects that enhance the community and boost local STEAM education, building upon the company’s partnerships with the Montgomery Public Schools system and non-profit organizations for skills building initiatives.

A FAVORABLE BUSINESS CLIMATE CAPTURES ELI LILLY

In order to boost Eli Lilly and Company’s small molecule drug production pipeline, the manufacturer is heading to Houston, Texas, with a $6.5 billion project investment. This is the second facility to come of the company’s $27 billion commitment to four new U.S. manufacturing sites. The location at Generation Park was said to be chosen based on local incentives, access to utilities, transportation and its overall business environment. Notably, the new Houston plant is among a few sites chosen to manufacture Eli Lilly’s first oral, small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as orforglipron, which will be submitted to global regulatory agencies by the end of 2026. “Our new Houston site will enhance Lilly’s ability to manufacture orforglipron at scale and, if approved, help fulfill the medicine’s potential as a metabolic health treatment for tens of millions of people worldwide who prefer the ease of a pill that can be taken without food and water restrictions,” said Eli Lilly Chair and CEO David A. Ricks. “This significant U.S. investment and onshoring of our API production capabilities will ensure faster, more secure access to orforglipron and to other life-changing medicines of the future.” Anticipated to be complete by 2030, the investment will create 615 new jobs in the region.

TERMINAL INVESTMENT DIVES DEEP IN SPAIN

A $165.6 million expansion initiative will soon boost APM Terminals’ annual capacity to 1.23 million twenty-foot equivalent units at the Port of Barcelona in Spain. Over the next three years, the Netherlands-based logistics company will pursue modernization and expansion that will not only scale the Port’s activity but also target its decarbonization goals via a new Offshore Power Supply system that provides docked ships access to power supply through the local grid. The move will cut emissions while improving environmental performance at the port. “[The modernization is] a strategic milestone for APM Terminals and reaffirms our firm commitment to the port development of Barcelona and to the sustainable growth of Spain as a key logistics hub in Europe,” said APM Terminals Spanish Gateways Managing Director Julián Fernández. The expansion phase of the project details reinforcing the South Quay berths; replacing rails for new Ship-to-Shore cranes; updating infrastructure to support up to 15-meter (49-ft.) drafts; and ensuring the terminal can handle two mega-container ships at once.

Gore indicated during his interview with Harder that this new demand may help reverse a problem that has halted the growth of the nuclear energy industry over the past few decades—namely, high costs. “For a variety of reasons, [nuclear power] has priced itself out of the market as the market used to exist. Now the market is different. . . . I think a lot of large users of electricity are recalculating whether or not they want to place very large, one-time bets for a huge increment of power in the form of nuclear,” Gore said. “And I think you’re going to see some resurgence of nuclear power.”

Eager to discuss nuclear: Harder writes that Gore “was eager to dive deeper into nuclear power in our conversation. Unprompted, he sought to address various concerns about it.”

Of used fuel Gore told Harder, “I think that the waste can be stored safely.” He also touched on nonproliferation during the interview, saying, “I think the terrorism threats are real, but they’re shared by a lot of other kinds of facilities around the world. . . . The proliferation issues are very real and have to be attended to with extreme care, safety of operation.” I think we can handle that. I really do.

Still, doubts: According to Harder, Gore expressed some reservations about nuclear. “The cost issue is the one that’s really a barrier to the expansion of nuclear,” he said.

Regard small modular reactors, Gore wasn’t sure how big of a role they would play in a nuclear resurgence “due to their price tag.” He said, “Some of the most responsible policy analysts that I respect are now shifting back away from SMRs as maybe a technological dead end again.”",https://cdn.ans.org/i/favicon-128.png,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:21.739147

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

The colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, about 50 miles west of Vicksburg, Mississippi. But not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a “kill switch” law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Floriday’s Nova Southeastern University powers student housing with floating solar

Nova Southeastern University (NSU), in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has become the first university in the United States to host a commercial floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) system. The 700kW array, developed by D3Energy, will directly power student housing on campus and marks a milestone in bringing clean energy to higher education.

“This installation at NSU demonstrates how floating solar can deliver real benefits for institutions that may not have the land or rooftop space for large-scale solar,” said Stetson Tchividjian, managing director of D3Energy, which specializes in floating solar development in the United States, “We’re proud to be pioneering solutions that reduce costs and support sustainability goals, while opening the door for universities to lead by example in renewable energy adoption.”

Cool factor: Floating solar is one of the fastest-growing clean energy technologies worldwide. The FPV system spans nearly two acres and includes 1,200 solar modules secured with an advanced anchoring system built for hurricane-force winds. It uses Ciel & Terre’s Hydrelio floating platform, a global leader in FPV manufacturing. Construction is underway, with grid connection expected by year’s end. Once complete, the project will offset a significant share of the electricity needs at Mako Hall, Nova Southeastern University’s latest student housing complex, providing clean energy directly where students live and study.

Avangrid’s new Oregon Trail Solar project will help power data centers

Avangrid Inc., signed a PPA with Amazon for energy from a new solar project called Oregon Trail Solar. The 57 MWdc (41 MWac) facility will be located in Gilliam County, Oregon, and will supply renewable energy for Amazon data centers in the region. The project will be operational in 2027.

“This agreement reflects Amazon and Avangrid’s commitment to delivering reliable energy solutions that will help meet America’s growing energy needs and support the growth of critical infrastructure,” said Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO. “Oregon Trail Solar builds on our strong presence in Oregon and deep partnership with Amazon, and we’re proud to help power the future with projects that bring lasting economic benefits to local communities, bolster our nation’s energy independence, and maximize energy production.”

Cool factor: Oregon Trail Solar represents the second recent renewable energy PPA between Avangrid and Amazon in the Pacific Northwest, adding to a previously announced deal for power from the Leaning Juniper IIA repower project, also located in Gilliam County. Avangrid and Amazon have agreements to generate power from several renewable energy projects in Illinois, Ohio and North Carolina as well.

Construction of Oregon Trail is expected to generate 200 jobs, mostly filled by local union labor. It will use over 100,000 solar panels and produce the same amount of electricity used by about 10,000 U.S. homes each year. Operations at Oregon Trail will also support several new full-time jobs in the community. Over its lifetime, Avangrid expects the project to contribute $6 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes), as well as property taxes for Gilliam County which will support a variety of public services, including schools and infrastructure.

Oregon Trail will add to Avangrid’s longstanding presence in the state, with its oldest project dating back to 2001. Today, the company operates 2.5 GW of capacity in Oregon. Avangrid also maintains its National Training Center in neighboring Sherman County and a large corporate office in Portland.

Lightstar Renewables launches New York’s first agrivoltaics project

Lightstar Renewables LLC hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the groundbreaking for Plains Road agrivoltaics project Montgomery, New York. The commissioning event was held at the DiMartino Farm, drawing attendance from state officials, agricultural leaders, and local media, and other local faming families. Representing Assembly Member Brian Maher, whose legislative support was instrumental in the project’s development, was his chief of staff, Meghan Hurlburt. She stood alongside representatives from American Farmland Trust (AFT) and Iain Ward, farmer, founder, and CEO of Solar Agricultural Services Inc. (SolAg).

“Today marks a turning point for sustainable development in New York,” Maher said in a statement. “The Plains Road project demonstrates how we can honor our agricultural heritage while meeting our clean energy goals. This is the kind of innovative thinking we need to build a resilient future for rural communities.”

Cool factor: The Plains Road project marks New York’s first agrivoltaics installation. The ribbon-cutting ceremony highlighted the unique design features that allow hay planting and harvesting equipment to operate seamlessly around the solar facility. The project will also add two acres of vegetable production, providing opportunities for new entry farmers while generating enough clean energy to power 466 homes annually.

Ever.green uses RECs to support 28 MW solar project in South Carolina

Ever.green partnered with Wells Fargo through a long-term purchase of High-Impact RECs to support a 28 MW solar project in Lee County, South Carolina. The deal displays how corporate energy buyers can accelerate the deployment of new renewable energy projects. The solar installation, developed by Headwater Energy, will generate approximately 50,000 MWh of electricity annually.

“High-Impact RECs are making it easier for companies to directly support new, impactful projects,” said Cris Eugster, CEO of Ever.green. “This project is a powerful example of how forward-thinking buyers can accelerate the energy transition while advancing grid resilience.”

Cool factor: Ever.green’s High-Impact RECs are renewable energy certificates sourced from yet-built clean energy projects via long-term, fixed-price forward contracts that are material to the project’s finance-ability. Projects are selected for their ability to maximize climate impact, minimize environmental harm, and deliver social benefits.

The Bishopville project uses low-carbon, domestically manufactured solar panels, helping to create new U.S. manufacturing jobs while strengthening the domestic energy supply chain. The panels use thin-film technology, which performs well in hot and humid climates, and they are both sustainably constructed and designed to be recycled at their end-of-life. A comprehensive environmental assessment of the project ensured compliance with biodiversity and land use protections, including the safeguarding of wetlands and floodplains through best management practices. Non-reflective panels and habitat preservation efforts have helped minimize impacts on 12 migratory bird species. At the end of its useful life, the site will be fully restored with native vegetation to preserve local ecosystems.

OCI Energy, ING finalize construction financing for battery project in Texas

OCI Energy has closed on the construction financing for its Project Alamo City, a flagship BESS installation under development in Bexar County, Texas. OCI Energy selected ING to underwrite the construction financing package which includes a construction-to-term loan, a tax equity bridge loan, and letters of credit. ING served as sole coordinating lead arranger, sole bookrunner, and sole green loan coordinator, and will also act as administrative agent. The relationship between ING and OCI Energy has proven instrumental in advancing the project from concept to construction.

“This project not only advances the deployment of cutting-edge battery storage technology in Texas, but also demonstrates the power of collaborative, innovative financing to accelerate the energy transition,” said Sven Wellock, head of renewables and power, Americas, ING.

Cool factor: With a planned capacity of 120 MW and with a four-hour battery duration, Project Alamo City will be a significant standalone battery storage installation in Texas, delivering 480 MWh of grid-strengthening storage capacity for CPS Energy.

“Project Alamo City represents a bold step forward in our commitment to enhancing grid stability and ensuring long-term energy reliability,” said Sabah Bayatli, president of OCI Energy. “It also marks OCI Energy’s return as a developer-owner-operator in the project finance space, and partnering with a financial institution like ING has been instrumental in bringing this transformative project to fruition.”

OCI Energy had previously announced the execution of a 20-year Storage Capacity Agreement with CPS Energy, the largest municipally-owned electric and natural gas utility in the United States. Under that agreement, OCI Energy is responsible for the development, financing, construction, and ownership of Project Alamo City, and CPS Energy will have operational control. Project Alamo City is expected to enter commercial operation in Q3 2027.

Nofar USA has secured more than 1 GW of solar development projects across multiple U.S. markets through a combination of acquisitions and exclusive development agreements. The transactions, completed in late August, expand the company’s portfolio and encompasses utility-scale and distributed generation projects with commercial operations expected to start between 2026 and 2029.

“These transactions mark a significant milestone in the expansion of our U.S. pipeline,” said Allon Raveh, executive chairman and CEO of Nofar USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nofar Energy. “By securing more than a gigawatt of projects across key renewable energy markets, including PJM, SPP and ERCOT, in combination with our ITC safe harboring strategy, I expect Nofar USA to grow its solar portfolio significantly in the next few years. This, combined with our growing energy storage portfolio which has already reached a contracted pipeline of 1.2 GWh, reinforcing our commitment to supporting America’s demand for clean power while generating long-term value for our shareholders”

Cool factor: The solar portfolio includes projects in various stages of development, from early-stage development through ready-to-build status. Projects span multiple regional transmission organizations and independent system operators, providing geographic and market diversification.

Nofar Energy operates across 10 countries with renewable energy and energy storage projects. The company has 2.4 GW of renewable energy projects connected or under construction globally. In the United States, Nofar has been expanding its presence through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, developing projects that range from distributed generation to utility-scale installations.

Aspen Power expands Pennsylvania portfolio with 6.85 MW in new solar projects

Aspen Power has closed on the acquisition of two solar projects in Northampton, Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of 6.85 MWdc. These projects are the first projects to close under a portfolio totaling 18 MWdc under contract with Syncarpha Capital LLC. The ground-mounted systems are expected to generate almost 9 million kWh of clean energy annually.

“Solar is now the most affordable source of new electricity in the U.S., and even in a difficult national political environment, we are executing and bringing projects online,” said Jorge Vargas, CEO of Aspen Power. “Together with our partners at Syncarpha Capital, we are creating reliable, long-term income for landowners, affordable clean energy for residents, and tangible progress toward a more resilient grid. At this pivotal moment for the renewable energy industry, strong execution and strong partnerships are what will drive lasting economic and environmental benefits, and Aspen is proud to be leading that effort in Pennsylvania.”

Cool factor: Aspen Power has been highly active in Pennsylvania, with more than 100 MW of operating and in-construction assets across the state. As electricity demand grows, solar’s speed of deployment makes it a critical solution for meeting near-term energy needs. Pennsylvania’s target of sourcing 18% of its electricity from renewables by 2025 underscores the importance of these projects, which will contribute directly to the state’s clean energy goals.

The company has developed or acquired more than 600 renewable energy projects across 26 states in pursuit of a more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy future.

Nexus secures $220 million, energy offtaker for Project Goody

Nexus Renewable Power LLC has closed on a series of transactions that together represent approximately $220 million of project funding for MRG Goody Solar and Storage (Project Goody), a 171.72 MWac solar project combined with a 237 MWh storage project located in Lamar County, Texas.

Goldman Sachs is making a preferred equity investment into Project Goody to support the hybrid tax equity financing. Nexus also executed a tax credit purchase agreement with respect to Project Goody. Meta is the power offtaker for the project, which will help match its data center electricity use with clean and renewable energy. This aggregate financing complements the previously announced $300 million construction-to-permanent financing facility with HPS Investment Partners, and the $100 million Nexus-Bad Carbon carbon credit financing joint venture.

Cool factor: Project Goody is named after, and honors the service of, Michael R. “Goody” Goodboe who died on Nov. 24, 2020, from injuries sustained while serving his country overseas. He was a highly decorated Navy SEAL and served his country with distinction in multiple theaters including Iraq, Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, and Africa. He is remembered for his warrior spirit, sense of humor, and high standards for himself and his comrades.

Project Goody is currently under construction, with a scheduled commercial operation date in the fourth quarter of 2025. It is the first in a series of projects being developed and constructed by Nexus. The project will provide employment opportunities and economic benefits to Lamar County, creating hundreds of construction jobs and contributing millions in long-term tax revenue to support the local school district and the community at large.

Verogy begins construction on sixth SCEF solar project in Connecticut

Connecticut-based developer Verogy has started construction on its sixth project under the state’s Shared Clean Energy Facility (SCEF) program in 2025. These projects, totaling more than 30 MW of renewable energy, enable Verogy to advance equal access to solar power and drive meaningful economic impact across Connecticut.

As part of its commitment to using domestically sourced materials and power generation technologies, Verogy continues to partner with Arizona-headquartered First Solar Inc. to supply its modules.

Cool factor: The SCEF program, overseen by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), was designed to expand access to solar power, particularly for low- to moderate-income (LMI) households. Participating residents can subscribe to a portion of the electricity generated by a SCEF project and receive credits on their electricity bills, which results in long-term savings without installing any equipment on their own property.

“Verogy is committed to ensuring the benefits of renewable energy are felt across all communities, not just those with access to on-site solar,” said William Herchel, CEO of Verogy. “The SCEF program makes it possible for more Connecticut consumers than ever to participate in and benefit from the solar economy.”

Upon completion of these six SCEF projects, Verogy anticipates delivering enough clean energy to power more than 3,600 average homes every year. In addition, these projects will generate an estimated $975,000 in annual savings for LMI households and other utility customers for the next 20 years.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club.
The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.
Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said.
“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said.","TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said.

Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”

Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.

Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.

“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.

Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.

“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”

Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.

“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”

Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.

Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.

“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”

Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.

Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.

“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”

Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction.

“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Evergy-Lawrence-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:01:59.196582

This particular opinion was chock-full of misinformation about clean energy and the economy, and commenters were quick to point that out.

Clean energy projects are great for the economy. They create jobs in multiple industries. Besides employment created in a given area directly associated with the necessary construction, the demand for equipment, components, and services creates additional employment down the supply chain. The ripple effect continues, as the wages earned are then spent in local economies.

On top of that, the proliferation of clean energy sources can attract businesses. According to Sustainable Views, a recent survey of nearly 1,500 business leaders from 15 countries showed that the majority would be willing to move business operations to a country with a higher adoption of clean energy.

A healthier population due to the reduction in pollution caused by dirty energy generation can also lead to huge economic savings. According to Yale Climate Connections, cleaner air and the resulting better public health will save the U.S. economy an estimated $118-200 billion between now and 2030.

The misinformed opinions shared by this Redditor said otherwise.

The Redditor believes clean energy regulations — not lower labor costs and reduced operating costs — drive companies to move operations overseas, resulting in lost jobs and a worse economy. They also believe this ends up in more planet-overheating pollution being released into the environment.

As mentioned above, commenters were quick to correct the original poster.

""Sounds like you have no clue at all about any of this,"" one person commented.

Another added: ""Your fear is not supported by reality.""

Another commenter debunked much of the general premise of the original post by mentioning that the U.S. had been sending jobs overseas long before the clean energy push started.

""American industry has been sending good manufacturing jobs to China and elsewhere for a half century,"" the commenter said. ""Singling out green tech is a bad faith argument.""

One commenter pleaded with the original poster to educate themselves on this, posting: ""Please spend a few minutes researching this … The premise that the transition to green energy is causing more problems than it's solving is nonsense.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clean-energy-regulationsimage-recY7eCzOgl1iWZ0L.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:05.087152

Energy Vault’s Calistoga Resiliency Centre comes online, company secures US$50 million

In other news from Energy Vault, the company, along with utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) announced the successful completion and operation of the Calistoga Resiliency Centre (CRC) located in California.

CRC integrates hydrogen fuel cells with a lithium-ion BESS to ensure power resilience during grid outages caused by wildfires or natural disasters.

The Calistoga community microgrid will benefit from the CRC by sustaining power during shutoffs or disconnections. According to Energy Vault, the 293MWh system provides about 48 hours of continuous energy, with a peak output of 8.5MW during public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events.

During such events, the system operates in ‘island’ mode, using green hydrogen to generate electricity.

After fulfilling the black-start and grid-forming roles of the microgrid, Energy Vault’s B-VAULT DC battery technology works with the fuel cells to ensure grid stability.

In April, Energy Vault closed on US$28 million in project financing for the CRC, including the sale of an investment tax credit associated with the project.

In August, the company received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to pursue market-based participation in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market with the CRC.

A representative from Energy Vault said to Energy-Storage.news:

“Ultimately, the system will need to be approved for market participation by CAISO itself, but the CPUC clearance is a key milestone toward that goal. That being said, the system’s operation relies on a hybrid combination of lithium-ion battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, so there is no distinction to be made in terms of which technology will be considered for CAISO market participation.”

The company also announced on 26 September that it entered into a definitive funding agreement with YA II PN, for up to US$50 million in corporate debenture financing.

Energy Vault noted the funding agreement is separate from and in addition to the recently announced US$300 million preferred equity investment with a leading infrastructure investor, which is pending final closure.

Upon final closing, Asset Vault will be established as a fully consolidated subsidiary to manage Energy Vault’s storage assets, which it will own and operate.

These assets will be backed by long-term offtake agreements, which Energy Vault says will secure project revenue and support Energy Vault’s strategy as an independent power producer (IPP).

The value of the contracts has not been disclosed owing to commercial sensitivity, although the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said that funding will be taken from the £9.4bn (US$12.6bn) earmarked for CCUS in the spending review in June.

Combined, the two facilities are expected to capture almost 1.2m tCO2e/y, including 800,000 tCO2e/y from Padeswood, amounting to around 95% of the cement works’ total emissions and more than half of all emissions from Heidelberg Materials’ UK overall cement operations in 2023. The 370,000 tCO2e/y expected to be captured at Protos, meanwhile, amounts to just under half of Encyclis’ total emissions from its three incinerators in the UK and Ireland in 2024. Encyclis plans to incinerate 500,000 t/y of non-recyclable waste at Protos, generating 49.9 MW of electricity.

Cement production is one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries, responsible for around 8% of global emissions, largely from the vast heat required to turn limestone into clinker.

Emissions at Padeswood are generated from burning domestic waste to heat the cement kiln. Heidelberg Materials says the plant will be the first cement works in the world to capture almost all CO2 emissions from industrial-scale production.

The facility Heidelberg Materials plans to build at Padeswood will use an amine solvent-based technology already deployed at its Brevik cement plant in Norway, which became the world’s first industrial-scale site to capture emissions from cement production when it opened in June. The Brevik plant captures only 50% of emissions, making Padeswood a significant technological advancement.

Heidelberg Materials is also planning to build a new heat and power plant to support the additional energy demand created by the capture facility. The company told TCE that the new heat and power plant will be fuelled by waste heat from cement production and natural gas, and that emissions will be captured.

Heidelberg Materials is also building a new 10 km spur pipeline to connect Padeswood to the wider HyNet network.

Olivia Powis, CEO of the CCS Association, said: “Cement and energy from waste are two of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, yet they are fundamental to our economy and way of life – from building new homes and vital infrastructure to managing society’s unrecyclable waste and providing reliable low-carbon power.

“These world-leading projects show how carbon capture can provide credible, scalable pathways to net zero securing the future of essential UK industries and keeping businesses competitive in global markets.”

The UK government expects the two projects to generate around 500 jobs, primarily in construction. Heidelberg Materials noted that its facility will create 50 new operational roles while supporting 200 existing positions. UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth and investment for local communities. These trailblazing projects showcase north Wales and the northwest’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.”

It can be life-threatening and lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in losses.

Unfortunately, research out of Texas A&M discovered that the country is shockingly vulnerable to grid outages — and some states are more at risk than others.

What's happening?

EnergySage spotlighted Texas A&M's report in a recent article examining how installing solar panels with battery storage can give homeowners a leg up during grid outages on households without a backup power source or those dependent on gasoline generators.

As an independent, objective expert in the nuances of the rooftop solar industry, EnergySage offers free tools for consumers to obtain easy-to-compare solar installation quotes.

Texas A&M's findings reveal why an increasing number of homeowners are preparing for weather-induced grid outages with the assistance of EnergySage.

The university reported that power outages have risen by 20% since 2019. Texas, California, and Louisiana, respectively, accounted for the most major power outages between 2000 and 2023, according to a Power System Vulnerability Index created using over 179 million data points.

Why is this important?

As EnergySage explains, power outages aren't just dangerous for people who rely on medical equipment needing refrigeration or electricity. During an outage, the average family loses $200 in groceries because of spoilage, and they may need to shell out upward of $25,000 on hotel stays, damaged electronics, and other repairs in the event of water-related property damage.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, the director of the Urban Resilience AI Lab that used machine learning to develop the vulnerability index, said in the Texas A&M release that the grid failure situation was more dire than they originally suspected.

""We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,"" Dr. Mostafavi said.

What can be done about this?

Installing solar panels and pairing them with battery storage won't only boost your family's ability to manage whatever climate-related event comes its way.

Along with upgrading to energy-efficient technology, solar and battery storage will also help you significantly reduce your energy bills while slashing dirty fuel-produced heat-trapping pollution responsible for warming the climate and subsequently supercharging extreme weather.

Whether used for everyday power or as a backup energy source, solar panels also improve comfort and peace of mind because they're quieter than gas generators and don't introduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

On average, EnergySage's free services save homeowners $10,000 on solar installations. Now is also the time to connect with EnergySage to maximize your savings, as solar projects must be underway by Dec. 31 to qualify for federal tax incentives. Its state-by-state mapping tool can help you discover which area-specific savings may also be available.

Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric one can save you $1,500 every year on fuel and maintenance.","An electric vehicle battery recycling project in Germany promises to keep the valuable devices in use, saving precious materials and supporting a circular economy while boosting communities.

The pilot plant is set for Chemnitz and will be built by manufacturing institute Fraunhofer IWU and EDAG Production Solutions, Interesting Engineering reported.

""Shredding high-voltage storage systems discards valuable resources,"" the outlet stated. ""The team sees disassembly and reuse as a better option.

""The process preserves raw materials and allows non-reusable cells to be passed on to recyclers, who can still recover lithium, cobalt, and other critical elements.""

The resulting products will be used to enable energy storage for homes, businesses, and utilities.

IE noted that used batteries will increase tenfold in the European Union by 2030. For the units to be fully repurposed, they must be broken down to their individual components. That way, failed or damaged cells can be replaced or repaired.

The plant will compile data about disassembly and recovery so it can improve processes.

Artificial intelligence will support the breakdown method, evaluating whether cells can be reused or are at the end of their lifespans. This will also reduce risks to workers and make the system scalable, IE reported.

Electric vehicles are great for people and the planet, saving folks money and reducing pollution that harms human health and the environment. EV batteries are made with rare metals, and their cells are arranged in modules, which make up a pack. Keeping these resources in circulation after they have outlived their usefulness in automobiles reduces the risk of toxins leaching into groundwater and soil and minimizes resource depletion.

Battery technology is always evolving, and developments make EVs and other machines more affordable and efficient. Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric one can save you $1,500 every year on fuel and maintenance. It will also produce only about one-quarter of the heat-trapping gases that are driving rising global temperatures and all the consequences of dirty energy use.

Battery storage also makes daily living easier for humans, helping individuals, companies, and cities reduce reliance on the electric grid, which is still powered mostly by dirty energy sources, saving money and curbing pollution. This has a profound effect on people's well-being, lowering risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and more while protecting vulnerable people and communities.

""Solar is not only about generation anymore; it is about creating a local industry,"" Tayfun Hiz, a researcher at the Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications of Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Xinhua recently.
Without these steps, it may be difficult to use all the renewable power being built,"" she told Xinhua.
The Turkish government aims to reach around 120 gigawatts of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035, while continuing to develop hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

""Solar is not only about generation anymore; it is about creating a local industry,"" Tayfun Hiz, a researcher at the Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications of Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Xinhua recently.

""Türkiye is already building panels, inverters and related technologies domestically. If we align research, manufacturing and policy, solar can become a driver of exports as well as clean energy at home,"" he added.

Muhdan Saglam, director of Ankara-based think tank the Center for Energy and Climate Change Studies at the Economic Policy Research Foundation, emphasized the next phase of the energy transition: ""Türkiye has shown it can build renewable power quickly, but the real challenge now is to integrate these resources smoothly into the system.""

""To solve this, Türkiye will need to invest in stronger power lines, storage systems such as batteries, and smarter electricity markets. Without these steps, it may be difficult to use all the renewable power being built,"" she told Xinhua.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced at the UN Climate Summit 2025 held Wednesday in New York that more than 60 percent of Türkiye's installed electricity capacity now comes from renewable sources, including hydropower, wind and solar.

He outlined new measures including an emissions trading system and green finance tools. ""In line with our net-zero emissions target for 2053, we will continue to transform key sectors,"" Erdogan added.

The renewable expansion also supports Türkiye's goal of reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and enhancing energy security through sun, wind and water resources.

Official data showed that Türkiye's solar power has doubled since 2021, reaching over 21 gigawatts of capacity by early 2025, while wind power has steadily expanded and hydropower remains the backbone with over 32 gigawatts of capacity.

The Turkish government aims to reach around 120 gigawatts of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035, while continuing to develop hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

Saglam warned that without proper grid infrastructure, renewable energy potential in Türkiye cannot be fully realized.

Citing the massive blackout in the Iberian Peninsula in late April as an example of grid vulnerability, Saglam stressed that ""necessary investments have to be made to support the grid.""

We are still ignoring the important role of ventilation in the full HVAC&R cycle.","As climate change pushes temperatures ever higher in the Middle East, the HVAC&R industry is being asked to provide more cooling while simultaneously consuming less energy. It’s a problem the industry has had to confront across the world, but the high ambient temperatures of the Middle East make it especially difficult to balance cooling and energy consumption.

It’s this challenge that Eurovent Middle East, an industry association of HVAC&R manufacturers and local service providers, is addressing at its upcoming HVACR Next Generation congress, which is being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on October 28. Indoor air quality (IAQ), ventilation and training are all major focus points of the program, as are natural refrigerants. In addition to technical challenges and best practices, another goal of the event is to show that sustainability is good for business, according to Markus Lattner, Managing Director of Eurovent Middle East.

“There is a clear business case to be made to rely on high-quality, high-energy-efficient systems designed and operated by trained and qualified personnel,” Lattner said.

NaturalRefrigerants.com spoke with Lattner to learn more about the HVACR Next Generation congress and Eurovent Middle East’s goals for the event. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The HVACR Next Generation congress is a relatively new event in its second edition. What is its goal and format?

Markus Lattner: There are several major issues the industry and region is facing that need to be brought to the attention of a wider audience within our ecosystem. Contrary to many of the commercial conferences, we can address these issues free from commercial interest and influence. We do not allow commercial content and sponsoring does not automatically entitle you to a presentation. This ensures that we can provide a truly relevant and engaging agenda.

One of the key topics on the agenda is the refrigerant transition in high ambient temperature, or HAT, countries. Given this, what presence will natural refrigerants have on the agenda?

ML: It is clear that the region will have to adapt to a changing refrigerant landscape in the coming decades, and the top priority lies in decarbonizing the building sector. Natural refrigerants will undoubtedly have to play a major part in this transition, and it is essential that we educate the market on their potential and address prejudices and misinformation as to their applicability in HAT conditions.

We want to motivate investors and end users to switch to low-GWP solutions at an early stage. We will discuss essential steps to be taken if we want to see this transition be successful from the legal environment to qualification requirements and the adoption of relevant international safety standards. This aspect will form a major part of the conference.

Training is an issue in the HVAC&R industry, both in general and with regard to the transition to natural refrigerants. Will training be a topic of discussion at the event?

ML: We launched our HVAC&R Leadership Academy two years ago to provide certified technical training, and we are seeing an increased interest in f-gas certification, which is a vital first step. Qualification across the value chain from planning to installation, operation and maintenance forms the greatest savings potential when it comes to energy consumption and carbon emissions. It is about time that we bring more skill requirements to the industry in the region.

“Natural refrigerants will undoubtedly have to play a major part in this transition, and it is essential that we educate the market on their potential and address prejudices and misinformation as to their applicability in HAT conditions.”

Markus Lattner, Managing Director of Eurovent Middle East

In addition to high-ambient temperatures, are there other unique challenges facing the HVAC&R industry in the Middle East?

ML: Our other major focal point is ventilation. We are still ignoring the important role of ventilation in the full HVAC&R cycle. After all, the best chiller on the roof is useless if the cooling load isn’t delivered equally and fully to the building. Add into this its effect on IAQ, the role it plays in keeping buildings healthy and its energy imprint, which is estimated to be between 40% to 50% of the total HVAC-related energy costs, and it is clear that we need to bring more scrutiny to the planning and design of ventilation systems.

We also will highlight that sustainability, aside from its environmental impact, is directly related to lower total cost of ownership. There is a clear business case to be made to rely on high-quality, high-energy-efficient systems designed and operated by trained and qualified personnel.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system.
Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.
“People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets.
This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (September 15, 2025)—A new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reveals how millions of people across Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia are footing the bill for an additional $4.3 billion in electricity infrastructure projects approved in 2024 solely to connect wealthy private companies’ data centers.

This $4.3 billion was previously obscured through opaque utility filings and is on top of an estimated $9.3 billion in data center electricity costs to be paid between June 2025 and June 2026 by the 65 million people who are customers supplied by PJM, the regional utility operator spanning 13 Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley states plus the District of Columbia.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system. Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.

Jacobs’ seven state analysis found household electricity bills subsidizing the following in direct data center transmission costs approved in 2024:

Illinois: $239 million

Maryland: $107.5 million

New Jersey: $14.5 million

Ohio: $1.3 billion

Pennsylvania: $491.7 million

Virginia: $1.9 billion

West Virginia: $215.8 million

“The big tech companies rushing to build out massive data centers are worth trillions of dollars, yet they’re successfully exploiting an outdated regulatory process to pawn billions of dollars of costs off on families who may never even use their products,” said Jacobs. “People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets. This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits. Utilities and regulators must do more to protect people from this outrageous practice that is already driving up household electricity bills for millions of people across the country.”

There are several ways state and federal regulators can reverse this subsidy, Jacobs explains, and these solutions could save people billions of dollars as data centers are projected to increase U.S. energy demand by 130% by 2030, potentially repeating these cost shifts in many more states.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:10.694594

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",http://d3i5p6znmm9yua.cloudfront.net/360_Tiffin_Live/0/0/0/0/753/661/753661_1,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:59.429587

The comprehensive funding package forms a central component of the ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign, an ambitious initiative co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that seeks to mobilize unprecedented levels of public and private investment in clean energy infrastructure across the African continent. This coordinated effort aims not only to expand renewable energy generation capacity but also to address the pressing challenge of energy access that continues to affect hundreds of millions of African citizens.

The Strategic Vision: Powering Africa’s Future Through Clean Energy

“The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world,” President von der Leyen emphasized in her address. “A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.”

This statement encapsulates the multifaceted rationale behind the EU’s substantial investment commitment. The initiative recognizes that Africa’s energy transition carries implications far beyond the continent’s borders, influencing global climate trajectories, international supply chain resilience, migration patterns, and geopolitical stability. By supporting Africa’s renewable energy development, the European Union positions itself as a key partner in addressing interconnected challenges of development, security, and environmental sustainability.

Africa’s Energy Paradox: Immense Potential Meets Pressing Need

The African continent presents a striking paradox in the global energy landscape. Blessed with extraordinary renewable energy resources—abundant sunshine across vast territories, strong wind corridors along coastal regions, significant hydropower potential from mighty river systems, and substantial geothermal capacity in the East African Rift Valley—Africa theoretically possesses the natural endowments to become a renewable energy powerhouse. Solar irradiation levels across much of Africa exceed those found in most other regions globally, making solar photovoltaic installations particularly economically attractive.

Yet despite these abundant natural resources, approximately 600 million Africans currently live without access to electricity—representing roughly 43% of the continent’s population. This energy poverty constrains economic development, limits educational opportunities, hampers healthcare delivery, and perpetuates cycles of underdevelopment. In rural areas particularly, lack of electricity access affects fundamental aspects of daily life, from food preservation and water pumping to communication and productive economic activities.

The consequences of this energy deficit extend beyond mere inconvenience. Without reliable electricity, small businesses cannot operate modern equipment, students struggle to study after dark, healthcare facilities cannot refrigerate vaccines or power critical medical equipment, and communities remain isolated from the digital economy transforming much of the world. Addressing this energy access challenge while simultaneously pursuing climate-friendly development pathways represents one of the defining development challenges of the 21st century.

The Development and Strategic Imperative

The urgency of supporting Africa’s clean energy transition stems from both developmental and strategic considerations. From a development perspective, modern energy access serves as a fundamental prerequisite for poverty reduction, economic diversification, and human development progress. The correlation between energy access and development indicators like life expectancy, education levels, and income is well-established in development economics research.

Strategically, how Africa meets its growing energy needs will profoundly influence global climate outcomes. With Africa’s population projected to reach approximately 2.5 billion by 2050—representing a doubling from current levels—and with legitimate aspirations for economic development and improved living standards, the continent’s energy consumption will inevitably increase substantially. Whether this increased energy demand is met through fossil fuels or renewable sources will significantly impact global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories and the feasibility of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Investing in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power across Africa is described in the EU announcement as “not just a moral and development imperative” but also “a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient.” This job creation potential is particularly significant given Africa’s youth demographic profile, with the continent possessing the world’s youngest population and facing substantial youth employment challenges.

The reference to supply chain strengthening acknowledges the growing importance of critical minerals for renewable energy technologies. Africa possesses substantial reserves of minerals essential for batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and other clean energy technologies, including cobalt, lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. Developing renewable energy industries within Africa could create opportunities for value-added processing and manufacturing, moving beyond simple raw material extraction toward more sophisticated and economically beneficial industrial activities.

The Global Gateway: Europe’s Infrastructure Investment Framework

The announced package operates within the framework of the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy, an ambitious initiative launched to mobilize €300 billion in infrastructure investments globally between 2021 and 2027. Global Gateway represents the European Union’s strategic response to infrastructure financing needs in developing and emerging economies, emphasizing sustainable, high-quality investments that adhere to international standards for environmental protection, labor rights, transparency, and governance.

The strategy explicitly positions itself as offering an alternative model to some other international infrastructure investment approaches, emphasizing partnership principles, local ownership, and sustainability considerations. In the African context, Global Gateway focuses particularly on digital connectivity, health systems, education, renewable energy, and transport infrastructure—sectors identified as critical for sustainable development and economic transformation.

Through this framework, the EU commits to helping “accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.” This comprehensive approach recognizes that expanding renewable energy generation capacity alone is insufficient; investments must also address transmission infrastructure to move electricity from generation sites to population centers, and regional interconnection to enable electricity trade and enhance system reliability.

Detailed Breakdown: Where the €545 Million Will Be Deployed

The newly announced package distributes resources across multiple African nations and regional initiatives, targeting both large-scale infrastructure projects and community-level electrification efforts. This diversified approach reflects recognition that Africa’s energy challenge requires solutions at multiple scales, from major transmission lines enabling regional power trade to decentralized mini-grids bringing electricity to remote villages.

Côte d’Ivoire: Strengthening Regional Energy Backbone (€359.4 million)

The largest single allocation within the package directs €359.4 million toward construction of a high-voltage transmission line known as ‘Dorsale Est’ (Eastern Backbone) in Côte d’Ivoire. This substantial infrastructure project aims to enhance regional energy distribution capacity, enabling more efficient power flow across the country and potentially facilitating electricity trade with neighboring nations.

Côte d’Ivoire has emerged as West Africa’s fastest-growing economy in recent years and serves as a regional economic hub. The country has achieved relatively high electrification rates compared to regional averages, with approximately 70% of the population having electricity access. However, the quality and reliability of supply require improvement, and transmission infrastructure needs upgrading to accommodate increasing demand and integration of new renewable generation capacity.

High-voltage transmission lines are critical infrastructure for modern power systems, enabling efficient long-distance electricity transport with minimal losses. By strengthening this transmission backbone, the project will facilitate integration of renewable energy sources that may be located far from major consumption centers—such as solar installations in northern regions or potential wind farms in coastal areas—and enhance grid stability and reliability.

Cameroon: Bringing Power to Rural Communities (€59.1 million)

The second-largest country allocation targets rural electrification in Cameroon, with €59.1 million dedicated to bringing electricity access to 687 communities, potentially benefiting more than 2.5 million people. This represents a significant step toward addressing Cameroon’s substantial rural-urban electricity access gap, where rural electrification rates lag far behind urban areas.

Rural electrification projects face distinct challenges compared to urban grid extension, including dispersed populations, difficult terrain, long distances from existing grid infrastructure, and limited ability of rural populations to pay cost-reflective electricity tariffs. These challenges often require innovative approaches such as mini-grids powered by solar or small hydropower installations, rather than traditional grid extension strategies.

The impact of rural electrification extends well beyond household lighting. Electricity access enables irrigation pumping for agriculture, refrigeration for food preservation and small businesses, power for processing agricultural products, communication technologies connecting rural areas to markets and information, and improved healthcare and education services. Studies consistently demonstrate that rural electrification catalyzes broader economic development when accompanied by complementary investments in productive uses of electricity.

Republic of Congo: Diversifying Renewable Energy Sources (€3.5 million)

A more modest allocation of €3.5 million for the Republic of Congo focuses on expanding access to diverse renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydropower technologies. While smaller in absolute terms, this investment could support feasibility studies, pilot projects, technical assistance, and policy development that lay groundwork for larger future investments.

The Republic of Congo possesses significant hydropower potential from the Congo River basin, one of the world’s most powerful river systems. However, developing this potential requires substantial investment in generation facilities and transmission infrastructure. Meanwhile, solar and wind technologies offer opportunities for more distributed generation that can provide electricity access more quickly and flexibly than large-scale hydropower projects.

Lesotho: Unlocking Wind and Hydropower Potential (€25.9 million)

The mountain kingdom of Lesotho receives €25.9 million through the Renewable Lesotho programme, specifically targeting development of wind and hydropower resources. Lesotho’s mountainous topography and high elevation create favorable conditions for both wind energy generation and hydroelectric installations, though the country currently remains heavily dependent on imported electricity from neighboring South Africa.

Lesotho faces unique energy challenges stemming from its geography—entirely surrounded by South Africa, with rugged terrain complicating infrastructure development, and a small population of approximately 2 million people that limits economies of scale. However, these same geographical characteristics provide renewable energy advantages. The highlands experience strong, consistent winds suitable for wind power generation, while steep elevation changes and reliable water flows create hydropower opportunities.

Developing domestic renewable energy generation could reduce Lesotho’s electricity import dependence, keep energy expenditure within the national economy, and potentially position the country to export renewable electricity to South Africa’s much larger market. The Renewable Lesotho programme appears designed to conduct necessary assessments, develop project pipelines, and attract additional financing for specific generation projects.

Ghana: Planning Large-Scale Solar Development (€2 million)

Ghana receives €2 million designated for laying groundwork for a large-scale solar park and facilitating regional energy trade. Though modest in size, this funding likely supports preliminary activities essential for major renewable energy projects—site assessments, grid integration studies, environmental and social impact assessments, regulatory approvals, and engagement with potential investors and off-takers.

Ghana has established itself as one of West Africa’s more stable and prosperous nations, with relatively strong governance institutions and a growing economy. The country has set ambitious renewable energy targets and seeks to diversify its electricity generation mix, which historically relied heavily on hydropower and thermal generation. Large-scale solar parks represent attractive options given Ghana’s location near the equator and consistently high solar irradiation levels.

Regional energy trade represents another strategic dimension of this investment. West African nations have long recognized benefits of regional electricity market integration, which can enhance supply reliability, optimize generation resource utilization, and provide economic efficiencies through trade. Ghana’s participation in the West African Power Pool positions it to both import and export electricity, and developing additional generation capacity could enable the country to become a net exporter to neighbors with electricity deficits.

Central Africa: Strengthening Regional Energy Cooperation (€3.3 million)

The package allocates €3.3 million across three initiatives supporting the Central African Power Pool (CAPP), a regional organization working to develop integrated electricity markets and infrastructure across Central African nations. These investments include:

Technical Assistance to CAPP (€1.6 million): Supporting the institutional development, planning capabilities, and operational effectiveness of this regional power pool organization. Effective regional electricity market operation requires sophisticated planning, coordination mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, and technical standards—all areas where technical assistance can build capacity.

Research and Infrastructure Funding Facility (€0.5 million): Creating a funding mechanism to support studies and small-scale infrastructure investments advancing regional energy integration. This facility could finance grid interconnection studies, renewable energy resource assessments, and pilot projects demonstrating innovative approaches.

Friendship Loop Feasibility Study (€1.2 million): Examining the technical and economic feasibility of a cross-border transmission line—dubbed the ‘Boucle de l’Amitié’ (Friendship Loop)—that would connect Pointe Noire, Brazzaville, and Kinshasa. These cities represent major population and economic centers across the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, yet electricity interconnections remain limited. A transmission link could enable power sharing, improve supply reliability, and facilitate integration of new generation capacity.

Madagascar: Expanding Rural Electrification (€33.2 million)

Madagascar receives €33.2 million focused on expanding electrification through mini-grids in rural areas. The island nation faces particularly acute energy access challenges, with electrification rates among the lowest globally—only about 15% of the population has electricity access, and rural access rates drop below 5%.

Madagascar’s geography—an island nation with dispersed rural populations, challenging terrain, and biodiversity conservation priorities—makes traditional grid extension economically prohibitive for many communities. Mini-grids powered by solar panels, small wind turbines, or micro-hydropower installations offer more practical solutions for bringing electricity to isolated communities.

These decentralized energy systems can be deployed relatively quickly, scaled to match community needs, and operated independently of national grid infrastructure. When properly designed and managed, mini-grids can provide reliable electricity at costs competitive with diesel generators while avoiding fossil fuel dependence. The EU investment will likely support both the physical installation of mini-grid systems and the development of sustainable business models ensuring their long-term operation and maintenance.

Mozambique: Encouraging Private Sector Engagement (€13 million)

Mozambique’s allocation of €13 million emphasizes supporting a low-emission energy transition while particularly encouraging private sector involvement. This reflects recognition that public financing alone cannot meet the scale of investment required for comprehensive energy system transformation, and that mobilizing private capital is essential for sustainable energy sector development.

Mozambique possesses substantial renewable energy potential, including significant solar resources, hydropower potential from major river systems, wind resources along its extensive coastline, and potentially exploitable natural gas reserves that could serve as a transition fuel. The country has attracted interest from international renewable energy developers, though project development faces challenges including limited grid infrastructure, regulatory uncertainties, and financing constraints.

EU support could address these barriers through various mechanisms: providing concessional financing that improves project economics, offering guarantees that reduce investor risk, supporting regulatory reforms that create clearer frameworks for private investment, and funding grid infrastructure that enables private generation projects to connect and deliver power to markets.

Somalia: Building Resilience Through Renewable Energy (€45.5 million)

Somalia receives a substantial €45.5 million allocation with multiple interconnected objectives: increasing access to affordable renewable energy, advancing circular economy practices, and building climate-resilient agri-food systems. This integrated approach recognizes the multiple challenges facing Somalia and the interconnections between energy access, agricultural development, climate adaptation, and economic recovery.

Somalia faces extraordinary development challenges stemming from decades of conflict, weak state institutions, and vulnerability to climate shocks including recurring droughts and occasional flooding. Energy access remains extremely limited, with most electricity generation coming from expensive imported diesel fuel powering small-scale generators. This results in some of the world’s highest electricity costs—often exceeding $1 per kilowatt-hour—which constrains economic activity and household wellbeing.

Renewable energy deployment, particularly solar systems, could dramatically reduce energy costs while avoiding continued fossil fuel dependence. The reference to circular economy practices suggests attention to sustainable resource management, waste reduction, and recycling—principles that can be integrated into energy system development through careful planning of equipment lifecycles, local manufacturing or assembly where feasible, and proper management of end-of-life solar panels and batteries.

The connection to climate-resilient agri-food systems acknowledges that Somalia’s economy depends heavily on agriculture and pastoralism, sectors highly vulnerable to climate variability. Renewable energy can support agricultural adaptation through solar-powered irrigation, cold storage facilities for produce and vaccines, processing equipment that adds value to agricultural products, and communication systems enabling farmers to access weather information and market prices.

The Scaling Up Renewables in Africa Campaign: A Collaborative Approach

The €545 million EU package represents one component of the broader ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign, an innovative multi-stakeholder initiative designed to mobilize commitments and action far beyond what any single actor could achieve alone. The campaign brings together governments, international organizations, private sector entities, and civil society in a coordinated effort to accelerate Africa’s renewable energy transition.

The involvement of Global Citizen, an international advocacy organization with expertise in mobilizing public engagement and private sector commitments around development goals, adds a grassroots dimension to the campaign. Global Citizen has pioneered approaches that combine public advocacy, major music and cultural events, and engagement with political and business leaders to drive action on global challenges ranging from poverty and hunger to education and climate change.

The International Energy Agency provides critical technical and analytical support, bringing its extensive expertise in energy markets, technologies, and policies. The IEA’s participation lends credibility and technical rigor to the campaign while helping ensure that initiatives align with best practices in energy system planning and development.

The campaign structure encourages diverse actors—governments, financial institutions, private companies, and philanthropists—to make concrete pledges of capital, expertise, or technical assistance. This model recognizes that comprehensive energy system transformation requires contributions from multiple sources: public financing to support enabling infrastructure and reduce project risks, private capital to fund commercially viable generation projects, philanthropic resources to support community-level initiatives and capacity building, and technical expertise to navigate complex planning, regulatory, and implementation challenges.

Momentum Toward Global Climate Goals

The campaign explicitly maintains momentum toward the ambitious targets established at COP28—the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Dubai—which called for tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. These targets reflect scientific consensus regarding the pace of clean energy deployment needed to limit global temperature increases and avoid the most severe climate change impacts.

Africa’s energy transition plays a crucial role in achieving these global targets. While the continent currently accounts for a relatively small share of global greenhouse gas emissions—reflecting low historical industrialization and energy consumption—Africa’s development trajectory over coming decades will significantly influence global emissions pathways. Supporting clean energy development now can help African nations achieve development goals while avoiding the high-carbon pathways that characterized industrialization in other regions.

The connection to COP28 commitments also positions the Africa renewable energy campaign within broader international climate negotiations and accountability frameworks. By linking African energy investments to global climate targets, the initiative emphasizes shared responsibility for climate action and the importance of developed nations supporting clean energy transitions in developing countries—consistent with principles of climate justice and differentiated responsibilities embodied in international climate agreements.

Looking Ahead: Upcoming Forums and the G20 Summit

The campaign’s strategic timeline builds momentum through a series of high-profile events designed to maintain attention, generate additional commitments, and translate pledges into concrete action. In early October, the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels will convene governments, financial institutions, and private sector leaders to provide additional support for Africa’s clean energy transition. This forum offers opportunities for announcing new investment commitments, establishing partnerships between European and African entities, and addressing technical and policy challenges impeding project development.

The campaign culminates with a high-level event connected to the G20 Summit in South Africa on November 22-23, 2025. The G20 represents the world’s major economies and accounts for approximately 85% of global GDP and two-thirds of the world population. Holding the summit in an African nation—South Africa—provides unique opportunities to center African development priorities, including energy access and climate change, in discussions among the world’s most powerful governments and economic institutions.

South Africa’s hosting of the G20 Summit carries particular significance given the country’s own energy transition challenges and opportunities. South Africa’s electricity system has historically relied heavily on coal-fired generation, but the nation has committed to transitioning toward renewable energy and has attracted substantial international support for this transition, including through the Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26. South Africa’s experience navigating the complexities of energy transition—including managing social and economic impacts on coal-dependent communities and workers—provides relevant lessons for other African nations.

The G20 context also enables engagement with major emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil—countries that increasingly influence development finance, technology transfer, and trade patterns affecting African nations. Securing commitments from this diverse group of global powers could mobilize resources and political will far beyond what European contributions alone could achieve.

The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities

While the €545 million EU package and the broader Scaling Up Renewables campaign represent significant commitments, successfully transforming Africa’s energy landscape will require addressing substantial challenges that extend beyond financing alone. Technical challenges include integrating variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind into electricity grids designed for predictable, dispatchable generation; developing adequate transmission infrastructure to connect generation sites with consumption centers; building local technical capacity for operating and maintaining modern energy systems; and ensuring cybersecurity for increasingly digitized grid management systems.

Regulatory and institutional challenges may prove equally important. Many African nations require reforms to electricity sector regulations that currently inhibit private investment, updates to grid codes and technical standards that facilitate renewable energy integration, strengthening of regulatory agencies that can effectively oversee liberalized electricity markets, and development of clear, stable policy frameworks that provide investors with confidence for long-term commitments.

Social and economic dimensions of energy transition also demand attention. Ensuring that energy access reaches poor and marginalized communities, not just economically advantaged populations, requires careful attention to affordability and deliberate targeting of underserved areas. Managing impacts on existing energy sector workers and fossil fuel-dependent communities necessitates just transition strategies that provide retraining, alternative employment opportunities, and social protection. Building local supply chains and manufacturing capabilities can maximize employment benefits and technology transfer, though this requires coordinated industrial policy alongside energy sector development.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities are immense. Successfully developing Africa’s renewable energy potential could position the continent as a major clean energy producer and exporter, particularly for green hydrogen and electricity exports to Europe via undersea cables. The job creation potential—up to 38 million positions by 2030 according to the EU announcement—could transform employment prospects for Africa’s young and growing population. Enhanced energy access would catalyze economic development across sectors from manufacturing and services to agriculture and digital economy participation.

Conclusion: A Defining Partnership for Sustainable Development

The European Commission’s €545 million investment package, announced by President von der Leyen at the Global Citizen Festival, represents far more than a financial commitment. It embodies a vision of partnership between Europe and Africa grounded in shared interests—climate stability, sustainable development, economic opportunity, and regional security—rather than outdated models of aid dependency or resource extraction.

By supporting Africa’s renewable energy transition through the Global Gateway framework and the Scaling Up Renewables campaign, the European Union positions itself as a committed partner in one of the 21st century’s defining development challenges. The success of these initiatives will be measured not simply in megawatts of generation capacity installed or kilometers of transmission lines constructed, but in lives transformed through energy access, jobs created in emerging green economies, and progress toward global climate goals that protect the planet for future generations.

As President von der Leyen emphasized, “The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world.” Through this substantial investment and the collaborative campaign it supports, Europe signals its commitment to ensuring that Africa has the resources, partnerships, and support needed to make choices that advance both continental development and global sustainability. The coming months, as the campaign builds toward the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, will reveal whether this vision can mobilize the comprehensive action—political, financial, and technical—required to realize Africa’s renewable energy potential and deliver on the promise of a clean energy future for all.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is giving a group of its clients front-row access to the energy transition that’s underway in the Gulf states, as the region’s efforts to pivot away from fossil-fuel dependence generate growing investor interest.

“It’s a very compelling story,” said Hannah Lee, Asia-Pacific equity thematic and head of sustainable investing research at JPMorgan Securities. That applies “both for their own electricity generation, but also for the potential to export clean energy at some point in the future.”

JPMorgan will be taking a group of institutional clients, some with an emerging markets and Asia focus, to Saudi Arabia next month. The trip will serve to raise investor awareness around the energy transformation that’s underway across many of the Gulf states, Lee said.

For now, the Middle East remains a bastion of fossil-fuel dominance. It’s home to about 30% of global oil production, and is coming to the clean-energy transition later than many other major economies, including the US, India and China. But the low base from which the Middle East is starting underpins the opportunity to generate returns from early green investments, according to Lee.

“Our entire renewable energy complex of analysts” has been following the build-out in the Middle East, she said. That analysis, which has covered “batteries and renewables and transformers and everything,” has identified “interesting new commitments out of some of the Middle Eastern, Gulf states on renewable energy and energy transition, of which Saudi Arabia is very notable.”

Gulf state efforts to explore clean energy gathered pace after Dubai hosted the annual United Nations climate change conference in 2023, also known as COP28, according to JPMorgan.

This year, the region is expected to spend $10 billion on renewable and nuclear power generation. That’s still less than a tenth of its projected investment in supplying oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency. In the coming decade, however, solar photo-voltaic capacity in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to increase tenfold, the IEA estimates.

JPMorgan is drawing investors’ attention to clean-energy opportunities in the Middle East at a time when capital previously destined for the US looks for other destinations. That’s amid growing evidence that a number of institutional investors have been put off by President Donald Trump’s escalating attacks on green energy.

Saudi Arabia has set a target of 130 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity by 2030, and will rely on renewables for half the electricity it generates. Abu Dhabi aims to produce 60% of its electricity from renewables and nuclear by 2035. Both sets of targets will require significant investments.

Data provider Kpler estimates that Saudi Arabia is installing 12.8 gigawatts in renewable energy capacity this year. Power demand from data centers and water desalination are further expected to drive renewables growth in Saudi Arabia. As of 2024, the Saudi Water Authority reported that 20% of the energy used in its new desalination plants came from renewable sources, primarily solar power, the Kpler report stated.

However, the stock market has yet to reward some of the biggest players in the region, with the share price of Saudi Arabian utility Acwa Power Co. down by roughly half this year.

Fossil-fuel behemoth Saudi Aramco, meanwhile, has lost about 13% of its market value in the same period, as excess supply drives down oil prices. The company’s importance to the Saudi economy means its share price losses have left a dent on the kingdom’s main stock index, which is down about 7% this year. Dubai’s benchmark equity index, meanwhile, is up about 14%.

Investor interest in the Gulf states has picked up more broadly of late, as the region’s low taxes and light-touch regulations lure hedge funds, private equity firms and wealthy individuals. At the same time, Middle Eastern efforts to dedicate capital to data centers is laying the foundations for a surge in energy demand. Deals to date include a $3 billion agreement backed by Qatar Investment Authority to finance and invest in data centers.

Lee says JPMorgan also expects the region to benefit from growing trade and investment ties with China, as the world’s biggest clean-tech economy steps up exports to developing nations. Chinese companies have sharply increased foreign investment plans in recent years, with more than 360 manufacturing projects announced since 2022.

The Silk Road Fund and various Chinese firms have already signed billions of dollars worth of investments in Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom achieve its renewables targets under Vision 2030.

Saudi Arabia’s abundant sunshine combined with its ability to pump capital into projects it decides to back has already helped it achieve some of the world’s lowest average costs of producing electricity (known as levelized costs of electricity, or LCOE), according to Norway-based energy research firm Rystad Energy.

“It’s quite an interesting trend and plays into the increased South-South trade corporation that we’ve seen kind of growing over the last couple of years,” Lee said.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/deni_638947418339646341.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:59.351447

The Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids were created to support wider adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the company said.

In partnership with RML Group, Shell engineered a 34 kWh battery pack using EV-Plus Thermal Fluid with Shell Gas-to-Liquid Technology. This pack can charge from 10% to 80% capacity in under 10 minutes by reducing thermal stresses and allowing higher charging currents, Shell said.

When used in a lightweight, aerodynamic car with an efficiency of 10 km/kWh, the charging rate could reach 24 km (14 miles) per minute, Shell said.

Key Benefits of Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids

Shell said fluids are electrically non-conductive and provide heat transfer by filling interstitial spaces in the battery pack. This ensures consistent temperature control and enhanced protection against thermal events, according to Shell.

“We are thrilled to demonstrate that these fluids can help to significantly improve battery thermal performance. This paves the way towards higher charging efficiencies, enhanced safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness— to support the widespread adoption of BEVs demanded by legislative initiatives around the world,” said Jason Wong, Global Executive Vice President, Shell Lubricants.

Addressing EV Adoption Challenges

Global BEV sales rose 14% in 2024 compared to 2023, according to Shell. EVs in Europe and the U.S. now travel farther than ICE vehicles, but range anxiety and limited charging infrastructure remain concerns. Faster charging solutions like Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids help address these barriers, making EV ownership more practical, Shell said.

“Consumers are in pursuit of better energy efficiency, longer driving range and faster charging,” said Robert Mainwaring, Shell’s lead engineer on the project. “Our ambition within this project was to show how these fluids can support significant reductions in charging time. Without compromising cell integrity and lifetime. We believe this will open the door to a generation of more sustainable, efficient and cost-effective battery electric vehicle solutions.”

Democrats are trying to leverage the must-pass bill to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies; the Trump administration is tying a shutdown to potential mass federal worker layoffs.

The current battle focuses on expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that Democrats say will hurt the ability of millions of enrolees to afford insurance. Democrats have also said they want to reverse Medicaid cuts that Trump signed into law this summer.

Republicans are seeking a bill to temporarily extend federal spending at current levels without any add-ons.

If the government shuts down, President Donald Trump and his administration – which has already defied norms on executive power – likely will seek to exert more power.

Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russell Vought has moved with more executive authority over spending, which is typically left to Congress. The administration took steps to cancel foreign aid and asserted power to withhold billions in domestic spending.

“I would expect this shutdown to look different than any other shutdown,” said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy. He said he expects that the Trump team’s actions would be guided by what they believe achieves the most for them politically.

Trump could use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, wrote Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier wrote, Trump and Vought “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programmes and employees can be sidelined – decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns”.

Beyond the Antideficiency Act, which says the government cannot spend money or incur debts without Congress’s authority, the shutdown process has historically been guided by traditions, not laws.

In recent past shutdowns, hundreds of thousands of employees were furloughed, but the shutdowns did not result in mass permanent layoffs or significant reorganisations. Under federal law, federal workers also receive back pay for their time on furlough.

Trump and his congressional allies would be in charge of the government amid a shutdown. What could Trump do on his own?

OMB told agencies to ‘consider’ layoff notices

The Trump administration has already reduced the workforce by about 200,000, a number that could grow to 300,000 by the end of the year, Stier wrote. The administration gutted some agencies and programmes, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Voice of America.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided an email, first published by Politico, that it sent to agency heads that said agencies should consider sending “reduction in force” notices to employees whose programmes are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” or lack mandatory funding or another source of funding, such as the tax-and-spending legislation, HR1 (Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”), which became law in July.

Rachel Greszler, a workforce expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the administration hasn’t mandated layoffs, but directed agencies to “consider” issuing such notices “as a way to let federal employees know which of their jobs could be on the line if Congress reduces their agency’s funding”.

This signals to Democrats that healthcare funding demands could backfire, she said, potentially causing further reductions in the size of the federal government.

Several questions remain, including how many employees could face layoffs and when. The memo says once fiscal year 2026 appropriations are enacted, agencies should revise their plans to reduce staff.

“I believe this memo indicates OMB will pursue a dual path of shutdown-related furloughs and a separate process of mass layoffs,” Sewell said. Whether the layoffs happen before or after funding is restored “is an open question”, Sewell said. “This certainly indicates the administration wants to cut these agencies and programmes at any opportunity either now or in the future.”

Experts offered mixed opinions about whether layoffs would hold up in court. Any such process must follow the rules, such as a 60-day written notice.

“A shutdown provides no new legal authority to engage in widespread firings,” said Sam Berger, who works for the liberal Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities and who worked at OMB during the Biden and Obama administrations.

Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader from New York, said the memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted such firings would be reversed.

Social Security cheques and other mandatory spending will continue

Mandatory spending – ongoing spending that does not require periodic extensions from Congress – generally continues during a shutdown. This means Americans would still receive Social Security cheques and be able to use Medicare and Medicaid.

In previous shutdowns, border protection, medical care in hospitals, air traffic control, law enforcement and power grid maintenance were deemed essential and remained active during the shutdown.

Even continued services can be disrupted. During the 2018-19 shutdown, holiday travellers faced delays as many unpaid TSA staff and air traffic controllers didn’t come to work.

Administrations have a lot of leeway to define “essential” workers. During the 2013 shutdown, the Obama administration closed national parks. In 2018, the Trump administration kept many national parks open with limited services using previously paid park entrance fees to cover personnel costs; the Government Accountability Office concluded that this violated federal law.

The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed. Trump campaigned on a promise to abolish the Education Department, and his administration has shrunk the Environmental Protection Agency.

There have been four shutdowns in recent decades that lasted more than one business day, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25240548052490-1756478286.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-29 10:04:22.506760

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%.
The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock?
Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?
The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.","In case you haven't noticed, nuclear energy stocks are having a moment in 2025. Four months ago, President Trump signed a series of executive orders designed to accelerate the development of nuclear power stations and secure access to supplies of nuclear fuel in the United States.

Investors in nuclear stocks have been quick to respond to the news. Over the past 12 months, shares of start-ups developing small and micro nuclear reactor plants are on the rise. For example, names like NuScale Power and Nano Nuclear Energy are up 246% and 267%.

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%. Does it still have room to run?

Right place, right time

And what lies behind Centrus's amazing rise -- I mean, in addition to the well-timed support from the President?

Well, there's Russia's war in Ukraine, for one thing. The United States imports 99% of the uranium used in American nuclear power plants, and 27% of that comes from Russia. ""Thanks"" to the war, however, the U.S. government has passed laws banning imports of Russian-sourced uranium, effective in 2028, and that means Centrus' role as a buyer and reseller of imported uranium is only going to get more important over time.

Centrus is further cementing its centrality by developing the capacity to enrich uranium domestically, such that the U.S. won't need to import so much uranium from abroad -- even from friendly suppliers such as France's Orano or from the British-Dutch-German company Urenco.

Alongside Urenco, which operates an enrichment facility in New Mexico, Centrus is the only other company licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to produce low enriched uranium (LEU) in the U.S. (Centrus also possesses a license to produce high-assay enriched uranium, or HALEU, for next-generation nuclear reactors.)

The second part of the puzzle is the artificial intelligence revolution, which is driving up electricity demand to levels where only the rapid building of new nuclear power plants can provide the amounts of power needed. This is why everyone -- from Microsoft to Alphabet to Amazon -- has been inking electricity supply agreements with nuclear power companies lately.

It also speaks clearly to a trend of rising demand for enriched uranium fuel -- which is what Centrus aims to supply.

And yet, this is a story that's been developing for more than a year now -- ever since Constellation Energy Group (CEG 1.59%) announced last year that it would need to reopen Three Mile Island in order to provide the kind of power levels that Microsoft needs. By this point, it's hardly a secret that Centrus is sitting in the proverbial catbird's seat, and likely to profit handsomely as this new nuclear story plays out.

This is the reason Centrus stock is up 450% over the past year. The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock? I fear it may be.

Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?

Don't get me wrong -- I'm totally on board with the idea that Centrus will perform well as a business as old reactors ramp their power output, and new reactors -- including new types of small reactors from NuScale, Nano Nuclear, and others -- come online. I'll even acknowledge that Centrus is doing just fine already today.

Centrus recorded a profit of $105 million over the past 12 months -- and these are high-quality profits, resulting in the generation of $107 million in positive free cash flow. The company's balance sheet is also flush, with $400 million more cash than debt in the bank. The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.

Those valuations might be defensible if Centrus were growing rapidly today. However, most analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast relatively flat profit growth for the next several years, with earnings only really taking off in 2030 and after, once new reactor types start going online.

While it's possible the stock's valuation will prove justifiable in those years, it's also possible something will happen over the next half-decade to upset this nuclear apple cart, and make Centrus stock look less attractive than investors currently hope for.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835039/nuclear-power-plant-next-to-a-pond-glowing-red-at-sunset.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:14.617123

Africa's renewable energy potential is huge, yet nearly 600 million people still live without access to electricity. How this clean energy transition unfolds will play a big role in shaping future development, regional stability, and progress on climate change.

Investing now in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power is not just a moral and development imperative, it is also a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient. Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, the European Union is helping accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.

The €545 million package expands the EU and Team Europe's clean energy efforts in Africa, with new projects supporting electrification, modernize power grids, and improve access to renewables.

Countries with the projects announced include Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Ghana, Central Africa. Madagascar, Mozambique, and Somalia. The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign is carried out with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen and relies on the policy support of the International Energy Agency. It aims to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector and philanthropists. They are encouraged to pledge capital or provide support such as expertise and technical assistance.

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 20/25 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

The Republican Party, especially, has kind of used Charlie Kirk as a symbol to suppress free speech, whether it's late-night TV show hosts or J.D. Vance encouraging people to report people who said things.

Arkansas high school senior Ariana Minkle says they're watching teachers get fired for online comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Minkle and some of her peers host a youth podcast on community radio in Little Rock, and she says they're concerned to see political speech censored.

Michigan authorities identified the gunman, who they say rammed a pickup into a packed Mormon church and opened fire, killing two.

They haven't said what the motive of 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a Narock war vet, was.

President Donald Trump meets with congressional leaders today in a last-ditch bid to avoid a government shutdown.

Tomorrow, he plans to address an unusual gathering of high-ranking military officers.

That meeting is being described as a pep rally for the services.

Domestic violence shelters say funding cuts and confusion about policy changes will put the lives of survivors and their children at real and immediate risk.

The White House now says shelters can't use federal funds to take in undocumented migrants or offer specific protections to trans individuals.

Krista Colon leads the California partnership to end domestic violence.

If I offer a night of shelter to someone who may be undocumented, is my entire funding at risk?

If I sex an individual's pronouns, am I now going to be a target?

Funding levels have never been enough, but federal funding is a cornerstone for programs nationwide.

Tomorrow is the last day to qualify for federal tax credits of up to $7,500 on new electric vehicles, ended in the Republican budget mega-bill.

Critics argue that will undermine clean energy jobs, but Ohio GOP Senator Bernie Marino says the government shouldn't be picking car market winners and losers. - That's not about what kind of car I like or I don't like.

What it's about is letting the marketplace choose.

So get rid of all the incentives, get rid of all the mandates. - Advocates for seniors are warning about the phase out of paper Social Security checks that starts tomorrow.

More than half a million Americans will be forced to use direct deposit or prepaid debit cards.

Maria Friess with the National Committee to preserve Social Security and Medicare says that could be tough for some rural and low-income seniors.

""They may or may not read the material that comes in with their checks.

They may or may not understand the material.

And they may not have any idea that this is coming.""

The administration says it'll improve security.

Critics argue it risks payment delays for folks without bank accounts and gives a windfall to some payment companies.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended his re-election campaign amid extensive accusations of corruption.

Adams was running far behind Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani.

Weiss commented, “After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC [investment tax credit].
There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.” The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well.
California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.
The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.","The United States had a record quarter for battery energy storage deployment from April to June, adding 5.6 GW of installations, according to a report released by the ACP and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage led the way, adding 4.9 GW in the quarter and growing 62% year-over-year. This is enough to power 3.7 million US homes during average peak-demand hours, said the ACP.

California, Texas, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of storage in the quarter, said the report. Wood Mackenzie forecast that Florida and Georgia will be major growth markets, ahead, due to aggressive procurement by vertically integrated utilities. For example, Georgia Power just issued a request for proposals for 500 MW of grid-scale storage.

However, supply challenges may hamper utility-scale growth, said Allison Weis, global head of storage at Wood Mackenzie. Weiss commented, “After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC [investment tax credit]. While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more-certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.”

The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well. It added 608 MW in the quarter, representing a 132% increase year-on-year. Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Batteries are included at an increased rate in quoted residential solar projects, said a report from EnergySage. Outside of Hawaii, which has a 100% battery attachment rate, California led the way among top-10 solar state markets, with 79% of quoted projects including batteries. This was followed by Texas (61%), Arizona (47%), Utah (44%), Florida (43%), and Illinois (25%).

“Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

The community-scale, commercial and industrial segment expanded 11% in Q2, adding 38 MW. California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.

The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.

However, the report warns US utility-scale storage installations could drop 10%, year-over-year, in 2027, largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern regulations on battery cell sourcing.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BESS.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:42.228073

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Therefore, accelerating renewable energy integration in the power system and electrification of the transport and industry sectors are crucial.
Currently, global markets demand products with smaller carbon footprints, while data centres and electric vehicles (EVs) seek clean electricity.
Notably, this policy applies exclusively to data centres, reflecting the government’s strong commitment to supporting the industry’s growth.
By advancing its energy transition, Thailand can gain a competitive edge in attracting clean investment for data centres.","Thailand updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2022, in which it committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 30% below a business-as-usual level, which is about 388 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), by 2030. With adequate international support, Thailand will aim for a 40% reduction, or 333 MtCO2. To meet carbon neutrality by 2050, Thailand will need to reduce its GHG emissions by 73-83% compared to 2015 levels.

Given that the energy sector accounted for about 69% of total emissions in 2019, decarbonising it will be indispensable to cut emissions. Within the energy sector, the power and transport sectors took up to 68% of total emissions in 2022. Therefore, accelerating renewable energy integration in the power system and electrification of the transport and industry sectors are crucial.

The draft RPDP sets ambitious emission reduction targets for the power sector, which reduce CO2 emissions by 18% in 2030 and 38% in 2037, compared to the previous plan. Under this pathway, emissions are projected to fall from 95.5 to 77.7 MtCO2 in 2030, and from 99.7 to 61.8 MtCO2 in 2037.

Achieving these targets will be particularly important given the country’s export-oriented manufacturing strategy, rising demand from data centres and EV adoption. Currently, global markets demand products with smaller carbon footprints, while data centres and electric vehicles (EVs) seek clean electricity. Aligning with international governance frameworks is imperative to maintaining Thailand’s global competitiveness in this era of growth.

Thailand is positioning itself as a regional green manufacturing hub, with a strong focus on electric vehicles. Under its 30@30 policy, unveiled in 2021, the government aims for zero-emission vehicles to make up at least 30% of total auto production by 2030. That target could drive exponential growth in EV adoption over the coming years.

The country is on the right track to promote a rapid EV adoption, which will help attract foreign investment, build new skills, and leverage its long-standing auto industry expertise. But, to fully realise the climate benefits of transport electrification, the power system must evolve in parallel with EV adoption, ensuring that clean energy supplies the rising demand for charging.

According to the RPDP, EVs are likely to account for about 68 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity demand by 2037, or roughly 20% of total consumption. The plan also assumes a 40% reduction in peak demand from EV charging through demand-response incentives and vehicle-to-grid integration. Ember’s analysis suggests the projection underestimates the real impact. Adjusting to a more realistic scenario, with peak demand rising to 50% of the normal peak pattern starting in 2026, the forecast adds an extra 3,355 megawatts (MW) above the RPDP baseline – lifting total peak demand to 57,901 MW by 2037.

The EV boom presents a double-edged sword: it risks straining the grid while accelerating the decarbonisation of road transport. Ensuring that clean energy powers EV charging will be crucial.

Thailand is looking to create a booming market for data centres, which is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7.5%-8.5% between 2025 and 2027 due to rising internet and digital payment usage, widespread cloud adoption, and AI integration across sectors.

The country’s “Cloud First” policy is a government initiative to speed up cloud computing adoption in both public and private sectors. The favourable policy has, so far, attracted $2.8 billion from major investors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, TikTok, Huawei, ST Telemedia and NTT. Google also announced a $1 billion investment in data centres last year to meet growing cloud demand and support AI adoption in ASEAN. The country also benefits from strategic connectivity to China and India, alongside growing links to other markets through an expanding submarine cable network.

Thailand’s electricity demand for data centres is forecast to grow at 8% CAGR from 2025 to 2027 and reach 6 TWh by 2030, or 2.2 % of total electricity demand. Our cost-optimal pathway factors this additional demand from data centres with the assumption of the growth rate to remain constant throughout the whole timeframe, adding about 10 TWh of electricity demand in 2037.

To ensure clean energy meets this demand, in late 2024, the Thai government approved a direct power purchase pilot project. This enables investors in data centres of at least 50 MW to purchase electricity directly from renewable energy generators under a direct power purchase agreement (DPPA). The total procurement capacity of the Pilot Project is expected to be 2,000 MW.

For the first time in the country, the single-buyer system is being relaxed to ease the monopoly over electricity trading and transmission access. Notably, this policy applies exclusively to data centres, reflecting the government’s strong commitment to supporting the industry’s growth.

This incentive paves the way for hyperscale data centre companies to invest in Thailand, as many have pledged to 100% use of renewable energy in data centres. For instance, Microsoft is committed to having 100% of its electricity consumption matched hourly by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030, Amazon set a goal to supply all of the electricity consumed with 100% renewable energy by 2030, but already achieved it 7 years earlier. Google’s next major target is to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

Malaysia and Indonesia are considering adding more gas capacity or delaying fossil fuel phase-outs to meet rising data centre demand – an approach that runs counter to the renewable energy commitments of major data centre investors. By advancing its energy transition, Thailand can gain a competitive edge in attracting clean investment for data centres.

“85% of our protected habitats are now considered to have an unfavourable status, while one third of our protected species have received the same label – horrifically, over half of native plant species are in decline and more than 50 bird species are of high conservation concern.

“We cannot afford to lose any more species than we already have – the knock-on effect of biodiversity loss is catastrophic for all facets of life.

“Today, I’m visiting the site of August’s fish kill in the River Blackwater, County Cork, where up to 42,000 fish died as a result of an unknown pollutant – this event is emblematic of the government’s approach towards environmental protection.

“Last week, a multi-agency report said the cause of the fish kill cannot be identified – I’m meeting local anglers today to assess the effects of the kill on the local community.

“Meanwhile, Ireland’s nitrate derogation has resulted in the nitrate levels in our rivers jumping by a staggering 16 percent in the first six months of this year – this is disastrous for our water quality and biodiversity.

“Despite our awareness of this issue, the government refuses to plan for any alternative future without the derogation, leaving farmers and rural communities in complete uncertainty.

“Ireland’s transition from a linear to a circular economy has never been taken seriously by the State – our plastic recycling rates, for example, are shockingly low at 30%, lagging behind the EU target of 50% – this is a direct result of poor policy decisions, a lack of enforcement, and chronic underfunding.

“It is the opinion of the Environmental Protection Agency that it is already too late for us to meet our 2025 EU recycling targets – lessons must be learned from these failings.

“Environmental policy must be front-footed to preserve nature in Ireland – Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been playing catch-up for years now, allowing the health of our countryside and waterways to degrade at an alarming rate.

“The government must comply with the EEA’s report and introduce urgent, large-scale measures that go beyond the weak plans and policies that have left us in this mess.

“The average EU spending per country on environmental protection measures in the last five years was 2.2% of GDP, but Ireland’s expenditure was just 0.9% – Budget ‘26 must allocate greater funding towards environmental initiatives to ensure this disaster does not become irreversible.

Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.
Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.
“More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.” Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation.
Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill.","“For nine months, we watched this Administration and congressional Republicans do everything to stifle clean energy, and clean energy is the fastest growing and the cheapest source of electricity,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.

“Republicans are blocking the only sources of energy that can be built fast enough to meet growing demand and cheaply enough to actually keep energy bills in check,” he added, pointing to expiring clean energy tax credits.

Following the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Democrats not only leaned into the cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicaid, but have also highlighted the GOP’s aggressive phasing out of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Trump’s multitrillion-dollar spending plan extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The massive piece of legislation, passed through a process called reconciliation, not only extends the lower individual tax rates that were part of the 2017 law but also makes them permanent.

The cost of electricity has continued to soar for most Americans and is shaping up to be a campaign issue for the 2025 and 2026 elections. In the New Jersey governor’s election this November, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Republican Jack Ciattarelli have both shifted their focus as electricity bills are at the top of voters’ minds in the state.

“Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills,” said Sherrill in her first TV ad of the general election.

Ciattarelli pledged to “lower electricity bills” in a campaign ad and has worked to tie Sherrill to the current Democratic governor on electricity prices as he looks to an “all of the above approach.”

The New Jersey gubernatorial race is not the only place where energy prices are being made a center point. Just this week, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) announced a rebate program for utility bill payments as part of his latest effort to lower energy costs for Marylanders. He’s up for reelection in 2026.

Levin and Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.

Levin said his legislation is a direct result of concerns brought to him by his constituents.

“I think there’s a great deal of frustration that you have people in my district and districts all across the country who are really struggling to make ends meet, costs are very high across the board, and electricity bills are going up and up and up, and others that want to do energy efficiency upgrades are finding those upgrades to be extremely expensive without these credits,” Levin told the Washington Examiner.

Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.

“Americans want lower costs, and rising energy bills will be a regular, unavoidable reminder to voters that House Republicans have failed miserably at fulfilling their central campaign promise,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Viet Shelton told the Washington Examiner. “Broken promises and working families facing bigger and bigger bills because of the Big, Ugly Law — these will be the leading reasons Republicans will lose their majority next year.”

Rep. Josh Riley (D-NY) has also been highlighting high electricity prices. He introduced the Keep the Lights Local Act, which aims to cut costs.

“Utility bills in Upstate New York haven’t been this high in a decade,” Riley wrote on social media. “More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.”

Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation. For the year ending in August, electricity shot up 6.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

The Trump administration has blamed Biden-era green energy initiatives and the accelerated phaseout of traditional fossil fuels such as coal. Trump called increased reliance on wind and solar energy production “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner in August, Energy Secretary Chris Wright backed up Trump’s assessment.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it,” Wright said. “The president’s 100% correct in that.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is seeking to hold or flip House seats in New York and California, said higher utility rates are the result of blue state leadership.

“Utility rates in blue states are the direct result of the failed leadership, misplaced priorities, reckless spending, and radical policies of governors like [Gavin] Newsom and [Kathy] Hochul,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told the Washington Examiner. “No false attack changes the fact that liberal wish lists in Albany and Sacramento have driven up prices for their constituents while Republicans are left cleaning up their mess.”

A September analysis by Inside Climate News found the average household price of electricity in the United States rose by 9.5% this year, with the highest spikes found in Missouri (38.3% increase), North Dakota (33.6%), New Jersey (28.6%), Iowa (27.5%), and Montana (25.3%)

The blame game comes as the cost of living is a persistent issue for voters across the nation, specifically, concerns about the rising cost of energy.

According to left-wing think tank Data for Progress, 60% of voters reported paying more for electric bills than last year. A PowerLines poll conducted with Ipsos shows that “three out of four Americans, across party lines, say they are worried about rising utility bills.” The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

HALEY STEVENS TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST RFK JR.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power. EIA data compiled by American Clean Power show that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year than the national average (a roughly 2.5% increase).

Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill. From the onset, Democrats labeled the bill the “big, ugly law,” as they held hundreds of events across the country to say that Medicaid cost savings would kick millions of people off their healthcare. Democrats plan to stick to their plan of slamming the bill, even though the tightening of Medicaid eligibility won’t kick in until after the 2026 elections.

Among the emerging technologies, lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) batteries are drawing growing attention as a next-generation solution. Forecasts indicate that the LMFP market will expand from USD 1.85 billion in 2025 to USD 6.79 billion by 2034, advancing at a robust CAGR of 15.55 percent. This surge is being fueled by the automotive sector’s demand for high-quality batteries, accelerating investments in battery manufacturing, and government support for energy infrastructure worldwide.

LMFP batteries represent a significant step forward in battery technology. By introducing manganese to the traditional lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, these batteries achieve improved energy density and extended performance. Available in prismatic, cylindrical, and pouch formats, LMFP batteries are versatile enough to serve passenger and commercial electric vehicles, energy storage systems, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Their combination of safety, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability is driving adoption across multiple industries.

In 2025, Asia-Pacific dominated the market, reflecting its leadership in both electric vehicle adoption and battery manufacturing. China, in particular, continues to play a decisive role, supported by abundant raw material resources, rapid expansion of lithium mining, and a robust ecosystem of manufacturers including BYD, CALB, and CATL. The region’s influence was highlighted by BYD’s launch of its second-generation LMFP blade battery in 2024, designed to enhance the driving range of light-duty vehicles. Looking ahead, Europe is set to record the fastest growth rate. Countries such as Germany, France, and Italy are ramping up production of commercial EVs and supporting domestic battery manufacturing through major government-backed initiatives. The recent announcement by Verkor to establish a new battery plant in Dunkirk underlines the region’s determination to compete globally.

The automotive sector remains the cornerstone of LMFP battery demand. Electric vehicles account for the largest share of adoption, as carmakers increasingly rely on LMFP chemistry to extend driving range and improve performance without compromising on safety. At the same time, the energy storage sector is rapidly emerging as a major growth driver. Utilities and grid operators are turning to LMFP batteries for backup power and load balancing, recognizing their reliability in managing fluctuating renewable energy supply. This dual role in both mobility and energy infrastructure positions LMFP batteries as a critical enabler of a more sustainable future.

From a technological perspective, the market reflects both tradition and innovation. Conventional cathode synthesis methods continue to dominate due to their scalability and cost efficiency. However, nano-engineered cathodes and advanced coating technologies are quickly gaining traction, offering superior energy density and improved cycle life. These advancements are supported by a wave of partnerships between battery manufacturers and automotive brands, as companies seek to design solutions tailored for next-generation vehicles and heavy-duty applications such as electric buses and trucks.

Form factor is another area of evolution. Prismatic batteries currently lead the market thanks to their space efficiency, long cycle life, and durability. Their use in electric and hybrid vehicles as well as large-scale energy storage systems has cemented their position. Yet pouch batteries are on the rise, especially in consumer electronics and mobility applications, where their lightweight, flexible design and cost-effectiveness make them attractive. With rising investments in new pouch cell manufacturing plants, this segment is expected to accelerate quickly.

Government support remains a critical factor in shaping the industry’s trajectory. Countries across Asia, Europe, and North America are investing billions to strengthen their battery manufacturing capacity, secure raw material supplies, and promote clean energy technologies. For instance, the UK announced a USD 621 million investment in 2025 to bolster its domestic battery sector, while India and China continue to expand incentives for EV adoption and local battery production. These initiatives not only reduce reliance on imports but also ensure that local industries can compete on the global stage.

The distribution landscape reflects this momentum. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dominate sales channels, as automakers prefer to secure batteries directly from trusted partners, ensuring quality and after-sales support. At the same time, the aftermarket is becoming increasingly important, offering replacement and low-cost solutions for consumers and smaller businesses. The rise of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart as distributors of LMFP batteries further illustrates how diversified the sales ecosystem has become.

Challenges remain, particularly around scaling up production and balancing costs with performance. Yet the pace of innovation and investment suggests that LMFP batteries are set to move from niche to mainstream far faster than earlier technologies. Their unique blend of safety, affordability, and energy performance positions them as a compelling alternative in a market hungry for solutions that can support both mobility and energy storage needs.

As the world accelerates toward electrification, LMFP batteries are poised to play a defining role. They embody the convergence of science, industry, and policy, standing at the intersection of consumer demand for greener mobility and society’s broader push toward sustainable energy.

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, September 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Argent LNG, a leading developer of low-carbon LNG infrastructure, is thrilled to announce that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has officially accepted its 25 million tonnes per annum (MMtpa) LNG export terminal at Port Fourchon, Louisiana, into the pre-filing process under Docket No. PF25-11.

Following the submission of the readiness letter on September 2, 2025, and FERC’s subsequent confirmation, this milestone accelerates Argent LNG’s path toward construction and operation, positioning the project to deliver reliable U.S. energy to global markets by 2030.

The FERC pre-filing process, under Docket No. PF25-11, initiates formal collaboration with FERC, federal and state agencies, local regulators, and community stakeholders. This phase enables early environmental reviews, engineering advancements, permitting coordination, and transparent engagement to ensure the project upholds the highest standards of safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility.

“Our acceptance into the FERC pre-filing process under Docket No. PF25-11 is a pivotal step toward realizing Argent LNG’s vision as a premier global LNG supplier,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman and CEO of Argent LNG. “Designed for speed, efficiency, and performance, this project leverages modular technology and partnerships with industry leaders like Baker Hughes, Honeywell UOP, ABB, and GTT to strengthen U.S. energy security while creating significant economic opportunities for Louisiana.”

Located on a 900-acre site under a 90-year lease at Port Fourchon, the terminal benefits from uncongested deepwater access, proximity to low-nitrogen feed-gas pipelines, and the port’s resilient energy infrastructure. Once operational, Argent LNG will be among North America’s largest and most competitive LNG export facilities, supplying cost-effective American natural gas to key markets in Europe, Africa, South Asia, and South America.

“Port Fourchon is the heart of America’s offshore energy industry, and Argent LNG’s project under Docket No. PF25-11 marks a transformative step forward,” said Chett Chiasson, Executive Director of Port Fourchon. “With our deepwater access, robust infrastructure, and skilled workforce, this project will position Fourchon as a global LNG export hub, driving economic growth and innovation in our region.”

Argent LNG’s hybrid model combines Baker Hughes modular construction with proven technology from Honeywell UOP, ABB and GTT, to minimize timelines, costs, and environmental impacts, setting a new standard for U.S. LNG development.

The DOE report was written by five contrarian researchers whose work has long been perceived as being outside the vast body of climate science, which has shown for years that the burning of fossil fuels is driving global temperatures higher.

Since the report’s release, there has been push back from the science community about how the report’s assertions conflict with decades of research and hundreds of studies. Among the critics are dozens of researchers whose work was cited by the DOE authors, and a new assessment by the National Academies that directly contradicts the government’s assertions by showing how greenhouse gases are endangering human health.

On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the report’s findings were taken straight from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other comprehensive climate reports written by hundreds of scientists, but “just in a format that’s easier or accessible, easier for people to read.”

“There’s nothing different in the science in our report and the science in the IPCC reports or even in the National Academy report,” Wright said at an event hosted by The New York Times during Climate Week in New York. “If you’re honest and sober about climate change, to politicians, to the media, that’s a bit of a threat. It kind of gets in the way of a political movement.”

In fact, there is a major delta between the DOE report and mainstream climate scientists.

Indeed, failure to land a deal on a stopgap funding measure before Wednesday would force a shutdown with sweeping implications for federal programs.

It would trigger lapses in authorizations for myriad energy and environment programs, halt most agency work, restrict disaster relief during hurricane season and prompt the White House to carry out its threat to permanently lay off thousands of federal workers.

Before last week’s recess, Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic funding proposal that would have extended government funding while adding more than $1 trillion in new health care spending and imposing guardrails on the White House’s spending moves.

Then, Senate Democrats blocked passage of Republicans’ “clean” funding extension, which had already passed out of the House. Democrats balked at the bill because it did not include their priorities and was not the result of bipartisan negotiations.

This week, Congress may look to pick up where the Senate left off. Thune is expected to put the Republican continuing resolution up for a vote again and dare Democrats to oppose it a second time before the funding deadline.

“The president wants to talk with [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)] about that and say, ‘Don’t do that,’” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Sunday.

House and Senate leaders doubled down on their party’s negotiating stances in television interviews Sunday, appearing to leave little room for compromise. Republican and Democratic leaders have been preemptively blaming each other for the potential funding lapse.

While they welcomed the meeting with Trump, Democrats expressed skepticism that it could be fruitful. A similar meeting between Trump and Democratic leaders in 2018 quickly spiraled out of control.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” Schumer said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation.”

House Republicans are holding a conference-wide call Monday morning, according to POLITICO, and House Democrats have plans to meet on their own Monday evening in Washington. Jeffries has called on Democrats to be on Capitol Hill this week even though Johnson canceled votes.

House GOP leaders have discussed potentially not bringing the House back into session at all this week if there is a shutdown Wednesday, POLITICO reported.

Jeffries said in a “dear colleague” letter last week that “Democrats will be in town and prepared to get the job done.”

Knapton H2 Storage is a consortium led by gas distributor Northern Gas Networks and partnered with BGS, Centrica Energy Storage+, Third Energy Onshore and the University of Edinburgh. The consortium has been awarded ‘Discovery’ funding by Ofgem’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) to undertake a new study to evaluate geological storage potential in the Knapton area, North Yorkshire. The Ofgem SIF funding is designed to drive innovation in energy networks as part of the ‘Revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs’ (RIIO-2) price control for gas and electricity networks.

Energy storage and backup power will become increasingly important as the UK increases the amount of renewable energy supplying electricity. This study is the first of its kind in the region and will undertake a feasibility assessment of the area’s geology to host energy storage technologies, allowing for the decarbonisation of adjacent gas-fired peaking power plants (those that only run when there is high demand) such as that at Knapton.

The Knapton, Vale of Pickering and North Yorkshire area hosts a fantastic diversity of geology that may be used for storing hydrogen. The region contains numerous depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs that may have potential for repurposing, alongside other porous rock aquifers, salt deposits and rocks that may support lined rock shafts. The study will generate an understanding of what is possible for hydrogen storage at scale in the local area, supporting the area’s local economy and the UK’s energy security.

Keith Owen, Head of Energy Futures at Northern Gas Networks said: As more renewables come online, energy storage will be critical to UK energy security and to clean power. Understanding the full potential for storing hydrogen at scale through Knapton H2 Storage will give us key insights into how we can deliver technologies to provide clean resilience on the days where the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.

Chris McClane, Energy Transition Interface Manager at Centrica said: “Centrica’s Knapton site is being redeveloped as a clean energy hub for solar generation, green hydrogen production, and battery storage. We’re also exploring hydrogen storage as it offers a reliable, flexible solution to support the energy system of the future that will require diverse fuel supplies ready for when the sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t blow. This project will advance the readiness of hydrogen storage technologies by unlocking a replica model to realise its potential at scale to supply hydrogen-to-power generation.”

Edward Hough, Research lead, Underground Energy Storage at the British Geological Survey said: “The natural geology of the area around Knapton will play an important role in supporting the use of hydrogen in the region. Storing hydrogen gives flexibility to the energy system, allowing excess hydrogen to be stored for use during periods when demand exceeds supply. In this project, BGS will build on its extensive laboratory and mapping programmes to help identify areas of the underground geology that may represent future exploration targets for hydrogen storage in bedrock.”

The federal government had come a long way from the heckuva-job-Brownie days of George W. Bush and Michael Brown, the unqualified head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who mangled the Hurricane Katrina disaster response in New Orleans and on the Gulf Coast.

Yet 20 years and another unqualified FEMA leader later, despite reforms intended to guard against future agency heads joking (or not) about the hurricane season, America’s disaster response has devolved into something more akin to the pre-FEMA era’s improvisions. After two decades of major disasters in the 1960s and ’70s like the Hilo, Hawaii, tsunami, the Alaska earthquake (the worst in American history), and major hurricanes including Agnes, the National Governors Association called for a reorganization of the country’s decentralized emergency preparedness and disaster response systems in 1977. FEMA debuted two years later.

The Trump administration’s zeal to stamp out a flawed but essential agency has been interrupted by the mind-numbing display of bureaucratic micromanaging: the federal response to the Central Texas flash floods in July that killed 135 people, among them children vacationing in summer camps. “As sad as that is, unfortunately, that is typically what moves the needle in terms of disaster policy throughout history,” says Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “It’s not the data forecasting what’s going to happen. It’s the lives lost when it does happen—and this happened in a red state.”

The requirement that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sign off on agency expenses above $100,000 compromised FEMA disaster hotline availability and search and rescue missions so severely that FEMA’s head of urban search and rescue resigned in frustration.

None of those facts made it into an August DHS press release that offered an upbeat, wholly unsubstantiated perspective on the agency, declaring that after 200 days, “FEMA is 100% faster in getting boots-on-the-ground to respond to disasters.” Nim Kidd, the head of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, claimed, “I’ve been doing this for more than 30 years, and I can say with confidence that this was the fastest and most effective federal support Texas has ever received.”

Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order that “empowers State, local, and individual preparedness and injects common sense into infrastructure prioritization and strategic investments through risk-informed decisions that make our infrastructure, communities, and economy resilient to global and dynamic threats and hazards.” An administration “review council” will consider what comes next for the emasculated agency, with a final report due in November.

Only the federal government can come up with billions of dollars in the direst catastrophes.

But common sense isn’t so common. Only the federal government can come up with the billions of dollars and assets to backstop the 50 states, local governments, territories, and tribal lands in the direst catastrophes. In an era when storms and wildfires are more frequent, stronger, and more expensive to respond to and recover from, shifting more of that burden onto states and localities after a jumble of executive orders, layoffs, firings, and delaying or withholding funds displays an obsession with cost-cutting by any means necessary and no concern with the ability of states to deal with catastrophes.

One long-held fallacy that cratered FEMA’s public image is the misguided belief that the federal government parachutes in with fists full of dollars to backstop local efforts as soon as the rains end or the last embers flicker out. It’s led to “Where’s FEMA?” outbursts by angry, despondent survivors who aren’t aware of officials scrambling, or have been taken in by mis/disinformation that compounds their agonies.

After a disaster, local and state officials are the first ones on the ground in many cases, not FEMA. The amount of financial assistance that a community might receive depends on the scope of devastation. A small storm or fire that affects few properties, with no loss of life, particularly in areas that are susceptible to severe storms and wildfires, is usually handled by municipalities and states.

Even broader damage might still not reach the federal threshold for a disaster declaration. The federal government has been selective in how it responds. The National Emergency Management Association reports that in fiscal year 2023 there were nearly 25,000 disasters in the United States; of those, only 60 received a federal disaster declaration.

Under the 1988 Stafford Act, the president approves major disaster declarations for cataclysmic situations that are beyond the capabilities of local and state officials, and emergency declarations for smaller upheavals where federal assistance can help stave off more serious consequences.

“The issue that it often comes down to is who is going to pay for those resources?” says Samantha Montano, a Massachusetts Maritime Academy associate professor of emergency management. “That’s why that declaration is so important, because it comes with money.”

FEMA has historically paid most of the costs for major disasters. Urging states to improve how they gear up for seasonal upheavals like tornadoes, hurricanes, and wildfires is not new. Having states budget for disasters as they might for education or health care has had support from Democrats and Republicans. One such proposal, a state disaster deductible proposed by Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator during the Obama years, evaporated under the first Trump administration.

But swerving from dependence on Washington after a catastrophe to deep budget cuts and homegrown self-reliance in just a few months produced the horror show that played out on the ground in Texas Hill Country.

PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A MAJOR DISASTER declaration for North Carolina after Tropical Storm Helene on September 28, 2024. The day before, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) approved the deployment of an eight-member volunteer urban search and rescue team to assist local officials in western North Carolina under the auspices of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). The mayor of Norwalk agreed to send a volunteer from the city’s fire department, a hazmat command and communications unit, along with a fire department utility truck and an ATV for the mission.

EMAC, a national mutual aid framework overseen by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), provides disaster relief in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, with people and equipment, but not funding. States providing assistance can seek reimbursement or send aid at no cost to a receiving state; but that is not linked to a state’s request for a federal declaration or funding. Connecticut and the other New England states also have reciprocal disaster assistance relationships with Canada’s eastern provinces through the International Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

With fewer natural disasters, Connecticut sends more assistance than it receives. “When we put in a bid to help another state, we up front say this is what it’s going to cost, so we know what resources are going to get reimbursed if we send them,” says William Turner, the state’s emergency management director. “[EMAC] is really the mechanism that allows all of us to respond and recover before we have to get FEMA pulled in. We’ve got that piece pretty well figured out. We just need to understand where FEMA is going to end up when the dust settles.”

In New Orleans, local residents have stepped into the city’s disaster preparedness void.

EMAC isn’t safe from a disintegrating FEMA. The mutual aid system runs exclusively on National Incident Management System funding provided through DHS and FEMA. However, in early September, FEMA failed to sign off on EMAC’s annual $2 million grant. Lynn Budd, NEMA’s president, told the national news outlet NOTUS that the episode “certainly flies in the face of the idea that states need to take on more responsibility.” The system finally received its monies, but this snafu raises critical questions about how EMAC can remain effective and navigate the volatile federal environment.

“EMAC works well, as long as there is trust and security among the states that there is going to be funding to pay for those resources,” Montano says. “Once you lose assurance that there is going to be funding for those resources, that can break apart very quickly, not because other states don’t want to help each other, but because the funding isn’t there to do it.”

Before Helene, North Carolina was fairly well off, with a healthy $5 billion in its reserve fund for disasters. Today, about $1 billion has gone to disaster relief, with that account now down to about $3.5 billion. State officials have estimated the total cost of Helene at $60 billion. The proposed state budget for fiscal year 2026 is nearly $34 billion. FEMA has reimbursed about $1 billion.

Trying to work around bureaucratic inertia can backfire. Henderson County in western North Carolina decided not to wait for FEMA funds for debris removal and spent $20 million up front, thinking that the federal payout would be speedier. Across the border, Tennessee took another tack, setting up a Helene Emergency Assistance Loan Program. The $100 million loan fund provides no-interest loans to eligible counties for hauling debris, as well as water and wastewater infrastructure repairs.

Even wealthy states that see frequent natural disasters don’t have the fiscal wherewithal to absorb the multibillions of a major catastrophe. Florida relies heavily on the federal government for response assistance and dollars. In the wildfire sector, California and Washington have devised budgetary formulas based on past disaster costs to allocate funds to disaster accounts. Montana moves a portion of excess general funds once every two years into a wildfire suppression fund. But though those steps have to be taken, particularly now, they don’t deliver enough money.

For some states, moving from “what if” to the “when” in state disaster budgeting is a radical paradigm shift. Historically less-prepared states have had to step up recovery and resilience programs. After several years of federal disaster declarations, an extreme rainfall event in 2015, and Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018, South Carolina created an office of resilience. Focusing on coastal and riverine areas, the state encourages strategies to manage waterways and mitigate flooding across communities, recognizing that if a downstream area has strong building codes, storm plans, and public awareness of risks, those efforts may not matter much if an upstream town doesn’t make comparable investments.

Being proactive is critical, says Peter Muller of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Managing Fiscal Risks project. “They’re trying to put money aside for costs they know they’re going to have, officially, before it happens, so that you don’t have to go and suddenly scramble and pull money from other priorities when a disaster does happen.”

Local residents also have stepped in to fill disaster preparedness gaps. Imagine Water Works, a New Orleans climate and disaster relief group, set up community power stations in neighborhoods after Hurricane Zeta in 2020, when three hurricanes and two tropical storms hit the state, the most in any calendar year. Residents were able to charge devices at homes and businesses that still had or regained power.

With the pandemic raging, residents were also able to pick up hand sanitizer, masks, and other COVID-19 supplies. The group asked fire stations to host charging stations and help people get oxygen for medical devices. They reached out to the city again the following year, and by the third year New Orleans officials began to duplicate their efforts. Fire stations also offer cooling facilities now.

With a robust network of indigenous and LGBTQ people, the group also has locations in Houma and southwest Louisiana as well as other local groups across the Deep South. “My relationship is very good with government. Folks who work in that space will contact me directly and ask for help spreading messages to folks, and we have a large social media presence, and we’re trusted,” says Klie Kliebert, the group’s executive director.

TO MARK THE KATRINA ANNIVERSARY, a group of past and present FEMA employees demanded that Congress wake up to the threat posed by dumping the agency leadership reforms that came out of the 2005 debacle. Some employees were suspended. Restoring FEMA’s independence has support in Congress, but saving FEMA, much less any of the dozens of vital agencies that have been rocketed into oblivion by the Trump administration, hasn’t prioritized faster action.

President Trump’s assault on disaster assistance has had one unifying effect, ginning up varying degrees of outrage and disbelief from every corner of the country. In the short term at least, there’s been the faintest glimmer of off-camera comity between Texas and California, two of the most disaster-prone states in the country, despite the cold civil war over redistricting: In mid-July, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sent a three-member human remains detection team to Texas, which boosted urban search and rescue personnel in Texas to 42 people.

Twenty states have sued FEMA and DHS to restore funding that had already been allocated under incentivized mitigation programs like Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), enacted under the first Trump administration. This second time around, FEMA canceled BRIC. A federal judge ordered the White House to halt any reallocation of $4 billion in BRIC funds.

2025 has been a quiet season on the hurricane front—so far. Escaping the threat posed by Hurricane Erin, which steered off into the open Atlantic away from coasts, appears to have dampened any urgency in Washington surrounding this mess. What happens next will signal whether the states can hang together and demand an end to whims disguised as policy or whether federalism is as moribund as the rest of America’s democratic systems. It may take another massive calamity to field-test that proposition.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23597/download/OCT25%20Gurley.jpg?cb=e58d652a1a0ea9dd369144bbb979e0ec&w=1024,N,,2025-09-29 06:57:55.146929

Bridging the gap with fuel cells Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand.
By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.","The power industry is at the center of America’s economic growth story. Access to power has become a decisive factor in economic growth. For data centers, manufacturers and other large-load customers, the grid is now a gating factor in site selection for new facilities - and they can’t wait for years for infrastructure to catch up. With interconnection queues stretching upwards of five years in parts of the country, utilities must adopt new and agile strategies that deliver power on accelerated timelines.

Fuel cells offer a flexible and responsive approach to meeting electricity demand that is growing at rates not seen since the 1950s. Their modular design allows for rapid deployment close to the load, helping utilities address immediate capacity needs and support large customers.

By integrating fuel cells into their strategy, utilities can bridge power gaps and position themselves to capture new growth, rather than risk losing business opportunities because new prospective customers have to migrate to regions with more accessible electricity.

Power that keeps pace with demand

For utilities, the challenge isn’t just adding capacity — it’s adding it fast enough to keep pace with customers. Failure to deliver on accelerated timelines can mean losing major customers, and the economic development they bring, to other regions.

“The market has flipped in just a few years,” said Scott Dayer, director of utility and IPP origination at Bloom Energy. “Electrification was already accelerating, and now compute demand is surging on top of that. Together, they’ve turned a system that for years had surplus into one where the real challenge is adding capacity fast enough to keep up with large, hard-to-forecast loads.”

Fuel cells give utilities a way to meet that need without waiting for new transmission lines, substations or conventional generation. They are also a faster alternative to constructing traditional forms of colocated generation like gas engines and turbines, where a customer installs and manages its own onsite power.

Bloom Energy, for example, can deliver up to 50MW in as little as 90 days. With 1 GW of annual production capacity today and 2 GW expected by the end of 2026, Bloom can support utilities in bringing hundreds of MW online in under six months.

For utilities, this capability provides a critical bridge. Fuel cells can serve large-load customers immediately while infrastructure upgrades progress. Plus, unlike gas turbines or reciprocating engines, fuel cells operate quietly, have a smaller footprint and carry a significantly lower emissions profile, making permitting easier and deployments more acceptable to neighboring communities.Crucially, fuel cells deliver firm 24/7 power, ensuring utilities can reliably meet customer demand as projects come online.

Power that scales with demand

Fuel cells offer scalable power that can be deployed at customer sites or at distribution substations, giving utilities maximum flexibility to match load growth over time. For example, Bloom’s skid-mounted “copy-and-paste” modular architecture enables rapid deployment at any scale — from hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts — without introducing scaling risk.

This flexibility is especially valuable for large-load customers such as colocation data centers, where demand can expand quickly as new tenants move in after construction is complete. The compact, skid-mounted design of fuel cell systems allows utilities to scale power efficiently. For example, a 20,000-square-foot ground mount can provide 30 MW of power. The same footprint, with a four-unit-tall install configuration, can deliver 100 MW.

Case in Point: AEP Delivers for AWS with Bloom Fuel Cells

American Electric Power (AEP) will be utilizing Bloom Energy Server systems to provide immediate, reliable power to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cologix data centers in Central Ohio. The fuel cells will enable the customer to begin operations quickly while AEP continues to permit and build out traditional transmission solutions over a multi-year timeline. Under these long-term agreements, the customers cover the full project costs, protecting utility ratepayers and ensuring the region retains economic development that might otherwise migrate elsewhere.

Beyond scaling capacity, fuel cells also provide operational flexibility. They can integrate with microgrids, distributed energy resources (DERs) or other grid assets, allowing utilities to optimize energy delivery, improve resilience and respond to shifting demand patterns in real time.

Power that moves with demand

One of the unique advantages of fuel cells is their mobility. Mounted on skids, crews can relocate them after infrastructure upgrades are complete, allowing utilities to optimize deployment as demand shifts. “Equipment can be redeployed as transmission constraints change, so utilities maintain flexibility and avoid overcommitting to one location or site,” Dayer said.

This modular design enables rapid redeployment to meet evolving load requirements, allowing utilities to position capacity where it’s needed most and respond to changing market dynamics efficiently.

Bridging the gap with fuel cells

Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand. Bloom Energy’s Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Energy Server® power systems can be deployed behind or in front of the meter, or grid-parallel, in a variety of configurations and contracting models, offering utilities the ability to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and reliability.

With a 17-year record of proven reliability, over 1.5 GW of deployed capacity, Bloom’s modular architecture enables rapid, scalable deployment while delivering high efficiency and firm 24/7 power. By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/n1MbtebkFObJvYKXM0nv7ihemeOlTIfWxqBTbOWKRSg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNDEzMjAwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:02.799757

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.
“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.
Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.
Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.","This hasn’t been a kind year for developers looking to break ground on renewable energy projects.

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July with exclusively Republican support, accelerated the phaseout of tax credits promised under the Inflation Reduction Act for wind and solar projects. Subsequent guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department further constrained eligibility rules.

And as bipartisan permitting reform takes center stage in Congress, critics have expressed doubt over whether a technology-neutral bill would still benefit renewable energy development under the current administration.

During a House committee hearing for the SPEED Act on Sept. 10, multiple Democrats expressed concern about their ability to engage in good-faith negotiations with Republicans to accelerate permitting amid the GOP’s attacks on wind and solar. Environmental groups, too, have cautioned that federal efforts to reform permitting could offer little benefit for renewables.

According to a report from the think tank Clean Tomorrow, the battle over renewable development has spread beyond Congress and the Trump administration—with siting policy at the state level now serving as one of the primary battlegrounds for those seeking to curtail the deployment of new clean energy projects.

“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.

The report’s authors assessed the expected impact of more than 300 state-level siting bills based on factors including their effect on permitting timelines, the predictability and uniformity of siting decisions and whether the bill incentivizes development. Falkenburg said they also used criteria from Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, when possible, to determine if a policy is restrictive.

According to Clean Tomorrow’s report, from January through June of this year, 148 siting-related bills were introduced across 47 states, seeking to make siting and permitting more restrictive.

That significantly outnumbers bills that would have a neutral impact (89) and those that would be more permissive (68).

Restrictive policies would hinder the development of renewable energy, while permissive policies would facilitate it. Bills that the authors deemed to have a neutral effect are those whose impact on project deployment was negligible or ambiguous, Falkenburg said.

The pushback against renewables, like recent actions at the federal level, is largely driven by the GOP.

Republican state lawmakers introduced nearly twice as many siting bills as Democrats, with an overwhelming number of those likely to restrict renewable development—nine restrictive bills for every one permissive proposal, according to Clean Tomorrow’s analysis.

“There’s a huge subset of these bills that legislators are introducing because they have constituents who are upset about renewable energy or they’re trying to score political points,” Falkenburg said.

“There are some that are purely messaging, and there are others that have real traction and are advancing quickly through their state legislatures.”

A Republican senator in Illinois, for example, introduced SB 160, which would have given local governments the authority to ban or restrict wind and solar projects. That effort had little chance of passing through the state’s Democrat-controlled legislature.

But other anti-renewable bills across the country advanced further through the legislative process. Arizona’s SB 1150, which included a slew of restrictive measures against wind farms, narrowly passed in the state House before stalling in the Senate.

If that bill had passed, Clean Tomorrow’s report says, it would have been the most restrictive wind development law in the U.S.

Thankfully for the renewable industry, the vast majority of those efforts haven’t been successful. Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.

Clean Tomorrow’s analysis found that over half of those are expected to have no meaningful impact on the pace of clean energy deployment, with a balance of wins (10 bills) and losses (7 bills) for the renewable industry in the remainder.

One reason the industry avoided some of the worst attacks, according to Falkenburg, is that there was less uniformity in Republicans’ views on renewable energy at the state level when compared to the federal level.

“There’s plenty of nuance in red states, and differences between folks who … have taken on the message from the federal government that clean energy is bad,” Falkenburg said.

“And then there’s plenty of other Republican legislators who are supportive of the industry—but mostly quietly behind closed doors and working to maintain renewable energy production in their states.”

Oklahoma serves as a prime example of that dynamic. The state’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has publicly denounced wind energy as a “Green Energy Scam,” and the Republican-controlled legislature passed three bills that would have had a restrictive impact on the deployment of renewable technologies.

Yet Governor Kevin Stitt, also a Republican, vetoed two of those bills—although the GOP-led legislature overrode one of those vetoes—and has been “unabashedly pro-renewables,” according to Clean Tomorrow’s report.

Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.

Clean Tomorrow’s report also points to unlikely alliances in the private sector and local communities as one of the forces pushing back against some of the more egregious attacks on renewables.

For example, the report highlights the role played by a coalition of the renewable industry, business groups and oil and gas interests in Louisiana in defeating HB 615, which would have dealt a significant blow to the state’s emerging solar industry.

Those efforts were mirrored in other states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, where chambers of commerce partnered with ranchers, and the energy sector joined forces with tech companies to oppose some of the more restrictive bills in those states.

In Falkenburg’s eyes, the wrangling over renewable energy siting is likely to intensify in the coming months, with significant potential for states to use siting and permitting to counter anti-renewable actions at the federal level.

“We’re expecting to see a lot of governors introduce executive orders and emergency actions in the next few months to try to mitigate or blunt the impact of the recent federal actions,” Falkenburg said. “And we expect in the legislature in 2026, more states will use this to reform their siting and permitting processes to deploy more energy, more renewable energy projects.”

Some of those actions are already taking root. In May, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed the Renewable Energy Certainty Act into law, which aims to standardize siting requirements for solar farms and energy storage devices, and preempts restrictive local zoning rules that prohibit these projects, according to environmental law firm Beveridge & Diamond.

And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in late August, fast-tracking the permitting process for energy projects racing to begin construction before federal tax credits expire due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s rollbacks.

According to Falkenburg, such state-level initiatives are going to become increasingly important in the face of the Trump administration’s growing attacks on wind and solar.

“For the renewable energy industry and climate advocates, the lesson here is really stark,” Falkenburg said. “State-level siting policy is a critical and contentious arena for the clean energy transition.”

“As the federal government abdicates its role in energy policy, the future of America’s clean energy economy depends increasingly on the outcomes of state-by-state political battles over where and how clean energy projects can be built.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2203448622-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 05:59:20.414854

Many executives expressed growing frustration over the obstacles posed by the chaotic trade policies of the Trump administration upon its return to the White House, as well as frequent changes in regulatory guidelines.

For the North American oil and gas industry, which fully supported 'Trump's MAGA-ism,' Trump’s presidency did not make the 'American oil industry great again' as he had promised. Measured by 'production,' U.S. oil output did reach new highs; however, measured by 'business sentiment/profitability/investment willingness,' the industry did not exhibit the strong expansion that Trump had promised, with executive sentiment remaining subdued.

MAGA, short for 'Make America Great Again,' refers both to the core tone of all policies under the Trump-led U.S. government and is also used by some mainstream media to refer to Trump himself and his fervent supporters among U.S. voters.

Making the American oil industry 'great again' essentially equates to 'high production + strong business sentiment + robust investment.' Currently, it is closer to 'high production, low sentiment'—output is impressive, but the central price of U.S. oil, along with policies/tariffs/uncertainty, is suppressing capital expenditure and sentiment. Overall, the entire U.S. oil industry appears more like 'increasing output while suffering internally,' rather than becoming 'great again.'

The Trump administration’s imposition of high steel and aluminum tariffs globally (up to 50% on steel and aluminum) drove up costs for OCTG (oil country tubular goods), pipelines, fracking equipment, and construction, repeatedly cited in the survey report by oil and gas executives as a source of 'rising costs and policy volatility.' On one hand, traditional U.S. energy companies complain about increased costs due to steel tariffs and policy flip-flopping causing 'chaos'; on the other hand, OPEC+ responded to U.S. calls for lower oil prices by ramping up production, thereby capping price elasticity—a development highly unfavorable for profitability in the U.S. oil industry, particularly in shale oil.

Overall, the rapid, concentrated, and directionally inconsistent policy/rule changes under the Trump administration across key areas such as methane regulation, RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard), offshore and public land development, LNG (liquefied natural gas) approvals, carbon emission standards, NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) procedures, and offshore financial guarantees have made compliance and capital planning difficult to stabilize. These factors collectively fueled collective grievances among executives in the U.S. oil and gas sector—one of Trump’s core constituencies—in the Dallas Fed survey, regarding 'heightened uncertainty and declining investment willingness.'

Collapse of the U.S. shale oil industry

The Dallas Fed's survey, conducted from September 10 to 18, gauged the latest sentiment of 139 oil and gas executives across the most crucial oil and gas regions in the U.S.—Texas, northern Louisiana, and southern New Mexico. The total energy production (primarily oil) from these regions even surpasses that of some of the world’s largest oil-producing nations.

""The U.S. shale sector has already begun to collapse,"" one executive said in the survey. ""Once the most dynamic energy engine in the world, it has now been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance under the Trump administration.""

""We have entered what might be called the 'shale twilight zone' for this segment of the industry,"" another oil and gas executive commented. ""The U.S. isn't running out of oil, but she (the Statue of Liberty) is certainly running out of oil priced at $60 a barrel.""

""A vibrant oilfield services sector will be critical if the U.S. needs to ramp up production. Right now, we are bleeding,"" an executive from a publicly traded oilfield support services company stated.

Criticism of Trump’s policies is not new, but Wall Street analysts widely noted that the latest commentary represented a significant escalation in tone, with executives describing the U.S. President’s sudden shifts and frequent adjustments on steel tariffs and energy policy as ""kneecapping"" an industry he had promised to support.

The survey also found that executives in the U.S. oil and gas industry now expect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to remain significantly lower than previously anticipated, forecasting a price of around $63 per barrel by the end of 2025 and staying within the $60 range through 2027; earlier in the second quarter, these executives had predicted WTI would close the year near $68 per barrel and re-enter the optimistic $70 range within two years.

Crude oil futures surged last week due to ongoing attacks by Ukraine on Russian oil infrastructure, undoubtedly adding a rising geopolitical risk premium for long-term buyers of Russian oil such as India and China, along with potential further sanctions from the EU and the U.S.

The cumulative impact of drone strikes became evident as Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced on Thursday that Russia will impose a partial ban on diesel exports until the end of the year while extending its existing ban on gasoline exports. This move represents a significant obstacle to oil and gas trade for the two major economies, India and China.

President Trump has been consistently and cautiously pressuring U.S. allies to reduce any oil imports from Russia to push President Putin to the negotiating table. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, remarked, ""We may see reductions in Russian imports by India and Turkey.""

NATO's warning against further airspace violations has heightened tensions and increased the likelihood of additional sanctions on Russia's oil industry.

Additionally, according to the national news agency, plans to resume crude oil exports from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region last Saturday could sustain expectations of oversupply, potentially driving Brent crude prices into a pronounced downward trajectory.

According to reports citing people familiar with the matter, Iraq is in negotiations with one of the most influential giants in the crude oil transportation sector – commodity trading giant Vitol. Once crude oil exports from the country’s Kurdistan region resume after a two-year halt, Vitol will handle the crude sales. This news is evidently negative for the Brent crude price, the international crude benchmark that has been weak for much of this year. The resumption of Kurdish oil exports is expected to intensify expectations of an “oversupplied crude oil market,” potentially pushing the recently rebounding Brent crude price back into a downtrend.

As of last week’s close, the front-month WTI crude contract for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) rose +5.3% to $65.72 per barrel, while the front-month Brent crude contract for November on the Intercontinental Exchange rose +5.2% to $70.13 per barrel. This marks the largest weekly gain for both benchmark crude prices since the week of June 13. Meanwhile, the front-month natural gas contract for October on Nymex rose +0.5% to $3.206 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).

On Friday, Nymex crude, Brent crude, and U.S. natural gas futures rose by 1.1%, 1%, and 0.3%, respectively. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), representing the energy stock benchmark ETF, gained +3.9% last week but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 index year-to-date.

Goldman Sachs has emerged as a 'big short' on crude oil: the global oversupply situation is set to worsen, with Brent crude possibly falling below $50 per barrel by 2026.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global crude markets are on the verge of significant oversupply due to OPEC's production increases and expectations that North American shale producers will ramp up output under the Trump administration. The return of Kurdish crude will only exacerbate this surplus. Previous reports indicated that pipeline resumption is initially expected to bring about 230,000 barrels per day to the international market, with the potential for this figure to increase further.

If Kurdish pipelines resume operations as planned, it would marginally weigh on Brent crude prices. An estimated ~230,000 barrels per day are expected to enter the market during the initial phase of Kurdish resumption, potentially rising to as much as 1 million barrels per day later. The IEA assesses that supply dynamics already point toward an oversupply situation in 2025, with the surplus likely to widen further in 2026. The return of Kurdish oil will undoubtedly exacerbate this backdrop of market oversupply.

In its latest commodities research report, Goldman Sachs maintained its forecast for Brent crude and WTI crude prices in 2025, while projecting average prices of $56 and $52 per barrel, respectively, for 2026. However, Goldman Sachs noted that due to the negative impact of increasing global crude oil oversupply, there is a probability that Brent crude futures could fall below the $50-per-barrel threshold by the end of 2026.

The U.S.-based financial institution stated that between Q4 2025 and Q4 2026, the global crude oil market is expected to experience an average daily surplus of 1.8 million barrels, leading to a significant buildup of nearly 800 million barrels in global oil inventories during this period. The report specifically highlighted that inventory increases among OECD member countries will account for one-third of the global total, reaching approximately 270 million barrels. Goldman Sachs added that with worsening oversupply and inventory pressures in 2026, Brent crude prices are likely to fall below current futures market expectations.",https://newsfile.futunn.com/news-thumbnail/20240704/public/1720075538223258302092-news-thumbnail/20240704/public/17200755382238178651278.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:01:10.352592

NOAA is using ocean robots to collect hurricane data

Forecasting hurricanes requires a lot of data. To predict when a hurricane will arrive, how strong it will be and where it's headed, meteorologists use sophisticated computer models that interpret measurements from the ocean and atmosphere.

Now, NOAA has another tool in its toolbox for collecting critical ocean information. In collaboration with the University of Southern Mississippi and robotics company Oshen, the agency has launched five small uncrewed surface vehicles.

The craft, called C-Stars, debuted on Aug. 31 by collecting critical weather and marine data off the coast of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

""Understanding weather conditions where the ocean surface meets the lower atmosphere is key to predicting hurricane intensity,"" said Greg Foltz, oceanographer and a lead principal investigator at NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory.

""If these miniature uncrewed surface vehicles prove reliable, they could become a critical piece of NOAA's hurricane observing system in the future,"" Foltz added.

NOAA

The C-Stars are currently in a line extending from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Bermuda. The robots can be relocated to various oceanic regions to monitor different weather and marine conditions.

The C-Stars are wind-propelled with solar-powered sensors but are also equipped with electric motor thrusters for when the winds are weak.

The vehicles can operate individually or in fleets when covering a larger area. The C-Stars collect and transmit real-time data via satellite, including wind speed and direction, sea surface and air temperatures, air pressure and relative humidity.

""Although C-Stars have navigated storms with towering 24-foot waves, hurricanes are a whole new level of challenge -- but if it works, the long-term potential is huge,"" said Anahita Laverack, CEO for Oshen.

The C-Stars also collect wave condition information and can capture high-resolution images and videos, which can be retrieved when the craft returns to port.

""If these miniature uncrewed surface vehicles prove reliable, they could become a critical piece of NOAA's hurricane observing system in the future,"" Foltz added.

""We believe that these new, small USVs can move the needle in how we observe and understand hurricanes, while keeping budgets under control,"" Laverack added.

Lavarack told ABC News that the C-Stars are smaller, lighter, and cheaper to make and deploy than larger platforms, like the Saildrone that NOAA has used during previous hurricane seasons.

""Our size and platform cost allow us to field a constellation of many small robot C-Stars. In the future this could mean say 20 datapoints instead of just one within each hurricane, giving a richer understanding of the event,"" stated Laverack.

""We are excited by the role that C-Stars could play in improving hurricane forecasts, which have direct consequences for millions of people along the Gulf Coast,"" said Leila Hamdan, associate vice president for research and professor in the School of Ocean Science and Engineering at the University of Southern Mississippi.

,American Energy,2025-09-29 08:18:55+00:00,Canary Media,Did California just screw up the largest virtual power plant in the US? - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-dsgs-funding-2025-legislation,"But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.
If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.
First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said.
Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid.
As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.","California lawmakers managed to pass a slate of bills aimed at controlling the state’s high and rising electricity costs in the final days of the legislative session this month. But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.

Now, companies like Sunrun and Tesla that have enrolled tens of thousands of customers in that VPP program don’t know if they can pay them to participate next year, because it’s unclear if any other state funding can be cobbled together. If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.

Lawmakers ​“are consistently undervaluing what distributed solar and storage can deliver for the system,” said Kate Unger, senior policy advisor for the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group that supports the program. ​“We find this to be very shortsighted and frustrating, because DSGS is a cost-saving measure.”

DSGS stands for the Demand Side Grid Support program, which pays utility customers to help relieve costly peaks in electricity demand during extreme events like heat waves. They do this by cutting their own power consumption with devices like smart thermostats or by feeding extra power to the grid from backup batteries that have been charged by rooftop solar. Customers have already installed and paid for those systems, so making use of them is cheaper than building new power plants or grid infrastructure to manage those peaks.

DSGS has grown quickly since its 2022 launch to more than 1 gigawatt of grid-relief capacity, Unger said, about 700 megawatts of that from batteries in homes and businesses, which can be deployed rapidly. That’s much bigger than other similar programs in the state.

Backers say that’s because DSGS, which is administered by the California Energy Commission, is far less onerous for participants than VPP programs run by the state’s utilities.

It’s also more cost-effective, according to an August analysis from consultancy The Brattle Group. That report, which was commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla, found that solar-charged batteries in DSGS could deliver between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in net savings to all California utility customers over the next four years. Those projected savings are predicated on the program nearly doubling its current capacity, which is a credible goal given that California residents are adding backup batteries in increasing numbers.

But instead of expanding its funding to achieve that growth, state lawmakers cut it this year in the face of budget shortfalls, just like they did last year. A provision that lawmakers inserted in August into a bill reauthorizing the state’s greenhouse-gas cap-and-trade program would have provided DSGS with a stable funding stream into the middle of next decade, but it was stripped from the bill that emerged from closed-door negotiations between Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and legislative leaders days before it was passed. That leaves DSGS with a dwindling pool of previously committed funding that is very likely to be depleted this year.

The remaining budget currently stands at about $64 million, according to the program administrator. DSGS would need at least $75 million more to continue operating in 2026, according to a letter sent to California lawmakers in August by dozens of companies, trade groups, and advocacy organizations.

DSGS backers are hoping the program might be able to secure a slice of the $1 billion in reserves to be disbursed annually from the state’s newly reauthorized cap-and-trade program. But Unger warned that competition for that money will be fierce — and lawmakers won’t make decisions on that spending until next year.

Without new funding, companies that have been active in DSGS will likely have to tell their customers they won’t be able to participate in 2026, said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. ​“How do you put your customers in a program if you don’t know they’ll get paid?”

Why DSGS is better than California’s other VPPs

The failure to fund DSGS is particularly frustrating, Heavner said, because it’s the rare example of a successful virtual-power-plant program in the state. Though California has ostensibly prioritized VPPs, it has little else to show for its efforts.

For more than a decade, the state has required its major utilities to incorporate rooftop solar systems, backup batteries, smart thermostats, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into their grid operations and planning. But utilities have done very little to actually tap these devices beyond launching pilot projects (and terminating many of them), even as the number of DERs in the state has grown dramatically. A June progress report from the California Energy Commission found the state has barely expanded its demand-side capacity over the past two years, and remains far from hitting its goal of 7 gigawatts by 2030.

“California is really excellent at deploying DERs, but really lags in DER utilization,” said Gabriela Olmedo, regulatory affairs specialist at EnergyHub, a company that manages demand-side resources and virtual power plants in the U.S. and Canada. Many of those programs have grown to play a significant role in reducing stress on utility grids during peak demand, she said, including a large-scale initiative in neighboring Arizona. But California’s ​“fractured, overlapping, and confusing load-flexibility programs really preclude scale,” she said.

DSGS, one of many programs created in response to California’s grid emergencies in 2020 and 2022, has broken that pattern, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for analytics firm Wood Mackenzie and lead author of a recently released report on virtual power plants. In particular, DSGS has avoided the types of problems that have limited customer participation in other VPP programs, he said.

First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said. Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid. That’s a legacy of these programs’ genesis as traditional demand-response offerings that reward customers for reducing power use.

DSGS is also superior to the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP), the other large-scale VPP program created as a response to California’s grid emergencies, Heavner said. One of the biggest differences is that ELRP is triggered only during specified grid alerts, warnings, or emergency declarations by the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s energy markets. Those emergencies are relatively rare, so participants are idle most of the time.

DSGS, by contrast, is triggered whenever wholesale prices on the state’s transmission grid exceed a threshold of $200 per megawatt-hour, so it plays a more active role in suppressing the price spikes that drive up costs for utilities and customers, Heavner said.

DSGS is also open to customers of all utilities in the state, unlike ELRP and most of the state’s other VPP programs, which are managed separately by each of California’s three large investor-owned utilities. Companies that have participated in both sets of programs say it’s easier to sign up customers and get them paid promptly under DSGS than under utility-managed efforts.

Killing California’s most promising VPP right as it’s getting big

A set of laws passed this year instructs state regulators to develop new VPP plans and programs, which could augment the current limited options. But ​“it will take years to establish that,” Heavner said. Meanwhile, ​“companies that have invested in dynamic grid response are left holding the bag right now.”

California may miss out on big money-saving opportunities as a result, he said. A 2024 analysis from The Brattle Group found that VPPs could shave more than 15% of the state’s peak demand by 2035, saving utility customers about $550 million each year.

The loss of funding for DSGS is particularly galling given the scale it has achieved, Heavner said. In a July test of the DSGS and ELRP programs, California’s three major utilities were able to dispatch about 540 megawatts of power from Sunrun and Tesla batteries, in what utility Pacific Gas & Electric described as ​“the largest test of its kind ever done in California — and maybe the world.”

Most of those batteries were enrolled in the DSGS program. Sunrun batteries alone accounted for at least 360 megawatts of capacity. As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.

Sunrun had enrolled more than 56,000 customers with solar-battery systems to participate in California VPP programs as of May, the majority of them in DSGS. The company offered participants up to $150 per battery enrolled in the 2025 season.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/solar-ca-homes-neighborhood.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=eff1726590319d11b9d913c0e3c78e9a,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:06.867769

By 2030, blue hydrogen will likely supply 25–30% of clean hydrogen demand worldwide, ensuring industries can decarbonize while green hydrogen scales.","The Global Blue Hydrogen Market has emerged as one of the most promising segments of the clean energy transition, bridging the gap between traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen and fully renewable green hydrogen. In 2024, the market was valued at USD 2,242.24 million and is projected to reach USD 2,511.31 million in 2025, before expanding further to USD 2,812.67 million in 2026. Long-term forecasts indicate the market could reach USD 6,964.06 million by 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% between 2025 and 2034.

Blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR) or autothermal reforming (ATR) combined with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). This process significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional “grey” hydrogen, making it a crucial transition fuel on the path to net-zero emissions. Governments and energy companies are increasingly investing in large-scale projects to deploy blue hydrogen at commercial levels, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Demand is being driven by multiple sectors: refineries, ammonia production, steelmaking, long-haul transport, and power generation. For example, global hydrogen demand is expected to exceed 200 million tons annually by 2030, with blue hydrogen positioned to meet a significant portion of that demand due to its cost competitiveness and lower carbon intensity compared to green hydrogen.

Regional insights show that the United States, Canada, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are among the frontrunners in developing blue hydrogen infrastructure. Investments from energy giants such as Shell, BP, and Equinor highlight the strategic importance of blue hydrogen in decarbonizing heavy industry and transport.

As the global energy landscape evolves, the blue hydrogen market in 2025 stands at a pivotal stage, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution while paving the way for the long-term adoption of green hydrogen.

What is Blue Hydrogen Companies?

Blue Hydrogen companies are organizations engaged in the production, distribution, and commercialization of hydrogen generated from natural gas, coupled with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies. Unlike “grey” hydrogen, which emits large amounts of CO₂, blue hydrogen captures up to 90% of the carbon emissions produced during manufacturing, making it a lower-carbon alternative and a vital bridge to a net-zero economy.

In 2025, the global blue hydrogen market is projected to reach USD 2,511.31 million, growing steadily toward USD 6,964.06 million by 2034 at a CAGR of 12%. Blue hydrogen companies form the backbone of this growth, with major players such as Shell, BP, Equinor, and Air Products leading investments in large-scale projects. For instance, Shell’s blue hydrogen facility in the Netherlands is expected to produce 60,000 kg/day of hydrogen by 2025, supporting industrial decarbonization.

The role of these companies extends beyond production. Many are developing value chains that integrate hydrogen transport, storage, and end-use applications in refineries, power plants, and mobility sectors. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that hydrogen could meet 10% of global energy demand by 2050, and blue hydrogen companies are expected to supply a substantial portion of this demand over the next decade.

Geographically, companies in the USA, Canada, Germany, UK, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are investing billions in infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Energy alone has allocated over USD 8 billion for regional clean hydrogen hubs, many of which prioritize blue hydrogen.

USA Growing Blue Hydrogen Market

The United States has rapidly emerged as one of the leading markets for blue hydrogen, driven by strong policy support, abundant natural gas reserves, and accelerated investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) infrastructure. In 2025, the U.S. blue hydrogen industry is projected to contribute nearly 30% of global revenues, equivalent to USD 753 million, out of the USD 2,511.31 million global market. This growth is reinforced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which provides tax credits of up to USD 3 per kilogram of low-carbon hydrogen, making blue hydrogen financially competitive against both grey and green alternatives.

The Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot initiative aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to USD 1 per kilogram by 2031, and blue hydrogen is a critical pathway toward achieving this goal. Large-scale projects in Texas, Louisiana, and California are being developed by companies like Shell, ExxonMobil, and Air Products, with planned production capacities exceeding 1 million tons annually by 2030. For example, Air Products’ Louisiana Blue Hydrogen Plant, valued at USD 4.5 billion, is one of the largest such projects in the world, expected to capture over 5 million tons of CO₂ per year.

Beyond industrial production, the U.S. is integrating blue hydrogen into heavy transport, refineries, and power generation. Hydrogen fueling infrastructure is expanding, with California alone expected to host over 200 hydrogen stations by 2027, many sourcing supply from blue hydrogen.

With robust federal funding, private sector leadership, and natural gas availability, the U.S. blue hydrogen market is positioned for sustained double-digit growth, establishing itself as a global hub in the clean hydrogen economy.

A recent analysis from EnergySage shows how changes in the federal budget could reshape the way many Americans go solar, and leasing might now be the smarter play for some households.

The update comes as the U.S. prepares for the expiration of many Inflation Reduction Act tax credits in 2025, shifting the financial landscape for both purchased and leased rooftop systems.

While outright ownership has traditionally been the go-to, Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, explains that third-party ownership options such as leases and power purchase agreements may become more popular.

If you lease your solar panels instead of buying them, the company that owns the system can still get the 30% tax credit for a couple of more years. That means leased solar projects have until mid-2026 to start or until the end of 2027 to be finished.

""That extra time is consequential for installers,"" Walker said. ""It allows them to continue developing residential projects with the tax credit, even as the credit for purchased systems disappears. For some homeowners, that will make TPO [third-party ownership] the most accessible entry point into solar.""

Going solar remains one of the best ways to cut utility bills and slash the pollution fueling Earth's overheating.

EnergySage makes it simple with free tools to compare quotes and get estimates, helping homeowners see what works best for their budget.

Solar panels don't just clean up the grid. They also put money back into people's pockets over time. With EnergySage's marketplace, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000 on solar installations. Its mapping tool also breaks down the average cost of systems and available incentives by state, so you know exactly what savings might be on the table where you live.

Pairing solar with efficient home appliances such as heat pumps can drive utility bills even lower. EnergySage even has a free comparison tool for heat pumps, making it easier to find the right option and installer for your home.

EnergySage emphasizes that while the policy changes may complicate the math for owned systems, TPO options will still allow families to tap into clean energy.

Whether you buy or lease, going solar sooner rather than later could mean significant savings for your household and a healthier planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-leasingimage-rectYAfove5uLJ1pt-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 06:58:08.321890

The five active stations are in Berea, Grayson, Hazard, Richmond, and Sparta. All of the awarded stations are expected to open in 2026. They represent an investment of $31.6 million in obligated NEVI federal formula funds.

“Accessible fast-charging stations across the Commonwealth will make a real difference for Kentuckians and visitors alike,” said KYTC Secretary Jim Gray. “We look forward to having nearly 50 NEVI funded fast charging stations up and running in the Commonwealth next year. Kentucky is leading the charge on the EV front.”

Kentucky is a leader in automotive production and is the EV battery production capital of the United States, helping create thousands of high-quality jobs for Kentuckians. Kentucky touts $13.5 billion in EV-related investments in the state with the creation of nearly 10,200 full-time jobs statewide.

The 46 awarded sites are along the state’s interstates and parkways. Each station must have at least four charging ports of 150 kilowatts or more, be accessible to the public 24 hours a day/seven days a week, and work with most EV models.

KYTC does not develop, own, operate or maintain the charging stations. Each developer must fund at least 20% of the construction and operational costs and is required to maintain and operate the charging station for at least five years.

Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.
In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.
After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.
While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program.","In her own words, Cornell alumna and ecologist Megan O’Rourke, Ph.D. ’09 is running for Congress because she “has a backbone.”

A Blairstown, New Jersey native, O’Rourke is emphasizing her working-class background in an effort to contrast her personal story with other candidates in the race. She’s also made affordability and opposition to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill a centerpiece of her campaign.

O’Rourke has joined a primary field in New Jersey’s 7th district so crowded with competitors that national Republicans have called it a “clown car.”

The district, expected to be one of the most competitive of the 2026 midterms, is currently held by a Republican, Tom Kean Jr., but votes regularly for both parties. Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.

Candidates for the Democratic primary include fighter pilot Rebecca Bennett, Biden Small Business Administration official Michael Roth and magazine executive Brian Varela, among others.

In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.

“Growing up poor, issues with food security were troubles in our family. We often relied on our church's food pantry,” O’Rourke said. Her family’s struggles, along with her love for nature, compelled O’Rourke to pursue an “intersection of environment and food” in her career.

After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.

Eventually, she decided to work for the federal government once again, this time as a program leader for climate in the Department of Agriculture, where she managed grants on sustainability that the department awarded to universities.

In July, she resigned from her position in protest of the Trump administration’s decisions to cut many of the same grants she had worked on only a year before. Since then, she has been running for Congress full-time.

O’Rourke said her decision to run this August was in part because she believed “there was some weakness” in the field, and that the candidates already in the race didn’t have the “strength” it took to defeat incumbent congressman Kean.

“People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have sacrificed,” O’Rourke said, referring to her decision to leave the Trump administration. “People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have the backbone.”

O’Rourke has lived in Blairstown, New Jersey, since she was born, moving only for college. She attended SUNY Stony Brook University before getting her master’s at Iowa State University and her doctorate in Agricultural Ecology from Cornell in 2009.

Attending graduate school at Cornell while raising a family made O’Rourke “stand out,” she says, especially on a graduate student’s stipend, which she estimated was around $25k.

While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program. She also started a community garden in Slaterville Springs, where she lived, to make some extra money.

“It was really hard, but we buckled down, because from a young age — for whatever reason — I wanted to do a Ph.D.,” O’Rourke said.

Though O’Rourke’s platform centers around affordability, during an interview with The Sun, she did not outline any specific priorities or policy proposals to combat the cost-of-living crisis that a majority of New Jersey voters say is their top issue. A review of her campaign website found that O’Rourke does not specify any policies to address affordability.

O’Rourke was also noncommittal on her stances regarding accepting corporate PAC money, whether she would vote for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, sending aid to Ukraine and Taiwan or a position on the Israel-Gaza war.

“We need to look at the conflicts as they come, because [between] right now and 2026, they are going to be completely different,” O’Rourke said. “I’m not going to be pinned down on every controversial vote, but the principles I will bring to the table are that we need to be proactive, we need to take a multilateral approach.”

However, O’Rourke did emphasize a few issues she would take a side on. She expressed support for a Congressional stock trading ban, the reversal of the 2010 Citizens United decision — that led to the rise of large political action committees’ influence in politics — and maintaining a state-and-local tax deduction.

Turning to her Alma Mater, she gave a message to Cornell students.

“My district, New Jersey’s 7th, may not be your home, but you can still pay attention to it, contribute to it,” O’Rourke said. “Don’t be apathetic in this current political situation. You can make a difference.”

By Michele N. Siekerka, NJBIA President and CEO On Sep 29, 2025

A new state law, which NJBIA helped push to the legislative finish line, is making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history.

Manufacturers are the engine that drives New Jersey’s economy – a $58 billion industry that produces everything from pharmaceuticals and chemicals to food products and the advanced technologies that support supply chains and catalyze innovation.

“Made in NJ Manufacturing Day” on Oct. 3, presented by NJBIA’s partners at the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program (NJMEP), will showcase these fantastic companies and their products at the largest gathering of its kind in the state. Hundreds of manufacturers, business leaders, students, and elected officials – including the two candidates running in the Nov. 4 election to be New Jersey’s next governor – will be there.

Look for our manufacturers to have an extra spring in their step about their Jersey-made products because a new state law is now making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history. The “Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program,” which NJBIA was proud to help push across the legislative finish line, provides $500 million in tax incentives to spur investments, create jobs, and position our state as a national manufacturing leader.

The tax credits will attract global investment in a wide range of manufacturing activities, including advanced manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, and clean energy component manufacturing, which includes nuclear, solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by federal tariffs and supply challenges, this economic boost couldn’t have come at a better time for New Jersey.

Beyond incentivizing manufacturing investments, the program will also boost workforce development efforts to fill thousands of new positions from the machine operators and assemblers on the factory floors to the engineers and scientists whose cutting-edge research drives innovation in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other advanced materials.

The NJEDA’s website has the details about the program, but here are the basics: tax credits for companies that make, acquire or lease investments of $10 million or more at a New Jersey manufacturing facility and successfully create at least 20 new full-time jobs that pay at least 120% of the median salary of manufacturing workers in that county.

Importantly, funding for the program comes from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax credit programs. No new money is involved.

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program is the one bright spot for the industry in a FY26 state budget that unfortunately zeroed out the Manufacturing Voucher Program geared toward smaller manufacturers and cut funding for NJMEP in half. Nevertheless, the new tax credits, coupled with the pro-manufacturing tax changes made on the federal level, make this an exciting opportunity to grow manufacturing businesses in New Jersey.

No, not the fear of water, but lab work centered on better battery science.

Hydrophobicity — when materials naturally repel water — has been one of the obstacles to implementing promising, safe, and low-cost water-based batteries that could be more widely used for grid storage and powering electric vehicles, according to the university's news release.

The key components of these batteries are common and not flammable, making them an attractive alternative to the lithium-ion batteries that use expensive and combustible parts. But how to solve the hydrophobicity issue …

The Tohoku researchers have developed an electrode material that works well with a water-based electrolyte, eliminating the problem. They say their new organic redox polymer could also help enable recycling, another long-standing hurdle for batteries of this type.

""By combining high charge storage capacity with recyclability, we can open new directions for sustainable battery research,"" associate professor Kouki Oka said in the release.

Their solution involved combining some components with the right attributes.

P-dihydroxybenzene is an organic molecule that has high charge storage capacity. Through a condensation reaction, the team ""introduced"" the molecule into a polyamine, ""which is water-soluble due to its positive charge,"" according to the release.

The combo tackles the hydrophobicity issue. It can also be broken back down into its component parts in water. A rendering provided with the release shows a circular process, from battery production through use and recycling.

""This study provides a design strategy for making hydrophobic redox molecules compatible with aqueous systems,"" Oka said.

Experts in Korea, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and elsewhere are also developing innovative water-based batteries.

It's important to note that common lithium-ion packs are generally high-performing, safe, and reliable. Gas-powered cars are more likely to catch fire than EVs powered by the existing battery type, according to reports. Recurrent has also reported that Goldman Sachs said battery prices could fall 50% by next year, compared to 2023 prices, due to cheaper chemistries, better performance, and more recycling.

Through August, global 2025 EV sales grew 25% compared to the prior year, though that 12.5 million total includes plug-in hybrids, according to Ars Technica. Sales are growing more slowly in the United States as federal policy changes have nixed up to $7,500 in tax breaks for the cleaner rides beginning Oct. 1. But certain states are continuing to offer their own perks. And EV owners continue to enjoy about $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance savings.

What's more, less-expensive EV options are on the way. Ford is retiring two popular gas-guzzlers in favor of a $30,000 electric pickup set to debut in the coming years, for example.

Each EV that replaces a gas-powered car prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution, per government data. And the tailpipe exhaust is among the gases linked by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to greater risks for the extreme weather that's compromising human health and safety as well as impacting insurance coverage and pricing.

Continuing to improve and diversify EV batteries and grid storage through water-based innovations should only strengthen the global clean energy transition.

The biggest push has come from Premier Danielle Smith's government, which put a short-term moratorium on renewable energy projects in 2023 before introducing new rules on where they can go.
The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.
While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.
Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.","In Pincher Creek, Alta., wind is king, roaring down the eastern Rockies, delivering power for generations, so much so the municipal district made a windmill part of its corporate logo.

Not anymore.

District Reeve Rick Lemire said the windmill image, which sits alongside other Alberta icons on the logo — a wild rose, wheat, a pumpjack and cattle will soon be erased.

""It's not us anymore,"" Lemire said in an interview.

There are few places where the wind blows as hard and as often as it does in Pincher Creek, Alta., where clusters of windmills tower over farmland, with mountains in the distance.

But in a few short years, new rules and changing attitudes have delivered a sharp pivot away from wind projects.

The biggest push has come from Premier Danielle Smith's government, which put a short-term moratorium on renewable energy projects in 2023 before introducing new rules on where they can go.

Regulations forbid renewable energy developments within a 35-kilometre buffer zone from the Rocky Mountains, which applies to Pincher Creek, mainly on the grounds of preserving jaw-dropping Prairie viewscapes. The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.

Rohit Sandhu, spokesperson for Alberta's department of affordability and utilities, said exemptions are available for wind projects currently in the buffer zone and the Alberta Utilities Commission can approve new projects on a case-by-case basis.

The commission declined to comment on the matter.

The district has more than 255 turbines producing nearly 511 megawatts of energy, says a third-party report commissioned last year by the town and district.

The issue is also about money.

Lemire said stopping renewable development means lost revenue down the line if companies can't repower their wind farms once existing ones reach the end of their life.

About 30 per cent of the district's budget relies on revenues from renewable electricity generation, says analysis by the Pembina Institute think tank, and landowners also collect a percentage of revenue generated by each turbine.

Despite the potential profit lost, Lemire said he believes residents are willing to take the hit.

""We're starting to slide,"" he said of the district's renewable energy revenues. ""We're coming down — we understand that. Administration knows that.""

Lemire said residents soured on wind projects years before the moratorium took effect, because they found new transmission lines connecting turbines to the grid to be unsightly.

But he said if the aging turbines are allowed to be replaced by fewer yet more efficient models, everyone wins.

Wayne Oliver, an intergeneration supervisor at TransAlta Corp. and a town councillor in Pincher Creek, agreed. Repowered wind farms, he said, would also likely have fewer turbines that produce the same amount of electricity and continue to provide revenues to the district.

While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.

""The people that live around that Castle River wind farm with 60 turbines, when they hear that six or seven turbines can replace that, they get excited,"" he said.

A spokesperson for TransAlta said it's continuously assessing the future of existing facilities but couldn't comment on specific sites.

Regulations 'popped a bubble'

Oliver, a resident of Pincher Creek for over 30 years, said he finds it remarkable how quickly times have changed in a few years.

""It popped a bubble,"" Oliver said of the renewable moratorium. ""It just shows you the power of government policy to change the direction of society.""

Will Noel, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, said what the industry needs is certainty. Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.

Forrest also advocates for the energy transition and has committed his business to achieving ‘real zero’ in a swipe at net zero targets, which he says include “scams” such as carbon credits or carbon offsetting.

Instead, the business aims to eliminate all of its emissions and help build the technologies needed to reach ‘real zero’ worldwide.

Indeed, solar PV, wind and green hydrogen have all been noted as critical technologies in the business’ real zero strategy.

Solar partnership to power mining operations

LONGi will serve as Fortescue’s strategic technology partner, supplying the latest-generation PV products for the company’s iron ore operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The partnership focuses on leveraging LONGi’s expertise in lowering the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) to ensure the projects remain competitive.

Under the agreement, LONGi will supply solar PV modules and participate in joint venture projects to develop integrated green energy solutions across multiple markets.

The artificial intelligence boom is reshaping global energy demands in profound ways, with data centers at the epicenter of this transformation. As companies race to deploy advanced AI models, the electricity required to power these operations is skyrocketing. According to a recent report from the International Energy Agency, AI could drive a surge in electricity demand from data centers, potentially doubling or tripling current levels by 2030. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a fundamental shift that challenges existing power infrastructures worldwide.

In the United States alone, projections indicate that data centers could consume up to 8% of the nation’s electricity by the end of the decade, up from about 2.5% today. Industry insiders point to the voracious appetite of AI training and inference processes, which require immense computational power. For instance, training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as thousands of households over several months, highlighting the scale of the issue.

Nuclear and Renewable Energy as Potential Solutions

To meet this burgeoning demand, tech giants are exploring unconventional energy sources. Small modular nuclear reactors are gaining traction as a reliable, low-carbon option, with companies like Microsoft partnering with nuclear firms to revive plants and secure dedicated power supplies. A commentary from the IEA notes that while renewables like solar and wind offer promise, their intermittency poses challenges for the always-on needs of data centers.

Grid constraints are exacerbating the problem, particularly in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, home to a cluster of data centers. Utilities are struggling to keep pace, leading to delays in new connections and rising costs. Posts on X from industry figures, such as investors highlighting AI’s power bottlenecks, underscore a growing consensus that energy scarcity could become the next big hurdle after chip shortages.

Global Implications and Economic Pressures

Internationally, the energy crunch is even more acute. In China, rapid data center expansion is outpacing power generation, prompting massive investments in new capacity. Meanwhile, in Europe, stringent environmental regulations are clashing with AI ambitions, forcing a reevaluation of energy policies. The Dallas News recently detailed how data centers’ insatiable power needs might lead to shortages, with experts warning that there simply may not be enough electricity to go around without significant infrastructure upgrades.

Economic ramifications are already evident. Electricity prices in key U.S. markets have risen by over 30% in the past three years, driven partly by AI-related demand. Bloomberg’s analysis in a recent article suggests creating a market for compute resources, akin to oil futures, to better allocate energy and spur investment.

Innovative Strategies and Future Outlook

Forward-thinking solutions are emerging, including on-site power generation and advanced cooling technologies to reduce consumption. For example, some firms are turning to geothermal and hydroelectric sources for sustainable alternatives, as outlined in reports from RCR Wireless News. Yet, challenges persist, with heatwaves and AI growth pushing global gas demand higher, according to the World Economic Forum.

Looking ahead, the integration of AI into energy management itself could provide relief. Smart grids powered by AI algorithms might optimize distribution and predict demand spikes, transforming the sector. However, without coordinated policy efforts and massive capital inflows—estimated at trillions of dollars—the AI revolution risks stalling amid energy constraints. Industry leaders must navigate this delicate balance to ensure technological progress doesn’t come at the expense of reliable power supplies.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-f4cf9881-0604-416c-9ec1-968ab184d4c2.jpeg,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:45.476449

The EPA is doing everything it can to revitalize the coal sector in the United States

During his first term, Donald Trump stated that he would “drill baby, drill”. At the time, what he meant by that was a mystery. However, once he began his second term, the meaning behind that statement became clearer. Trump wants to revitalize the coal sector, particularly in the United States. His administration, led by his EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, has now stated that they will roll back the coal-ash rules implemented by the Obama administration.

In 2015, the Obama administration finalized long-sought federal rules for disposing of coal ash, which is a byproduct of incineration at coal-fired power plants. That rule aimed to prevent contamination of groundwater and surface water by establishing technical guidelines for power plants’ coal ash disposal. During his first term, the Trump administration did little to enforce those rules, and now plans to remove the regulatory barriers that the rule imposes.

Utility companies were ordered to report coal ash contamination in groundwater to the EPA by February 2026. As well as install groundwater monitoring systems by May 2028. They were also required to begin drafting remediation plans if contamination was found.

The EPA has shifted its stance to allow for more state involvement

On July 19, the Trump-led EPA announced it would extend the deadline for utility companies to address the rules by at least one more year. The EPA stated that it aims to put more power in the different states’ hands, as opposed to keeping the rules tightly wound up by the federal government. Which has not gone down well with environmentalists.

“Trump tried and failed to bail out the coal industry during his first term in office. Given the realities of the market, whatever he tries to do this time should fail as well.… Instead of trying to prop up the fuels of the last century, this administration should be working to build the grid needed for the 21st century.” – Christy Walsh, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council

A court has intervened in the Duke coal-ash cleanup, which only strengthens the stance being championed by the current administration. The EPA released a statement on the matter.

“Due to the receipt of adverse comment, the EPA is withdrawing the direct final rule titled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule,” which published on July 22, 2025 (90 FR 34358).” – United States Environmental Protection Agency

Today, energy policy is investment policy, and Indonesia risks being left behind.

Clean energy is no longer just about meeting climate targets. For many companies, it has become a make-or-break factor when deciding where to expand, build and invest.

Companies in sectors like manufacturing, textiles, food processing and technology have set ambitious decarbonization goals, many targeting net-zero emissions before 2050. To meet their goals, they need to power their operations with clean energy. In practice, that means locating in countries where renewable power is available, affordable and accessible through the central grid or via clear purchasing pathways.

Indonesia has taken important steps to expand its renewable energy supply, with 76 percent of new capacity additions within the Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik 2025 (RUPTL 2025), or Indonesia’s Electricity Supply Business Plan, coming from renewables.

Nonetheless, corporate buyers are seeking a more diversified menu of procurement options. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are currently the most viable option for corporate procurement in Indonesia. But while useful, RECs do not support the large-scale, long-term investments businesses are planning. Companies are looking for structural solutions to source renewables locally, such as Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) and the joint utilization of transmission and distribution networks, known globally as power wheeling.

A recent paper by Climate Group’s RE100 campaign, Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) explained how shared use of Indonesia’s transmission and distribution network would allow different stakeholders to deliver electricity from generation sources to load centers. These mechanisms would allow companies to contract clean electricity directly and at scale from renewables-rich areas to business hubs, through state electricity company PLN’s grid.

Other countries in the region are already moving faster – with both Vietnam and Malaysia introducing schemes that allow third parties to supply or buy electricity through the existing grid network. Thailand has enabled eligible customers to purchase both energy and RECs from large renewable energy projects by rolling out the second phase of its Utility Green Tariff (UGT2). These policies give companies flexible and transparent pathways to scale their clean energy use, and they are attracting investment.

Indonesia risks falling behind. While Vietnam sourced over 14 percent of its electricity from solar in 2023, Indonesia’s share of solar and wind remains below 3 percent. An estimated Rp 278 trillion (US$16.64) in annual investment is needed if its targets for added renewable capacity are to be met.

The priority therefore is delivering on this plan. With the country’s sovereign wealth fund Danantara launched earlier this year, Indonesia has a timely opportunity to turn capital, policy alignment and partnerships into renewable energy projects. Fossil fuels still account for a significant share of Indonesia’s capacity, and policymakers have sent mixed signals on coal drawdown. While recent geothermal announcements are promising, Indonesia will need a decisive push to match its renewable commitments with bankable projects that draw the investment that is required.

Other Indonesian business leaders share this sense of urgency. Some 88 percent said they want most of the country’s energy supply sourced from renewables within the next ten years. A majority said they would consider relocating operations and contracting supply chains to other countries if Indonesia cannot deliver adequate renewable supplies.

This should set off alarm bells. Sectors like textiles and light manufacturing are already major employers in Indonesia, and many of these companies are under pressure from their customers to clean up supply chains. Global tech firms looking to build data centers are clear in their message: renewable energy access is a key part of site selection.

There is an economic prize waiting for those moving faster on renewable energy. Research shows that meeting clean energy targets will create jobs, boost wages and improve resilience to global fuel price shocks, as shown in ACEC’s May 2025 publication Asia’s Clean Energy Breakthrough. Renewables also reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets, providing more stable pricing for both industry and consumers.

All of this is especially relevant for Indonesia, which has set a target of eight percent annual gross domestic product growth by 2029. Unlocking clean energy investment can be a key enabler of that growth as it’ll attract capital, lower energy costs, improve energy security and fulfill a government promise to create 19 million jobs.

Indonesia still has time to lead the charge on the regional energy transition, but the window is closing. If the country can move quickly, it will be well positioned to compete with its neighbors on energy, and in every sector of the economy that depends on it.

The companies are ready. The demand is real. It is now time for policy to catch up.

As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.","The concrete seawall that runs along the edge of Lake Pontchartrain, stretching from the Industrial Canal to West End, is a favorite spot for joggers, cyclists, fishermen and families.

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 21/2-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it’s just mud, and it’s so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.”

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. “Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,” she said.

Dredging lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

“It’s solid concrete installation techniques. …I would bet it’s probably sunk a pretty good bit over time, but I don’t have the data on that,” Trail said. “We’re out there every day, we see it. It’s still there. It’s still doing its job.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/86/c86fa899-225e-5e0d-9a9b-e62df2d7fc3d/68d5c14feb11b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-29 00:59:33.549273

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 28, 2025 (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone (a financial company separate from from BlackRock) has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”
