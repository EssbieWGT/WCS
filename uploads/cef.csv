(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska schools, students and education funding will continue to be in focus in the 2026 legislative session set to begin on Jan. 20, but early signs show they are unlikely to be at the center of the political spotlight as they were last year. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will not be pursuing education policy changes this year, according to a spokesperson with his office on Friday. Instead, he will focus on a state fiscal plan and the proposed development of the Alaska LNG gas pipeline, his office said. 
Those policy changes were at the heart of Dunleavy’s objection to increased education funding last year, and he said they were essential to boosting student achievement. He called a special session in August for lawmakers to address his policy items, but legislators took no action other than overriding two of his vetoes. 
One of those veto overrides was an historic win for education advocates: it restored a $700 increase to per student funding, known as the base student allocation, adding $50.6 million in education funding to the state’s budget.  
Yet many Alaska school districts continue to face steep budget deficits, and struggle to address the rising cost of operations, school maintenance, teacher retention and lost of federal funding. The Anchorage School District — the state’s largest district — is grappling with an $80 million shortfall, however the district and the union representing teachers reached a tentative agreement over the weekend on a new three-year contract. There may also be changes on the federal level because the Trump administration has promised to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, and chair of the Senate Education Committee, said it is still unclear whether lawmakers will again take action this year to increase education funding through the base student allocation. Tobin also co-chairs the special task force on education funding created this year. 
“It is difficult to know what the body is willing to do at this point in time,” Tobin said, as lawmakers are in transit back to Juneau this week, and caucuses are meeting to discuss policy priorities. 
But Tobin said she anticipates some kind of funding increase to help districts keep up with inflation. “Inflation continues to be a pressing issue in the state, and we don’t want the gains we made by increasing the basic allocation by $700 this last budget cycle to diminish because of inflation,” she said.
Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau is co-chair of the House Education Committee and agreed an inflation adjustment is a major priority. “We don’t want to lose any ground,” she said in an interview Friday, pointing out the increase to the BSA only added $20 per student more than the year before.  
Dunleavy told reporters in December he hoped the legislature would pass a bill to launch a pilot program for schools run by Alaska Native tribes, known as tribal compacting, introduced last year. Tobin said the initiative is a priority, and said she supports tribal compacting statewide and wants to see greater tribal consultation and engagement throughout all districts. 
She said increasing funding for school maintenance will also be a major priority, as many rural districts grapple with deteriorating facilities and an estimated $800 million in deferred maintenance. 
Tobin said members of the task force recently made a visit to a school in Fairbanks with one of three boilers working — in subzero temperatures — and a plan to evacuate students if the last one failed. “That’s 726 students that will be displaced. It will be a huge hit to the Fairbanks education community,” she said. “It has the potential to really harm our students’ learning and what we need to do in Juneau, during this 34th legislature, to set us up for a long term solution on rebuilding our schools, is very much at the forefront of my mind.”
Tobin co-chairs the task force on education funding, which was established this spring to conduct an 18-month study and create policy recommendations for how the state funds schools. Members have expressed interest in a wide variety of policy initiatives: from revisiting the school funding formula, to investigating chronic absenteeism, to student performance and accountability measures, and policy changes sought by the governor like open enrollment and reading incentive programs. They are slated to deliver their recommendations at the start of the next legislative session in 2027. 
Tobin said task force members have made visits to schools in Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna, Anchorage and Kenai Peninsula boroughs, and have plans to visit Skagway, Juneau, Bethel and Western Alaska. 
Republican leaders of the Senate and House minority caucuses did not respond to interview requests on their priorities for education. 
Veto override for additional education funding still in question
Lawmakers could also take up another veto override vote within the first five days of the session. Last year, lawmakers passed a corporate tax bill tied to online sales in Alaska that could generate up to $65 million in revenue that would go to fund career and technical education and K-12 reading improvement programs. Dunleavy vetoed it in September. 
Whether lawmakers will take up the override vote next week is unclear. At least 40 of 60 legislators are needed to override the governor’s veto within the first five days of the legislative session. 
In August, lawmakers narrowly overrode the governor’s budget veto of last year’s education funding increase by a vote of 45 to 14.
Tobin and Story, as education committee chairs, said the override vote and restoring additional education dollars is essential, especially for reading, and funding programs instituted by the Alaska Reads Act.  
House Speaker Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said via text that the Majority caucus is meeting to discuss legislative priorities this weekend. “Protecting education and public safety items in the budget along with other core services will be a priority in an environment that will be fiscally constrained,” he said. 
Edgmon did not confirm whether an override vote would take place, as of Thursday.

Yet in […]","Missouri Gov. MIke Kehoe waves after completing his 2026 State of the State address on Jan. 13, as House Speaker Jon Patterson claps in the foreground (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). Gov. Mike Kehoe’s State of the State address rested on a tension he never resolved.
Missouri, he warned, is falling behind. Its population is “stagnant.” Economic growth over the past decade has been “average at best.” When competing with states like Texas and Tennessee, Missouri too often loses before the conversation even begins.
Yet in the same breath, Kehoe insisted Missouri has “already seen success” cutting taxes. Over the last decade, Missouri has trimmed the income and corporate taxes while eliminating the franchise and capital gains taxes. This argument did much of the heavy lifting for the signature proposal in the speech: a five-year phaseout of the individual income tax.
But if tax cuts are already delivering growth, why does Missouri still lag its peers?
And if the state is falling behind, why double down on a strategy that has yet to close the gap?
The governor never reconciled that contradiction, even as he dismissed critics who argue tax cuts have worsened the state’s budget outlook as people who “just want to spend more of your money.”
There is also a political reality left unspoken.
Republicans have controlled the Missouri legislature for more than two decades and the governor’s office since 2016. The conditions Kehoe now decries did not arise in a vacuum. His agenda is not a sharp break from the past so much as an escalation of it — a bet that going further down the same road will finally produce different results.
Kehoe attempted to reassure skeptics by drawing bright lines. He pledged he would “never support” extending sales taxes to agriculture, health care or real estate. He described his plan as deliberate, responsible and safeguarded against runaway sales taxes.
But the language of the constitutional amendment introduced in the Missouri House the day Kehoe gave his speech — the apparent vehicle for that tax-cut promise — tells a different story.
The proposal explicitly allows state and local sales and use taxes to be expanded “to impose taxes on transactions involving any goods and services” for the purpose of eliminating the income tax.
Any resulting tax increase would be exempt from Missouri’s constitutional revenue limits and Hancock Amendment protections, meaning lawmakers could raise or broaden taxes without triggering the usual requirement to take the issue to voters.
Missouri revenue surplus nearly gone as Gov. Mike Kehoe unveils his budget plan

All of this is unfolding as Kehoe warns, in stark terms, that the era of pandemic-era budget surpluses is over and that federal funds that once bolstered state coffers are no longer filling gaps. He proposes roughly $600 million in cuts to the core operating budget while warning that the state’s revenue surplus of $4.3 billion on June 30 will be only $4.7 million next year.
This is not abstract belt-tightening. Kehoe explicitly warned lawmakers against restoring cuts or slipping pet projects into the budget without identifying how to pay for them. The message was unmistakable: lean years are coming, and discipline will be enforced from the governor’s office.
That context makes his tax plan more controversial, not less. States that have successfully eliminated the individual income tax typically rely on alternative revenue streams to balance their budgets, such as oil and gas production, massive tourism economies or both.
Missouri has none of those advantages on a scale large enough to matter.
The coming months will reveal whether Kehoe’s foundation for growth is solid — or whether the cracks he papered over in this speech widen under fiscal pressure.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011326-1635-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on the first day of school on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s legislators are, once again, seeking a silver bullet to solve our complex education problems.
It doesn’t exist, and their annoying habit of trying to take shortcuts to solve complicated, intertwined problems and repeating lobbyists’ popular talking points, continue to undermine teaching and learning. 
No “miracle” is going to quickly fix our sagging literacy rates and restore reading for comprehension or simply increase our testing outcomes. 
It will take a marathon to do that.
Unfortunately that hasn’t dawned on lawmakers yet judging by the fact that they’ve become focused on a new “silverbullet” — the Oklahoma State Chamber’s education plan, called “Oklahoma Competes.” The strategy relies heavily on the assumption that retaining third graders will benefit more students than it harms.
And while there is evidence that retention improves test scores, there is also even more compelling evidence that it increases dropout rates, and that it reduces children’s earnings as adults and stigmatizes youth.
Yet, our legislators and lobbyists constantly praise the “Mississippi Miracle,” which is a policy package policy that laid a foundation for student supports, including remediation services for students, phonics, and teacher training programs, as well as controversial online tutoring. It also focuses on accountability metrics that, I believe, drove down teaching and learning over the last quarter of a century.
Those policies led to boosts in fourth grade performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tests. The test is often used as a barometer to measure how each state’s education system is performing against its peers. 
But I’m doubtful about the overall success of the program.
Sure, Mississippi fourth grade scores saw a jump in test scores, but if there had been long-term gains in reading comprehension, we would have seen that translate into the 8th grade NAEP scores by now.  
In 2024, research found that Mississippi’s eighth grade reading scores have not changed since 2002, which raises doubts in my mind about the long-term effectiveness of Mississippi’s strategy and if third grade children are actually learning the basics of reading or if they’re teaching to a test.
The other elephant in the room that Oklahoma legislative leaders seem to be avoiding is that Mississippi’s program started with a $100 million grant by the Barksdale Foundation. It was a private investment that had been successfully tested in other schools, which trained teachers in literacy instruction.
What is the chance that Oklahoma would do something like that? 
Yes, the Chamber now supports a number of programs along the lines of the services Mississippi funds. But, why are supporters so quiet about their price tags, and where the money will come from?
I’ll tell you why. It’s going to cost a ton of money to do this right, and spending that money will be a tough sell among our penny-pinching lawmakers. 
At a time when funding is being cut for a range of service providers and nonprofit organizations whose support for public education is often essential, what are the chances that we would fully invest in the more expensive parts of the Mississippi plan?
So, before we discuss retaining students, we should consider starting with win-win, long-term investments in early literacy screenings, intervention specialists, additional instructional time, structured summer programs and targeted support for at-risk students. 
Once we have those in place — and adequately funded — for several years, then we could talk about implementing retention policies.  
Instead of seeking quick fixes that will do little to address underlying problems, we should heed the wisdom of State Superintendent Lindel Fields.
He says instead of a “miracle,” we need a “marathon.”  
Indeed, there is no quick way of reversing our literacy crisis. 
It’s going to take a concentrated, long-term investment in teachers, children, and schools to improve student outcomes. 
Whether we are talking about test-driven accountability for third graders or for teachers, the supports they need, or how to fund these efforts, one thing is abundantly clear.
We need open, balanced discussions, and research on both sides of the issues that includes educators and parents.
Because there is no easy fix to our education system.

Mikie Sherrill, but New Jersey's deficit may force hard choices. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will face growing budget deficits, shrinking federal support, and a resistance to new tax hikes as she moves to enact her first spending bill in the coming months.
But Sherrill, a Democrat who becomes governor on Tuesday at noon, will enter office with far more resources than her predecessors.
New Jersey’s reserves will remain at some of their highest levels in decades after Gov. Phil Murphy (D) leaves office. And though spending that has already been approved and expiring one-shot revenue sources stand to expand New Jersey’s deficit and shrink its reserves, experts said past treasurers and governors would envy the Sherrill administration’s position.
Bernie Sanders stumps for Democrat Analilia Mejia in crowded House race

Rather than having to raise hundreds of millions in new revenue or cut the same amount in spending, Sherrill can decide which of her priorities she wants to pursue first, said David Rousseau, who served as state treasurer under Gov. Jon Corzine.
“Recognizing that the challenges of meeting the spending needs of the state still exist, and the need to look forward, any governor and treasurer since 2001 would love to have this situation,” he said. “This allows a more focused look at the budget, instead of dealing in a crisis situation.”
New Jersey’s current budget calls for state spending to exceed state revenue by $1.5 billion. That deficit is set to grow after non-recurring revenue that has buttressed the budget in the current July-to-June fiscal year runs dry and steep cost increases from the nascent property tax relief program Stay NJ take effect in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Those include a $550 million transfer from a state fund meant to pay down higher-interest debt to reduce long-term borrowing costs, and the roughly $900 million increase to the annual costs of Stay NJ.
The lost revenue and added costs could speed the draining of New Jersey’s surplus, which was expected to fall to $6.7 billion by the end of June, and leave it less prepared to backfill steep reductions to federal aid, said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective.
“It makes sense to save up even more money in your rainy-day fund for the rainy day, the bad weather that’s yet to come,” he said. “Dipping into your savings to pay your bills now is only going to hurt you down the road.”
State officials have said federal changes to Medicaid would reduce annual federal funding for the program by about $3.6 billion. Some of those costs are likely to pass through to charity care or hospital emergency rooms, boosting some state expenses.
But with New Jersey’s surplus still near record highs, Sherrill has room to spend some down, a flexibility governors like Chris Christie and Jon Corzine never enjoyed.
“There is this structural deficit, but the discussion is ‘what actions do we have to take to maintain whatever surplus we want?’ It’s not ‘what actions do we have to take to meet our constitutional obligation and have any surplus?’” said Rousseau.
A lack of legislative support for new taxes could complicate Sherrill’s path to her own spending priorities. She’s due to deliver her first budget address in late February or March.
Democrats in Trenton homed in on affordability as a top issue following legislative losses and a narrow gubernatorial win in 2021, and they’ve credited that focus for recent election wins that delivered the party a third consecutive governorship and its broadest Assembly majority in more than half a century.
“I think we need to continue to look at ways and find ways to make New Jersey more affordable,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week.
Chen and other progressives have argued the state can boost revenue without politically costly broad-based tax hikes by creating new brackets for higher earners — at $2 million or $5 million in income, say — and for highly profitable businesses.
Reforms to the tax code that don’t alter rates, like changes to capture more business income reported outside the United States, could also boost revenue without straining New Jersey residents writ large. Either way, Chen said, something would have to give.
“The reality of the budget and of maintaining services is going to require more revenue at some point,” Chen said. “Or it will require the kinds of cuts that we’re already seeing in some districts. We’re hearing about layoffs. We’re hearing about cuts.”
New Jersey’s corporate taxes on high-earning businesses are already the highest in the nation, and its marginal rate on top-level individual incomes only lags behind rates in California, Hawaii, and neighboring New York.
Republican lawmakers who have chaffed at the state budget’s growth under Murphy — it rose from about $39 billion in Murphy’s first year to around $59 billion in the current fiscal year — said Sherrill would eventually have to make those tough budget decisions.
“We are going to reach a point where the governor’s going to have to look at the budget in total, and she’s going to have to make some hard decisions, and we’re going to have to decide what the state of New Jersey has to do, what it would like to do, and what it can no longer afford to do,” state Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), his chamber’s minority leader, told reporters last week.

(Photo courtesy of Henrico County Public Schools)If at first you don’t succeed with legislation at the Virginia General Assembly, try, try … wait for a new governor.
That’s the lesson for local officials, educators and state lawmakers when it comes to winning a reliable stream of money for major school construction projects around the commonwealth. It’s been well worth the fight.
Glenn Youngkin, whose term just ended, repeatedly vetoed proposals that would have allowed localities to add a one-cent sales tax earmarked for school construction and major renovations. (I chalk this up to Youngkin, a Republican, being able to say he didn’t raise taxes as governor when he inevitably runs for another electoral office.)
Only the city of Danville and the counties of Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick, and Pittsylvania now have – following a voter referendum – the state’s blessing to raise the sales tax for capital school projects, due to the Dillon Rule. Those nine localities gained that ability before Youngkin became governor in 2022.
Localities can raise real-estate tax rates on their own, but many other essential services like public safety and garbage disposal gobble up the money from that source. Officials who want to borrow money for school construction often run into bonding limits in their cities and counties.
Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who was sworn in Saturday as governor, has said she would sign the latest legislation if it passes both chambers this session. The measure, in the state House and Senate, likely will win approval given the current Democratic majorities in both chambers, and because previous versions of the bill garnered bipartisan support.
“The need is only growing” in communities around Virginia, Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, told me. The sales tax option “adds a tool to help localities tackle the issue.”
McPike is the chief sponsor of the Senate bill and has waged a long battle to make it a law. He also knows about the crumbling conditions in so many ancient buildings around Virginia.
He sits on the Assembly’s Commission on School Construction and Modernization. In a report released in 2021, the panel found the total replacement cost for the 1,000-plus buildings then over 50 years old was nearly $25 billion. Many school structures have gotten worse since then.
I’ve written before about some of the woeful conditions that existed: a collapsed 750-pound section of an auditorium ceiling in Norfolk; air ducts that operated so loudly in Portsmouth they competed with the voices of teachers; worn-out HVAC systems; roofs, floors and windows that are deficient in Stafford County.
To Youngkin’s credit, in his first year in office in 2022, the General Assembly approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aimed at modernizing facilities and reducing funding disparities among school divisions. The plan had grants and loans.
Loans, of course, have to be repaid. Besides, the needs across Virginia dwarf the amount of money the state has offered.  
Youngkin had previously claimed that, if the sales-tax increase became law, citizens would be on the hook for additional taxes of $1.5 billion annually. But as critics noted, you get to that figure only if voters in every locality approved the measure. Some of the state’s richer localities have enough revenue streams that they wouldn’t need the additional taxes.
That’s why so many communities are desperate to add this option for school construction. Several have publicly supported the one-cent sales tax in recent years – especially those with modest enrollments and limited tax bases.
“Given the magnitude of the issue, it requires a holistic approach to solve it,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs with the Virginia Association of Counties. The group supports the proposal.
Some officials told me they currently must borrow money to complete major projects – which is part of the reason they often delay new construction and sizable renovations.
“It would be vital for us” if the tax proposal passed, said Zebedee Talley Jr., superintendent of the roughly 2,000-student Martinsville City Public Schools. Some sections of their five school buildings date to 1949.
“The kids are deserving of this 1% tax,” he added.
Prince Edward County also is among the places favoring the proposal. The Board of Supervisors in December there cited estimates that the tax could raise $3 million in annual revenue based on recent collections. The division has about 1,850 students.
“No one likes new taxes. I get that,” Donald (Chip) Jones Jr., superintendent of county schools, told me. But “this would allow us to take another revenue source. Anybody who shops or eats in Prince Edward County would contribute.” 
It never made sense that the Assembly granted nine localities this option but denied it elsewhere. Legislators and Spanberger should approve the measure for the rest of the state.
Students, educators and administrators would thank them.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Reviews are in for Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson’s debut budget blueprint. They are mostly two thumbs down.
In the course of six hours of public hearings over three days last week, dozens of people criticized the governor’s approach to closing a projected $2.3 billion shortfall.
They booed his push to cap access to a coveted child care program, cut funding for public schools and colleges, and redirect climate dollars away from pollution reduction and toward tax credits for low-income working families.
There was applause for Ferguson’s embrace of an income tax on millionaire-earners. But because it could be years before it might generate revenue, testifiers urged members of the House and Senate budget-writing committees to find ways to raise money sooner.
A recurring theme was the lasting negative effects of further paring public resources after the widespread reductions made last year to plug a budget hole that Ferguson pegged at $16 billion over four years.
Tyler Muench of the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction said “significant cuts” proposed to popular programs like Running Start and cancellation of a planned funding boost for rural school districts carry longer-term consequences.
“OSPI cannot continue to absorb cuts and still deliver services that Washingtonians expect and deserve,” he said.
Ferguson’s budget director foresaw the negative response and empathized with lawmakers who are crafting their own spending plans in the House and Senate.
“It’s a very difficult set of budget decisions that we dealt with and that you all will have in front of you as well,” said K.D. Chapman-See, Ferguson’s chief budget writer, in presenting the governor’s proposal at hearings in the House Appropriations and Senate Ways and Means committees.
The big picture
Ferguson, a Democrat in his first term as governor, released his budget proposal Dec. 23. It makes adjustments to the two-year budget he signed in May and that took effect July 1, 2025.
The governor and legislative Democrats balanced the budget with a combination of billions in cuts and more than $9 billion in new and higher taxes.
Since last spring, the state has collected less in taxes than expected while dealing with greater demand for services, rising expenses due to inflation and costly new federal requirements under congressional Republicans’ so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
The state is facing another shortfall. This one is $2.3 billion in the current operating budget, which runs through mid-2027. Ferguson proposes to patch it by trimming $800 million in spending, withdrawing $1 billion from the state’s rainy day reserve fund, and using revenues from the state’s auctions of air pollution allowances to shore up other programs.
Chapman-See said tapping into the rainy day fund, formally known as the budget stabilization account, was “a really, really difficult decision” for the governor. It got to the point where they were discussing cuts to critical services that he was not comfortable making, she said.
The reductions he settled on are what drew fire at the hearings.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)
Changes in child care programming account for nearly 40% of the reductions, advocates say.
Ferguson wants to close enrollment to the Working Connections Child Care program that provides lower-income families with subsidies to pay for care. There were 44,333 enrolled as of last February, with an active caseload of 33,465 as of November 2024, the Department of Children, Youth and Families reported in the summer.
The governor wants to halt new sign-ups until the caseload drops to 33,000. It is estimated that this will save $217 million.
He also wants to freeze the level of state funding to child care centers, rather than proceed with a previously approved increase. That is a $41 million cut for providers.
“Child care should never be a discretionary line item as it is the work that makes all the other work possible,” said Alex Galeana, executive director of the Children’s Campaign Fund. “Please reject these reductions and stand by children and families.”
Ferguson’s plan calls for 3% cuts in funding to Washington State University and the University of Washington, and 1.5% for community and technical colleges.
Jacqui Cain, president of the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, said across-the-board cuts would have “immediate consequences. Even modest cuts lead to hiring delays, fewer course offerings, and increased workloads.”
She also called on lawmakers to restore a provision concerning the Workforce Education Investment Account, which derives its money from a tax imposed on very large high-tech firms.
Ferguson and Democratic lawmakers made a change last year to allow the dollars, which will total hundreds of millions in this budget cycle, to be used to supplant spending from the general fund. It is limited to this budget. Absent that revision, those dollars were used to supplement higher education spending.
Not using the dollars as originally intended could lead to hiring freezes, program cuts and less financial aid, critics warned.
Chris Mulick, senior director of state relations for Washington State University, said a proposed 3% cut in the Cougars’ financial hide would be the fifth straight year of reductions.
“Just in the past six months, we’ve cut administration, academic programming, and public service while eliminating several hundred jobs,” he said.
Mulick then delivered uncharacteristically sharp remarks on what he said is a proposed quadrupling of WSU’s premium for the state’s self-insurance liability coverage “without any corresponding increase in claims or payouts.”
To cover the increase, he said, the governor counts on new tuition revenue “that never existed in the first place,” and that had at one point been earmarked for other spending.
“These are the same phantom tuition dollars that were supposed to have partially funded university COLAs but didn’t,” he said, referring to cost-of-living adjustments for employees. “It’s absolute make-believe and it sharply increases our already outlying cut to well beyond 5%. Please don’t do this.”
Some of the strongest criticism came from foes of Ferguson’s desire to redirect $569 million of proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act into the Working Families Tax Credit program. 
“Our members are outraged at the proposal,” said Robin Everett, deputy director for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign. They recognize the budget challenge and “share the goal of keeping our lowest income folks afloat during difficult times. But we also can’t ignore the climate crisis that is unfolding,” she said.
Use of the money for the tax credits is allowed under the law that created the climate program.
While the idea may be “technically legal, it is profoundly out of step” with the spirit of the law, Everett said. “Gutting this program will set a deeply troubling precedent.”
Not everyone’s unhappy
Those with kudos for Ferguson’s handiwork urged lawmakers to follow his lead.
Dawn Rains, chief executive officer of Treehouse, said a $7 million cut last year forced the nonprofit to end services to 400 students in foster care aimed at helping them graduate high school.
A patchwork of private and one-time funding helped keep the group going. But that approach “is neither sustainable nor equitable,” she said.
The governor’s budget restores $3.5 million, a sum that “would stabilize and expand a proven program” for some of Washington’s most vulnerable students, she said. 
An $8.5 million cut to a program supporting access to abortion-related services was one of the more controversial budget moves last year. Restoring those dollars to the Abortion Access Project is the top priority of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates — and it is in the proposed budget. 
The five abortion care agencies in the state supported by the program provided 80% of the total abortions in 2022, according to the Department of Health’s Center for Health Statistics. These clinics are located in 20 out of the 39 counties in Washington state. Planned Parenthood is the largest recipient of funds from the program.
“Without full restoration, patients will likely see reduced services, limited appointment times, higher out-of-pocket costs, fewer management options, and less secure health centers, and even clinic closures,” said Nicole Kern, government relations manager for the alliance.
How much of Ferguson’s proposal survives will become clearer when majority Democrats in the House and Senate release their respective spending blueprints. Those will come out following the next revenue forecast on Feb. 16.

Lawyers for Attorney General Lynn Fitch and State Auditor Shad White will argue before the Mississippi Supreme Court on Tuesday over which of them has the right to claw back state money they believe was illegally spent.

Fitch believes she has the exclusive right to file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state. White contends state law gives him the authority to file a suit to recoup funds in some instances.

The issue is over a section of Mississippi law stating that the state auditor is “to institute suit, and the attorney general shall prosecute the same in any court of the state,” when recovering misspent tax dollars.

Fitch first took White to court when the auditor attempted to sue Pro Football Hall of Fame athlete Brett Favre to recoup allegedly misspent welfare money. A Hinds County chancery judge disagreed with Fitch, so the attorney general appealed to the state’s highest court.

The two officials have said they’re considering running for governor and have clashed in recent years over the handling of Mississippi’s massive welfare scandal, which has seen multiple people plead guilty to state and federal crimes.
Fitch also withdrew her office’s representation of the auditor in two defamation lawsuits, including one filed by Favre, after determining a book White wrote about the welfare scandal cast her office in a negative light and created a conflict of interest.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073835/AP24037782705063-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-19 06:57:16.821947
