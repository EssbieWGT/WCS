For Detroit homeowners over 65 who overwhelmingly live on fixed incomes, unexpected costs – increases in grocery prices, rising health care premiums or an emergency repair – heighten their risk of financial instability and can even lead to them falling into poverty.
I am a policy researcher at Poverty Solutions at the University of Michigan. Our initiative uses action-based research, an approach that seeks to understand real-world problems and inform policy changes that could make life work better for people with low incomes. The center recently examined data from the 2023 American Community Survey to explore how low-income seniors in Detroit are affected by declining housing values and high housing costs compared to seniors across Michigan.
Federal, state and local programs to help seniors with these costs are already strained. As the population of older adults in metro Detroit continues to grow, demand for support services, such as caregiving and healthy meal programs, will likely increase.
 Housing cost burdens are more acute for Detroit seniors

The poverty rate of senior-headed households in Detroit is nearly twice as high as the rate statewide.
Detroit seniors, both owners and renters, are more likely to be housing cost-burdened than Michigan seniors overall, with 45% paying more than 30% of their income on housing costs compared to 31% of seniors statewide. This is partially driven by lower median incomes in the city compared to the state.
Even when we focus on the seniors who would be considered the most financially stable, those who own their homes free and clear, the proportion burdened by housing costs is twice as high as the state: 32% versus 16%.

 Detroit seniors pay more for property taxes and utilities

Lower incomes aren’t the only thing driving the higher housing cost burden. Detroit seniors pay more for all homeownership costs, including utilities – not only as a proportion of home values and income, but also in terms of real costs.
Detroiters face higher rates for auto insurance, and they pay more for utilities, compared to others in the state, adding to a situation where many residents, especially seniors on fixed incomes, struggle to make ends meet.
While the cost of living in urban areas is often higher compared to suburban and rural places, my analysis found that comparative costs for insurance, water, electricity and gas are lower in cities such as Milwaukee and Pittsburgh, which points to systemic issues that might be unique to Detroit.

Insurance and property taxes are also higher for seniors in Detroit compared to seniors across the state, especially relative to median home values. Detroit seniors pay the same or slightly more for these essentials despite living in homes that are worth less, based on the analysis.
The median house value for senior property owners in Detroit is $65,000, compared to $170,000 for seniors in Michigan.
 High property taxes and insurance rates drive costs

Detroit lost over half a million residents between 1980 and 2020, causing an oversupply of single-family housing stock and a steady drop in home prices.
As residents left and businesses followed, the property tax base eroded. To generate the same revenue as cities with a richer tax base, Detroit levies property taxes at relatively high rates. Detroiters face a property tax rate close to 3%, significantly higher than the national average of 1.38%.
The housing market in Detroit has seen such large declines in property values that a disconnect has emerged. The replacement cost of a home, which is the actual expense required to reconstruct the dwelling, is often substantially higher than its current market value. This makes the cost of homeowner’s insurance disproportionately expensive relative to the market value of a home in Detroit.
A property’s condition and the condition of neighboring properties also raises the cost of homeowner’s insurance because insurance premiums are primarily influenced by the risk associated with insuring a property. Poor property and neighborhood conditions limit the availability of homeowner’s insurance, driving those who want homeowner’s insurance to purchase costly policies from insurers of last resort, or companies that provide coverage to people who cannot obtain it through other means due to high insurance risks.
The high cost drives many Detroit residents to forgo homeowner’s insurance. According to my analysis, almost 35% of Detroit seniors do not insure their homes, putting their main financial asset at risk.
 Big utility bills

Utility bills in Detroit are higher compared to those statewide for two reasons: higher use and higher rates. The housing stock in Detroit is significantly older, with 88% of Detroit seniors living in houses built before 1960, compared to 34% of seniors in the rest of the state. These older homes use more energy because they often lack modern insulation and have single-paned windows, outdated appliances, older plumbing fixtures and poor seals around windows and doors.
Detroiters and others in Michigan served by DTE Energy, a utility provider, pay gas and electricity rates that are higher than others in the state. Detroiters also pay more for utilities due to a 5% “utility users tax” added to their gas and electricity bills. This surcharge isn’t new. It stems from legislation originally passed in the 1970s, and the funds collected flow to the Public Lighting Authority, which is responsible for improving and maintaining street lights in the city, and to the Detroit Police Department.
In the wake of Detroit’s bankruptcy filing in 2013, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department carried out widespread shut-offs. From 2014 to 2020, the shut-offs affected as many as 141,000 Detroit residents, mostly those with low incomes. The crisis garnered national and international attention.
The initial crisis has passed, yet the cost of water continues to increase across the entire state, with those in the metro Detroit area served by the Great Lakes Water Authority seeing substantially higher rate increases than the state overall to cover deferred maintenance and infrastructure costs.
 Costs are compounded by social isolation

Costs stemming from isolation and disability exacerbate the financial strain Detroit seniors already face.
Several factors contribute to older adults living alone, including increased life expectancy for women as well as children and family members moving farther away from each other. Older adults living alone are also more likely to be poorer than older adults who are a part of a larger household.
This issue is more pronounced in Detroit, where 54.7% of seniors live alone compared to the 43.2% statewide average. Living alone increases the risk of social isolation, which is linked to poorer health outcomes. Detroit seniors also have higher rates of disability than other seniors in the state of Michigan, which can lead to higher health care costs, decreased mobility and increased social isolation.
 Less funding could create more hardship

Historically the demand for support outstrips the available resources, with only a small proportion of eligible households receiving energy assistance. And now, programs that help vulnerable seniors with the costs of utilities are at risk of funding cuts.
Detroit Water and Sewerage Department’s Lifeline Plan, launched in 2022, ran out of state and federal money in October 2025.
Meanwhile, the entire staff that administers the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, was cut in April 2025. While the program is funded in the continuing resolution passed on Nov. 12, 2025, it is zeroed out in the president’s fiscal year 2026 proposed budget.
Even before funding uncertainties emerged, Detroit seniors who own their homes faced institutional barriers accessing property tax relief, putting many at risk of tax foreclosure. Additionally, Detroiters struggle to keep up with home repair costs, heightened by the needs of older homes and because the home repair assistance system is fragmented and difficult to access.
Without these programs, Detroit seniors will be left without an essential lifeline.

Unions and advocates want a wealth tax targeting billionaires to make up the loss.,"Guest Commentary written by

Josephine Rios
Josephine Rios is a nursing assistant at Kaiser Permanente.


Doctors told us my grandson wouldn’t live past three months, but they didn’t know Elijah was capable of. Today he’s 7 years old, stubborn as ever and fighting every day to prove them wrong.
Elijah was born with cerebral palsy. Caring for him is a full-time, all-hands-on-deck operation that includes in-home nurses, physical and occupational therapy, school support and a small pharmacy’s worth of medications. 
None of that care is optional. It’s what keeps him alive, learning, laughing and giving me attitude. 
It’s only possible because of Medi-Cal. Now California’s health care system — the system that keeps Elijah alive — is being pushed to the brink. With $100 billion a year in federal health care cuts barreling toward Americans, California is expected to lose about $30 billion a year in Medi-Cal funding. 
Families like mine are living in a state of panic. Elijah’s medications alone would run over $5,000 a month. That’s not a “tough choice” for a working family — that’s impossible. 
And the emergency rooms we rely on when his seizures hit? They may not even be open.
This isn’t a hypothetical threat. This is my reality. It’s the reality of millions of Californians who depend on the care we’ve been promised.
This disaster is preventable. There’s a simple, fair, no-nonsense solution on the table, the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act. I’m one of thousands of Californians fighting for it, as the campaign collects signatures to place the proposal on the ballot this year.

As a nursing assistant, union member and grandmother battling to keep a special needs child healthy, I don’t have time for political games. I’m interested in what works, and this would work.
The measure would create a one-time, 5% emergency tax on Californians worth more than $1 billion. That’s roughly 200 people, who together hold more than $2 trillion in wealth. The tax would be spread out over a five-year span.
And because of loopholes in tax law, most of that money may never be taxed at all.
This proposal would raise $100 billion for California. It would keep hospitals open, protect Medi-Cal, prevent layoffs of health care workers and keep 3.4 million Californians who are at risk insured. 
In other words, it would keep my grandson and many others alive.
As for the billionaires, they honestly wouldn’t even feel it.
I’ve heard some people say this tax is “punishing success.” Give me a break. Working families already pay our share. We pay it every time we choose which bills to pay. Every time we work a double shift. Every time we sit in an ER praying that the lights stay on long enough to keep our kids breathing.
All we’re asking is for the tiny group who benefit the most from California’s economy, to pitch in one time to prevent a total health care collapse. That’s not punishment. That’s responsibility.
Voters from across the political spectrum support this. When your child or parent is sick, politics matter a whole lot less than their survival.
The ultra-wealthy and their lobbyists are already gearing up to fight this effort. They always do. They’re loud, they’re powerful and they’re used to getting their way.
But I’ve got news for them: so am I. I’ve had to fight for Elijah since the day he was born. I’ve fought for my patients, my coworkers and my community for decades. I know how to stand my ground, and I know I’m not standing alone.
California is at the cliff’s edge. We can either let the healthcare system fall, or we can pull together and pull it back.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/031125-Medicaid-Bakersfield-LV_CM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-17 08:57:26.587593

The state must not spend a portion of the disputed $645 million in state work project funds slashed by the Michigan House Appropriations Committee late last year despite the State Budget Office authorizing departments and agencies to do so, a Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled Friday.
In an order from Judge Michael Gadola, the court ruled that the Michigan House of Representatives and its key committee allocating state funds would suffer irreparable harm if the Michigan State Budget Office “encumbers, expends or otherwise utilizes those funds designated for work projects that were unencumbered within 15 days before the end of the 2025 fiscal year.”
“This harm outweighs the harm an injunction may cause,” Gadola wrote.
The order came after the court heard oral arguments in the matter on Friday morning. Gadola had indicated earlier on Friday that he would rule on the spending matter later next week, which focused on the State Budget Office’s decision to activate spending codes on the work project dollars slashed previously by the House Appropriations Committee. 
The office did so after Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a formal opinion that the cuts to work projects from the Appropriations committee were unconstitutional, bucked the separation of powers doctrine and violated presentment requirements.
Unconstitutional: Nessel says $645M Michigan House GOP project cuts violated separation of powers

Yet, Gadola moved swiftly to opine on the spending matter while the question of constitutionality as it related to Nessel’s opinion was still being resolved.
“The public interest will be served by the entry of this preliminary injunction order,” Gadola wrote.
He further ordered that the budget office’s agents, officers, and employees were immediately enjoined from encumbering, expending, transferring, or otherwise obligating any of the $645 million in unencumbered funds associated with the specific line-item appropriations disapproved as work projects by the House Appropriations Committee on Dec. 10, 2025.
The order did not, however, apply to any funds that were paid out by the budget office as of Sept. 15, 2025.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

The status quo of the order was to be maintained until the court ruled otherwise, with Gadola noting there were other pending questions in the case.
The drastic work project cuts were made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bollin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, who said the money was an area of concern in their push to wipe what they’ve labeled “waste, fraud and abuse” in the budgeting process.
Several of the cuts slashed community services and other projects that residents have come to rely on. Democrats in the state House and Senate unified to call the cuts cruel, and some Republicans joined their repudiation of Hall and Bollin.
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Nessel said earlier this month that the cuts were accomplished through an unconstitutional process, which led the budget office to start spending the money.
Hall filed a lawsuit almost immediately, the merits of which are still pending before Gadola and the Court of Claims.
The speaker ran a victory lap in a statement following Gadola’s order.
“I’ve said all along that we were going to win this easily, because any fair court would rule in the House Republicans’ favor,” Hall said. “While ultimate Lansing insiders and Senate Democrats are desperate to protect their pork spending, House Republicans are fighting for hardworking taxpayers. This ruling has stopped Dana Nessel’s bogus legal opinion in its tracks, forcing the Whitmer administration to stop illegally spending their slush fund dollars.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers on the the House Education Committee on Friday unanimously deferred action on a bill to more effectively remove violent children from public school classrooms on a temporary basis.
The bill was introduced at the request of the South Dakota Education Department and supported by Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration. It would authorize school districts to require students with “aggressive or violent behaviors” that disrupt school or endanger other students or employees to continue their public school education in an “alternative setting.”
The legislation would help plug a “leaking” workforce pipeline, Education Secretary Joe Graves said, since teachers are increasingly leaving the profession due to violent student behaviors. South Dakota is still recovering from a yearslong teacher shortage.
Lawmakers determined the bill was too brief and too vague. The legislation doesn’t lay out the process for the removal, time limitations or parental involvement. Nor does it define “alternative setting” or “aggressive or violent behaviors,” said Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton.
“I’m not sure 37 words is going to plug this hole,” Stevens said.
In 2015, 7.5% of South Dakota teachers left the profession entirely, according to department data. In 2025, 17.3% left the profession. Graves said behavioral issues are the second leading cause of teachers leaving the profession, behind teacher pay.
Graves said children have thrown objects through windows, destroyed classrooms and smashed computers — increasingly at the elementary school level, and sometimes injuring educators.

Graves shared a message from an elementary school teacher, who said if they were a new teacher “no way I’d stick it out if this is what I’d deal with until retirement.”
Several lawmakers raised concerns about how removing a student from a classroom for violent behavior would impede their education. Graves told lawmakers it would harm the student’s education.
“It’s better for the other 20 kids who don’t have to face that violence and disruption,” Graves said.
Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, told lawmakers that the bill could cause legal challenges and more costs for school districts. Other lobbyists raised concerns about responsibilities not outlined in the bill and capacity issues at existing alternative education options, such as Children’s Home Society in Rapid City and Sioux Falls.
Monson added that schools already use in-school suspension to separate children within a building. Superintendents can suspend students for up to 90 days. School boards can choose to expel students, which involves a hearing and investigation.
Graves said expulsion is a “little-used disciplinary tool.”
Lawmakers asked Graves to meet with them, education lobbyists and other stakeholders over the next few weeks to amend the bill and reintroduce it to the committee.

For many, the recent holiday season was a time to connect with family. For some, family includes someone incarcerated in one of Wisconsin’s prisons or jails. 
Juli Bliefnick told the Wisconsin Examiner she was incarcerated in county jail and state prison from January 2012 to June 2016. She said that many people would save up precious telephone time to call their families for the holidays. 
“People that came from more disadvantaged backgrounds would not call their families as often,” Bliefnick said.
She remembers the cost of calls putting strain on her relationship with her parents while she was incarcerated. 
While incarcerated, Ventae Parrow said he had to choose whether to spend his money on additional food items and hygiene, or on talking with family on the phone. Parrow left prison in 2020 and is an organizer for the advocacy network WISDOM. He told the Examiner that how often he talked to his family depended on how much money he had.
Nationally, jail and prison phone call rates have declined over the years, according to a report covering 2008-2021 from the Prison Policy Initiative. And in 2024, the Federal Communications Commission voted for new rules to lower how much calls could cost.
The agency announced that for the overwhelming majority of people, the upper limit on the per-minute cost of calls would drop by over half. New per-minute caps ranged from 6 cents per minute for prisons to 12 cents per minute for very small jails.
However, the agency postponed aspects of the new rules in June, including the 2024 caps, until April 2027. Then the FCC voted in the fall of last year to partially roll back the 2024 change with new caps. The commission voted to increase the caps on the cost of a minute on the phone partway back to the caps that preceded the 2024 rules. The new caps range from 11 cents per minute for prisons to 19 cents per minute for extremely small jails. The FCC called them interim caps, and said it was seeking comment on how to establish permanent caps.
Worth Rises, a group advocating for lower rates, said the 2025 revised caps will deliver substantially less financial relief to families affected by incarceration. They will take effect April 6 barring further action.
In northeastern Wisconsin, people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail currently pay a per-minute rate of 15 cents for phone calls, Captain Heidi Michel told the Examiner. They receive two free phone calls and two free messages per week.
Michel said the jail’s average daily population for 2025 was 661 people, which meets the FCC’s definition of a medium-sized jail. The 2025 caps will require jails of this size to have rates of 12 cents per minute or less. Under the 2024 rules, medium-sized jails would have to abide by a lower rate — 7 cents per minute or less — and therefore charge incarcerated people and their families less money.
The 2025 caps also allow for people to be charged higher rates for video calls than the 2024 rules. Michel said people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail can have video visitation for 18 cents per minute. A medium-sized jail can have this rate under the 2025 caps for video calls. However, the 2024 caps would have required a rate of 12 cents per minute or less.
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said rules the commission adopted in 2024 resulted in “serious, unintended consequences.” He said that limiting how facilities could recover safety and security costs through phone call charges caused some correctional facilities to scale back or even stop offering calling services.
The Baxter County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas announced that the phone system used at the Baxter County Detention Counter would soon no longer be available due to the regulations. Two companies claimed to the FCC in April that its 2024 order was forcing correctional facilities to end or reduce access to services, and that the two companies were forced to end service to a few facilities.
Commissioner Anna Gomez, who dissented in the rollback of the 2024 rule change, said the commission took “narrow and speculative” concerns and granted a waiver of the entire 2024 decision. She also raised the idea that the commission could have considered an individual waiver of the 2024 caps for facilities that showed that having less revenue led to communication services being unavailable.
Gomez called the FCC’s order indefensible, saying it would implement “an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to monopoly companies that seek to squeeze every penny out of them.”
Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative told the Examiner that according to the FCC, the caps were calculated to offset the cost of companies offering certain features to jails and prisons, such as call monitoring. In an interview, Bertram argued that call monitoring technology should not be funded by fees charged to incarcerated people and their families. 
Call costs for Wisconsin jails and prisons
The cost of a phone call varies across facilities. In the Eau Claire County Jail in western Wisconsin, incarcerated people pay 9 cents per minute on the phone and receive two free phone calls a week, Security Services Captain Chad Dachel told the Examiner. For the Polk County Jail, the rate is $0.19 per minute, and incarcerated people are allowed two free calls per week, according to Sheriff Brent Waak.
As of late 2021, the average cost of a 15-minute call from a local jail in Wisconsin was $3.00, according to a Prison Policy Initiative report.
In a statement to the Examiner, Mark Rice of WISDOM called for making prison and jail phone calls free for all. The effects of this would include reducing the financial challenge for families and improving the mental wellbeing of affected people, he wrote. The Prison Policy Initiative has argued that family contact also reduces recidivism.
In November, lawmakers and organizers announced a package of bills aimed at improving conditions in prisons and jails, including the affordability of communication, the Examiner reported.
ICSolutions, telephone service provider for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC), charges 6 cents per minute for calls at the department’s adult facilities, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke told the Examiner, as of late December. ICSolutions charges 1 cent per minute for calls made at juvenile facilities and continues to charge $2.50 for a 25-minute video visit or $5 for a 50-minute visit, according to Hardtke.  According to reporting from the Examiner in 2024, a family member of a man incarcerated at Fox Lake Correctional Institution said people receive two free calls every Sunday. Three free weekly messages are provided, according to the department’s website.
People incarcerated in jails and their families have tended to experience higher phone rates than those in prison, according to the Prison Policy Initiative report covering 2008-2021. Under the caps the FCC passed in 2024, the DOC’s 6-cent rate would still have been allowed; that’s a 15-minute rate of 90 cents In 2021, the average 15-minute rate for a jail phone call was roughly $3.
However, ICSolutions is required to pay the department a commission of 4 cents per minute for all calls at adult institutions. The FCC decision includes a ban on site commissions, which critics say inflate call costs. The ban will take effect on April 6. 
Will the commission ban affect state prisons?
Under state law, two-thirds of the phone commission from the contract must go to the Department of Administration, according to Hardtke. One-third goes to DOC and must be spent on services that “directly benefit” incarcerated people.
In September 2024, Hardtke told the Examiner that ICSolutions paid nearly $6.3 million in commission in fiscal year 2024. The Department of Corrections’ share was nearly $2.1 million. 
Hardtke said that “the commissions received allow DOC to purchase the following in support of the persons in our care,” and provided a list of items ranging from mail processing services to re-entry portfolios to art supplies. 
It’s unclear whether the FCC’s commission ban will affect prisoners’ ability to access items and services currently funded by  the commission money, or if other funding will sustain those items and services. However, $2.1 million is a tiny fraction of the Department of Corrections budget, and the commission money may not account for all of the funding supporting each item or service Hardtke listed. Hardtke said the Department of Corrections is continuing to evaluate how to best continue services to the Wisconsin prison population.
Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative said that charging people higher phone rates shouldn’t be the source of money for things like free video calls that benefit incarcerated people.
The decision leaves some room for authorities to receive money from phone calls. Within the new FCC caps, a portion of up to 2 cents per minute exists “to account for the costs correctional facilities incur in allowing access to (communication services).” 
Bertram told the Examiner that an example of this would be time spent by a correctional officer to escort people to a phone bay. The FCC said this was an interim measure while it sought comment for a permanent version. 
Hardtke’s full list of items that receive funding from the commission was: “mail processing services, driver education simulation equipment, recreation equipment, exercise equipment, library resources, TVs, cable TV, art supplies, re-entry portfolios, puzzles, yarn, activity books, CD/DVD players, movies, dayroom microwaves, incentive prizes, visiting room toys/activities, media credits, dayroom newspapers, magazine subscriptions, modern technology improvements and services, bus tickets for release, dayroom ice machines, personal laundry washing machines and repairs, barber services, religious and chapel supplies and services, legal loans, lanyards, burial/cremation for unclaimed bodies, dayroom game tables, dayroom board and card games, graduation ceremonies expenses, and more.”
Before the rollback in October, the FCC postponed its rate cap rules in June. In a November interview, Bertram said she’d already heard from families about the cost of connection going up in the wake of the loss of the 2024 caps. 
“This is going to come as a shock to a lot of families who had gotten a lot of relief from the 2024 rules,” Bertram said.

Our state faces important challenges when it comes to keeping our young people, maintaining local services and supporting our health care system, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming faces critical questions in 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","A new year is a natural time for reflection and looking ahead. This year promises to be another important one for Wyoming, with a major statewide election and big decisions to be made about our state’s future. Looking ahead to the coming year, what are some of the major political issues we are likely to see debated?

Opinion

One key issue that will be at the forefront of many debates is what we should expect of local and county governments. Last year, the Wyoming Legislature instituted significant cuts to funding for local and county governments. Just one year in, we have seen counties and municipalities dipping into reserves to make ends meet, programs shutting down and services ending. This will only continue as reserves run out and local elected officials must make decisions on where to spend fewer and fewer dollars. 
We will see whether the people of Wyoming approve of this new style of government as roads deteriorate, infrastructure like sewer and water goes without necessary maintenance, and local services like parks, street plowing, libraries and senior centers are defunded.. Local government is often the most responsive and most impactful for our day-to-day lives, but current trends point to less local control and more power being concentrated in the state capital in Cheyenne. Expect this debate to continue.
Access to quality and affordable health care is also likely to be a major issue. Wyoming has unique challenges in this area, as our large state, low population and dispersed cities make it difficult to provide access to necessary health care across the state. We simply do not have the population base to support the full range of necessary services in all communities. Some hospitals in smaller population centers have already stopped providing vital services. For example, cities like Evanston, Rawlins, Wheatland and Kemmerer have seen their hospitals close or pause inpatient maternity services, leaving these communities without a place where expecting mothers can have their children. They must now drive to other communities, sometimes hours away, to receive necessary care. Determining how to provide health care, especially in rural communities, in a way that is economically viable for both the providers and patients, is a massive issue that we have not made much progress on yet. As our population ages, this issue is likely to become more and more urgent.
Education is also likely to be at the forefront of many debates. Our state constitution requires the Legislature to fund a top-quality education, although the question of how and what should be included is a matter of significant debate. The Wyoming Supreme Court is considering two cases that are likely to have major implications on the future of education in Wyoming, as it decides whether the state can issue direct payments to parents for non-public education and whether the state has adequately funded our public system. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, public schools in Wyoming still must provide education in an ever-changing environment. Education is the single largest expense of our state budget and will undoubtedly demand major attention. 
Perhaps the greatest question for the long-term outlook of our state is how we stem the tide of outmigration of our young people. We are an attractive state for retirees or those who have already built a career or business, but we fall behind when it comes to those starting professional life. The answer is not just low taxes. If that were the case, we would be in great shape, as our tax burden is among the lowest in the nation. We must decide to do something more to build places where families are confident they can prosper. Quality careers, access to amenities beyond just our outdoors, the education, health care and community infrastructure that gives people confidence that they can meet their necessary needs at home. All of these are areas that require attention and are likely to be major issues of public debate in the coming year.
All these topics have a common thread. They all wrestle with the question of what our state looks like in the future and what type of lives our fellow citizens will lead. We must decide whether we want prosperity or whether we want to hold fast and watch the society around us wither away. Most voters do not spend their time following legislative debates or subscribing to political dogma. They want to live good lives, provide for their families and feel like they are making progress. Political decisions can make all the difference when it comes to how our families and communities operate. Let’s hope that all of us, citizens and officials alike, recognize the importance of finding the right solutions to the questions ahead.

Getty ImagesNearly three-quarters of all state student aid money nationwide was based on financial need rather than merit in the 2022-2023 school year, according to the College Board.
In Georgia, that number was around 1%.
Georgia is an outlier when it comes to the money available for college students without the money for an education or the grades and test scores for a merit-based scholarship.
But that could be changing with the expansion of the University of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship program announced by Gov. Brian Kemp Thursday.
Kemp proposed a one-time investment of $325 million in state funding for the program, which is seen as a potential companion to the merit-based HOPE Scholarship launched in 1993 under Gov. Zell Miller.
“In this era of high prices and new challenges for those graduating from high school, we also recognize the advantage need-based financial assistance can give to those who would not otherwise be able to access higher education,” Kemp said in an address to the state Legislature.
“Like their peers who have the means to attend college, these students have great dreams for rewarding careers and impactful lives, but they do not always have hope that those dreams can become reality,” he added.
The new scholarship could provide up to $3,000 to students who meet qualifications, including that they work or volunteer at least part time. Recipients also need to be Georgia residents, demonstrate financial need after all their other scholarships and grants are considered and complete a financial literacy course.
Georgia student loan borrowers have the second-highest average student loan balance in the nation at $42,300, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Of the $325 million, $25 million would be direct scholarship money, and the rest would serve as seed money for an endowment, the proceeds of which the foundation would withdraw from every year to pay for the scholarships. The plan is to grow the endowment so it could support offering tens of millions of dollars in aid to students.
Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, called the plan “a tremendous victory.”
“This is a work of labor of a good nine years from people around the state, committed educators and counselors who saw students just falling through the cracks because their families were not in a position to write a check for their higher education financing,” she said.
Orrock chaired a Senate committee that met several times last year to study college affordability. That committee estimated that annual funding of over $120 million could have funded about 99,000 students per year, Orrock said. The committee also recommended using money from the Georgia Lottery’s unrestricted reserve to pay for scholarships, a pot of money Kemp and his fellow Republicans have been loath to draw from for recurring expenses.
Orrock said she was unbothered that Kemp’s proposal did not match the committee recommendations.
“We’re on the road, and we’re optimistic that there’s going to be broad buy-in for this vision,” she said. “And as we see the success rate, the successes that come from it, we’re going to continue to build it to fully fill the need that’s out there.”
Ashley Young, senior education analyst with the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said advocates have been calling for needs-based aid in Georgia for decades and called the plan exciting but said she will be waiting to see further details, especially what kind of financial need students will need to demonstrate.
“It’s a little bit hard to understand how much of an impact it can make, just because we don’t have some of those specifics answered,” she said. “But certainly the model of ensuring that we are establishing a program that is based solely on student need and not merit is a step in the right direction.”
State Rep. Chuck Martin, an Alpharetta Republican who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, expressed confidence that the program will benefit Georgia students.
“I don’t have all the details, but I have great trust in the governor for putting that in the budget,” he said. “So I look forward to working with them on what’s necessary to see the implementation. We just want to see the investments that are made be productive, and I’m sure they have a plan to do that.”

Will it survive?",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/15/school-choice-house-passes-mississippi-trump/,"Rep. Rob Roberson, left, answers questions from Rep. John G. Faulkner about House Bill 2 on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026, at the State Capitol in Jackson.","The Mississippi House narrowly passed a major public-education overhaul Thursday after four hours of debate that centered on school choice — but also invoked President Trump, rifles and shotguns, the Psalm of David, pimps and meth addicts and even sexual innuendo.
The bill, authored by Republican Speaker Jason White, passed 61-59. Seventeen Republicans broke with White and voted no, and two Republicans did not vote.
The razor-thin margin is likely not the homerun that White wanted to see in his chamber, after his months-long campaign to expand school choice in Mississippi. The slim passage puts the bill’s future in doubt, with the Republican Senate leadership vowing to kill it, or at least the parts that would spend tax dollars on private schooling.
School choice refers to a collection of policies that give parents more power over their children’s education. But opponents argue that in doing so, public money is siphoned away from the public education system into private schools or the highest-performing public schools.  
White has been at the center of efforts to broaden school choice policies in Mississippi, one of the few states in the Southeast without an expansive program. The drive has, in large part, come from national conservative groups and the Trump administration.
Rep. Jeffrey Harness, Democrat from Fayette, acknowledged that pressure during the floor debate. 
“I know y’all have to do everything that Donald Trump tells you to do,” he said. “I mean, if he tells you to jump off a cliff, you’re gonna jump off a cliff.”
The crux of the divide in the House is ideological, representatives made clear on Thursday.

Democrats, led in dissent by House party leader Robert Johnson III from Natchez, said they believe the state’s public-education system should be rewarded for its recent success and that school choice would harm public schools, which must accept all students. In contrast, House Republicans said that parents, not the government, deserve the ultimate say over where and how their children are educated. Republican Rep. Celeste Hurst of Sandhill, in an unconventional opening, introduced the bill — estimated to cost the state $162 million overall and headlined by an education savings account program that would send public dollars to families to pay for private school tuition — by acknowledging its 446-page length.
“The opponents have called it gargantuan,” she said. “I have even heard the word ‘girth’ tossed around. And I get it, it’s really hard to embrace something that you can’t quite get your arms around … what’s also big is the issue we’re trying to address.” Others during the hourslong debate snickered as they used girth and similar innuendo.
And before the debate unfolded in earnest, Republican Rep. Jansen Owen of Poplarville, one of the authors and White’s right-hand man in the school choice push, was brought to tears.
“Supporting school choice doesn’t mean turning backs on public education. It means opening our eyes to the reality that every baby is unique and every baby is different,” he said, before turning away from the podium to gather himself.
There were recurrent themes throughout the floor discussion, including accountability, transparency and fears over resegregation. One major portion of the bill changes current law to remove the veto power of a home school district if a student wants to transfer out. The other school district, however, retains its power to accept or deny a student.
Johnson argued that idea was antithetical to public schools by definition. 
“If I live in a county, I can go to school in that county,” he said. “And if I show up at that school ugly, dirty, rambunctious, crazy, I don’t care what it is — they have to take you. That’s what public education is.”
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, who represents Starkville, brushed off concerns that the public-school transfer provision would result in a concentration of high-performing students at the most well-resourced schools, causing rural, struggling schools with lower-income tax bases to lose students and, subsequently, close. 
Some Democrats likened it to the segregation of schools in the 1950s. 
“These schools that you’re talking about are going to close anyway,” Roberson refuted. “That’s the road they’re on.”
Lawmakers also took issue with private schools accepting state money, while adhering to their own standards, not public school standards. 
Rep. Bob Evans, a Democrat from Monticello, said there were no penalties in the bill, but Owen disagreed: If schools fail to educate students, their parents can send them elsewhere, he said. 
“Let me ask you a question: If little Johnny’s momma is on crystal meth, and little Johnny’s daddy is a pimp, can you tell me how they (are) gonna be able to choose that little Johnny is getting the right kind of education services when that’s not even on their plate?” Rep. John Hines, a Democrat from Greenville, asked. 
“I hope little Johnny has a good grandmomma,” Owen responded.

A handful of amendments offered by Johnson and Rep. Omeria Scott, a Democrat from Laurel, failed on the floor Thursday, including one presented by the latter to require a specific Psalm for provision of the bill that permits school boards to create policies that allow prayer at the beginning of the school day. 
While the House debated the lengthy House bill, Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, told Mississippi Today the Senate Republican majority does not support the House bill. Senate leaders have already passed a public-school transfer bill, filed legislation that mirrors portions of the House bill and made clear they don’t plan to entertain an education savings account program to spend tax dollars on private schools.
He also alluded to moves by House Republican leaders to finagle votes in a Wednesday committee meeting, such as asking some members to skip the meeting instead of voting no.
“The Senate position is what we passed and I’m going to support the Senate position,” DeBar said. “I’ve got votes on a single bill, I’m not twisting arms or asking people to walk. I’ve got the full support of the Senate. When the House bill gets here, if it gets here, we’ll deal with it in due course.”
But White on Thursday after adjournment denied any heavy arm twisting of House Republicans. He told reporters that he asked his members to vote ‘yes’ on the bill, and that pressure has come from their constituents and “politics,” not House leadership.  
And if the Senate kills his bill, White said senators will “answer to the voters” and suggested that Gov. Tate Reeves would call a special session to reconsider school choice expansion. 
“ I’m hopeful and optimistic that we can find some common ground,” he said. “The same people that voted for these representatives, voted for those senators, and I just can’t believe we’re that far apart.”
DeBar said he plans to call a committee meeting next week to handle noncontroversial bills. He plans to have his committee consider whatever version of House Bill 2 passes the House, but did not say when that would be. 
“My preference is to bring the bill up as is and not have amendments made to it because I think the committee needs to consider the bill in its totality and make a decision on how they want to move forward with it,” he said.

House Democrats outlined their plans moving forward at a press conference on the Capitol’s second floor steps immediately after adjournment.
“We hope the position of the Senate remains steadfast on this issue, and we’ll continue to talk to them and encourage them, along with everyone else in the House and Senate,” Johnson said. 
The bill was held on a motion to reconsider, a procedural motion that could bring more debate or another vote on the bill before it could move to the Senate.

Larry Rhoden speaks during a press conference on Jan. 15, 2026, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A day before lawmakers were set to debate a bill that would dash his exclusive authority to dole out awards from an employer-funded pool of economic development dollars, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order to place “guardrails” on his use of the funds.
When asked during a Thursday press conference if he’s pushing back against allegations that he and his predecessor improperly used the fund, Rhoden said that’s not the case.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said.
Governor hits the road to award more state grants; opponents call it campaigning

The Future Fund was created in the 1980s to allow South Dakota governors to nimbly advance economic development projects without intervention from lawmakers or oversight from a state board or committee. The fund’s money comes from a fee employers pay when they submit payroll taxes to the state’s unemployment benefits program.
The fund falls under the umbrella of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. That agency has a board that reviews and approves awards in most circumstances, but the board doesn’t sign off on Future Fund awards.
The fund has drawn controversy in recent years, largely for the manner of its use by Rhoden’s predecessor, former Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Noem, now the secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, used Future Fund dollars to pay for a gun range lawmakers declined to help pay for, and to help pay for a rodeo at which she appeared and workforce development ads that featured her as the star. 
Rhoden has used the money a handful of times during the year he’s spent in office, funding industrial parks in Aberdeen and Watertown and supporting a biotechnology company in Brookings. 
His executive order preserves the governor as the sole decision maker on the use of dollars from the Future Fund. The board would remain tangential and have no authority to review or overturn a decision.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The order does, however, lay out procedures on how Future Fund beneficiaries get the money, and it requires transparency on the awards. 

Grants must come on a reimbursement basis, the order says, and the entity securing the grant must prove it’s paid its bills before accessing the money, but the economic development commissioner can waive that requirement. 
The economic development office ought to, “when feasible,” require that the beneficiaries invest matching dollars into funded projects.
Awardees must have conflict-of-interest policies in place.
Awards and award agreements must be posted on the OpenSD.gov website, and the economic development commissioner must sign the agreement.
The economic development office must report on its use of Future Fund dollars biannually to the legislature’s Joint Committee on Appropriations.

Rhoden told a group of reporters that the order’s dictates offer transparency on the process, and that they are essentially “a direct reflection of how we do business today.”
Legislative interest
The Appropriations Committee already gets reports on Future Fund spending. Some lawmakers had aimed to reduce the fund’s revenue in 2024, but ultimately opted to back a bill that created the reporting requirement.
A bill to repeal the Future Fund’s revenue source failed by four votes in the state House of Representative in 2025.
Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

The first bill filed in the Senate for 2026 would move the authority to spend Future Fund dollars from the governor to the economic development board, which has 13 members appointed by the governor. It would also require the economic development office to spell out the criteria for awards and set interest rates for loans.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said she still hopes her bill is approved. It’s scheduled to receive its first hearing Friday morning in the Senate State Affairs Committee.
It’s important, Howard said, that guidelines for the expenditure of taxpayer dollars are set by the Legislature. Governors can rescind executive orders, and there’s no clear mechanism for enforcement if a governor were to ignore existing executive orders.
“Different governors will do different things,” Howard said. “Certain governors will spend this money on rodeos, and other governors may spend it the way it was originally intended.”
When asked if he’d support a bill if it contained the exact language of his executive order, Rhoden said Thursday that he hates to comment on hypotheticals, but that he couldn’t see a reason why he wouldn’t.
Howard said she would consider bringing such a bill if her own proposal fails.
“I do believe something needs to be in statute,” she said.
Even so, she said, the question on who has the authority to spend money from the fund is a point of contention for her. The economic development board ought to review awards, she said.
“I don’t believe one person should be the deciding factor in how those funds are spent,” Howard said. “So I want it to go before several people.”
At Rhoden’s Thursday press conference, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the executive order, in leaving the decision-making authority with the governor, preserves what he sees as the Future Fund’s primary value.
“You need to have a tool that is flexible and they can act quickly,” Venhuizen said. “And I think a positive thing about the Future Fund is that there is one person who’s accountable, the governor.”
Broader debate on economic development
The Future Fund discussion dovetails with a larger discussion on the role of economic development that’s grown into a rift among Republicans.
Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, is one of three candidates running against Rhoden in this year’s Republican primary for governor. Hansen has repeatedly decried state funding for economic development projects as “corporate welfare,” and his running mate, Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, is the prime sponsor of Howard’s Future Fund bill in the House of Representatives.
Lawmaker wants longer ‘cooling-off period’ for those who parlay public work into private-sector jobs

A few hours after Rhoden’s press conference, the state Senate took up a resolution meant to encourage “honest economic development rooted in the republican principles of limited government, deregulation, and organic entrepreneurial growth.”
The resolution asked senators to agree that “the free market and the private sector, left alone, will best serve our economic interests.”
The resolution’s sponsor, Republican Sen. John Carley of Piedmont, told his fellow lawmakers that the businesses that wish to develop and thrive in South Dakota ought to be able to do so without the aid of taxpayer dollars.
Carley said offering taxpayer dollars to companies instead of pushing for lower taxes amounts to “corporatocracy.”
“Instead of choosing corporations, let’s choose the taxpayers,” he said.
The resolution failed on a 15-17 vote, with one senator absent. Carley signaled his intent to have the vote reconsidered.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EM8A4567-copy-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519
