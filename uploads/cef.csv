The state must not spend a portion of the disputed $645 million in state work project funds slashed by the Michigan House Appropriations Committee late last year despite the State Budget Office authorizing departments and agencies to do so, a Michigan Court of Claims judge ruled Friday.
In an order from Judge Michael Gadola, the court ruled that the Michigan House of Representatives and its key committee allocating state funds would suffer irreparable harm if the Michigan State Budget Office “encumbers, expends or otherwise utilizes those funds designated for work projects that were unencumbered within 15 days before the end of the 2025 fiscal year.”
“This harm outweighs the harm an injunction may cause,” Gadola wrote.
The order came after the court heard oral arguments in the matter on Friday morning. Gadola had indicated earlier on Friday that he would rule on the spending matter later next week, which focused on the State Budget Office’s decision to activate spending codes on the work project dollars slashed previously by the House Appropriations Committee. 
The office did so after Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a formal opinion that the cuts to work projects from the Appropriations committee were unconstitutional, bucked the separation of powers doctrine and violated presentment requirements.

Yet, Gadola moved swiftly to opine on the spending matter while the question of constitutionality as it related to Nessel’s opinion was still being resolved.
“The public interest will be served by the entry of this preliminary injunction order,” Gadola wrote.
He further ordered that the budget office’s agents, officers, and employees were immediately enjoined from encumbering, expending, transferring, or otherwise obligating any of the $645 million in unencumbered funds associated with the specific line-item appropriations disapproved as work projects by the House Appropriations Committee on Dec. 10, 2025.
The order did not, however, apply to any funds that were paid out by the budget office as of Sept. 15, 2025.
Michigan Dems say $645M work project cuts are ‘cruel’; GOP’s Rylee Linting also calls foul

The status quo of the order was to be maintained until the court ruled otherwise, with Gadola noting there were other pending questions in the case.
The drastic work project cuts were made by House Republican appropriations chair Rep. Ann Bollin, and championed by House Speaker Matt Hall, who said the money was an area of concern in their push to wipe what they’ve labeled “waste, fraud and abuse” in the budgeting process.
Several of the cuts slashed community services and other projects that residents have come to rely on. Democrats in the state House and Senate unified to call the cuts cruel, and some Republicans joined their repudiation of Hall and Bollin.
‘Trust cuts both ways’: Nonprofits say Michigan House GOP cuts risk harming vulnerable families

Nessel said earlier this month that the cuts were accomplished through an unconstitutional process, which led the budget office to start spending the money.
Hall filed a lawsuit almost immediately, the merits of which are still pending before Gadola and the Court of Claims.
The speaker ran a victory lap in a statement following Gadola’s order.
“I’ve said all along that we were going to win this easily, because any fair court would rule in the House Republicans’ favor,” Hall said. “While ultimate Lansing insiders and Senate Democrats are desperate to protect their pork spending, House Republicans are fighting for hardworking taxpayers. This ruling has stopped Dana Nessel’s bogus legal opinion in its tracks, forcing the Whitmer administration to stop illegally spending their slush fund dollars.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers on the the House Education Committee on Friday unanimously deferred action on a bill to more effectively remove violent children from public school classrooms on a temporary basis.
The bill was introduced at the request of the South Dakota Education Department and supported by Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration. It would authorize school districts to require students with “aggressive or violent behaviors” that disrupt school or endanger other students or employees to continue their public school education in an “alternative setting.”
The legislation would help plug a “leaking” workforce pipeline, Education Secretary Joe Graves said, since teachers are increasingly leaving the profession due to violent student behaviors. South Dakota is still recovering from a yearslong teacher shortage.
Lawmakers determined the bill was too brief and too vague. The legislation doesn’t lay out the process for the removal, time limitations or parental involvement. Nor does it define “alternative setting” or “aggressive or violent behaviors,” said Rep. Mike Stevens, R-Yankton.
“I’m not sure 37 words is going to plug this hole,” Stevens said.
In 2015, 7.5% of South Dakota teachers left the profession entirely, according to department data. In 2025, 17.3% left the profession. Graves said behavioral issues are the second leading cause of teachers leaving the profession, behind teacher pay.
Graves said children have thrown objects through windows, destroyed classrooms and smashed computers — increasingly at the elementary school level, and sometimes injuring educators.

Graves shared a message from an elementary school teacher, who said if they were a new teacher “no way I’d stick it out if this is what I’d deal with until retirement.”
Several lawmakers raised concerns about how removing a student from a classroom for violent behavior would impede their education. Graves told lawmakers it would harm the student’s education.
“It’s better for the other 20 kids who don’t have to face that violence and disruption,” Graves said.
Rob Monson, executive director for the School Administrators of South Dakota, told lawmakers that the bill could cause legal challenges and more costs for school districts. Other lobbyists raised concerns about responsibilities not outlined in the bill and capacity issues at existing alternative education options, such as Children’s Home Society in Rapid City and Sioux Falls.
Monson added that schools already use in-school suspension to separate children within a building. Superintendents can suspend students for up to 90 days. School boards can choose to expel students, which involves a hearing and investigation.
Graves said expulsion is a “little-used disciplinary tool.”
Lawmakers asked Graves to meet with them, education lobbyists and other stakeholders over the next few weeks to amend the bill and reintroduce it to the committee.

For many, the recent holiday season was a time to connect with family. For some, family includes someone incarcerated in one of Wisconsin’s prisons or jails. 
Juli Bliefnick told the Wisconsin Examiner she was incarcerated in county jail and state prison from January 2012 to June 2016. She said that many people would save up precious telephone time to call their families for the holidays. 
“People that came from more disadvantaged backgrounds would not call their families as often,” Bliefnick said.
She remembers the cost of calls putting strain on her relationship with her parents while she was incarcerated. 
While incarcerated, Ventae Parrow said he had to choose whether to spend his money on additional food items and hygiene, or on talking with family on the phone. Parrow left prison in 2020 and is an organizer for the advocacy network WISDOM. He told the Examiner that how often he talked to his family depended on how much money he had.
Nationally, jail and prison phone call rates have declined over the years, according to a report covering 2008-2021 from the Prison Policy Initiative. And in 2024, the Federal Communications Commission voted for new rules to lower how much calls could cost.
The agency announced that for the overwhelming majority of people, the upper limit on the per-minute cost of calls would drop by over half. New per-minute caps ranged from 6 cents per minute for prisons to 12 cents per minute for very small jails.
However, the agency postponed aspects of the new rules in June, including the 2024 caps, until April 2027. Then the FCC voted in the fall of last year to partially roll back the 2024 change with new caps. The commission voted to increase the caps on the cost of a minute on the phone partway back to the caps that preceded the 2024 rules. The new caps range from 11 cents per minute for prisons to 19 cents per minute for extremely small jails. The FCC called them interim caps, and said it was seeking comment on how to establish permanent caps.
Worth Rises, a group advocating for lower rates, said the 2025 revised caps will deliver substantially less financial relief to families affected by incarceration. They will take effect April 6 barring further action.
In northeastern Wisconsin, people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail currently pay a per-minute rate of 15 cents for phone calls, Captain Heidi Michel told the Examiner. They receive two free phone calls and two free messages per week.
Michel said the jail’s average daily population for 2025 was 661 people, which meets the FCC’s definition of a medium-sized jail. The 2025 caps will require jails of this size to have rates of 12 cents per minute or less. Under the 2024 rules, medium-sized jails would have to abide by a lower rate — 7 cents per minute or less — and therefore charge incarcerated people and their families less money.
The 2025 caps also allow for people to be charged higher rates for video calls than the 2024 rules. Michel said people incarcerated in the Brown County Jail can have video visitation for 18 cents per minute. A medium-sized jail can have this rate under the 2025 caps for video calls. However, the 2024 caps would have required a rate of 12 cents per minute or less.
FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said rules the commission adopted in 2024 resulted in “serious, unintended consequences.” He said that limiting how facilities could recover safety and security costs through phone call charges caused some correctional facilities to scale back or even stop offering calling services.
The Baxter County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas announced that the phone system used at the Baxter County Detention Counter would soon no longer be available due to the regulations. Two companies claimed to the FCC in April that its 2024 order was forcing correctional facilities to end or reduce access to services, and that the two companies were forced to end service to a few facilities.
Commissioner Anna Gomez, who dissented in the rollback of the 2024 rule change, said the commission took “narrow and speculative” concerns and granted a waiver of the entire 2024 decision. She also raised the idea that the commission could have considered an individual waiver of the 2024 caps for facilities that showed that having less revenue led to communication services being unavailable.
Gomez called the FCC’s order indefensible, saying it would implement “an egregious transfer of wealth from families in incredibly vulnerable situations to monopoly companies that seek to squeeze every penny out of them.”
Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative told the Examiner that according to the FCC, the caps were calculated to offset the cost of companies offering certain features to jails and prisons, such as call monitoring. In an interview, Bertram argued that call monitoring technology should not be funded by fees charged to incarcerated people and their families. 
Call costs for Wisconsin jails and prisons
The cost of a phone call varies across facilities. In the Eau Claire County Jail in western Wisconsin, incarcerated people pay 9 cents per minute on the phone and receive two free phone calls a week, Security Services Captain Chad Dachel told the Examiner. For the Polk County Jail, the rate is $0.19 per minute, and incarcerated people are allowed two free calls per week, according to Sheriff Brent Waak.
As of late 2021, the average cost of a 15-minute call from a local jail in Wisconsin was $3.00, according to a Prison Policy Initiative report.
In a statement to the Examiner, Mark Rice of WISDOM called for making prison and jail phone calls free for all. The effects of this would include reducing the financial challenge for families and improving the mental wellbeing of affected people, he wrote. The Prison Policy Initiative has argued that family contact also reduces recidivism.
In November, lawmakers and organizers announced a package of bills aimed at improving conditions in prisons and jails, including the affordability of communication, the Examiner reported.
ICSolutions, telephone service provider for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC), charges 6 cents per minute for calls at the department’s adult facilities, DOC communications director Beth Hardtke told the Examiner, as of late December. ICSolutions charges 1 cent per minute for calls made at juvenile facilities and continues to charge $2.50 for a 25-minute video visit or $5 for a 50-minute visit, according to Hardtke.  According to reporting from the Examiner in 2024, a family member of a man incarcerated at Fox Lake Correctional Institution said people receive two free calls every Sunday. Three free weekly messages are provided, according to the department’s website.
People incarcerated in jails and their families have tended to experience higher phone rates than those in prison, according to the Prison Policy Initiative report covering 2008-2021. Under the caps the FCC passed in 2024, the DOC’s 6-cent rate would still have been allowed; that’s a 15-minute rate of 90 cents In 2021, the average 15-minute rate for a jail phone call was roughly $3.
However, ICSolutions is required to pay the department a commission of 4 cents per minute for all calls at adult institutions. The FCC decision includes a ban on site commissions, which critics say inflate call costs. The ban will take effect on April 6. 
Will the commission ban affect state prisons?
Under state law, two-thirds of the phone commission from the contract must go to the Department of Administration, according to Hardtke. One-third goes to DOC and must be spent on services that “directly benefit” incarcerated people.
In September 2024, Hardtke told the Examiner that ICSolutions paid nearly $6.3 million in commission in fiscal year 2024. The Department of Corrections’ share was nearly $2.1 million. 
Hardtke said that “the commissions received allow DOC to purchase the following in support of the persons in our care,” and provided a list of items ranging from mail processing services to re-entry portfolios to art supplies. 
It’s unclear whether the FCC’s commission ban will affect prisoners’ ability to access items and services currently funded by  the commission money, or if other funding will sustain those items and services. However, $2.1 million is a tiny fraction of the Department of Corrections budget, and the commission money may not account for all of the funding supporting each item or service Hardtke listed. Hardtke said the Department of Corrections is continuing to evaluate how to best continue services to the Wisconsin prison population.
Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative said that charging people higher phone rates shouldn’t be the source of money for things like free video calls that benefit incarcerated people.
The decision leaves some room for authorities to receive money from phone calls. Within the new FCC caps, a portion of up to 2 cents per minute exists “to account for the costs correctional facilities incur in allowing access to (communication services).” 
Bertram told the Examiner that an example of this would be time spent by a correctional officer to escort people to a phone bay. The FCC said this was an interim measure while it sought comment for a permanent version. 
Hardtke’s full list of items that receive funding from the commission was: “mail processing services, driver education simulation equipment, recreation equipment, exercise equipment, library resources, TVs, cable TV, art supplies, re-entry portfolios, puzzles, yarn, activity books, CD/DVD players, movies, dayroom microwaves, incentive prizes, visiting room toys/activities, media credits, dayroom newspapers, magazine subscriptions, modern technology improvements and services, bus tickets for release, dayroom ice machines, personal laundry washing machines and repairs, barber services, religious and chapel supplies and services, legal loans, lanyards, burial/cremation for unclaimed bodies, dayroom game tables, dayroom board and card games, graduation ceremonies expenses, and more.”
Before the rollback in October, the FCC postponed its rate cap rules in June. In a November interview, Bertram said she’d already heard from families about the cost of connection going up in the wake of the loss of the 2024 caps. 
“This is going to come as a shock to a lot of families who had gotten a lot of relief from the 2024 rules,” Bertram said.

Our state faces important challenges when it comes to keeping our young people, maintaining local services and supporting our health care system, writes columnist Khale Lenhart.
The post Wyoming faces critical questions in 2026 appeared first on WyoFile .","A new year is a natural time for reflection and looking ahead. This year promises to be another important one for Wyoming, with a major statewide election and big decisions to be made about our state’s future. Looking ahead to the coming year, what are some of the major political issues we are likely to see debated?

Opinion

One key issue that will be at the forefront of many debates is what we should expect of local and county governments. Last year, the Wyoming Legislature instituted significant cuts to funding for local and county governments. Just one year in, we have seen counties and municipalities dipping into reserves to make ends meet, programs shutting down and services ending. This will only continue as reserves run out and local elected officials must make decisions on where to spend fewer and fewer dollars. 
We will see whether the people of Wyoming approve of this new style of government as roads deteriorate, infrastructure like sewer and water goes without necessary maintenance, and local services like parks, street plowing, libraries and senior centers are defunded.. Local government is often the most responsive and most impactful for our day-to-day lives, but current trends point to less local control and more power being concentrated in the state capital in Cheyenne. Expect this debate to continue.
Access to quality and affordable health care is also likely to be a major issue. Wyoming has unique challenges in this area, as our large state, low population and dispersed cities make it difficult to provide access to necessary health care across the state. We simply do not have the population base to support the full range of necessary services in all communities. Some hospitals in smaller population centers have already stopped providing vital services. For example, cities like Evanston, Rawlins, Wheatland and Kemmerer have seen their hospitals close or pause inpatient maternity services, leaving these communities without a place where expecting mothers can have their children. They must now drive to other communities, sometimes hours away, to receive necessary care. Determining how to provide health care, especially in rural communities, in a way that is economically viable for both the providers and patients, is a massive issue that we have not made much progress on yet. As our population ages, this issue is likely to become more and more urgent.
Education is also likely to be at the forefront of many debates. Our state constitution requires the Legislature to fund a top-quality education, although the question of how and what should be included is a matter of significant debate. The Wyoming Supreme Court is considering two cases that are likely to have major implications on the future of education in Wyoming, as it decides whether the state can issue direct payments to parents for non-public education and whether the state has adequately funded our public system. Regardless of the outcome of these cases, public schools in Wyoming still must provide education in an ever-changing environment. Education is the single largest expense of our state budget and will undoubtedly demand major attention. 
Perhaps the greatest question for the long-term outlook of our state is how we stem the tide of outmigration of our young people. We are an attractive state for retirees or those who have already built a career or business, but we fall behind when it comes to those starting professional life. The answer is not just low taxes. If that were the case, we would be in great shape, as our tax burden is among the lowest in the nation. We must decide to do something more to build places where families are confident they can prosper. Quality careers, access to amenities beyond just our outdoors, the education, health care and community infrastructure that gives people confidence that they can meet their necessary needs at home. All of these are areas that require attention and are likely to be major issues of public debate in the coming year.
All these topics have a common thread. They all wrestle with the question of what our state looks like in the future and what type of lives our fellow citizens will lead. We must decide whether we want prosperity or whether we want to hold fast and watch the society around us wither away. Most voters do not spend their time following legislative debates or subscribing to political dogma. They want to live good lives, provide for their families and feel like they are making progress. Political decisions can make all the difference when it comes to how our families and communities operate. Let’s hope that all of us, citizens and officials alike, recognize the importance of finding the right solutions to the questions ahead.

Getty ImagesNearly three-quarters of all state student aid money nationwide was based on financial need rather than merit in the 2022-2023 school year, according to the College Board.
In Georgia, that number was around 1%.
Georgia is an outlier when it comes to the money available for college students without the money for an education or the grades and test scores for a merit-based scholarship.
But that could be changing with the expansion of the University of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship program announced by Gov. Brian Kemp Thursday.
Kemp proposed a one-time investment of $325 million in state funding for the program, which is seen as a potential companion to the merit-based HOPE Scholarship launched in 1993 under Gov. Zell Miller.
“In this era of high prices and new challenges for those graduating from high school, we also recognize the advantage need-based financial assistance can give to those who would not otherwise be able to access higher education,” Kemp said in an address to the state Legislature.
“Like their peers who have the means to attend college, these students have great dreams for rewarding careers and impactful lives, but they do not always have hope that those dreams can become reality,” he added.
The new scholarship could provide up to $3,000 to students who meet qualifications, including that they work or volunteer at least part time. Recipients also need to be Georgia residents, demonstrate financial need after all their other scholarships and grants are considered and complete a financial literacy course.
Georgia student loan borrowers have the second-highest average student loan balance in the nation at $42,300, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Of the $325 million, $25 million would be direct scholarship money, and the rest would serve as seed money for an endowment, the proceeds of which the foundation would withdraw from every year to pay for the scholarships. The plan is to grow the endowment so it could support offering tens of millions of dollars in aid to students.
Sen. Nan Orrock, an Atlanta Democrat, called the plan “a tremendous victory.”
“This is a work of labor of a good nine years from people around the state, committed educators and counselors who saw students just falling through the cracks because their families were not in a position to write a check for their higher education financing,” she said.
Orrock chaired a Senate committee that met several times last year to study college affordability. That committee estimated that annual funding of over $120 million could have funded about 99,000 students per year, Orrock said. The committee also recommended using money from the Georgia Lottery’s unrestricted reserve to pay for scholarships, a pot of money Kemp and his fellow Republicans have been loath to draw from for recurring expenses.
Orrock said she was unbothered that Kemp’s proposal did not match the committee recommendations.
“We’re on the road, and we’re optimistic that there’s going to be broad buy-in for this vision,” she said. “And as we see the success rate, the successes that come from it, we’re going to continue to build it to fully fill the need that’s out there.”
Ashley Young, senior education analyst with the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said advocates have been calling for needs-based aid in Georgia for decades and called the plan exciting but said she will be waiting to see further details, especially what kind of financial need students will need to demonstrate.
“It’s a little bit hard to understand how much of an impact it can make, just because we don’t have some of those specifics answered,” she said. “But certainly the model of ensuring that we are establishing a program that is based solely on student need and not merit is a step in the right direction.”
State Rep. Chuck Martin, an Alpharetta Republican who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, expressed confidence that the program will benefit Georgia students.
“I don’t have all the details, but I have great trust in the governor for putting that in the budget,” he said. “So I look forward to working with them on what’s necessary to see the implementation. We just want to see the investments that are made be productive, and I’m sure they have a plan to do that.”

Will it survive?",Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/15/school-choice-house-passes-mississippi-trump/,"Rep. Rob Roberson, left, answers questions from Rep. John G. Faulkner about House Bill 2 on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026, at the State Capitol in Jackson.","The Mississippi House narrowly passed a major public-education overhaul Thursday after four hours of debate that centered on school choice — but also invoked President Trump, rifles and shotguns, the Psalm of David, pimps and meth addicts and even sexual innuendo.
The bill, authored by Republican Speaker Jason White, passed 61-59. Seventeen Republicans broke with White and voted no, and two Republicans did not vote.
The razor-thin margin is likely not the homerun that White wanted to see in his chamber, after his months-long campaign to expand school choice in Mississippi. The slim passage puts the bill’s future in doubt, with the Republican Senate leadership vowing to kill it, or at least the parts that would spend tax dollars on private schooling.
School choice refers to a collection of policies that give parents more power over their children’s education. But opponents argue that in doing so, public money is siphoned away from the public education system into private schools or the highest-performing public schools.  
White has been at the center of efforts to broaden school choice policies in Mississippi, one of the few states in the Southeast without an expansive program. The drive has, in large part, come from national conservative groups and the Trump administration.
Rep. Jeffrey Harness, Democrat from Fayette, acknowledged that pressure during the floor debate. 
“I know y’all have to do everything that Donald Trump tells you to do,” he said. “I mean, if he tells you to jump off a cliff, you’re gonna jump off a cliff.”
The crux of the divide in the House is ideological, representatives made clear on Thursday.

Democrats, led in dissent by House party leader Robert Johnson III from Natchez, said they believe the state’s public-education system should be rewarded for its recent success and that school choice would harm public schools, which must accept all students. In contrast, House Republicans said that parents, not the government, deserve the ultimate say over where and how their children are educated. Republican Rep. Celeste Hurst of Sandhill, in an unconventional opening, introduced the bill — estimated to cost the state $162 million overall and headlined by an education savings account program that would send public dollars to families to pay for private school tuition — by acknowledging its 446-page length.
“The opponents have called it gargantuan,” she said. “I have even heard the word ‘girth’ tossed around. And I get it, it’s really hard to embrace something that you can’t quite get your arms around … what’s also big is the issue we’re trying to address.” Others during the hourslong debate snickered as they used girth and similar innuendo.
And before the debate unfolded in earnest, Republican Rep. Jansen Owen of Poplarville, one of the authors and White’s right-hand man in the school choice push, was brought to tears.
“Supporting school choice doesn’t mean turning backs on public education. It means opening our eyes to the reality that every baby is unique and every baby is different,” he said, before turning away from the podium to gather himself.
There were recurrent themes throughout the floor discussion, including accountability, transparency and fears over resegregation. One major portion of the bill changes current law to remove the veto power of a home school district if a student wants to transfer out. The other school district, however, retains its power to accept or deny a student.
Johnson argued that idea was antithetical to public schools by definition. 
“If I live in a county, I can go to school in that county,” he said. “And if I show up at that school ugly, dirty, rambunctious, crazy, I don’t care what it is — they have to take you. That’s what public education is.”
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, who represents Starkville, brushed off concerns that the public-school transfer provision would result in a concentration of high-performing students at the most well-resourced schools, causing rural, struggling schools with lower-income tax bases to lose students and, subsequently, close. 
Some Democrats likened it to the segregation of schools in the 1950s. 
“These schools that you’re talking about are going to close anyway,” Roberson refuted. “That’s the road they’re on.”
Lawmakers also took issue with private schools accepting state money, while adhering to their own standards, not public school standards. 
Rep. Bob Evans, a Democrat from Monticello, said there were no penalties in the bill, but Owen disagreed: If schools fail to educate students, their parents can send them elsewhere, he said. 
“Let me ask you a question: If little Johnny’s momma is on crystal meth, and little Johnny’s daddy is a pimp, can you tell me how they (are) gonna be able to choose that little Johnny is getting the right kind of education services when that’s not even on their plate?” Rep. John Hines, a Democrat from Greenville, asked. 
“I hope little Johnny has a good grandmomma,” Owen responded.

A handful of amendments offered by Johnson and Rep. Omeria Scott, a Democrat from Laurel, failed on the floor Thursday, including one presented by the latter to require a specific Psalm for provision of the bill that permits school boards to create policies that allow prayer at the beginning of the school day. 
While the House debated the lengthy House bill, Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, told Mississippi Today the Senate Republican majority does not support the House bill. Senate leaders have already passed a public-school transfer bill, filed legislation that mirrors portions of the House bill and made clear they don’t plan to entertain an education savings account program to spend tax dollars on private schools.
He also alluded to moves by House Republican leaders to finagle votes in a Wednesday committee meeting, such as asking some members to skip the meeting instead of voting no.
“The Senate position is what we passed and I’m going to support the Senate position,” DeBar said. “I’ve got votes on a single bill, I’m not twisting arms or asking people to walk. I’ve got the full support of the Senate. When the House bill gets here, if it gets here, we’ll deal with it in due course.”
But White on Thursday after adjournment denied any heavy arm twisting of House Republicans. He told reporters that he asked his members to vote ‘yes’ on the bill, and that pressure has come from their constituents and “politics,” not House leadership.  
And if the Senate kills his bill, White said senators will “answer to the voters” and suggested that Gov. Tate Reeves would call a special session to reconsider school choice expansion. 
“ I’m hopeful and optimistic that we can find some common ground,” he said. “The same people that voted for these representatives, voted for those senators, and I just can’t believe we’re that far apart.”
DeBar said he plans to call a committee meeting next week to handle noncontroversial bills. He plans to have his committee consider whatever version of House Bill 2 passes the House, but did not say when that would be. 
“My preference is to bring the bill up as is and not have amendments made to it because I think the committee needs to consider the bill in its totality and make a decision on how they want to move forward with it,” he said.

House Democrats outlined their plans moving forward at a press conference on the Capitol’s second floor steps immediately after adjournment.
“We hope the position of the Senate remains steadfast on this issue, and we’ll continue to talk to them and encourage them, along with everyone else in the House and Senate,” Johnson said. 
The bill was held on a motion to reconsider, a procedural motion that could bring more debate or another vote on the bill before it could move to the Senate.

Larry Rhoden speaks during a press conference on Jan. 15, 2026, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A day before lawmakers were set to debate a bill that would dash his exclusive authority to dole out awards from an employer-funded pool of economic development dollars, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order to place “guardrails” on his use of the funds.
When asked during a Thursday press conference if he’s pushing back against allegations that he and his predecessor improperly used the fund, Rhoden said that’s not the case.
“I think it’s just to put in writing and give the legislators a comfort level that this is what we’re looking at when we’re making these decisions on Future Fund projects,” Rhoden said.
Governor hits the road to award more state grants; opponents call it campaigning

The Future Fund was created in the 1980s to allow South Dakota governors to nimbly advance economic development projects without intervention from lawmakers or oversight from a state board or committee. The fund’s money comes from a fee employers pay when they submit payroll taxes to the state’s unemployment benefits program.
The fund falls under the umbrella of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. That agency has a board that reviews and approves awards in most circumstances, but the board doesn’t sign off on Future Fund awards.
The fund has drawn controversy in recent years, largely for the manner of its use by Rhoden’s predecessor, former Gov. Kristi Noem. 
Noem, now the secretary for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, used Future Fund dollars to pay for a gun range lawmakers declined to help pay for, and to help pay for a rodeo at which she appeared and workforce development ads that featured her as the star. 
Rhoden has used the money a handful of times during the year he’s spent in office, funding industrial parks in Aberdeen and Watertown and supporting a biotechnology company in Brookings. 
His executive order preserves the governor as the sole decision maker on the use of dollars from the Future Fund. The board would remain tangential and have no authority to review or overturn a decision.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The order does, however, lay out procedures on how Future Fund beneficiaries get the money, and it requires transparency on the awards. 

Grants must come on a reimbursement basis, the order says, and the entity securing the grant must prove it’s paid its bills before accessing the money, but the economic development commissioner can waive that requirement. 
The economic development office ought to, “when feasible,” require that the beneficiaries invest matching dollars into funded projects.
Awardees must have conflict-of-interest policies in place.
Awards and award agreements must be posted on the OpenSD.gov website, and the economic development commissioner must sign the agreement.
The economic development office must report on its use of Future Fund dollars biannually to the legislature’s Joint Committee on Appropriations.

Rhoden told a group of reporters that the order’s dictates offer transparency on the process, and that they are essentially “a direct reflection of how we do business today.”
Legislative interest
The Appropriations Committee already gets reports on Future Fund spending. Some lawmakers had aimed to reduce the fund’s revenue in 2024, but ultimately opted to back a bill that created the reporting requirement.
A bill to repeal the Future Fund’s revenue source failed by four votes in the state House of Representative in 2025.
Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

The first bill filed in the Senate for 2026 would move the authority to spend Future Fund dollars from the governor to the economic development board, which has 13 members appointed by the governor. It would also require the economic development office to spell out the criteria for awards and set interest rates for loans.
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said she still hopes her bill is approved. It’s scheduled to receive its first hearing Friday morning in the Senate State Affairs Committee.
It’s important, Howard said, that guidelines for the expenditure of taxpayer dollars are set by the Legislature. Governors can rescind executive orders, and there’s no clear mechanism for enforcement if a governor were to ignore existing executive orders.
“Different governors will do different things,” Howard said. “Certain governors will spend this money on rodeos, and other governors may spend it the way it was originally intended.”
When asked if he’d support a bill if it contained the exact language of his executive order, Rhoden said Thursday that he hates to comment on hypotheticals, but that he couldn’t see a reason why he wouldn’t.
Howard said she would consider bringing such a bill if her own proposal fails.
“I do believe something needs to be in statute,” she said.
Even so, she said, the question on who has the authority to spend money from the fund is a point of contention for her. The economic development board ought to review awards, she said.
“I don’t believe one person should be the deciding factor in how those funds are spent,” Howard said. “So I want it to go before several people.”
At Rhoden’s Thursday press conference, Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen said the executive order, in leaving the decision-making authority with the governor, preserves what he sees as the Future Fund’s primary value.
“You need to have a tool that is flexible and they can act quickly,” Venhuizen said. “And I think a positive thing about the Future Fund is that there is one person who’s accountable, the governor.”
Broader debate on economic development
The Future Fund discussion dovetails with a larger discussion on the role of economic development that’s grown into a rift among Republicans.
Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, is one of three candidates running against Rhoden in this year’s Republican primary for governor. Hansen has repeatedly decried state funding for economic development projects as “corporate welfare,” and his running mate, Canton Republican Rep. Karla Lems, is the prime sponsor of Howard’s Future Fund bill in the House of Representatives.
Lawmaker wants longer ‘cooling-off period’ for those who parlay public work into private-sector jobs

A few hours after Rhoden’s press conference, the state Senate took up a resolution meant to encourage “honest economic development rooted in the republican principles of limited government, deregulation, and organic entrepreneurial growth.”
The resolution asked senators to agree that “the free market and the private sector, left alone, will best serve our economic interests.”
The resolution’s sponsor, Republican Sen. John Carley of Piedmont, told his fellow lawmakers that the businesses that wish to develop and thrive in South Dakota ought to be able to do so without the aid of taxpayer dollars.
Carley said offering taxpayer dollars to companies instead of pushing for lower taxes amounts to “corporatocracy.”
“Instead of choosing corporations, let’s choose the taxpayers,” he said.
The resolution failed on a 15-17 vote, with one senator absent. Carley signaled his intent to have the vote reconsidered.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EM8A4567-copy-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-15 18:57:36.949519

Brian Kemp gives two thumbs up at his final state of the state address in the Georgia Capitol Thursday. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp called for an expedited income tax rate cut and another tax rebate, new spending for law enforcement retirement savings and funding for a needs-based scholarship program in his annual state of the state address Thursday before the Georgia General Assembly. 
The speech — Kemp’s eighth and final address as governor — highlighted many of the policies that have shaped his legacy, including his efforts to raise wages for teachers and other state employees, issue tax rebates during years the state had a revenue surplus and shore up the state’s multibillion-dollar reserves. According to Kemp’s projections, Georgia’s state reserves and rainy day fund combined will have more than $10 billion by the time he leaves office. The state’s current reserves sit at $14.6 billion.
Traffic congestion, homelessness top Kemp’s agenda for his final year in office

“There’s no question the state of our state is stronger, more prosperous and safer today than it was in January of 2019,” he told lawmakers.
But Kemp’s speech also highlighted the rising costs of living across the state, and cautioned lawmakers against taking the state’s economic stability for granted.
“The reality is that too many of our citizens are still struggling to make ends meet and everyday costs are still too high,” he said. “Groceries, rent, insurance, clothes for the kids, it all adds up to more than it used to.”
In his speech, Kemp also previewed his priorities for his last legislative session as governor, which includes a proposal to accelerate a plan lowering the state income tax rate below 5%.
Kemp’s proposed tax cut would bring the state’s income tax rate to 4.99%, down from 5.19%. His proposal would take effect for this year’s tax year and cost the state about $750 million each year in future lost revenues. 
“This will fulfill a promise to the people of the state that I made during my re-election campaign to lower our state income tax rate to under 5% and with the General Assembly’s passage and my signature, it will come a full three years ahead of schedule,” he said.
But there is a push in the Senate to move aggressively toward eliminating Georgia’s income tax. A special Senate panel recently released a plan that would waive the tax on up to $50,000 a year for individuals and $100,000 for married couples starting in 2027 – and eliminate the income tax entirely by 2032. Republican House leaders say they are also readying a bill that would nix the property tax on primary residences. 
Victor Anderson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Rep. Victor Anderson, a Cornelia Republican and chair of the House Governmental Affairs Committee, said that with Kemp’s proposed accelerated income tax cut, lawmakers could consider some sort of property tax relief reduction without impacting local government services.
“I also think there’s plenty of room for us to work with our local government on property taxes and still allow them to provide the services the citizens need,” Anderson said.
Notably absent from Kemp’s speech were discussions of hot-button social issues like banning diversity, equity and inclusion efforts or restricting access to gender-affirming care.
Instead, Kemp centered his speech on cost-of-living issues, including a proposal to distribute a one-time $2,000 bonus to state employees, and fund a needs-based scholarship for Georgia students that had previously been funded through private donations. 
The University System of Georgia Foundation’s DREAMS Scholarship would complement the state’s existing HOPE Scholarship, which is awarded to students based on merit. Under Kemp’s proposed budget, the DREAMS Scholarship would receive a one-time contribution of $325 million from the state to create more opportunities for Georgia residents to graduate without student debt.
“I believe we owe it to every child to ensure they start out on a level playing field, no matter their zip code,” Kemp said. 
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley applauded Kemp’s push to fund the scholarship during his final year in office.
“We’ve been asking for a need-based scholarship for years,” she told reporters after the speech. “As you know, HOPE started out as a needs-based proposition, and they turned it into a merit-based scholarship. So I’m happy that on his way out the door, he’s giving a nod to something that we’ve been asking for for several years.”
But Hugley, a Columbus Democrat, also criticized Kemp’s proposal to send out one-time tax rebates to Georgia residents, saying it would not go far enough to address the state’s affordability issues.
This year’s rebates, which also require lawmakers’ approval, would be the fourth time Georgia taxpayers received an extra payment in recent years, and it would again show up as $250 for individuals, $375 for head of household and $500 for married couples filing jointly. All told, the rebates would cost the state’s rainy day funds about $1.2 billion.
The rebates “will not take care of the needs that most families are thinking about,” she said. “They’re thinking about child care. They’re thinking about paying rent. But a one-time $250, a one-time $500, what is that really going to do?”
Kemp also released his budget proposals Thursday. Here are some other notable details from his spending plans: 
Kemp’s budget would use $46.4 million to replace the recent reduction of federal funding for a key food aid program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The cuts were included in last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The governor’s plan would also add about $18 million to go toward reducing the state’s payment error rate to avoid future federal funding cuts to the program. 
Roughly $2 billion in Kemp’s proposed budget would go toward highway improvements around metro Atlanta, and another $250 million would be allocated to local road projects. Rural parts of the state would also receive $100 million to strengthen or replace failing bridges, and $35 million for natural gas infrastructure upgrades. He highlighted these infrastructure projects at Wednesday’s Eggs and Issues event. 
The proposal would also include $5 million to fund a full hand recount for this year’s election, and another $1.8 million to help scan and tabulate ballots based on the human-readable text.
The new spending will bring the size of this year’s budget up to $42.3 billion. Next year’s budget, which will take effect in July, is set at $38.5 billion. 
The governor sets the spending levels each year in his budget proposals, and while lawmakers can’t increase the money available, they can move money around in the budget to reflect their own priorities. Lawmakers are set to hold budget hearings next week.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Helping Rhode Islanders afford health insurance, home energy bills and child care is an expensive proposition: nearly $15 billion in fiscal 2027 under Gov. Dan McKee’s budget proposal.
The $14.9 billion tax-and-spend plan unveiled by McKee’s office Thursday marks the largest spending plan in state history — $522.6 million more than the current year’s budget although the dollar figure on fiscal 2026 is poised to cross the $15 billion dollar-mark under proposed revisions by the executive branch.
Embattled McKee highlights affordability, takes on Trump in 2026 State of State

The eye-popping button line comes amid stark federal funding cuts under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill) poised to decimate social safety net programs for vulnerable Rhode Islanders while increasing state costs. Indeed, the gap between state revenue and expenses is poised to swell to $537 million by fiscal 2031. Nearly one-third of the deficit stems directly from H.R. 1, according to analysis by the state Office of Management and Budget.
“It’s gotten worse, as you can tell,” Brian Daniels, budget office director, said in a press briefing with reporters Thursday. “That’s not particularly heartening.”
But the headline-grabbing bottom line belies what Joe Codega, state budget officer, insisted is a “disciplined process” with “modest” growth in state general revenue. Less than half — $6.0 billion — of the total fiscal 2027 spending would come from state coffers under McKee’s proposal. This represents an increase of 2.5% over the $5.8 billion included in the fiscal 2026 budget. Federal funding covers the bulk of the remaining spending plan, including $292 million in leftover pandemic aid that must be spent by the end of the calendar year. 
“The $15 billion headline, I realize, gets attention,” Codega said. “But it really is a broad universe of spending in that $15 billion total.”
Across the galaxy, here are 10 highlights to focus on:
1. Cleaning up the Big Beautiful Mess 
Many of the sweeping federal changes to eligibility and funding for social safety net programs don’t kick in for nearly a year, or more. 
But state administrators want to prepare. McKee’s proposal includes $19.3 million in state general revenues ($45 million across all funding sources) for information technology, full-time workers and contractors to implement the necessary changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This includes working to reduce the 12.3% error rate in distribution of SNAP benefits to avoid up to $50 million in federal penalties down the line, and updates to the RIBridges electronic benefits portal to ensure compliance with new Medicaid work requirements.
More than 33,500 Rhode Islanders are expected to be kicked off Medicaid by the end of the calendar year because of new federal work requirements, while a separate group of 13,000 who buy insurance through the state marketplace are likely to opt out of coverage this year because they can’t afford the higher premiums. 
 McKee’s budget proposes $10 million to offset hospitals’ uncompensated costs from treating uninsured patients, and another $9.5 million to help 6,500 of the lowest-income self-insured afford insurance through the state marketplace — though not until January 2027, one year after the federal discounts expired.
The Rhode Island Community Food Bank will also see its annual state grant double, from $1 million to $2 million — as McKee highlighted in his State of the State address Tuesday.

2. Tax the rich, save the seniors 
Bad news for millionaires, cigarette and cigar smokers: Your taxes will go up under McKee’s spending plan. Despite reticence at a tax on top earners in past years, the executive branch has finally acquiesced to the progressive call for an extra 3% tax on income over $1 million. 
“H.R. 1 really forced our hand on this,” Daniels said. The income tax is expected to bring in $67.1 million in fiscal 2027, rising to $135 million in fiscal 2028, affecting 7,800 people, 2,300 of whom are Rhode Island residents.
Also boosting state coffers: a 75-cent increase per pack of cigarettes to $5.25; raising the cap on cigar taxes from 50 cents to $2; and removing the 1.25% discount for cigarette distributors that stamp their own packages for a collective $8 million in additional revenue. This is the third year in a row that McKee has moved to raise the cigarette tax, though lawmakers nixed the move last year.
On the other side of the ledger, seniors collecting Social Security, families with minor children and motorists will see savings under a series of tax credits and cuts. A three-year phaseout of the state’s income tax on Social Security benefits— mirroring policies adopted by 42 other states — will ease costs on 32,000 seniors while meeting the AARP Rhode Island’s top legislative focus for the year. The move cuts $40 million from state coffers, however.
A new, permanent child tax credit, $325 per child, replaces the dependent exemption on state income tax filings to help level the benefit across income levels. The change will help 31,200 people — just over one-quarter of state tax filers. 
For motorists, McKee wants to roll back the 2-cent gas tax increase that took effect in July, reducing the gas tax from 40 to 38 cents per gallon, made possible after paying off motor fuel bonds. And for tax scofflaws, the administration is offering the first amnesty program since 2017, hoping easing up on delinquent taxes will generate some revenue, rather than none at all.
3. Electricity bills vs. environmental mandates 
McKee’s solution to soothe frustrations over rising home energy bills comes at the expense of state environmental mandates. His eight-pronged approach to save ratepayers $1 billion over the next five years — or $180 a year for the average customer using 585 kilowatt-hours of electricity — hinges on rollbacks to state mandates for renewable energy, energy efficiency and utility infrastructure upgrades.
Most significantly, the 2022 law requiring the state to generate 100% of its electricity needs from renewable sources, or purchase credits to offset the fossil fuel sources, has now been extended to 2050, matching the overall decarbonization deadline of the Act on Climate law. This will cut bill costs for ratepayers by nearly $64 million in fiscal 2027. 
Large community net metering projects will also be charged a new fee to offset local taxes, project construction costs and interconnection upgrades, saving ratepayers $20 million collectively. And customer charges that fund energy efficiency projects will be capped — saving ratepayers another $21 million — with the reduced bill charges partially offset by $10 million in new state borrowing as part of a “green economy” bond. 
Acting Energy Commissioner Chris Kearns framed the decarbonization rollbacks as an attempt to balance climate goals with affordability concerns while recognizing the 180-degree shift in federal incentives for clean energy since President Donald Trump took office.
“Rhode Island ratepayers should not pay the price for President Trump’s chaos in Washington,” Kearns said during the briefing.
Despite advocates’ outrage at the executive profits and shareholder returns for Rhode Island Energy, McKee’s suite of changes only includes one direct cut to the utility supplier: eliminating an energy efficiency performance incentive for shareholders, which saves ratepayers $2.5 million a year.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, did not specifically respond to questions regarding the proposed cuts to company shareholders.
“We appreciate the Governor’s focus on energy affordability and look forward to reviewing the full details of his proposals and working with stakeholders to advance affordability measures as the legislative process unfolds,” Dalo said in an email Thursday.

4. Bonds. $600 million worth of bonds
McKee is proposing six bond initiatives totaling $600 million, a package representing the priciest ballot request in state history, even accounting for inflation, budget officials said.
That is 50% more than the $400 million bond package in 2020, which would be the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $515 million in November 2026. This year’s suggested bond bundle includes:

$215 million for higher education, with $105 million for an “Integrated Health Building” to support nursing, pharmacy, medicine and other interdisciplinary sciences at the University of Rhode Island; $50 million to renovate and add a student success center to the Adams Library at Rhode Island College; and $60 million for the Community College of Rhode Island to add a career and technical education center to its Warwick campus.
$120 million for housing development, divided into $25 million for home production and $95 million to preserve the state’s stock of affordable housing via redevelopment, construction, property acquisition, and improved infrastructure. 
$115 million for economic development, with $70 million for site development at the Quonset Business Park in North Kingstown as well as the I-195 Redevelopment District in Providence. The other $45 million would flow toward “growth industry” infrastructure meant to fortify the state’s ocean, defense, life science and data analytics sectors. 
$50 million for the green economy, spread out across initiatives like energy efficiency programs, shoreline resilience efforts, land conservation, watershed restoration, brownfield remediation, and local recreation efforts — a bond very similar to the one voters approved in 2024.
$50 million for career and technical education — a workforce-centric centerpiece of educational policy both locally and nationally — for improving programs and facilities in public schools statewide via a grant pool administered by the state education department.  
$50 million for the cultural economy, including $45 million for Secretary of State Gregg Amore’s much-pined-for state history center. It’s less than the $60 million Amore asked for to house Rhode Island’s most cherished and delicate artifacts, but the governor hopes Amore could make up the $15 million difference with some alternate funding sources. The remaining $5 million in this bond would fund preservation grants for municipalities and nonprofits.

5. No fiscal cliff, no service returns either for RIPTA
After declining to fill a $32.6 million dollar deficit in his recommended fiscal year 2026 budget, McKee pledged in his State of the State speech to “fully close” the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) projected $13.8 million deficit for fiscal 2027.
McKee recommends a $9.3 million annual increase to RIPTA’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account, funded primarily by vehicle registration fees, from $5 million to $14.3 million.
Also plugging RIPTA’s deficit would be $1 million generated from a proposed increase in fees assessed per passenger on cruise ships that visit Newport. Since 2024, cruise ships have been charged $10 per passenger embarking or boarding from the city by the sea — all of which has been collected by the municipality. McKee proposes increasing the fee by $5 to $15.
McKee also recommends a $3.5 million allocation of capital funds toward bus purchases — money the quasi-governmental agency had taken out of its operating budget.
RIPTA will continue to receive the 2-cent gas tax increase approved by lawmakers last year, even as Gov. Dan McKee has pledged to roll back the overall tax.
The governor’s commitment is still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall, when RIPTA reduced service on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history.
So why not add more revenue?
“This was their proposal and we filled that gap,” Andrea Palagi, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said Thursday.
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand thanked McKee for plugging the agency’s latest financial gap.
“This investment affirms the progress we have made over the past year to stabilize our finances, operate more efficiently, and better align service with the needs of riders and employers across the state,” he said in a statement to Rhode Island Current. “Through more than $30 million in cost-savings measures, increased federal reimbursements, and new revenue sources, RIPTA has taken meaningful steps to strengthen its long-term sustainability while continuing to serve the people who rely on transit every day.”

6. Truck tolls still stalled, bridge oversight returning in-house at RIDOT
Keep waiting for the state to restart its truck tolling program. 
McKee’s administration had anticipated $10 million in revenue for fiscal 2026, but the gantries set up on state highways under the Gina Raimondo-era RhodeWorks program still remain offline. That’s because state transportation officials found much of the equipment needs to either be replaced or updated before tractor trailers get tolled again.
Officials declined to say when the gantries will reactivate, just that it won’t be before June 30. Whenever they do turn on in the upcoming fiscal year, McKee’s budget recommendation assumes the tolls will bring in $20 million into the state’s coffers, increasing to $40 million in annual revenue starting in fiscal 2028.
Come July 1, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) could hire two new civil engineers to provide “inspection oversight” over the state’s inventory of 1,206 bridges, costing $356,492 in state funding.
RIDOT Director Peter Alviti Jr. told lawmakers during a Nov. 13 oversight hearing on the Washington Bridge that the department had no in-house ability to check the adequacy of work of contractors who maintain and inspect Rhode Island’s bridges.
Helena Buonanno Foulkes, McKee’s 2026 Democratic gubernatorial rival, has called for the creation of an “Office of Accountability” within RIDOT responsible for oversight and making sure contracts are fair and the work is being done.
7. New education funding formula? What new education funding formula?
This year, like last, McKee wants to give an incremental boost to the numbers behind the formula to determine the state’s share of public education costs, hopefully redirecting more money to school districts with higher numbers of students living in poverty. 
Overall, the governor’s proposal represents a $17.5 million raise for per-pupil formula aid, or a 3.1% increase from last year. The so-called “student success factor” would rise from 40% to 43% in the funding formula and would account for $14.2 million additional K-12 aid. 
The state is using October enrollment data as the baseline for its formula calculations. That autumnal data led to some troubles last year when the state undercounted the amount of multilingual learners as well as the amount of children living in poverty, but Daniels said the state is “in better shape” this year because of improved data matching work across certain state agencies. “There was a big swing last year, so we really focused a lot on data accuracy,” he said. “I don’t know that we’re fully there yet.” 
Meanwhile, the recently publicized report of a Rhode Island Foundation commission shows how the state could forge a new calculation of what to give school districts. While consideration of this new algebra is underway at the General Assembly — the state Senate is set to receive a presentation on the retooled funding formula Thursday, for instance — McKee’s team is sticking to the method of bean counting the state has relied on for approximately 15 years. When a reporter asked why McKee hadn’t opted for the shiny new formula in this year’s budget, Daniels joked, “Well, it came out 10 days ago, and it cost $600 million.” 
Daniels then took a more serious tone and noted the commission’s report has “some very thoughtful ideas” but the fiscal forecast does make it look “difficult” for the state to absorb even more education costs than it already does. 
McKee is also proposing a $2.5 million increase for high-cost special education categorical funding for a total of $20 million. High cost special education is defined as students whose needs are more than quadruple the formula’s most core instructional amount. 
8. He wants the (veto) power 
After landing in legislative purgatory following the fiscal 2026 budget process — McKee declined to sign the final spending plan but refused to veto it either — he’s back with the perennial solution of executive branches past: a line-item veto.  
Rhode Island is an outlier — one of only six states that don’t let their executive branch reject individual items within their annual budget. But the path to changing the state’s constitution is long and onerous. Without a constitutional convention, McKee’s push for more power must first pass muster with the Rhode Island General Assembly and then with voters as a ballot question.
There is no direct cost for the policy change. So why was it included in McKee’s budget proposal — listed as an “affordability initiative” in a handout supplied to reporters?
“It relates to the administration of the budget,” Daniels said. “We view this as an area where we can have long-term cost containment.”
The Rhode Island General Assembly would still be able to override executive vetoes by a three-fifths majority vote in both chambers. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson did not address McKee’s veto plan in a joint statement Thursday.
“The submission of the Governor’s budget today signals the start of a very public budget process over the next several months,” they said. “The respective House and Senate Finance Committees will carefully review all of the proposals at televised hearings and we encourage all interested parties to provide in-person or written testimony.”

9. A Band-Aid for a bleeding health care system 
The governor proposed modest increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates and accompanying funding for cash-strapped hospitals, nursing homes and health centers, and the providers who work within them.
Rather than relying on the July 1 reimbursement rates recommended by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, McKee’s administration proposes a slightly lower, 2.5% increase for hospitals, nursing homes and federally qualified health centers to match the state’s projected revenue growth.
Daniels acknowledged this would not be welcomed by health care providers and facilities. “Yes, you probably want more, but you are going to get what we’re getting,” he said. 
This, on top of regularly scheduled increases in hospital licensing fees based on updated patient revenue figures, would pad state coffers with another $232.5 million in fiscal 2027.
Nearly $120 million in inflation-adjusted reimbursement increases ($46 million from state coffers) for home health aides and providers who work with people with developmental disabilities and young children will be doled out over two years, rather than a single year as the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner recommended. 
But the health insurance commissioner would be able to wield more power over insurers that fail to meet state caps on annual premium increases, an answer to the double-digit insurance hikes that marked the 2024 and 2025 rate review processes. 
There’s no money for Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital as the drawn-out sale reaches decision day, but the executive branch is working closely with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General on contingency planning, Daniels said.
10. More beds for Veterans in Bristol 
McKee’s office pledged in October that he wouldn’t make any cuts to the Rhode Island Veterans Home in Bristol. The governor not only stuck to that promise but wants to commit a potential $3 million in fiscal year 2027 as part of a two-year plan that would reopen 16 beds for veterans on the campus. 
The 16 beds represent half the full capacity of the Foxtrot neighborhood, which has been closed since the pandemic due to a lack of staff needed to tend to residents in the unit. McKee’s allotment provides for up to 22 full-time resident care roles, plus two more jobs for administrative tasks like training, recruitment and retention. The governor’s budget estimates the Veterans Home could reach its full occupancy of 208 beds in fiscal year 2028.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Outdoor learning for K-12 kids, expanding trade pathways in middle schools, universal pre-k and bilingual education were top of the education platform announced Thursday by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland.
Haaland, a former U.S. congresswoman and U.S. The Secretary of the Interior made the announcement of her platform from a classroom in Albuquerque’s Highlands Highschool, the last of the 13 public schools she attended in childhood, due to constant moves  by her military family.
“Every step in a child’s education should open doors for them, from pre-k to grade school to whatever they decide to do after. Our kids can’t do that alone though, they need stability at home and their educators should feel supported to do the jobs they need to do,” Haaland said.
When asked, Haaland said if elected, she would continue to support free universal child care, a policy announced by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is term-limited from seeking office again.
Haaland acknowledged that lawmakers and the executive disagree on how to pay for the program but said if she’s sworn in: “I’ll be happy to see where it is and I’ll take it from there.”
Supporters included the New Mexico American Federated Teachers Union leadership, teachers, and the Democratic chairs of both education committees in the Legislature.
Picaris Pueblo Gov. Craig Quanchello praised the plan for “investing in Native schools and children to meet their unique needs,” in a speech endorsing Haaland.
“I’m honored to stand before an amazing person and support her. Education is strongest when it reflects who our children are and the communities that raise them,” he said.

Evans received treatment at one of Mississippi's 12 community mental health centers.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Less than 48 hours after terminating over $14 million of Mississippi mental health grants, the federal government informed organizations that their funding will be fully restored. 
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration cancelled nearly $2 billion of grants across the country Tuesday, according to NPR. In Mississippi, government health centers, private nonprofits and universities were told to stop all work funded by those grants — mainly related to addiction and children’s services. 
By Tuesday evening, Mississippi Today had learned about roughly $9.2 million of cancelled Mississippi grants. Later that night, the state Department of Mental Health accounted for an additional $4.9 million that had been terminated to Mississippi State University, University of Southern Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Health Institute. 
Wendy Bailey, the mental health department’s executive director, said Tuesday night there could have been other terminated grants her agency hadn’t learned about yet. 
A Tuesday letter the federal mental health department sent to grantees said the cancellations were final because “no corrective action could align the award with current agency priorities.” But by Thursday morning, the agency sent the same organizations a short message to “disregard the prior termination notice and continue program activities as outlined in your award agreement.”

Nationwide, all $2 billion of the cuts from earlier this week were reversed, according to Roll Call. A spokesperson for the federal agency did not answer Mississippi Today’s call and email about the terminations and restorations.
Four of Mississippi’s 12 community mental health centers, local public organizations that serve people regardless of their ability to pay, were set to lose $8.7 million. Phaedre Cole, the Mississippi Association of Community Mental Health Centers president and the executive director of a center that serves the Delta, called the unexpected terminations and restorations “whiplash.” 
She said she was encouraged by the swift, bipartisan pushback to protect critical Mississippi mental health services that were already underfunded. But the previous 48 hours had left her and other executive directors frazzled. 
“It’s terrifying to us because we know we are the place of last resort for thousands of people across the state,” she said. “If we are to disappear, we will not disappear quietly.”
Shortly after receiving notice that the Department of Mental Health’s grant had been restored Thursday, Bailey said the last two days had been a whirlwind. But she’s grateful Mississippi mental health providers can continue providing important services. 
“We must remember that behind these dollars are services and supports that are being provided to our neighbors, friends, family members, and people throughout our communities,” she said.
Communicare, the community mental health center serving Oxford and the surrounding counties, was set to lose more than any other organization Bailey’s department heard from. Melody Madaris, Communicare’s executive director, said the losses would force her agency to cut back on preventing opioid overdoses, restructure services for school children and halt other planned programs. 
Thursday morning, before she had officially heard that the federal government would restore her grant, Madaris said services funded by federal grants are often the ones most people don’t notice unless they need them — transporting people from rural homes to receive antipsychotic medications, working with food banks to deliver meals to patients and other resource-intensive services. 
“Those are the things we do to keep our community healthy,” she said. “Without the federal funding, these are things that we won’t be able to do as much of.” 
Right after the federal government sent her an email restoring the funds, she texted Mississippi Today: “A sigh of relief and back to work as usual helping the citizens of Mississippi struggling with mental health and substance use issues.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29162137/3X0A8546.jpg,,,2026-01-15 14:57:28.918251

(Peña-Melnyk photo by Christine Condon, Ferguson photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s presiding officers opened the 2026 General Assembly by reminding their respective chambers that pocketbook issues should be their primary concern as lawmakers try to address rising costs without adding to them with new taxes.
The speeches by new House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), now in his seventh year leading the chamber, come as the legislature faces an estimated $1.5 billion budget deficit in the fiscal 2027 budget and demands for increased spending on education and health care, among other areas.
They also come at a time when state residents face steadily increasing costs for utilities, health care and housing, issues that must be at the top of lawmakers’ concerns when making decisions, the leaders said.
“The big issues for us to tackle are far from a secret,” Ferguson said during a roughly 10-minute speech after being unanimously reelected to lead the chamber. “Despite the actions we took last year, our state faces another $1.4 billion deficit. We still must invest in kids and health care. We continue to have an energy affordability crisis in Maryland, and Marylanders are getting whiplash from the increasing cost of their utility bills.”
Peña-Melnyk, elected by acclamation to her first term as speaker, said she fears her children will not be able to buy a home, and told the story of the surging utility bills faced by one of her daughters, a medical student in Baltimore.
“She keeps her thermostat at 60 degrees,” Peña-Melnyk said, “because her last utility bill was more than $300.”
89 days to go, but on day one of the legislative session it’s all back slaps and applause lines

The rising cost could mean that the House of Delegates takes a harder tack with utility companies, Peña-Melnyk said in a meeting with reporters after the House session.
“I told my members to be innovative, to be creative, and to leave it all out there, all right? We need to get relief,” she said. “Now, I will work with the companies, and I will sit down … and talk it out and compromise. But the number one issue that I’m concerned [about] are the people of Maryland.”
Peña-Melnyk has already voiced her support for House Bill 1, a measure that would prohibit certain utility companies from using ratepayer funds for employee bonuses.
The solutions to Maryland’s affordability challenges could come from delegates on either side of the aisle, Peña-Melnyk noted, even though Democrats hold a super-majority in both House and Senate.
“See your fingers?” she said, raising her hand into the air during a roughly 30-minute speech. “They’re not the same. Not the same, but you need them all for your hand to function. There is no reason why we can’t do that here.”
She asked all 141 delegates in the chamber to make suggestions, including about how to respond to a series of damaging audits for Moore administration agencies, which have included reports on lapses by the state foster care system and costly leases for state office buildings.
“How can we provide stronger oversight to ensure that agency audits are addressed and the taxpayer funds are wisely protected? Think about that,” Peña-Melnyk told the House.
Despite the need for cuts to close the budget shortfall, Peña-Melnyk said funds in the state’s multibillion-dollar edcucation reform pan, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, shouldn’t be among the cuts. As a young girl who immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic and did not speak any English, Peña-Melnyk said the education system lifted her up, allowing her to become an attorney, then College Park city council member and, finally, a delegate and speaker of the House.
“The Blueprint is important,” she said. “I know that we have to figure things out, but we will. But can we all agree that education is a change-maker? Can we do that?”
‘Rooted in justice’
Both leaders worried that any gains lawmakers can come up with could be upended by Trump administration cuts to federal programs and federal jobs — Maryland lost 25,000 federal jobs through the first 11 months of 2025, the most of any state in the nation, according to recent state data.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ferguson said the legislature “must do three things this year.”
“One, we must grow our economy by capitalizing where Maryland can excel in industries like health care, higher education, quantum biomedical research, transportation and logistics and other private sectors that diversify our economy in the future,” he said. “Second, we must make decisions that ask this simple question: Did we enhance affordability for Marylanders, particularly in areas of health care, energy and housing?
“And third and finally, the Senate of Maryland must protect our state’s residents from what has been too often needlessly cruel [federal] government policies that have too often sown distrust,” Ferguson said.
After the Senate adjourned, Ferguson spoke with reporters on several topics, including immigration. He emphasized that Maryland will always protect immigrants, and has already thrown his support behind legislation, which failed last year,  to ban 287(g) agreements, which allow local police to perform certain immigration enforcement roles to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“We are a country built on immigrants,” Ferguson said. “Of course, we should enforce the law, but we don’t need to do it in a way that disrespects humanity. I think that’s what ICE has become, is a paramilitary force that has disrupted and been offensive to humankind, frankly.”
Those thoughts were echoed by Peña-Melnyk, who said immigrants in the U.S. “deserve to live with dignity and respect.”
“How can we as Americans stand by the disrespect, the abuses, people losing their lives, racial profiling, civil rights violation?” she said of recent aggressive ICE tactics. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat: What’s right is right. What’s wrong is wrong. You don’t treat any human being that way. My God that I believe in loves everyone.”
Both leaders also support legislation to prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including ICE agents. Under both Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 155, face coverings include a ski mask, neck gaiter or tactical mask. The bills wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation.”
With another budget deficit in Maryland, Republicans see an opportunity

SB1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), has been scheduled for a Jan. 22 hearing before the Judicial Proceedings Committee. No hearing has been set yet in the House Judiciary Committee for HB155, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s).
When asked if it would pass the House, Peña-Melnyk said, “Yes.”
Ferguson brushed off questions about how state laws would apply to federal officers.
“How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution,” he said. “I know there is contention about this, but that will have to be figured out in the courts.”
This year’s session is the last of the cycle for lawmakers, all of whom are up for reelection this fall — one of the reasons higher taxes were taken off the table early in the discussion on the current $1.5 billion budget shortfall. But the demands of this year make it different than a typical election year, Ferguson said.
“The old adage used to be that the election year sessions are quiet, where the General Assembly tries to punt on the hard topics and avoid rocking the boat too much. That will not be the case for the 2026 legislative session,” Ferguson said. “Circumstances dictate policy, and circumstances our residents are facing require bold and immediate action.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/speaker_president-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-15 04:57:11.778364

Its findings affirmed those concerns.,"Flaws in Connecticut’s special education system are impeding the state’s ability to provide adequate services to students, according to a report released Wednesday by state Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker.
Russell-Tucker commissioned the report six months ago amid concerns the state wasn’t doing enough to support students with disabilities. The findings affirmed many of those worries, revealing a system struggling with staffing shortages, arduous data collection software and a widespread lack of confidence in how disputes are resolved. As a result, children may struggle to access the resources they require for a free adequate public education — a legal standard also known as FAPE.
“We didn’t do this because we thought we were going to get a … report that says, ‘You’re doing everything well,'” Russell-Tucker told the State Board of Education at its meeting Wednesday. “That was not the point. 
“We did this because it was a need — to make sure that we understand and uncover where the challenges are, so we can literally be having this conversation today, very clearly and concisely, about what it is our next steps need to be,” Russell-Tucker said.
Representatives of WestEd, a consulting group, conducted the evaluation and presented the findings alongside Russell-Tucker at Wednesday’s meeting. 
Several individuals also shared views on the report during a public comment period at the meeting.
Andrew Feinstein, an attorney who represents children with disabilities and a founding member of the group Special Education Equity for Kids in Connecticut, called the report “devastating.”
“The fundamental problem appears to be that the Bureau of Special Education sees itself primarily as a conduit to transmit district-generated data to the federal Department of Education. It does not see itself as accountable to parents and teachers. The bureau is ineffective in improving results for students,” Feinstein told the board.
Kathryn Meyer, an attorney with the Center for Child Advocacy who works with low-income families, agreed. “Right now too many of our clients are sending their children with disabilities to school — our most vulnerable students — worried not just about the quality of their education, but their child’s safety and supervision. We are seeing district by district unable to provide adequate staffing support to meet their basic needs, and our children are paying the price,” Meyer wrote in an email to the Connecticut Mirror.
There was a bright spot: The report found Connecticut does routinely meet federal targets regarding special education.
The problem, Feinstein told CT Mirror, is that the state itself sets those targets. If the state sets and meets a low target, the federal government won’t see a problem, he said— even if a large number of kids still aren’t receiving adequate support.
That blind spot is what Russell-Tucker said she’d sought to clarify by commissioning the report. 
Rorie Fitzpatrick of WestEd, the consultancy that produced the report, praised the commissioner for taking a proactive approach to improving Connecticut’s approach to special education. “This was not a compelled endeavor. The compulsion here was a commitment to results for students,” Fitzpatrick told the board.
The report included four categories of recommendations to the state Department of Education. 
That included better defining the state’s “vision” for students with disabilities to ensure everyone in the system understands the goals and mission; mapping out and streamlining how staff and workflows are organized; coordinating more effectively within the department to address staffing shortages; and strengthening legal oversight and transparency in how the state handles disputes between parents and teachers.
That last category is especially important to families that feel schools are not adequately assisting children with disabilities, whether due to a staff shortage, an improper IEP or another issue.
Right now, Feinstein said, the most accessible option for low-income parents is the state’s administrative complaint process. The process is free, but it suffers from extended delays, and the results can be legally suspect, he said. As a result, Feinstein said, he seldom relies on state complaints.
Meyer told CT Mirror her organization has also experienced issues with the state complaint process.
“We have experiences with cases where … corrective action has not been fully monitored or enforced, and that’s something that we continue to urge [the state Department of Education] to really take a look at,” Meyer said. “Corrective action is not meaningful if a district doesn’t think it’s going to be required in a timely manner.”
Meyer also said she thought the report’s data on the number of complaints filed in the state seemed low. “That was surprising and doesn’t align with my experience,” she said.
In the report, WestEd recommended that the state hire a legal expert to support investigators and analyze their findings, with the aim of ensuring legal integrity and determining appropriate corrective actions. 
Meyer said that seems like a step in the right direction. “A lot of investigators have a lot of experience and want to do well by these families, but having someone with a legal lens to support them in that process, I think, is really critical,” she said.
Families who can afford to hire a lawyer can also set in motion what is known as due process. If they cannot reach an agreement with a school district, the case will eventually come before an impartial arbiter known as a hearing officer. 
These officers are similar to court magistrates, in that they are expected to render a finding that resolves the dispute. However, the report found widespread mistrust in the quality of Connecticut’s hearing officers, with doubts about how knowledgeable they are in federal and state law. 
By way of a solution, the report recommends that Connecticut establish clear criteria for hearing officer competence and make those criteria transparent to the public to rebuild trust. It also recommends providing guidance to parents without legal representation to help them navigate the process.
Feinstein urged the board to read the report’s findings and “demand that the department [of education] make fundamental change, both in the structure and operations of the Bureau of Special Education and, more importantly, by making clear that the mission is not to passively collect data, but to enhance the education of students with disabilities.”
Meyer concurred. “At its most fundamental level, SDE needs to prioritize the voices of parents, students, and educators by following through on WestEd’s recommendations, particularly around monitoring and enforcement of children’s legal rights to a meaningful and safe education,” she wrote in an email. “Urgent action and accountability are needed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_315-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898
