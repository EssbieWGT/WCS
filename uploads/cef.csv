,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-15 01:19:16+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Problems persist in CT special ed system despite federal compliance,Theo Peck-Suzuki,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/14/report-problems-persist-in-ct-special-ed-system-despite-federal-compliance/,The report was commissioned amid concerns CT wasn't doing enough to support students with disabilities. Its findings affirmed those concerns.,"Flaws in Connecticut’s special education system are impeding the state’s ability to provide adequate services to students, according to a report released Wednesday by state Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker.
Russell-Tucker commissioned the report six months ago amid concerns the state wasn’t doing enough to support students with disabilities. The findings affirmed many of those worries, revealing a system struggling with staffing shortages, arduous data collection software and a widespread lack of confidence in how disputes are resolved. As a result, children may struggle to access the resources they require for a free adequate public education — a legal standard also known as FAPE.
“We didn’t do this because we thought we were going to get a … report that says, ‘You’re doing everything well,'” Russell-Tucker told the State Board of Education at its meeting Wednesday. “That was not the point. 
“We did this because it was a need — to make sure that we understand and uncover where the challenges are, so we can literally be having this conversation today, very clearly and concisely, about what it is our next steps need to be,” Russell-Tucker said.
Representatives of WestEd, a consulting group, conducted the evaluation and presented the findings alongside Russell-Tucker at Wednesday’s meeting. 
Several individuals also shared views on the report during a public comment period at the meeting.
Andrew Feinstein, an attorney who represents children with disabilities and a founding member of the group Special Education Equity for Kids in Connecticut, called the report “devastating.”
“The fundamental problem appears to be that the Bureau of Special Education sees itself primarily as a conduit to transmit district-generated data to the federal Department of Education. It does not see itself as accountable to parents and teachers. The bureau is ineffective in improving results for students,” Feinstein told the board.
Kathryn Meyer, an attorney with the Center for Child Advocacy who works with low-income families, agreed. “Right now too many of our clients are sending their children with disabilities to school — our most vulnerable students — worried not just about the quality of their education, but their child’s safety and supervision. We are seeing district by district unable to provide adequate staffing support to meet their basic needs, and our children are paying the price,” Meyer wrote in an email to the Connecticut Mirror.
There was a bright spot: The report found Connecticut does routinely meet federal targets regarding special education.
The problem, Feinstein told CT Mirror, is that the state itself sets those targets. If the state sets and meets a low target, the federal government won’t see a problem, he said— even if a large number of kids still aren’t receiving adequate support.
That blind spot is what Russell-Tucker said she’d sought to clarify by commissioning the report. 
Rorie Fitzpatrick of WestEd, the consultancy that produced the report, praised the commissioner for taking a proactive approach to improving Connecticut’s approach to special education. “This was not a compelled endeavor. The compulsion here was a commitment to results for students,” Fitzpatrick told the board.
The report included four categories of recommendations to the state Department of Education. 
That included better defining the state’s “vision” for students with disabilities to ensure everyone in the system understands the goals and mission; mapping out and streamlining how staff and workflows are organized; coordinating more effectively within the department to address staffing shortages; and strengthening legal oversight and transparency in how the state handles disputes between parents and teachers.
That last category is especially important to families that feel schools are not adequately assisting children with disabilities, whether due to a staff shortage, an improper IEP or another issue.
Right now, Feinstein said, the most accessible option for low-income parents is the state’s administrative complaint process. The process is free, but it suffers from extended delays, and the results can be legally suspect, he said. As a result, Feinstein said, he seldom relies on state complaints.
Meyer told CT Mirror her organization has also experienced issues with the state complaint process.
“We have experiences with cases where … corrective action has not been fully monitored or enforced, and that’s something that we continue to urge [the state Department of Education] to really take a look at,” Meyer said. “Corrective action is not meaningful if a district doesn’t think it’s going to be required in a timely manner.”
Meyer also said she thought the report’s data on the number of complaints filed in the state seemed low. “That was surprising and doesn’t align with my experience,” she said.
In the report, WestEd recommended that the state hire a legal expert to support investigators and analyze their findings, with the aim of ensuring legal integrity and determining appropriate corrective actions. 
Meyer said that seems like a step in the right direction. “A lot of investigators have a lot of experience and want to do well by these families, but having someone with a legal lens to support them in that process, I think, is really critical,” she said.
Families who can afford to hire a lawyer can also set in motion what is known as due process. If they cannot reach an agreement with a school district, the case will eventually come before an impartial arbiter known as a hearing officer. 
These officers are similar to court magistrates, in that they are expected to render a finding that resolves the dispute. However, the report found widespread mistrust in the quality of Connecticut’s hearing officers, with doubts about how knowledgeable they are in federal and state law. 
By way of a solution, the report recommends that Connecticut establish clear criteria for hearing officer competence and make those criteria transparent to the public to rebuild trust. It also recommends providing guidance to parents without legal representation to help them navigate the process.
Feinstein urged the board to read the report’s findings and “demand that the department [of education] make fundamental change, both in the structure and operations of the Bureau of Special Education and, more importantly, by making clear that the mission is not to passively collect data, but to enhance the education of students with disabilities.”
Meyer concurred. “At its most fundamental level, SDE needs to prioritize the voices of parents, students, and educators by following through on WestEd’s recommendations, particularly around monitoring and enforcement of children’s legal rights to a meaningful and safe education,” she wrote in an email. “Urgent action and accountability are needed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0319_SR_Hearing_315-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-14 20:57:47.621898

Kim Reynolds lead a standing ovation for Iowa National Guard service members during her Condition of the State address Jan. 13, 2026. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)As Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke  Tuesday on her proposals on property taxes, veterans’ benefits and health initiatives this session in her Condition of the State message, she said finding ways to spend government funding effectively is key to all of these goals.
Reynolds, who has served as Iowa governor since 2017, announced in April 2025 she would not seek reelection, meaning 2026 will be her final session leading the state’s executive branch. In her remarks, she said she was entering the session “deeply grateful, fully committed, and determined to finish strong.”
One of the issues she said Iowans have told her is most important to address before she leaves office was reducing property taxes. The governor said her property tax bill, with text not yet available online, is a solution to address the growth rate of property taxes across the state, which she said are rising “faster than inflation, faster than paychecks and faster than population growth.”

At the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, Reynolds named property taxes as her top priority for the upcoming year. Over several months, she and legislators held meetings across the state with local government officials and community leaders discussing the state’s property tax system, in addition to holding roundtable discussions with Iowans about the impacts of property tax increases on Iowans.
Through these discussions and reflections on previous legislative attempts to limit local taxing authority, Reynolds said she found limits on specific levies are not an effective way to address property tax increases.
“So this year, we need to go after the real driver of the problem, spending,” Reynolds said. “Spending is what drives taxes, always has, always will. And the most reliable way to protect taxpayers is to limit the growth of government itself.”
The governor’s proposal would cap overall revenue for local government to 2% growth each year, with an exemption built in for new construction. The cap also includes exceptions for debt service and school funding.
The measure incorporates two ways aimed at helping local governments reduce costs. The proposal would create a $10 million fund of one-time money to provide grants to local governments pursuing consolidation and shared service agreements with other local governments for services like emergency medical services, law enforcement and public health. It also would remove election mandates for county treasurers, auditors and recorders, meaning these positions could become appointed, instead of elected, positions in the future.
The proposal also would change how often property tax assessments are conducted, moving from every two years to every three years. Additionally, it would limit the use of Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts and accelerate the timeline for using the state’s Secure an Advanced Vision for Education (SAVE) funding stream for property tax relief.
Reynolds said the proposal also works to provide property tax relief for both older homeowners and new homeowners. The legislation would freeze property taxes for seniors age 65 and older in homes valued at $350,000 or less, “because no one should be taxed out of their own front door,” she said. The bill would also create FirstHome Iowa Accounts modeled after the Iowa 529 Plan, the state-sponsored savings plan that allows families to create a savings fund for a person’s future educational expenses that offers both tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified costs.
The FirstHome Iowa Account proposal would mean funds in tax-deductible savings accounts could be used to for the purchase or closing costs of a home, with certain restrictions. The money in these accounts could only be used to purchase a home in Iowa, and the person using the funds cannot have owned a home in the past three years in the state. Unlike the 529 Plan accounts, the FirstHome Iowa Accounts would be subject to some federal taxes, as there is not a federal equivalent to the program.
This proposal differs significantly from the legislation brought forward by Senate Republicans Monday. Senate Study Bill 3001 proposes ending the state’s “rollback” system of calculating property taxes, while Reynolds’ measure would not make a change to this system. The Senate GOP measure would also expand Iowa’s homestead tax credit, while the governor’s bill would change the homestead tax credit to a tax exemption.
House Democrats have also introduced a property tax plan earlier in January to freeze property taxes for seniors age 65 and older, triple the Homestead Tax Credit and limit annual property tax growth to 4%.
Reynolds honors National Guard servicemembers, calls for changes to county veterans’ benefits services
Reynolds began her address by acknowledging Iowans who died in 2025, including three legislators who died in office, Rep. Martin Graber, Sen. Rocky DeWitt and Sen. Claire Celsi, as well as former Rep. Janet Metcalf.

She also spoke on the loss of two Iowa National Guard service members, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard of Marshalltown and Sgt. Edgar Torres-Tovar of Des Moines. They died Dec. 13, 2025 in Palmyra, Syria when a gunman associated with ISIS fired on American troops, also injuring three other Iowa soldiers and killing a U.S. civilian. Reynolds said the Torres-Tovar family was honoring their son’s death in a memorial services Tuesday evening, while Howard’s wife, parents and brother attended the Condition of the State address. She told them their family “remains in our prayers, and we will never forget Nate’s sacrifice.”
“When I reflect on the evil that robbed our state of two exceptional young men and wounded three others, I’m aware that no words can right the wrongs of their deaths or make up for the heartbreak of their loved ones,” Reynolds said. “But know this: their service lives on — in the families they cherished, in the communities they strengthened and in the freedoms they helped preserve.”
Reynolds said Iowa owes service members a “debt of gratitude,” which is “best paid by ensuring our veterans get every benefit they’ve earned.” She said while the state is home to nearly 178,000 veterans, only one-third of veterans are receiving the benefits they earned.
“That’s not acceptable,” Reynolds said. “An outdated system that provides little accountability is leaving too many veterans — and well-meaning county officials — without the tools, training and consistency they need. So tonight, I’m proposing a bill to modernize the system statewide.”
While the state currently provides counties funding to train Veterans Service Officers across the state, the governor is proposing redirecting this funding to create a centralized training program through the state Department of Veterans Affairs and create a single statewide claims program for submitting veterans’ benefits claims.
Additionally, while each Iowa county currently receives $10,000 to support their local VSOs, the program proposes tying state funding to outcome and performance measures. It would give counties in the top third of VA compensation per capita $15,000; the middle third of counties $5,000, with a bonus award of $5,000 if compensation per capita is increased by 5%, and the bottom third of counties $2,000 with a bonus award of $3,000 for a 5% per capita compensation increase.
“The goal is simple — more benefits reaching more veterans,” Reynolds said. “Let’s do more for the heroes who’ve done so much for us.”
Federal dollars directed toward cancer programs
Making effective use of taxpayer dollars is not limited to state and local governments, Reynolds said, but also includes federal funding flowing to the state through both established programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, as well as the Rural Health Transformation Program established through the tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in 2025.
Iowa was awarded $209 million in the first year of the Rural Health Transformation Program funding, and Reynolds said more than $50 million of that federal funding will be invested in cancer prevention, screening and treatment. Concerns about cancer in Iowa have grown as the state has the second-highest cancer incident rate in the country.
The $50 million will go toward expanding cancer screenings for uninsured and underinsured Iowans, investing in cancer specialists and cancer treatment equipment in rural Iowa, and funding radon testing kits, mitigation efforts and specialists, Reynolds said. This work is already beginning, she said, as the state has already received 250 proposals from around Iowa for the program with plans to begin awarding contracts by the end of January.
More funding will become available for these efforts in future years, she said, with the state expecting the funding to grow to $183 million over the course of the five-year grant.
Cancer is not the only public health condition impacting Iowans, Reynolds said — she also said obesity is a “serious public health issue” in the state and an issue the state government is working to address through food programs.
Iowa has received federal approval of waivers for SNAP and the Summer EBT programs, funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in the past year. Under the waiver, SNAP dollars cannot be used to purchase foods like candy and soft drinks in Iowa. In 2025, the state received funding to implement the Healthy Kids Iowa demonstration project instead of approving SUN Bucks, the federal summer nutrition program for children. However, beginning in summer 2026, Reynolds announced she will participate in the Summer EBT program after USDA approved a waiver requiring these funds are subject to the same restrictions on eligible foods as SNAP.
Reynolds said she is asking the Legislature to approve a measure that would direct the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services “to maintain a federal waiver going forward” for these programs.
“The days of government programs that enable chronic illness are over,” Reynolds said. “It’s time for a new era of accountability and health.”
Updates to prescription drugs, charter schools
Reynolds’ health care agenda also includes measures that would allow both ivermectin and contraceptives to be sold over the counter to Iowans without a prescription, and would restrict the use of certain dyes and preservatives in school foods. Ivermectin — a drug approved for parasitic infections in humans and animals  — was used by some to treat COVID-19 despite a lack of research into its safety and efficacy. Reynolds has proposed over-the-counter access to contraceptives in past sessions but conservative activists and lawmakers have scuttled the idea.
The governor is also proposing changes to Iowa Code that focus on charter schools, both changing language that would allow charter school students to access concurrent enrollment classes and extracurricular activities, as well as shifting certain per-pupil state aid categorical funding from public school districts to a charter school where the student attends classes.
“I am proposing a bill to ensure per-pupil funding truly follows the student, so that every public-school student receives equal support, no matter which public school they attend,” Reynolds said.
Immigration status verification
Though she did not bring them up in her address, Reynolds is proposing codifying her executive order requiring state government departments use the federal E-Verify system to confirm state government employees work eligibility, and requiring Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database in order to verify immigration and citizenship status of people seeking professional licenses.

Reynolds signed the executive order with these provisions in October 2025 after the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest of former Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts, who had been granted an administrator license by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in July 2023 that was revoked following his arrest.
The governor is also introducing two other measures related to immigration. One would establish a new “presumption of detention” law, stating undocumented immigrants arrested for felony and non-simple misdemeanor charges are presumed to be a flight risk and not be eligible for bail. This presumption could be rebutted.
The second measure would require people registering to vote in Iowa to swear they are a U.S. citizen. Currently, Iowa only requires people to confirm they are a citizen when voting, though registering to vote as a noncitizen is illegal. The proposal would recategorize the crime of falsely claiming to be a citizen while registering to vote as a Class D felony. This proposal follows disputes in the 2024 election cycle about citizenship of individuals who voted or registered to vote in Iowa identified by the Secretary of State’s office as “potential noncitizens.”
According to Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, 277 of the 2,176 people identified were confirmed to not hold U.S. citizenship. Of those individuals on Iowa voter rolls, Pate said his office had found 35 non-U.S. citizens cast ballots that were counted in the 2024 general election, five ballots that were rejected by Absentee and Special Voters Precinct boards, and 22 noncitizens who registered to vote in 2024 but did not participate in the election.
Reynolds proposes spending increase
The governor also released her budget proposal for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2026. Reynolds’ budget proposes spending $9.666 billion in FY 2027, an increase of roughly $188 million from the current year’s budget. According to the budget, the state is expected to have roughly $10.546 billion in available funds, with an expenditure limit of $9,877 billion, while accounting for a $1.464 billion in reserve funds and proposed $583.9 million transfer from the Taxpayer Relief Fund.
Reynolds is proposing a roughly 2% increase in state funding, with a a 2% State Supplemental Aid rate for K-12 schools and 1.5% increase in funding for Regents and community colleges, 1.5% increase for state health and human services, judicial and justice systems and a 0.1% reduction for other state appropriations.
No mention of eminent domain
An issue the governor did not touch on in her speech was eminent domain. The use of eminent domain in carbon capture pipeline projects is expected to be an early point of debate at the Legislature this year following the dramatic passage — and ultimate governor veto — of a bill related to pipeline projects at the end of the 2025 session.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh said he plans to introduce several bills on the issue in 2026, including a proposal to widen the corridor approved by the Iowa Utilities Commission in these projects, avoiding the use of eminent domain while allowing the project to move forward.
Meanwhile, earlier Tuesday afternoon, a House subcommittee moved forward with a bill that would ban carbon dioxide pipeline operators from invoking eminent domain to construct, operate or acquire right-of-way for carbon sequestration pipeline projects.
The issue of eminent domain in pipeline projects caused disagreements within the Republican trifecta in 2025, particularly in the Senate. While Reynolds did not directly discuss the subject, she said not all lawmakers may agree on every issue this session.
“We may disagree,” Reynolds said. “We have disagreed. We will disagree again. But those disagreements have always been rooted in conviction, not indifferent, and in a shared belief that Iowa is worth fighting for. And that’s what this session must be about — not politics, but people.”
One last ‘Condition of the State’ to come for Reynolds
Reynolds took over from former Gov. Terry Branstad, who she served as lieutenant governor for, in 2017 when he left the position to serve as U.S. ambassador to China during President Donald Trump’s first term. She served two more full terms in the office, winning the 2018 and 2022 elections.
As she will give one more Condition of the State address in 2027 before the next governor is inaugurated, Reynolds said she would hold off on reflecting on her accomplishments — though she did celebrate many of the measures passed during her tenure as governor, like the passage of a flat individual income tax and the Education Savings Account program.
“There will be time to look back and time to say thank you,” Reynolds said. “But tonight, our focus is forward — on what still needs to be done, and on doing it together.”

During – and again after – Tuesday’s first meeting of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, co-chairman Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, alleged the budget proposal Gov. Brad Little presented Monday does not balance and was built on gimmicks. 
After Tuesday’s meeting adjourned, Tanner issued a press release alleging Little’s proposed budget “does not balance on an ongoing basis” and leaves year-end cash balances that Tanner described as dangerously low.
Idaho Legislative Guidebook: How is the state budget set?

“The governor’s budget does not balance,” Tanner wrote in his press release. “It relies on one-time gimmicks, spends more than the state takes in on an ongoing basis, and leaves Idaho with the lowest ending fund balances in nearly a decade.”
“These razor-thin reserves leave Idaho with virtually no margin for error,” Tanner added. “Any revenue slowdown, economic disruption, or continued Medicaid growth could force a special legislative session.”
Tanner made his comments on his first day helping lead JFAC as a co-chair. 
On Jan. 5, Tanner was appointed to take over as co-chair for former Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who resigned from the Idaho Legislature to take a job with the federal government in Washington, D.C.
 Idaho’s top budget official says Gov. Little’s proposal balances state budget without cutting too deeply

Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff, who serves as Little’s budget chief, disagreed with Tanner. 
Wolff stated repeatedly that the budget proposals for the current year and next year balance and are forecast to leave a positive ending balance of $32 million for the current year and $25.5 million for next year. 
“This budget is balanced,” Wolff told Tanner.

Wolff also cautioned Tanner, who is in second legislative term and who was not serving in office the last time the Idaho Legislature had to make deep budget cuts coming out of the Great Recession, against making budget cuts that go too deep. 
“Sometimes cutting too deep makes it so that we cannot grow out of it,” Wolff said. “If we start cutting too deeply with these budgets, we will not have the opportunity for continued growth and meeting some of the needs that we have around the state. So it is very deliberate, very essential.”
On Tuesday afternoon, Little’s office issued a written statement backing up Wolff and expressing confidence in Idaho’s economy. Wolff also announced the corporate income tax filings came in more than $100 million ahead of projections in December, which erased the shortfall in corporate tax filings that Idaho had experienced so far in fiscal year 2026.
“The latest revenue projections clearly validate Gov. Little’s confidence in the strength and forward momentum of Idaho’s economy,” Little’s office said in a written statement Tuesday.

Wolff said Little’s office brought in teams of economists, tax experts and state agency directors to help develop the budget proposal and devise a way to avoid a budget deficit without depleting the state’s major rainy day reserve accounts or repealing Medicaid expansion. 
Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, attempted to soften the tone following Tanner’s comments. Wintrow said she hopes the legislative branch and the executive branch of government work together to navigate Idaho’s budget and revenue challenges. 
At the same time, Wintrow made no secret of blaming the budget committee and the Idaho Legislature for creating the projected revenue and budget shortfalls facing the state.
“I would remind the committee that we’re in the position we’re in because this committee didn’t vote on the revenue number until late (in the legislative session), and then we backed our expenses into the revenue that we wanted so we could do some tax cuts, and now we’re going to suffer for it,” Wintrow said. 
“I would hope that we would all work together to recognize why we’re here,” Wintrow added.
 Idaho budget committee outlines 10-week plan to cut funding, balance state budget

In addition to picking apart Little’s budget proposal, JFAC members also unveiled their 10-week schedule for the 2026 legislative session. The schedule calls for budget committee members to complete the annual budget-setting process March 12.
Other key dates on JFAC’s schedule include:

Friday, when the Economic Outlook and Revenue Committee is supposed to present a revenue recommendation to JFAC.
Jan. 23, when JFAC is scheduled to begin cutting budgets through the budget rescission process.
Feb. 6, when JFAC is scheduled to set the bare-bones maintenance of operations budgets that are intended to keep the lights on at state agencies.

Beginning Feb. 13, the budget committee is scheduled to begin taking action on any proposed budget enhancements from state agencies or departments.

On Tuesday, Lassiter was back before a committee of the N.C. Child Fatality Task Force to discuss the impact of the Secure All Firearms Effectively (S.A.F.E.) campaign, which provides gun locks and targeted messaging to remind gun owners how to safely store their firearms.
The two-year-old campaign has been funded using lapsed salaries and leftover federal funds. In the upcoming short legislative session Lassiter is hopeful that lawmakers will earmark $2.26 million in recurring funds to keep the messaging front and center. Support from task force members could help secure that funding.
“We had almost 11,000 guns in the state of North Carolina stolen from gun owners last year and that’s been a trend for the last 10 years in our state,” Lassiter said.
Put another way, nearly 100,000 guns have been stolen in the past decade, often ending up in the hands of children or criminals.
Lassiter said some gun owners mistakenly think they are safer if they don’t lock up their firearms for quick access.
“The reality is that if you’re not locking up your gun in your home, then it makes it an easy target for someone that breaks in,” he cautioned. “It’s one of those easy items to sell on the street.”

Since May 2023 the NC S.A.F.E. campaign has handed out 150,000 gun locks at PTA meetings, community gatherings, gun stores, and the N.C. State Fair.
“We’re really proud of those numbers, and I can tell you when we host events in local communities there’s definitely a desire from the public to have these gun locks,” Lassiter said.
The Department of Public Safety recently partnered with RTI International to evaluate NC S.A.F.E.’s effectiveness.
Lassiter said the RTI study found the non-partisan campaign resulted in a 22% change in gun owners acknowledging guns are increasingly being stolen from vehicles and homes, and that they have a responsibility to make sure their own firearm is locked up.
The campaign has also led to two-thirds of gun owners surveyed understanding that half of North Carolina’s gun deaths are suicides. Lassiter said that shift in understanding is critically important.
“A lot of gun owners thought that most of the gun deaths were homicides,” Lassiter explained. “This is also a suicide problem, and it may be someone in your own household that may use that gun to harm themselves.”
Lassiter said the NC S.A.F.E. campaign is helping combat the misperception that it’s only important to lock up firearms when children are around.
In 2019, 53% of North Carolina’s gun owners surveyed acknowledged keeping their firearms loaded and unlocked. In 2024, that number had fallen 8% to just under 44%.
“I really feel like the message is getting through about the importance of safe storage,” Lassiter said. “But we still got a lot of work to do.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gun-inside-safe-scaled_StockPhoto_Getty-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:59:03.356360

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas lawmaker raised concerns Tuesday about how to fund the state’s school voucher program in the future after advancing a request for more money that would raise its cost this year to nearly $310 million. 
A Legislative Council subcommittee, on a closely divided voice vote, endorsed the request for an additional $32 million for the Educational Freedom Account program. The full council is expected to take up the funding request on Friday.
The Educational Freedom Account program, created through a 2023 education overhaul known as the LEARNS Act, provides state funding for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. The voucher program was phased in over three years with increasing eligibility until it was open to all students for the first time last fall.
Republican Rep. Frances Cavenaugh of Walnut Ridge said she supports the program but told the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review subcommittee Tuesday she’s worried about the Legislature continuing to approve funding beyond what had already been budgeted. 
After approving a budget that included more than $187 million for the EFA program in April, lawmakers approved an additional $90 million in June. The additional money approved Tuesday is needed to fully fund this year’s program, according to a letter from the Arkansas Department of Education.
More than 44,000 students have been approved for the program this year, each of whom can receive up to $6,864, according to the state’s education department. 
Cavenaugh asked what programs are going to be cut from the state budget to make room for the vouchers, which has become an annual expense, or if lawmakers should plan to keep funding the initiative annually until the state runs out of money.

Republican Sen. Jonathan Dismang of Searcy, who co-chairs the subcommittee, said he didn’t want to set a precedent that lawmakers would “punt the rights to draft (Revenue Stabilization Act) to the executive branch.” The stabilization act is the legislation detailing the state’s budget priorities. 
Dismang said it ultimately is up to the Legislature to decide what gets funded in the state’s budget. 
“I understand we’re in charge of RSA, but we fund so much stuff out of RSA, and when we tell ourselves that we’ve got a balanced budget, we’re lying to ourselves and to our constituents,” Cavenaugh said. 
Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson disagreed and argued the state’s budget is balanced, which is required by law. 
Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders will present lawmakers a proposed state budget “well ahead” of April’s fiscal session and it will include funding for the program because it’s a priority for her, Hudson said. 
“We have one-time money for this fiscal year,” he said. “We’re not proposing to use one-time money next year. ”
When the Educational Freedom Accounts program was created, Cavenaugh said lawmakers were told it would be controlled by the budget, but she’s frustrated that hasn’t been the case. 
“I just want to make sure that we don’t get the state into an area where we, and quite frankly we’re going to be there anyway, that we have to make some really tough choices, as you said, what are we going to prioritize to be able fund, and we’re fast approaching that,” Cavenaugh said. 
Arizona became the first state to offer a universal school voucher program in 2022. Increased participation has increased the program’s cost to about $1 billion, which has contributed to Arizona’s budget woes. Opponents of Arkansas’ program worry a similar situation could befall the Natural State, especially as lawmakers continue approving tax cuts. 
Lawmakers also raised concerns Tuesday about what guardrails are in place to ensure program participants are using state funds appropriately.

Mike Kehoe during his 2025 State of the State address (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s revenue surplus, nearly $8 billion a few years ago, will be exhausted at the end of the coming fiscal year even with a proposed budget that has no new money for public schools, higher education or state employee pay raises.
That’s the forecast for the budget plan unveiled Tuesday by Gov. Mike Kehoe in his annual State of the State address. He’s asking lawmakers for $527 million from the general revenue fund to make up shortfalls in this year’s budget but only $2 million more overall from general revenue for the coming year.
To slow spending, Kehoe proposes cutting $600 million in general revenue being spent in the current budget from his proposal for the coming year. Those cuts will make room for increases in demands on general revenue due to the depletion of funds that were used to substitute for general revenue in past budgets.
Kehoe’s budget proposal calls for $54.5 billion for all state government operations and building needs in the coming fiscal year, including $16.3 billion in general revenue. If lawmakers agree to all of Kehoe’s proposed supplemental spending for the current year, that would represent a year-to-year cut of about $600 million from all funds.
In his speech, Kehoe said he expects lawmakers to try to restore some or all of those cuts.
“While that is certainly your prerogative, any reversal or new spending items must have a pay-for,” Kehoe said.
There are few big, new spending items in the budget proposal. The foundation formula, the state’s basic aid program for public schools, will see no increase after receiving a $500 million boost last year to $4.2 billion. The budget also recommends no new funding for school transportation.
And after four years of substantial pay raises for state employees, the budget does not recommend any adjustments for inflation. The budget will continue the practice of giving state workers a pay raise of 1% for every two years in their position on their anniversary dates, state Office of Budget and Planning Director Dan Haug said.
Kehoe is making room for some smaller increases:

$10 million to boost the MOScholars program to $60 million. Lawmakers put $50 million into the private school voucher program last year, a move being challenged in state court.
$14.7 million for drone deployment and countermeasures by law enforcement agencies.
$63.2 million, including money from federal grants, to support the FIFA World Cup soccer matches in Kansas City.
$7.5 million for public schools that accept transfer students if lawmakers allow open enrollment between school districts.

There are mandatory increases in general revenue spending that do not increase the overall budget because the money is replacing banked federal COVID relief funds that are now being exhausted.
The total cost of replacing the exhausted funds is about $1 billion, Haug said.
In his speech, Kehoe said that after adding 3,400 new budget lines at a cost of $13 billion since fiscal 2022, it was time for restraint.
“Simply put, the days of excusing budgetary decisions with fund balances and ‘so-called surpluses’ are over,” Kehoe said.
Kehoe and the state budget office have been warning that the surplus, partially due to unprecedented revenue growth in 2022 and 2023 and partially due to billions in federal COVID-relief funding, would soon be exhausted.
From $4.3 billion left over on June 30, Kehoe’s budget proposal states, there will be only $4.7 million left on June 30, 2027.
“If we don’t get this budget on a sustainable path, we are going to see significant issues in the future, and the (fiscal 2027) budget is the first step in that journey,” Haug said in a briefing with reporters.
Kehoe vetoed $300 million in discretionary spending in June, and restricted the release of $211 million more.
The state expects $13.15 billion in general revenue in the coming fiscal year, which would be a decline of about 2% from the previous year. While revenues are expected to grow again in fiscal 2027, the increase is only about $500 million, leaving a gap of $2.7 billion between revenue and projected spending.
Gov. Mike Kehoe wants voters to decide whether Missouri should eliminate its income tax

The future revenue picture is clouded by Kehoe’s call to eliminate the state income tax. He wants voters to approve the concept of eliminating the income tax this year, with the details of how to replace the revenue to come later.
In the state’s current tax system, about 65% of general revenue comes from the individual income tax, about 21% comes from sales taxes and another 6.5% comes from corporate income taxes. That tax structure is one reason the state’s population is stagnant and its economic performance is lackluster, Kehoe said in his speech. 
“I’m tired of being in the middle of the pack,” he said. “I’m tired of pretending like merely keeping pace with everyone else is good enough.”
For the year ending June 30, the supplemental budget recommendation includes $80 million in general revenue, and $491 million overall, for increased costs in the Medicaid expansion program covering 363,000 low-income adults aged 18 to 64, as well as $71 million more for mental health services for that population.
There is also $131 million, including $28 million in general revenue, for increased costs in the Medicaid managed care system.
The budget does project that Medicaid overall will cost the state $16.8 billion in the coming year, down from $17.3 billion this year.
“This is going to be a multi-year task of getting our budget on a sustainable path,” Haug said. “This is the first year, but I think we’re making great strides to that with the $600 million in cuts.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012825_kehoe1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-13 17:11:55.279373

(File photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)As a part-time Legislature, Idaho’s lawmakers convene for a roughly three-month session each year. Lawmakers’ sole constitutionally required task for the session is to approve a balanced budget, but this isn’t always a straightforward task. 
The state budget does more than keep the lights on. It determines public school funding, road and bridge maintenance projects, water infrastructure, university funding, public assistance programs, state parks maintenance, wildfire suppression, and so much more. 
 Step 1: Pick a revenue number 

To ensure the budget is “balanced,” budget-writers must determine how much revenue the state expects so that expenditures don’t exceed that number. Without the ability to peer into the future and see what happens, this revenue number amounts to an educated guess. 
The state fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30, so lawmakers in January must estimate how revenue will finish out the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year. 
There are a number of factors that can contribute to revenues coming in above or below projections, such as elevated or stalling sales tax revenue depending on people’s spending habits during the year. 
Income tax revenue may vary depending on worker and business earnings, and this number shifts depending on changes to the tax rate the Legislature enacts. The federal government can provide boosted or diminished funds for programs, depending on policy decisions made by Congress or the president, such as tariffs and federal tax code changes. Other economic factors can impact this number as well.
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee is a group of state House representatives and senators who are provided with a variety of  reports and projections from economists, university scholars, industry representatives, state budget staffers and others to recommend a feasible state revenue projection. 
After hearing the estimates and factors laid out by all these groups, the committee must vote on the number members believe will get the closest to reality. 
In 2025, committee members and presenters came up with fiscal year 2026 revenue projections that spanned from $5.5 billion from the Idaho Tax Commission up to an estimated $6.5 billion from House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Monks, R-Meridian. The governor’s budget staff predicted around $6.4 billion, while the mean of the committee members’ estimates came to $6 billion.
“Generally in forecasting, that’s how it goes. You see more variability if the projection’s farther away because there’s more things that can happen to change that projection,” Legislative Services Office budget staffer Hayley Kaae-Domgaard told committee members at their Jan. 9, 2025, meeting. 
Discussion at that meeting included a desire to have enough revenue to accomplish policy goals, such as an income tax cut, which the Legislature did. That year the state approved a $253 million income tax cut, the largest in state history.

Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, who also chairs the state budget-writing committee, at the time expressed some concerns about the then-threat of tariffs, as Idaho is a strong trading partner with Canada, and the looming uncertainty of when the next recession would occur. 
One member expressed annoyance at the common practice of purposely estimating a low revenue to constrain spending and keep a higher number on the bottom line. Eagle Republican and House Assistant Majority Leader Josh Tanner argued that this results in agencies having to come back the next legislative session and ask for supplementals — a mid-fiscal-year budget request to cover costs incurred that could not be covered by what the agency was appropriated for that fiscal year. 
While the individual factors vary year to year, these are the types of considerations lawmakers must contend with each year to pick a revenue number. 
During that 2025 session, the revenue projection was just narrowly agreed on in a 10-8 vote by the committee. 
Is that the end of it, now the budget-writers can start setting budgets? 
Nope. 
The Economic Outlook and Revenue Assessment Committee can only make a recommendation. It’s up to the members of the powerful state budget writing committee, the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, called JFAC, to choose a number to work from. 
Historically, the budget-writers on JFAC have voted on and approved revenue projections early in the legislative session. But, because it’s politics, sometimes the politicking delays this process. 
In 2025, after failing to garner majority support for 59 days into the legislative session, JFAC adopted a revenue projection on March 5. By then, lawmakers had already approved the $253 million income tax cut. 
With all that deliberating, the projection must be pretty accurate, correct? Not always. 
As of December, Idaho’s state budget was projected to end the fiscal year on June 30 with a $40.3 million deficit. That estimated deficit shrunk from the previous months’ projection of $58.3 million more in expenditures than revenues. 
In 2022, amid an influx of federal COVID-19 pandemic assistance, Idaho boasted a record budget surplus of $1.5 billion.

 Step 2: Agencies make requests

Idaho’s government functions are run by its agencies, commissions and councils. To get a sense of what those agencies need, they submit detailed budget requests to the governor’s budget staff within the Division of Financial Management well ahead of the legislative session. 
The administrator of the Division of Financial Management then works with those agencies and with the governor to create the governor’s state budget proposal.

Gov. Brad Little, nor any other governor, cannot ultimately set the budget. But on the first day of the legislative session, he stands before the Legislature and unveils his priorities and his budget proposal for the next fiscal year. 
The governor’s proposals and agency requests then go to budget writers on JFAC. 
Each budget gets its own hearing in a format that has changed over the last couple of years. As of 2024, budget hearings are reduced to a roughly 90-minute presentation from the legislative budget staffer assigned to work on that agency’s budget, and short remarks by the head of that agency at the end. In the past, legislators heard three-hour long presentations from the agency directors themselves as they detailed how they’d spent prior funding and their needs for the upcoming year. 
Unlike other committees, the public at large never has a chance to weigh in on these hearings. 
The budget hearing schedule can be found online here.
 JFAC work groups craft budgets

The joint budget-writing committee was formed in the Idaho Legislature in the late 1960s, and at the time, was fairly unique among other state processes, said Jaclyn Kettler, a political science associate professor at Boise State University who researches state legislatures and teaches comparative state politics.  
Some states have committees in each chamber produce their own budget proposals, and then must find a way to reconcile them to approve one budget. Other states, as well as Congress, also sometimes do large omnibus budget bills that include spending for every agency and program. 
Members of the Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee listen to a presentation at the Idaho State Capitol building in Boise on Jan. 11, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)
For the most part, Idaho passes a budget for each agency in separate bills. However, with the changes adopted in 2024, the committee has since undergone a “maintenance” budget process and “enhancement process.” 
“Maintenance budgets” include the funding for agencies that has already been approved by the Legislature, but no new spending. These budgets are passed in around 10 omnibus bills that combine agencies under general topics such as public safety, general government or economic development. The committee votes on the 10 budgets all at once early in the legislative session. 
Then, new spending requests are considered line-by-line for each agency. To work on these requests and determine proposed budgets for each agency, JFAC is split into working groups for different agencies. 
Which lawmaker serves on which working group is not typically publicly shared, and the groups’ work is all done behind closed doors. 
Sometimes members who work on the agency disagree on how to set a budget. 
When it comes time to vote, members bring prepared motions to set how much state funding the agency gets as well as the authority to spend any federal money that agency may receive.
There is typically a motion made for one budget and a “substitute motion” made if there’s a competing budget proposal. If there’s a third proposal, a lawmaker can make an “amended substitute motion.” After that, there can be no further motions on an individual budget. 
The committee votes on the most recently made motion first. For instance, if there was an amended substitute motion to spend $1,000 of general funds on ice cream for the Idaho Ice Cream Commission (a fictitious agency example), that would be the first motion to get a vote. If the motion dies, the committee would move on to the substitute motion to spend $2,500 on ice cream. 
If that motion also fails, the committee moves on to the original motion of $1,200 on ice cream. If all three motions fail, the work groups must get back to work and bring something different for the committee to vote on again.  
Much of the focus of the state budget is on the state’s general fund, which consists of unobligated money that the state uses to pay many of its bills and to enact policies. 
For fiscal year 2025, the state’s total budget, using all sources, is about $13.9 billion. Federal and dedicated funds typically are earmarked for certain programs or projects. The state general fund budget was around $5.2 billion for fiscal year 2025. 
 JFAC members also approve ‘intent language’ 

Once the numbers for the budget are approved, the committee members will also vote on what’s called “intent language.” This language usually dictates how the money must be used or conditions for approval. Sometimes, it may require a report on how a certain grant was used, or clarifies that certain funds may only be used for a specified purpose. 
Intent language is part of the law, and agencies may face consequences for using the funds for other purposes. The committee has the authority to order an audit of use of funds if there’s suspected misuse. 
If the audit findings are serious enough, auditors may recommend referring the case to the state attorney general for criminal prosecution. Most times, the issues are resolved before legal proceedings are brought. 
 Approved budgets go to House and Senate floors 

Once budget numbers are approved by the committee, they go to legislative staffers to be drafted into a bill. This process can take a few days, after which the budgets would show up in the House or Senate floors calendars. It’s up to leadership to decide which chamber will hear the budget first. 
The bills must pass both chambers and go to the governor to be approved. 
Idaho Lt. Gov. Scott Bedke, R-Oakley, (left) and state lawmakers take a break from legislative proceedings on the Idaho Senate floor on Jan. 7, 2025. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
If the House or Senate votes down a bill, it goes back to JFAC budget writers who must get back with work groups to craft a new bill that will be more likely to pass. 
If a budget passes the Legislature, the governor may then veto it. If the governor vetoes an entire budget, it’s likely that JFAC would have to take it back up. The governor also has the option to do a “line item veto,” only striking one section of the bill. 
Little has used this line-item veto power one time, and it was to strike out a section of his own office’s budget that would have eliminated his emergency fund.

 Once the the whole budget is passed and signed into law — that’s it. Sine Die. 

Once every agency budget has been approved by both chambers of the Legislature and signed by the governor, that’s it. 
However, some budget bills may sometimes be held on reading calendars as “hostages,” keeping lawmakings in session until preferred policy bills move forward. 
Once all the negotiating is complete and the policy bills that are going to move forward are approved, the hostages are released, and the chamber may vote on the bill. 
At the end of the session, which includes paperwork and some procedural moves that can sometimes delay the actual adjournment. The final adjournment of the session is called “Sine Die,” Latin for “without day,” which indicates that the work is done until next year. 
During the interim between sessions, there may be work groups and task forces and other interim committees, but the Legislature as a whole won’t meet again unless a special session is called. 
The governor may convene a special session for a specific purpose, and as of a 2022 voter-approved state constitutional amendment, the Legislature may call itself into special session with approval from 60% of each chamber’s members.

School Choice Deadline for the 2026–27 school year is 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 14
DOVER, Delaware — Families considering alternatives to their neighborhood public school have just days left to apply through Delaware’s school choice program. The deadline to submit applications for the 2026–27 school year is 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 14, according to the Delaware Department of Education.
Delaware’s school choice system allows any family living in the state to apply for their child to attend any public school district, charter school, or vocational-technical school, regardless of home address. Applications must be submitted online through the state’s portal at SchoolChoiceDE.org.  The annual application window opens in November and closes on the second Wednesday in January. Only applications submitted by the deadline are included in school lotteries.
Students must be registered at their assigned feeder school before applying for school choice. Families may apply to multiple schools and may edit or withdraw applications until the window closes. Application status can be tracked through the online portal. Districts and charter schools are required to notify families of invitation status by Feb. 27. Families who receive offers must accept or decline them by March 20.
Transportation considerations
Transportation is not guaranteed for students attending a school through choice. School districts are required to provide transportation for students attending their assigned feeder school. For choice students, districts typically provide transportation only from existing bus stops within the receiving district. Families may be required to transport students to a designated stop or directly to school. Charter schools follow similar transportation rules. Vocational-technical schools offer broader countywide bus networks, though stops are limited and may require travel to centralized locations. Transportation assignments are finalized after a family accepts a seat, usually during the summer.
Kindergarten and late applications
Kindergarten families may apply through the school choice system once their child is registered at their feeder school. While kindergarten applications may be submitted later in the year, applying by the January deadline ensures inclusion in lotteries and early placement decisions. Delaware does not offer general deadline extensions. Families who miss the deadline may apply after Jan. 14 only if they meet “good cause” criteria, which include a change of residence, change in guardianship, foster placement, adoption, documented bullying, or participation in a mental health or substance treatment program.

(Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer) Minneapolis Public Schools placed its top three finance department leaders on administrative leave more than a week ago — but the district has not provided any public explanation.
The district has communicated the personnel changes to a narrow group of employees, but has not shared the information with school staff. The district has declined to comment to the Reformer, citing state privacy law. 
The significant personnel moves come as the district, already facing fiscal uncertainty, grapples with an audit whose delivery to the Minnesota Department of Education is already late. The district has declined to talk about that, as well.  
The Reformer has reached out to all five school board members who sit on the finance committee: Abdul Abdi, board treasurer; Collin Beachy, board chair; Greta Callahan; Kim Ellison, board vice chair; and Joyner Emerick. None would comment on the record. 
The school board will meet in executive session, closed to the public, to “discuss potential litigation in an employment-related matter” and “preliminary consideration of charges and allegations against an individual subject to the Board’s authority,” at 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to the official meeting notice. 
It is not clear from the notice whether these topics are related to Ibrahima Diop, Tariro Chapinduka or Aaron Gilbert, the three employees placed on leave.
There is nothing on the agenda for the board’s public meeting Tuesday that indicates the district will provide information about why the finance department leaders were placed on leave.
The district has started assigning some of the senior finance officers’ roles to Senior Executive Officer Ryan Strack. The school board approved a series of annual financial authorizations that included transferring multiple authorities to Strack, which in prior years the board had assigned to Diop in his role as senior finance officer. By Friday, Jan. 9, the Minnesota Department of Education had changed its website to name Strack as the district’s business agent — a role previously assigned to Diop.
Strack has not previously worked in the district’s finance department. He started at the district as a social worker, and at least as far back as 2018, under former Superintendent Ed Graff, worked as a liaison between the school board and the superintendent. 
Diop was hired by Milwaukee Public Schools on Dec. 18, 2025, to serve as a deputy superintendent of operations, according to WTMJ in Milwaukee. This is the day before his departure from Minneapolis Public Schools was announced to district staff. On Jan. 8, Milwaukee Public Schools informed district employees that Diop would not be joining the district.
The people of Milwaukee — and, for that matter, Minneapolis — might want to know the cause of this notable development, but at this point, Minneapolis Schools has declined to tell the public anything.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MinneapolisSchool_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-13 11:58:41.794281

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas schools that opt to use a gun detection software program supported by the attorney general could receive a cut of $10 million from the state.
Attorney General Kris Kobach promoted an artificial intelligence-driven, unconcealed firearm detection and situational awareness software that can be applied to existing security cameras. He announced Monday that his office is accepting applications to integrate the program into K-12 public schools.
AI gun detection software purports to halt and prevent gun violence. Its implementation in schools has grown in popularity as technology has advanced and school shootings and mass shootings have increased in frequency.
The attorney general uses a product from the Pennsylvania-based company ZeroEyes, which sent lobbyists to the Kansas Legislature in 2024 to push for a contract with schools. The technology can analyze more than 36,000 images per second from security camera video feeds, according to the company’s website.
If the software identifies a gun in school, images are immediately shared with the ZeroEyes Operations Center, an in-house hub staffed 24/7 by military and law enforcement veterans, according to ZeroEyes. The company claims security teams and law enforcement can be notified of a threat as quickly as three to five seconds from the point the software detects a firearm. Operation center staff review software images and determine whether a threat is valid. They can then send alerts equipped with information such as a description, gun type and last known location.
The chief strategy officer for ZeroEyes, Kieran Carroll, said in 2024 that installing the software in 1,300 school buildings in Kansas and enabling 24-hour surveillance of two dozen cameras per school would cost the state $8.5 million annually. That same year, Gov. Laura Kelly line-item vetoed a budget measure that allocated $5 million to a program that favored ZeroEyes. The governor called it “a no-bid contract,” criticizing the lack of consideration for other companies.
A $10 million earmark made it through the Legislature in 2025, and in November, the Legislature’s special budget committee said the state was considering three bidders for a gun-detection software contract. ZeroEyes beat out companies based in Wichita and Springfield, Missouri.
Funding will be dispersed equally across Kansas’ four congressional districts, and grants are available on a first-come, first-served basis, according to the Attorney General’s Office.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010107-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-13 09:57:41.387950

As Michiganders set their intentions for 2026, the state Legislature is setting its intention for the upcoming year by finalizing budget priorities for the 2027 fiscal year, which informally kicks off with the Census Revenue Estimating Conference (CREC) on Friday, Jan. 16. 
One priority lawmakers should include in the upcoming budget is adopting the framework for funding special education services detailed in the Michigan Special Education Finance Reform Blueprint. This legislative report, delivered in October 2025, describes longstanding flaws with our current reimbursement model for supporting students receiving special education services, and then it provides a solution: a weighted funding model tied to student need.
Today, nearly 16% of students in Michigan receive special education services, and the proportion of students who qualify for these services continues to grow. This increase underscores a pressing need for our funding system to modernize in response to the changing student population. Currently, most funding for special education services comes from the state in the form of a reimbursement for 28.6% of district expenditures. Local funds contribute to the rest of costs, but contributions vary widely by Intermediate School District (ISD). Additionally, most districts are forced to use general fund dollars to cover special education costs, creating budget constraints. The result is inequity that shows up directly in classrooms. 
The Blueprint highlights this inequity by pointing to two counties with similar student populations, but due to tax wealth, one county can spend $3,500 more per student on special education services. Essentially, our system has created a reality where two students with identical characteristics (academic achievement, family life, diagnosis, etc.) are receiving drastically different services simply because of the district they are assigned. This gap translates into fewer interventions, more students per teacher, and fewer supports for students who need them most. 
The Blueprint’s model solves these problems by tying special education funding to the needs of a particular student. The new model scraps the reimbursement format and provides each special education student with the foundation allowance (currently set at $10,050) and an additional percentage of the foundation allowance, as determined by their diagnosis. The change means that funding is tied to student needs, not ZIP codes.
Although it has been nearly a decade since I was a classroom teacher, the feeling of “if only” has not faded.
If only I could be in two places at once…
If only there were someone to provide the reading interventions…
If only we funded all of our students according to their unique needs…
For too long, these have been common realities in Michigan classrooms, but they no longer need to be hypothetical wishes for our educators.
​The Blueprint was developed by school finance experts and informed by hundreds of stakeholders across the state. Adequate and equitable funding will allow teachers to focus on teaching and will create classrooms where diverse needs are met with appropriate supports.
Importantly, adopting the Blueprint will not only improve outcomes for students receiving special education services; it will improve the educational experience for everyone. By strengthening staffing, reducing strain on general education classrooms, and stabilizing district budgets, the Blueprint will improve learning conditions for all Michigan students.
Now, at the start of a new year, lawmakers must take decisive action by adopting the Blueprint’s weighted funding model and redefining special education funding in Michigan. As we make our resolutions for the year ahead, let this be one we keep: a commitment to equitable, effective education funding that empowers every Michigan student to thrive.

(Photo by Hal Brown/New Jersey Monitor)The Legislature approved a plan Monday to expand New Jersey’s corporate tax breaks by almost $3 billion and grant Newark’s Prudential Center up to $300 million in new tax subsidies.
The votes in the Senate and Assembly came during hourslong voting sessions in the Statehouse in Trenton as the two bodies met for the last time in the 2024-25 legislative session. A new session begins Tuesday at noon.
Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

Critics had blasted the bill as irresponsible during a time of fiscal belt-tightening and federal funding cuts.
Several Assembly Republicans slammed the subsidies as “corporate giveaways,” saying legislators should fund small businesses rather than billionaire sports owners and only add new spending that supports residents’ health, safety, and welfare instead of their entertainment.
Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) derided Monday — in which the Democratic-led Legislature approved multiple bills that included new spending and tax breaks — as “the majority party’s oligarch day, where we keep giving more and more money away.”
Supporters said the bill includes provisions to safeguard public money, while Prudential Center officials said the arena needs the subsidies to make $400 million in repairs and upgrades to a facility they say is a major economic driver for the city and state.
The Assembly passed the measure by a 49-22 vote, and the Senate, 31-6.
 Paid family leave
More small businesses would be required to offer paid family leave and temporary disability benefits to employees under a bill advanced in both chambers of the Legislature Monday.
The legislation would require employers with as few as 15 workers to offer paid family leave and cut in half the amount of time an employee would have to work annually to be eligible for the benefit. If signed into law, the bill would allow a worker to take paid family leave if they work for at least six months and 500 hours for their employer.
New Jersey law requires businesses to provide eligible workers with up to 12 weeks of paid leave to bond with a new child or to care for a loved one. Workers pay into the fund, and the benefits are based on a worker’s earnings.
The bill would also ensure that workers can return from paid leave to the same position they had before taking it. Advocates say it would include another 1.7 million workers who are not currently covered by the state’s family leave law.
In the Senate, the bill advanced by a vote of 31-7, and in the Assembly, 46-25.
 Magic mushrooms
Lawmakers also passed a bill to legalize therapeutic access to psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms. The bill, which would apply to adults over 21, passed by a 35-4 vote in the Senate and a 48-23 vote in the Assembly.
Supporters say the drug treats chronic mental health disorders more effectively than existing therapies. Critics have complained about the bill’s $6 million price tag (to implement a pilot program) and said state officials should wait for the federal Food and Drug Administration to act, as it’s expected to do this year to approve the use of synthetic psilocybin.
 Cyberharassment
New Jersey lawmakers approved heightened penalties for cyberharassment of elected officials and other public employees in nearly unanimous votes Monday.
Under the legislation, electronic threats and the posting of obscene or lewd material meant to emotionally harm a public servant or their family members could earn between one and five years’ jail time, rather than the 18-month sentence provided for by existing law.
The bill would require the attorney general to promote education and training on cyberharassment and calls on the office to work with social media platforms to tighten harassment policies and create or expand offices dedicated to combating cyberharassment.
The Senate passed the bill 39-0 and in the Assembly the vote was 70-3.

Henry McMaster releases his 2026-27 budget recommendations at the Statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday, Jan. 11, 2026. (Photo by Seanna Adcox/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Raising teachers’ salaries by $2,000, ensuring all students can eat breakfast for free, and expanding 4-year-olds’ access to full-day kindergarten are among Gov. Henry McMaster’s recommendations for the 2026-27 budget.
The $14 billion proposal he released Monday marks the last of his 10-year tenure. The 2026 session that kicks off Tuesday marks his final chance to persuade the Legislature to meet his longstanding funding goals, continue priorities they’ve approved in the past, and pass items they’ve ignored.
The governor’s executive budget is only a proposal. McMaster has had more success with his recommendations than previous GOP governors, largely because he works with legislators through the process.
The release of his entire plan came a week after he previewed requesting $1.1 billion in additional money for roadwork to counteract inflation that’s driving up construction prices.
SC governor asks legislators to spend $1.1B more on roadwork as inflation drives up costs

The additional $150 million he suggests putting toward teacher salaries would set the pay floor statewide at $50,500 for teachers’ first year in the classroom. Four years ago, he set a goal of reaching $50,000 by 2026.
“Well, it’s 2026 now, and we’re almost there,” said the Republican governor, noting teachers’ minimum starting pay was $30,113 when he took office in January 2017.
An additional $2,000 boost this year would represent a 68% increase over a decade. The governor’s recommendation would boost state-funded minimums by $2,000 across the so-called teacher salary schedule, which pays teachers according to their years in the classroom and level of college degree.
Most school districts use local property taxes to pay more. Charleston County pays the most, with teachers there starting at nearly $67,400 this school year, followed by Beaufort County, where the salary floor is about $60,100. On average, the minimum starting pay across all districts is already $50,430, according to an analysis of districts’ salary schedules.
Under the increased flexibility that legislators gave local officials several years ago, only the 21 school districts that pay the minimums would be required to increase salaries by the full $2,000. The other school districts could use their share of state aid however they choose, but districts generally have used it to keep boosting their pay scales higher as they compete for teachers.
Free breakfast
McMaster pointed to Arkansas in pitching another recommendation: Last year, that GOP state began providing free breakfast for all K-12 children in public schools, regardless of their parents’ income.
South Carolina should too. Children who start their school day with a meal can better concentrate and pay attention in class, McMaster said.
Roughly 60% of South Carolina’s public school students live in poverty. Many schools already offer free meals to all students under a federal program.
Extending that to every school for breakfasts only — not lunches — is expected to cost $8.7 million, according to the state’s fiscal experts.
Since 2018, legislators have encouraged participation in the federal program for universal cafeteria meals but balked at using state taxes to close any gaps.
McMaster would eventually like for lunches to be free too. But his office did not have estimates on that cost.
Asked about Republicans’ prior opposition to the idea, he said, “We’re trying to fill their minds. We ought to fill their bellies so we can fill their minds more easily.”
Universal 4K
The GOP governor said the state should also make full-day preschool available to all 4-year-olds regardless of their parents’ income.
“We should go to universal. We will one day. I think it’s just a matter of time,” he told reporters. “The more you help the younger children, the more you help them up to where they can learn, the better they’ll be. I’m hoping it won’t be long before 4K is universal.”
But completing that goal would have to come under a future governor. His budget recommends spending $10 million to expand access in private preschools to the children of parents making up to 300% of the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that’s $96,450, according to the latest federal guidelines.
His proposal comes 20 years after the Legislature created a state-paid, full-day program for 4-year-olds in response to a Circuit Court ruling that the state did not do enough to help poor children succeed. Legislators initially limited the program to at-risk children in districts that sued the state 13 years earlier. Eligibility wasn’t expanded statewide until 2021, though legislators didn’t require school districts to participate.
In South Carolina’s dual 4K system, the state Department of Education oversees public school programs, while First Steps — a separate agency tasked with preparing children for school — oversees state-paid classes in approved, private schools and child care centers. Parents can choose either option, where slots are available.
This year, 18,411 children are enrolled statewide, a 30% increase since 2021. Just one district, Greenville County, continues to opt out, according to the governor’s office.
Private centers have nearly 1,900 unfilled slots this year, according to First Steps. McMaster believes making more parents eligible for the program would fill them. The state’s education oversight agency would determine availability in public schools.
“I believe that is the key to the future,” he said of the 4K program.
Other scholarships
Under his proposal, more students in kindergarten through college would also qualify for state-paid scholarships.
The law McMaster signed last year to reinstate K-12 scholarships for private tuition requires the Legislature to fund at least 15,000 slots for the upcoming school year. Both McMaster and state Superintendent Ellen Weaver recommend providing 20,000 scholarships instead, which would double this year’s enrollment cap and cost an additional $61.4 million.
The scholarship itself will rise from $7,500 this school year to $7,634 in 2026-27, as per the law’s required annual adjustments.
New additions in McMaster’s budget request include $15 million for Meeting Street Scholarships, expanding on a privately funded program started by Charleston businessman and philanthropist Ben Navarro. The state aid would not replace what he and other private donors have funded since 2020. Instead, more high-achieving, low-income students statewide could go to college for free, according to McMaster’s office.
The program provides each participating student up to $40,000 over four years to cover tuition, housing, food or other expenses not covered by federal Pell grants and other scholarships, allowing them to earn a degree without racking up debt.
College spending
For all in-state students, McMaster wants public colleges to keep tuition rates frozen for a seventh consecutive year. His budget recommendation would collectively provide an additional $39.2 million in exchange for that guarantee. His office’s formula for divvying out that money rewards colleges with higher numbers of South Carolina high school graduates.
Last year, college presidents sought permission to raise tuition through a staggered system that would keep rates steady for students while they’re in college, while allowing rates to increase with each freshman class. McMaster promised to veto the idea, and legislators squashed it.
$2.3B more sought by SC colleges includes extraterrestrial request

“We have to educate our young people and college tuition is getting so high, some can’t go,” he told reporters.
As for college construction requests, McMaster recommends providing $115 million to the Medical University of South Carolina for a top-tier cancer hospital. That’s about a third of what the college is asking for the project.
MUSC estimates that new cancer cases in South Carolina adults will rise 18% between 2023 and 2028, then jump by 30% over the next 15 years.
“That’s a lot of cancer. That’s a lot of worry,” McMaster said. “If you catch it quickly, it’s better. Everyone, don’t forget to have your checkups regularly.”
The hospital will “deliver best-in-class cancer care and cutting-edge clinical trials for all South Carolinians,” reads his executive budget.
That’s the only specific college construction project his budget would fund. All colleges and universities would get a share of $82 million for maintenance, renovations or new builds. Technical colleges would split $40 million total. Each college would decide how to spend their share.
McMaster renewed his request for a study of South Carolina’s 33 two- and four-year public colleges. He wants the state’s employment agency to contract an independent analysis of the state’s higher education system. Legislators have ignored that request since he first recommended it in 2024.

But GOP lawmakers, the minority in both House and Senate, say the deficit is a new opportunity to hone their small-government message.","Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey, Jr. (R-Upper Shore) says lawmakers should restrain spending to address the state's $1.5 billion budget deficit in the 2026 legislative session. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)For the second straight year, Maryland legislators are arriving in Annapolis with a budget shortfall of more than $1 billion.
In the eyes of the GOP, the minority party in both House and Senate, the deficit presents a new opportunity to hone a small-government message.
“Government has out-sized itself,” said Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore). “We’ve gotten to the point where there’s more government than people need.”
Because Democrats hold commanding majorities in each chamber, and a Democrat sits in the governor’s mansion, Hershey acknowledges that his party’s role will be a “responsive” one.
“We are going to take a good look at the type of legislation that comes in from the majority party and see the issues that they think are important,” Hershey said. “Because we know what’s important to Marylanders, and that’s the affordability, energy and accountability of government.”
To resolve last year’s budget woes — to the tune of $3.3 billion — lawmakers enacted a combination of budget cuts and tax and fee increases. Then came Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) announcement of a buyout offer for state workers and government-wide hiring freeze.
But the arrangement didn’t provide a lasting fix. In November, state officials told lawmakers that they were projecting a roughly $1.5 billion deficit for the 2027 fiscal year — five times more than what was predicted at the end of the last legislative session.
House Speaker Peña-Melnyk begins first session tackling budget deficit, immigration policy

And from there, matters may only get worse, said state officials, who noted that pressures such as inflation, Medicaid costs and the consequences of tariffs were all to blame for the worsening deficit picture.
“When we talk about the budget this year … It’s about the $3 billion deficit next year and a $3.5 [billion deficit] the following year,” Hershey said. “We want to address not just the structure, but the symptoms. Why are we getting to that point?”
Ask Republican leadership, and the medicine might be paring back state spending, including on the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a costly “unfunded mandate” for the state’s education system, in Hershey’s words.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said that the Blueprint money is well-intentioned, and some elements are worth keeping, but “we just can’t afford it.”
“Spending money is not necessarily the immediate pathway towards success in education,” Buckel said. “You also have to be fiscally responsible to your taxpayers. You can’t just simply say the answer is always more.”
On Thursday, Moore announced a $10.2 billion allocation for education in his proposed budget, a $373.8 million increase over the previous fiscal year. His proposal includes $480.5 million for school construction.
“Maryland has the talent and the drive to have the best schools in the country, but that requires more than just high standards — it requires us to continue making historic investments,” Moore said in a statement.
Buckel said that the legislature should halt raises for some state employees, while ensuring that law enforcement and mental health services are properly staffed and funded.

“We have to hire more people in corrections, public safety and the sort of mental health professions, because if you let those things go, it has deleterious effect on all of your society,” he said. “We have to restrain the growth in state employment. We have tremendous state employees — I think they have been the recipient of quite a bit of raises over the last four or five years.”
During an election year, legislators on both sides of the aisle seem intent on avoiding tax increases, and focusing on pocketbook issues, though with vastly different approaches.
Energy bills, for instance, are once again likely to draw significant debate. And while many Maryland Democrats have put blame onto regional grid operator PJM — arguing that it failed to plan for massive surges in demands primarily caused by data centers — Republicans have argued that the state’s climate mandates have made matters worse.
By law, the state must reduce its carbon emissions 60% below 2006 levels by 2031. Moore has also previously touted his goal for the state to rely entirely on clean energy by 2035.
Hershey argues that observers need not look any further than the recent ballooning of the Strategic Energy Investment Fund. Fueled by utilities, that can make alternative compliance payments in lieu of purchasing renewable energy, the fund has grown exponentially in recent years. The General Assembly tapped into the fund, which pays for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, last year to provide ratepayers with an $80 refund on their utility bills, and to help balance the budget.
“Generators can’t get enough renewable energy. Our goals are too high,” Hershey said. “As soon as Gov. Moore takes overpayments from electric bills and puts it into the general fund, that’s a tax.”
This General Assembly session is also likely to feature sparring between Constellation — which already owns several power plants in the state and has proposed a new natural gas plant — and Exelon, its former parent company that by law can’t build and operate generation, but wants to.
Hershey, for one, is open to the idea of allowing Exelon to build generating plants, though with guardrails. Constellation is a private company, meaning its power plant would be funded by investors, whereas Exelon can use ratepayer funds.
“There’s a way to take a look at it,” Hershey said of Exelon’s proposal. “It’d be very specific on making sure that this is not rate-based, and at the same time making sure that customers aren’t paying for anything until electrons are being generated.”

Amid President Donald Trump’s (R) widespread immigration crackdown — which doubled the number of arrests by immigration enforcement in Maryland last year — the issue is also likely to feature prominently in this year’s legislative session.
In some Maryland counties, the sheriff’s departments enter into agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to let deputies take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those partnerships, called 287(g) agreements, are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.
Lawmakers are expected to take up legislation in the 2026 session that would ban such agreements, after Democrats’ unsuccessful attempt to do so last legislative session.
Buckel calls the effort is performative “virtue signaling.”
“If you’ve taken the right to be here unlawfully – and I understand that — I couldn’t imagine growing up in Ecuador and wanting a better life and you can’t get into the United States. I might take that chance too,” Buckel said during a December interview. “But if you came in illegally and did the best you can, and then it turns out you’re a member of MS-13 and you’re dealing drugs and you get thrown in the Montgomery County jail, I don’t understand why we wouldn’t allow the law enforcement officials for those individuals to work with the federal government.”
Hershey, who argued that Maryland should “let the feds continue to do their job,” with regard to immigration, said he believes that 80% of Marylanders wouldn’t list immigration issues as their biggest concern — even though Democrats will focus on it closely.
“This will be just used to take the focus off what the real important issues are — and that’s whether or not the Democrats are going to raise taxes this year,” Hershey said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_jan12_hersh_sitdown6-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 20:57:25.135347

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A state board governing charter schools has decided it’s seen enough from Proud To Partner Leadership Academy and voted Monday to “pull the plug” on the school.
The Statewide Charter School Board made the rare decision to issue a notice of termination to the charter high school in southwest Oklahoma City. Seven board members voted in favor and two abstained.
The decision sets in motion the process of closing the school once the current academic year ends and voiding its charter contract. The 100 students attending the school, known as PTPLA, then would have to return to their neighborhood school districts or find another educational option.
The board placed PTPLA on probation in November over financial, operational and academic quality concerns. Members of the state board grew frustrated with what they considered to be an uncooperative response from the school’s leadership. 
“That’s what we always ask for is a spirit of cooperation and desire to work together to improve the outcomes at the school,” board Chairperson Brian Shellem said after Monday’s meeting. “As it continued to progress, it seemed like it got harder and harder.”

State officials said they still had more questions than answers after three months of probation and multiple meetings with PTPLA.
The board’s staff made three visits to the school this fall and reported seeing only one teacher giving instruction. PTPLA leaders contend the report is inaccurate.
Rebecca Wilkinson, executive director of the state board, said she observed students with a computer open but not logged in, others not completing any work, seven who were sleeping or had their heads down, and some who were unable to say what course or topic they were studying, all of which raised concerns about the school’s educational quality.
PTPLA, which opened in 2024, faced scrutiny over weak finances, as well. It laid off four teachers in October and finished the previous school year in a budget deficit. 
State officials also complained of missed deadlines and other unfulfilled obligations by the school’s administration.
“My opinion is it’s time to pull the plug,” statewide board member William Pearson said before the vote. “It’s time to move to termination.”
Despite the school’s struggles, PTPLA leaders told the state they had “nothing to fix.”

School founder and Superintendent Dawn Bowles said her students now face the prospect of returning to “schools that were not serving them in the first place.”
“Our next feat will be, what is our next move to make sure that we don’t drop the ball on the ones that we’ve committed to serving,” Bowles said. “We will continue to serve them. We will continue to educate them. We will continue to provide opportunities outside of education, and we will continue to be their village as we move forward because this is what we consider to be the greater way.”

Here's where they don't.,"While New Mexico legislators and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham largely agree on how to spend state money in the upcoming fiscal year, some key differences have emerged through a review of budget docs. (Anna Padilla for Source NM)While New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state legislators mostly agree on how to spend more than $11 billion in state funds during the next fiscal year, some key differences have emerged in budget proposals unveiled ahead of the legislative session starting Jan. 20.
Budget experts from both branches presented Monday to the state House Appropriations and Finance Committee, which is tasked with introducing the budget bill for lawmakers to consider when the Legislature meets for its finance-focused 30-day session. 
Wayne Propst, secretary of the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, and Charles Sallee, director of the Legislative Finance Committee, both told the committee that their budget proposals reflect the tough economic conditions impacting the state and the rest of the country. 
“We are in a period of declining or moderating revenue growth. The executive budget is an attempt to recognize that,” Propst said at the beginning of his remarks. 
Despite the economic forces that are prompting fiscal architects to craft smaller budgets, Propst began his presentation with what he said was good news: Moody’s, the global credit rating agency, on Friday upgraded the state’s bond issuance rating. Propst said the upgrade reflects the state’s years-long strategy to invest record oil and gas revenue into revenue-generating trust funds. 
State legislators’ proposed $11.1B budget doesn’t fully fund universal child care plan for NM

As for the budget, the governor seeks just over $11.3 billion for state operations in FY27, which represents a roughly 4.7% increase over the current fiscal year ending July 1. The Legislative Finance Committee is pushing an $11.1 billion budget, representing a 2.5% increase over last fiscal year. 
The roughly $230 million difference can be accounted for, according to Source New Mexico’s review of the two budget proposals, in just a few of more than 125 line items detailed in budget documents.
The biggest difference relates to funding for the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, the agency the governor has tasked with implementing her universal childcare proposal. The governor’s budget seeks a little over $465 million for the agency, which is $163 million more than the LFC has called for in its budget. 
The extent to which the Legislature will fund the governor’s proposal during her last year in office is shaping up as a key battle during the session. State Rep. Nathan Small (D-Las Cruces), told Source last week that the LFC budget is a starting point for negotiations. 
Another major difference between the two budgets centers on the state Health Care Authority, which administers major federal health and nutrition programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The governor seeks $80 million more than the LFC for the HCA, which currently has an operating budget of slightly more than $2 billion. 
Sallee said Monday that he believes Medicaid, and therefore the HCA, is overfunded by roughly $150 million, especially ahead of cuts to statewide enrollment expected due to the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” 
The budget proposals also reveal a potential fight over the fate of the embattled McKinley County District Attorney’s office. Lawmakers in last year’s session slashed District Attorney Bernadine Martin’s funding due to concerns about her performance; they then provided additional funding to the DA next door and asked him to take over Martin’s cases. 
Since then, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez has taken action to remove Martin from office. She is facing a trial before the Supreme Court in March that will determine whether she will be removed from office. 
NM judge rejects McKinley County DA Martin’s request for extension in case to remove her from office

According to the budget records, the Legislature seeks to continue funding to the judicial district Martin now runs at the same level as last year, roughly $283,000, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s budget seeks to restore funding to roughly $3.8 million, on par with other district attorneys across the state. 
Apart from those key differences, the two budget proposals largely agree. The median difference on more than 130 programs is 1.2%, according to a Source review, and the governor and the Legislature have identical spending proposals on eight line items, including the New Mexico Compilation Commission, the Public Employee Labor Relations Board and the Economic Development Department.

Expect at least a few sports metaphors in Gov. Dan McKee’s 2026 State of the State address, scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Rhode Island State House. The annual event sets the tone for the policy and funding debates that will play out over the rest of the six-month legislative session. 
For McKee, this year is all about affordability, with an emphasis on proposals that “put money back in Rhode Islanders’ pockets,” Laura Hart, a spokesperson for McKee, said in an email Monday. 
Keep an ear out for tax relief and measures to lower energy bills and health insurance costs, per Hart. A lineup of not-yet-announced special guests will help give human examples of the necessity of McKee’s priorities. 
But the broad brush outline won’t delve into the weeds; despite signaling the likelihood of a new tax on top earners in a Boston Globe interview, for example, McKee’s speech is not expected to mention a millionaire’s tax by name or in description, Hart said.
Those details will come Thursday, when the governor unveils a proposed fiscal 2027 budget. Also awaiting clarification: how McKee plans to make up the funding loss from a proposed end to income taxes on Social Security benefits, keep the beleaguered Rhode Island Public Transit Authority afloat, and make good on promises to address rising winter electric bills.
Until then, it’s McKee’s moment to take a lap. His speech in the House of Representatives chamber will highlight state investments in the economy, housing, life sciences and marine defense, Hart said. 
Like last year, protestors are scheduled to gather a floor below McKee for a “People’s State of the State” rally. And this time, there will be almost-full public access, except for a small area near the stairway to the chambers where McKee will deliver his speech. That plan came from an agreement in a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island after access issues during McKee’s 2025 State of the State.
Demonstrators arriving at the State House for a scheduled event before the Jan. 14, 2025, speech were unexpectedly blocked from accessing the State House rotunda, which had been reserved by the administration even though it was not where McKee’s speech was taking place. 
Another source of 2025 criticism: the administration’s decision not to let TV camera crews into the chamber where McKee delivered his speech. The seemingly unprecedented media restriction of 2025 has been reversed. This year, there is a collective arrangement among TV networks for WPRI-TV 12 to record and supply live video to all, Hart said. The event will also be televised and livestreamed on Capitol TV.
While it appears McKee has fought off another round of access issues this year, he’s still facing scrutiny, including from his 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary opponent, Helena Buonanno Foulkes. Even when praising McKee’s vague announcement to restore funding for RIPTA, which is facing a projected $14 million deficit in fiscal 2027, Foulkes took a jab. 
“Last budget, Governor McKee made the choice to cut RIPTA’s funding — a decision that led to routes being eliminated and unreliable service for Rhode Islanders who rely on public transportation in their daily lives,” Foulkes said in a Jan. 9 statement. “Now, as he faces dismal approval ratings and election season, the Governor is claiming to ‘restore’ the very cuts he made only months ago. I’m relieved that the Governor has finally recognized the value of investing in public transportation and is doing the right thing by reversing a bad policy decision.”
Foulkes, meanwhile, has been promoting her own 2026 priority agenda, including accountability in the Washington Bridge crisis, returning Providence and Central Falls Public Schools to local control, and ending “pay-to-play politics.” On Monday, she offered more detail on the final of those points, calling for a state policy change that prevents lobbyists from donating to state general officers and lawmakers during the legislative session. 
McKee’s office did not immediately return requests for comment on Foulkes’ statements Monday.
House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale , a Foster Republican, will deliver a response on behalf of Rhode Island Republicans immediately following McKee’s address. His response will also be televised and livestreamed on Capitol TV.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250114_Salerno_RICurrent_StateOfTheStateAddress-0014-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-12 16:11:44.352884

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state lawmakers begin a 60-day session today, in which a fiscal reckoning, flood recovery, and their own reelections loom large.
They departed Olympia last spring, fingers crossed that a colossus of budget problems had been defeated with a one-two punch of spending cuts and new taxes. It was not. 
Adding to the difficulties: massive changes foisted upon states in the federal law dubbed “beautiful” by its Republican sponsors and “ugly” by its Democrat detractors.
Then came the havoc of December’s heavy rains and flooding. The financial toll for residents and public infrastructure is still being tallied. But it won’t be cheap. And it’s not clear yet that the Trump administration will step in with federal aid.
Meanwhile, Gov. Bob Ferguson came out last month in full support of an income tax on individuals earning over $1 million a year, setting up a major debate on tax policy.
Two controversial citizen initiatives are pending, but are dead on arrival in the Legislature and will likely go to voters in the fall.
Plus, policy debates are percolating on topics ranging from pennies to policing to pensions.
And it’s an election year. All 98 House seats and roughly half of the 49 Senate seats will be on ballots. Those sitting in them now know their votes in the next two months could determine if they will be back in 2027.
Here are four questions for which we don’t know the answers, yet.
How will they balance the budget?
When Ferguson arrived in office a year ago, he pegged the multi-year shortfall in the state operating budget at $12 billion, a figure he later upped to $16 billion. The first-term Democratic governor and the Democratic-run Legislature responded with spending cuts throughout state government and imposing billions of dollars in new and higher business taxes.

A year later, Ferguson says the state is facing another gap, this one at least $2.3 billion, between what Washington expects to collect in tax receipts and the amount needed to cover the state’s expenses through mid-2027. That doesn’t include the tab for the December floods.
Crafting a solution will be a challenge. Cutting deeper could undermine public services. But Republicans and others say if Democrats keep piling on taxes, it could drive people out of business or out of the state. 
Ferguson has proposed very precise cuts as a fix this time around. 
He also wants to move large sums of cash out of accounts where it’s not needed immediately. This includes using $569 million of Climate Commitment Act revenue to cover the expense of the Working Families Tax Credit for low- and middle-income households, and a proposal to siphon $1 billion from the state’s rainy day reserve fund. 
Some Democrats are skeptical of using that much of the climate money on the tax credits, rather than spending it to reduce air pollution. Republicans balk at the rainy day fund drawdown.
Legislative budget writers will put out their blueprints in late February.
Will progressives get their income tax?
Ferguson delivered arguably the session’s biggest news before the opening day gavel.
It came last month with his call for taxing the income of those earning more than a million dollars a year. This is the same governor whose preaching of austerity at his inauguration 12 months ago drew glares from Democratic legislators.
Those turned to scowls when he publicly and privately rejected Democratic proposals for a so-called “wealth tax,” a statewide payroll tax on large employers and a higher cap on annual property tax collections by local governments.

With his embrace of an income tax, progressives’ frowns may be easing. But Ferguson attached strings to his support. That makes some of them wary of whether he’ll sign what is sent to him — presuming something is passed.
To survive, the tax will need to be designed to withstand an inevitable court challenge. Lawmakers are also looking at how to possibly funnel money from the tax to the Working Families Tax Credit or to underwrite various other forms of targeted tax relief. Deciding how to use the revenue could further complicate the debate. 
There are election-year realities, too. While the governor is not on the ballot this year, most of the Democrats who would need to vote for the tax will be.
Will Heywood’s initiatives factor in?
Let’s Go Washington, the political committee led by hedge fund manager Brian Heywood, has become a perennial thorn in the side of majority Democrats in Olympia. The group is back this year with a new set of initiatives.
One would roll back changes Democrats made last year to the group’s 2024 parental bill of rights initiative. The other would bar transgender athletes from competing in girls’ sports.

These are initiatives to the Legislature, meaning they go to lawmakers for consideration before possibly ending up on the ballot. Top Democrats made clear Friday that the initiatives will not get a hearing in the House or Senate this session, all but guaranteeing that they’ll go to voters to decide in November. 
While the initiatives may be blocked legislatively, they could still pop up in the form of protests at the Capitol, or with Republicans finding ways to hammer on the wedge, culture war issues involved with an eye toward Election Day.
How will Ferguson fare?
Ferguson got off to a rocky start during his first session as governor, with staff drama and many Democrats miffed as he made a show of reaching out to Republicans and as he reined in progressive tax proposals.
This session is a moment when Ferguson will either succeed or fail in showing he’s a force that can drive the conversation and the priorities in Olympia.

Backing the income tax on high earners should build some goodwill among members on his party’s left flank, but it’ll also put him front and center in a Republican narrative that Washington Democrats are out of control on spending and have an endless appetite for taxes.
During last year’s session, Ferguson could readily fall back on the assertion that he inherited a budget blueprint — and budget troubles — from his predecessor, Jay Inslee. That kind of deflection will become increasingly difficult moving forward, as what’s happening now is squarely on his watch.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1688-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-12 07:12:15.904943

The 2026 Florida Legislative Session kicks off tomorrow.
You psyched? I know I am.
We can witness the majesty of democracy at work, the glory of our constitutional system, the sheer fabulousness of our elected representatives as they conduct the People’s Business.
My top priority — yours, too, I’m sure — is the state bird.
Mockingbirds are usually about ten inches in length, with a fifteen-inch wingspan, grayish upper portions, white undersides, and white patches on the tail and wings.Via FL Department of State
Our state avian is the Northern Mockingbird, a noisy and ill-mannered little bastard who likes to pick fights with other critters.
We’ve been stuck with this gray, aggressive, song-plagiarizing critter since 1927.
But perhaps not for much longer.
Rep. Jim Mooney, R-Islamorada, has once again filed a bill to replace the mockingbird with the flamingo.
He insists the change is vital: “If you ask people around the state of Florida what’s the state bird, very few people ever say the mockingbird. They’ll say the flamingo, they might say a pelican.”
Mooney reasons that, because flamingos feature on Florida postcards, the plastic variety are stuck into Florida lawns and appear on the Florida Lottery logo, it must replace the mockingbird.
Like the mockingbird, the flamingo is native to Florida, although in the early 20th century we damn near hunted it to extinction, “harvesting” its pretty feathers to adorn the hats of fashionable ladies.
“The reality of it is the flamingo represents Florida,” he says. “It always has since I was a kid.”
The mockingbird is also the official bird of some other states, so it’s not special enough for the special state of Florida.
Nevertheless, it has its defenders, including several North Florida lawmakers who feel the flamingo, all sleek pinkness and skinny supermodel legs, is a South Florida thing unrepresentative of the state’s non-pastel regions.
The only time a flamingo comes near the Panhandle is when a storm blows one up here.
‘Evil little bird’
Mooney’s biggest problem, however, may be Marion Hammer, former NRA president and longtime NRA lobbyist.
The woman feels very strongly about the m-bird.
“Mockingbirds have exceptional vocal abilities,” she says, “and can mimic songs of other birds, and the noise of mechanical devices like sports cars and tones on cellphones.”
Flamingos, on the other hand, produce a kind of nasal honk.

Perhaps to mollify the anti-flamingo contingent, Mooney’s bill would also name the Florida Scrub Jay the state’s official songbird.
The scrub jay is the only bird endemic to Florida; its presence on our peninsula goes back 2 million years.
It’s clever and sports sky blue feathers: a lovely little critter beloved by all who see it.
Almost all.
As Coach Lee Corso, another famous Floridian, liked to say, “Not so fast, my friend!”
The Hammer hates the scrub jay, calling it an “evil little bird” whose kind “steal other birds’ eggs and kill the babies of other birds.”
Worse, because the scrub jay is friendly and will eat seeds and nuts out of your hand, she says it has a “welfare mentality.”
Really, really bad, the scrub jay is a threatened species, which means tree-huggers and their radical leftist Audubon Society ilk want to protect its shrinking habitat and stop decent Christian developers from paving over it.
The fate of Mooney’s bill may depend on whether the Hammer decides to oppose it.
Remember, she’s armed.
Suffer the little children
While we’re on the subject  of “welfare mentality,” Speaker of the House Daniel Perez is pushing a brace of bills to punish people who insist on being poor.
Or a child or old or pregnant or disabled or all the above.
Following the example of the huge bill Donald Trump calls “beautiful” and most Americans call “ugly,” Perez wants to cut aid to what Jesus (remember him?) called “the least among us.”
Perez and his pet House Republicans will tighten SNAP eligibility and slash Medicaid and Florida’s low-cost children’s health insurance program.
He says it’s to save money.
Fewer kids will have access to care. And thanks to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and our science-challenged state surgeon general, far fewer will be vaccinated.
You know what will happen: A non-immunized, no longer insured child gets measles or chicken pox or RSV, infects a whole classroom of other children, and has to go to the Emergency Room, thus costing everybody a lot more than if the child could get treated without bankrupting the parents.
Speaker Perez calls this “protecting taxpayer dollars.”
Also on the health beat, Rep. Jeff Holcomb, R-Spring Hill, wants to allow you to get ivermectin at your neighborhood Walgreen’s. No age restrictions, no prescription necessary.
Ivermectin, in case you have forgotten, is an anti-parasitic drug, good for round worms, hook worms, whipworms, and head lice.
What it’s not good for, according to reputable clinical trials, is COVID-19, despite quacks across the nation claiming it is.
Sojourners
At this point, you may be wondering if the Legislature plans to do anything to improve transparency, accountability, and the lives of ordinary citizens.
There are a few promising bills.
Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, wants ICE to take off the masks and wear visible IDs when they’re going around terrorizing people.
Given that ICE seems to enjoy apprehending anyone they don’t like the look of, including U.S. citizens, you’d think it was only fair — constitutional, even — for them to show identification.
As for the detainees, other lawmakers think it might be an idea to keep better track of them. FDLE has a database of a sort, logging “suspected unauthorized alien encounters.”
Senate Minority Leader Lori Berman, D-Boca Raton, wants a more comprehensive public database of who gets detained and how, where they were born, where they’re being held, and if they’re moved to another prison.
Right now, if someone is held in one of the state’s Sites of Penal Alliteration — ”Alligator Alcatraz,” “Deportation Depot” — their families and their lawyers may not be able to locate them.
However, as long as Gov. Ron DeSantis can keep claiming Florida is under a “state of emergency” (renewed for the 19th time in December), legislative oversight can be ignored, detainees can be abused in vile facilities, and the state can build all the “Alligator Alcatrazes” it wants.
No accountability.
According to DeSantis, hordes of rampaging undocumented types “remain within the State of Florida;” therefore he needs king-like powers to make sure they’re not running around mowing lawns and mopping nursing home floors.
Sen. Tina Polsky, D-Boca Raton says, “The state of emergency has allowed the governor to skirt more than two dozen state laws, including those related to requirements for competitive bidding, oversight of excessive spending, proper licensing, public transparency, and safety restrictions.”
People, Florida government IS the emergency.
Fetal personhood
Of the 20,000 arrested in Florida last year, a third had some kind of criminal conviction — anything from shoplifting to assault. The others either had no criminal past or else had been charged with heinous offenses such as driving without a license.
Some of those hauled in by ICE have pending asylum claims — they’re here legally. Others are United States citizens.
The worst of the worst, y’all.
Don’t expect anything to happen with these immigration-related proposals.
They’re sponsored by Democrats.
The ruling majority is likely to ignore them completely in favor of bills promoting hatred, cruelty, and destruction.
Rep. Shane Abbott, R-DeFuniak Springs, thinks a family member should be able to sue anyone who aids a woman in getting an abortion, even if, 1. The woman wants the abortion; and 2. The abortion takes place in a state or country where it’s perfectly legal.
Parents could also sue over the “wrongful death” of what SB 164 refers to as “a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”
This is a fetal personhood bill.
The persistent Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach, files it every year, hell-bent on criminalizing miscarriages, medical abortions, perhaps even contraceptives such as IUDs.
It would essentially give a fetus the same legal status as the woman who carries it.
If that’s not enough to make you consider moving to Tierra del Fuego, check out Sen. Stan McClain’s bid to make pollution great again.
Environmental plunder
SB 479 would stop uppity local governments from enacting their own water quality and wetlands protection rules.
Those rules make developers sad.
County and city governments across the state know something McClain and his ilk don’t get: Floridians like nature.
They want to protect local ecosystems.
They want clean water.
Wetlands are critical to clean water.
But this bill would let the Department of Environmental “Protection” decide who gets to pollute and where.
Of course, what they’ll decide is to let the developers who own state government lock, stock, and barrel haul off and build that huge new subdivision.
Never mind the run-off.
Did I mention McClain’s a residential contractor?
Perhaps he’d like to do some business in scrub jay habitat. The little sucker isn’t monetizing it.
And once that land has roads and houses and Starbucks, Publixes, and Wawas, Marion Hammer won’t ever have to worry about that bird again.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC12185.jpg,,,2026-01-12 00:12:09.892877
