To identify known health hazards and evidence gaps from these chemicals to inform disaster-response research. We conducted a rapid phased literature scoping review. In Phase 1, we summarized major conclusions from eight authoritative sources across ~15 health hazard categories for 22 chemicals potentially related to the train derailment and response. In Phase 2, we conducted targeted literature searches in PubMed for higher-priority chemicals and outcomes with research gaps, considering the recency of authoritative reviews. Finally, we summarized findings from the retrieved studies and those from authoritative reviews to further characterize evidence gaps and the next steps. Eight higher-priority chemicals were skin and eye irritants, seven of which were also respiratory irritants, consistent with symptoms reported by East Palestine residents and workers. Five chemicals were human or animal carcinogens; two may cause adverse immunological or neurological effects, and one may cause damage to reproductive organs or the developing fetus. Vinyl chloride had the most comprehensive data. After Phase 2 literature searches, we suggested the need for primary studies for 12 chemical outcome pairs and a systematic review for two pairs. Our rapid literature scoping approach can provide knowledge for researchers conducting community studies and public health officials who communicate with the affected community on the known and unknown health hazards of chemicals related to the East Palestine train derailment. It also informs global disaster-response-related research, as these chemicals are commercially important and have been detected in other chemical release incidents. Moreover, our rapid literature scoping phased approach can be leveraged for environmental emergencies when the need for health hazard information is urgent.

He was an adjunct professor at the University of Saskatchewan in the School of Environment and Sustainability and has spent the last decade researching and teaching about regulatory capture. MacLean holds a BCL and JD from McGill University and a PhD in Canadian climate law and policy from the University of Alberta. In joining the Law School, he is excited to dive deeper into his research interests in regulatory issues within the United States.Tell us a bit about your background in the law.I began my career as a litigator on Wall Street with the firm Shearman & Sterling LLP (now A&O Shearman). After clerking at the Supreme Court of Canada, I practiced corporate and constitutional litigation in Toronto. During that time I also started writing about Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and that ineluctably spurred my interest in the problem of regulatory capture.What is motivating your decision to get an LLM?Since leaving legal practice for academia, I have been teaching and writing about regulatory capture and other aspects of regulation for over ten years. Much of that work touched or even centered on the US administrative landscape, including the work of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As my research into US regulatory issues deepened, the more the idea of expanding my understanding of the US legal system by studying at a leading US law school appealed to me.  Why did you choose the University of Chicago Law School?The University of Chicago Law School was my first choice for several reasons. Serious, systematic research on regulatory capture began at the University of Chicago, and that research tradition continues at the University’s George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State. The Law School is among the very best in the nation. It is renowned for its commitments to interdisciplinarity, rigorous scholarly research, and robust, open-minded debate. It is the ideal place to further develop scholarship regarding legal and regulatory frameworks that advance the public interest.What do you hope/plan to do with your LLM after you graduate?I plan to continue researching regulatory capture, with an emphasis on proposing effective solutions. I also hope to explore new areas of scholarship, including US civil procedure and federal courts. What are you most looking forward to in coming to the Law School, the US, and/or the city of Chicago?The faculty workshops and spending time by the lake.Any interesting hobbies or interests you’d like to share?I’m slowly learning to play the piano. I’m also learning—a little less slowly—to program in Python.What is a “fun fact” about you? I’m Canadian, but I don’t play hockey. (I’m kidding—of course I play hockey! It’s the law.)Anything else you’d like to share?I’m very much looking forward to meeting everyone and participating in such a vibrant intellectual community.",,,,,2025-09-11 19:02:36.215448

Posted: September 2025

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing updates to the hazardous waste permit for the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics facility in Raritan. The proposed changes would require cleanup actions at four areas of the site to address past contamination and confirm that no further work is needed in other areas already cleaned. These steps are designed to protect public health and the environment, while giving residents an opportunity to review and provide comments.
