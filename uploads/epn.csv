Beyond Pesticides announced an action to Tell EPA and Congress to eliminate PFAS chemicals, including those used in pesticides.¬† In its action Beyond Pesticides pointed to the long history of allowing pesticides on that market that have long residual lives and bioaccumulate in the environment, causing generations of exposure and adverse effects to health and ecosystems. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) exemplifies the generational effect of a toxic pesticide whose effects ha endured for decades, even though it was hailed as a miracle solution for agriculture and public health. PFAS, with a wide variety of uses‚Äîfrom nonstick pans to waterproofing fabrics to firefighting foams to pesticides‚Äîmight similarly lead to the characterization as a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù chemical. PFAS also share the less beneficial characteristics of DDT. Like DDT, PFAS are persistent, leading to the nickname ‚Äúforever chemicals,‚Äù and they are highly toxic.

In the current study, 315 frozen imported bovine samples (105 each of muscle, liver, and kidney) collected from local markets in Sohag governorate, Egypt, were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for the determination of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The metals determined were investigated for their potential public health hazards in humans. The mean ± SE concentrations of Hg, Pb, and Cd in beef were 0.312 ± 0.058, 0.684 ± 0.105, and 0.030 ± 0.005, respectively, while the corresponding values in liver samples were 0.273 ± 0.054, 0.763 ± 0.106, and 0.056 ± 0.007, respectively, and in kidney samples were 0.167 ± 0.04, 0.716 ± 0.119, and 0.073 ± 0.014, respectively. Beef samples contained the highest Hg level, while liver samples contained the highest level of Pb, and kidney samples contained the highest level of Cd. More than half of the samples tested exceeded the permissible limits set by International and local food agencies for Hg and Pb; exactly, 62.9, 60, and 54.3% of muscle, liver, and kidney samples, respectively, exceeded the maximum limits of Pb, while 54.3 and 57.1% of muscle and liver samples exceeded the limit of Hg. In contrast, none of the tested liver or kidney samples exceeded the limit of Cd, although only 22.9% of the beef samples exceeded their maximal limit. Although the human health risks estimated in the current study for consuming the contaminated samples were low, high proportions of samples exceeded the permissible limit, and therefore, continuous monitoring of heavy metal residues in food, especially of animal origin, is of great significance.",,,,,2025-12-14 17:58:04.284388
