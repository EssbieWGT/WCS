The study, which found that glyphosate poses no cancer or other health risks to people, was retracted because it relied exclusively on unpublished Monsanto studies. The study failed to review any research that was not conducted by Monsanto, the maker of glyphosate, now owned by Bayer. The journal also found that the paper may have been ghostwritten by Monsanto employees and that financial compensation from Monsanto was not disclosed.

The article has been cited extensively by regulatory agencies around the world, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as evidence that glyphosate poses no cancer risk to humans. The paper is in the top 0.1% of cited articles on glyphosate in the scientific literature, meaning it is more highly cited than 99.9% of articles written on the chemical.",,https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,,,2025-12-03 15:04:46.518359

This approval reflects the confidence placed in Related Midwest, CRG, Clayco, and our many development and construction partners as we work together to build a world-class quantum hub while responsibly addressing potential environmental concerns.

The IEPA’s decision paves the way for construction of the PsiQuantum facility, establishing the physical environment needed to build one of the world’s first commercial-scale quantum computers right here on the site.

At Clayco, CRG, and LJC, we’re proud to collaborate with so many exceptional partners to bring this transformative project to life, including Related Midwest, BOWA Construction, All Construction, and many others. A heartfelt thank-you to Governor JB Pritzker and to the leadership at IQMP for their steadfast leadership and guidance throughout this process.

The implementation of Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (EASR) is the biggest advancement in environmental legislation in almost thirty years.  
 
Transforming the way we regulate allows us to have a more targeted approach. It moves the dial on prevention and enables quick interventions when operators are at risk of non-compliance.  

This allows us to deliver a more efficient public service.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Ghana is responsible for registering and monitoring pesticide use and regulating the presence of unregistered or banned products on the local market; however, this regulation is ineffective. Farmers frequently acquire pesticides directly from vendors who may not possess sufficient training, and the lack of stringent measures facilitates the accessibility of hazardous products. Furthermore, while regulations mandate safe handling and disposal practices, there are also possible oversights at the community level, leaving farmers largely dependent on their own knowledge, practices, or what they have learnt from other colleagues. This study explores the safety practices, perceived exposure levels, and awareness among rural farmers in the Hohoe municipality of Ghana.   Methods A qualitative ethnographic approach was adopted, involving in-depth interviews with 13 purposively selected farmers with over five years of farming experience. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews guide informed by prior literature. Thematic analysis was conducted using ATLAS.ti version 25, with open and selective coding techniques.   Results Four major themes emerged: knowledge and practices of pesticide use, health risks and exposure, safety practices, pesticide storage and disposal. Most farmers (approximately 10 out of 13) reported using Glyphosate as their primary herbicide, followed by Paraquat Dichloride and 2,4-D, relying on vendor recommendations for application methods. Common health complaints included eye and skin irritation, waist pain, and temporary vision loss. While some farmers used PPE like boots and gloves, many lacked complete protective gear, especially eye protection. Pesticide containers were often stored at home or discarded on farms or by burning, indicating poor disposal practices. Awareness of pesticide expiry dates and proper dosage was inconsistent.   Conclusion The study reveals substantial gaps in pesticide safety knowledge and practices among rural farmers, posing significant public health risks. Targeted interventions, including regular training on safe pesticide handling, PPE use, and environmentally sound disposal methods, are critical to reducing occupational exposure and its associated health burdens.",,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0337693.g001&size=inline,,,2025-12-02 15:02:27.970442
