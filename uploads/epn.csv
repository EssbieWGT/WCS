The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in interpreting these laws, often determining how they are implemented and enforced. Historically, the Court has tackled significant cases that shaped federal authority over environmental regulations, starting from the 1960s when the federal government began to take a more active role in environmental protection.</p>
<p>Through landmark rulings, the Court has balanced the interests of industry, state, and federal agencies while establishing precedents that govern the scope of environmental legislation. For instance, in cases like Massachusetts v. EPA, the Court affirmed the Environmental Protection Agency&#039;s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. However, subsequent rulings, such as West Virginia v. EPA, have curtailed this power, illustrating the ongoing tension between environmental protection and regulatory authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Court&#039;s decisions have influenced citizen involvement in environmental issues, often determining who has the standing to sue and how regulations are applied. The evolving landscape of environmental law reflects broader societal concerns about climate change and the role of government in regulating industries, making the judiciary&#039;s engagement with these laws a pivotal aspect of environmental governance in the United States.</p>
