Where a WCPP applies, owners and operators must ensure that exposures do not exceed the EPA’s limits, even if they are far below OSHA’s regulatory values.

This marks the fifth proposed approval of a PFAS pesticide since Trump took office. The pesticide is a “forever chemical” — one of a group called PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances.  It comes more than a month into a federal government shutdown where food stamp benefits have been delayed and are only expected to be paid at 50% of the normal rate. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not receiving paychecks and millions of people across the nation are seeing increased disruptions to their daily lives — from air travel to securing home loans.
