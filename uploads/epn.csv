Sewage sludge (biosolids) is a byproduct of sewage treatment and is used as a source of organic matter for amending soil in nonorganic agriculture and landscaping. In light of a recent settlement in a lawsuit filed by Beyond Pesticides against¬†ScottsMiracle-Gro, ongoing litigation against GreenTechnologies, LLC, and a major study identifying 414 contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), Beyond Pesticides‚Äô network is calling on Governors and local officials to ban the use of biosolids on farms and parks, until there is adequate testing of toxic residues‚Äîwhich does not currently exist. ¬† The lawsuits against producers of sewage sludge fertilizer cite test results showing PFAS residues in the companies’ products and numerous scientific studies on the adverse effects of PFAS to public health, wildlife, and pollinators. (See‚ÄØsettlement statement‚ÄØrecently reached with ScottsMiracle-Gro.)¬† A literature review published in¬†Frontiers in Environmental Chemistry identifies CECs in soils, untreated and treated sewage sludge (biosolids), and dust, across 151 peer-reviewed studies released between 2018 and 2023‚Äîemphasizing the range of potential exposure pathways across various products, including classes of pesticides like neonicotinoid insecticides.
