Burial at sea is completely legal in the United States, provided it follows strict environmental regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The practice has long been associated with naval traditions and is still used today, especially for military veterans.

Bodies must be prepared using biodegradable materials, weighted appropriately, and released at least three nautical miles offshore in waters deeper than 600 feet to minimize environmental impact.

Important Details:

• Burial at sea is legal under U.S. law
• Regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
• Must occur at least 3 nautical miles offshore
• Water depth must exceed 600 feet
• Only biodegradable materials are permitted
• The U.S. Navy offers ceremonies for veterans
• Requires official reporting and permits

This practice blends tradition with environmental responsibility. Burial at sea remains a solemn option that respects both human dignity and marine ecosystems.
