End of Life Vehicles are taken apart and depolluted at these facilities

The purpose of these inspections was to determine whether air conditioning gases are being correctly removed from vehicles and to raise awareness on recent national and EU regulatory changes. Air conditioning gases typically contain hazardous fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-Gases), the most potent greenhouse gases. Their use is restricted and they are due to be phased out by 2050.

The inspection campaign highlighted the need for improvements in F-gas recovery practices and hazardous waste reporting. EPA Guidance is available at: https://lnkd.in/d69KBqNg",,https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/c45fy346jw096z9pbphyyhdz7,,,2025-12-19 01:03:03.852922
