,,2026-01-22 02:34:32+00:00,Nature,Environmental impact of dental amalgam and alternative restorative materials: a systematic review - BDJ Open,,,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-026-00399-z,"Concern about the environmental impact of dental restorative materials has grown in recent years. The most common material for dental restorations has historically been amalgam, but this has seen a decline due to concerns about the health and environmental impact of mercury. Alternative dental restorative materials include resin-based composite (RBC) and glass-ionomer cement (GIC), but both have uncertain environmental impacts. This systematic review aimed to compare the environmental impact of dental amalgam versus other restorative materials used for direct restorations. We undertook a systematic review which followed established guidance and prospectively registered our protocol on PROSPERO (CRD42024608563). Searches of bibliographic databases included Environment Complete, GreenFILE, Science Citation Index, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE and CINAHL. These were supplemented with checking reference lists and forward citation searching of included studies. Retrieved records were screened by two independent reviewers at title and abstract and full text using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality appraisal were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second. Findings were narratively synthesised. Twenty-one studies (n = 22 study reports) were included. Eleven were in a clinic setting, three were in a lab setting, five were in both clinic and lab settings and two were in a crematorium setting. Six studies included a comparison between different restorative materials, the remainder only measured environmental impact of one material (or multiple without comparison). Some studies were framed as potential environmental impact due to limited data. Materials included dental amalgam, RBC and GIC. Studies were highly heterogenous which limited the scope for synthesis of findings. All materials were associated with environmental impact. Whilst the evidence included in this review indicates that both amalgam and non-amalgam dental materials are associated with environmental impacts, confidence in these findings is limited due to the heterogeneity of study designs, outcome measures, and limited comparative data. Further research is needed to inform future policies which aim to reduce the environmental impact of restorative dental activities.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41405-026-00399-z/MediaObjects/41405_2026_399_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2026-01-22 01:58:35.894956

Instead, they'll monetise only the compliance cost to businesses.

Let that sink in for a second.

For decades, the agency showed that health benefits from cleaner air far outweighed compliance costs. Fewer premature deaths. Fewer kids in hospital with asthma. Fewer heart attacks.

Those calculations made it clear: protecting people was worth it.

Now, those lives won’t be monetised in EPA’s core economic calculation.

The pollutants in question aren't minor irritants. PM2.5 and ground-level ozone are among the deadliest air pollutants we know. They kill. They hospitalise. They shorten lives.

But apparently, quantifying that is too uncertain.

What's certain is this... when you remove the value of human life from your cost-benefit analysis, you make it exponentially easier to weaken protections. 

You shift the entire framework toward one question: what does this cost companies?
Not: how many people will this save?

This isn't just an American problem.

We're seeing this pattern globally. A quiet recalibration where corporate profit edges ahead of public health and protecting human lives. Where the cost of compliance becomes the only metric that matters.

It's a backward step dressed up as methodological refinement.

Every regulation that protects air quality is also protecting someone's parent, someone's child, someone's future.

When we stop counting those lives, we're not being more rigorous. We're just deciding they don't matter enough to measure.

And that's a trend we can't afford to normalise.

Because once you stop valuing life in your equations, it becomes a lot easier to sacrifice it in your decisions.

---

Many impact organisations make the same mistake without realising it. You report outputs because they're concrete: workshops delivered, people reached, hours of service. 

But funders don't invest in outputs. They invest in transformed lives. That single mother who avoided homelessness because of your housing support needs to be real to the person reading your grant application. 

Not as a case study. As a human being whose life trajectory changed because you existed. 

When institutions remove human lives from their measurements, your job becomes putting those lives back in. 

That's not just communications. 
That's accountability.

If you're working in social impact and need to turn your work into stories that funders and project sponsors actually care about, I send one practical storytelling framework every Thursday.

You get frameworks, templates, and AI prompts you can use immediately. No hot air. Under 10 minutes to read.
