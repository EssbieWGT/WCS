Instead, they'll monetise only the compliance cost to businesses.

Let that sink in for a second.

For decades, the agency showed that health benefits from cleaner air far outweighed compliance costs. Fewer premature deaths. Fewer kids in hospital with asthma. Fewer heart attacks.

Those calculations made it clear: protecting people was worth it.

Now, those lives won’t be monetised in EPA’s core economic calculation.

The pollutants in question aren't minor irritants. PM2.5 and ground-level ozone are among the deadliest air pollutants we know. They kill. They hospitalise. They shorten lives.

But apparently, quantifying that is too uncertain.

What's certain is this... when you remove the value of human life from your cost-benefit analysis, you make it exponentially easier to weaken protections. 

You shift the entire framework toward one question: what does this cost companies?
Not: how many people will this save?

This isn't just an American problem.

We're seeing this pattern globally. A quiet recalibration where corporate profit edges ahead of public health and protecting human lives. Where the cost of compliance becomes the only metric that matters.

It's a backward step dressed up as methodological refinement.

Every regulation that protects air quality is also protecting someone's parent, someone's child, someone's future.

When we stop counting those lives, we're not being more rigorous. We're just deciding they don't matter enough to measure.

And that's a trend we can't afford to normalise.

Because once you stop valuing life in your equations, it becomes a lot easier to sacrifice it in your decisions.

---

Many impact organisations make the same mistake without realising it. You report outputs because they're concrete: workshops delivered, people reached, hours of service. 

But funders don't invest in outputs. They invest in transformed lives. That single mother who avoided homelessness because of your housing support needs to be real to the person reading your grant application. 

Not as a case study. As a human being whose life trajectory changed because you existed. 

When institutions remove human lives from their measurements, your job becomes putting those lives back in. 

That's not just communications. 
That's accountability.

If you're working in social impact and need to turn your work into stories that funders and project sponsors actually care about, I send one practical storytelling framework every Thursday.

You get frameworks, templates, and AI prompts you can use immediately. No hot air. Under 10 minutes to read.

Therefore, it is crucial to assess the effect of long-term cultivation on heavy metal pollution in soils of apple orchards, for safe and sustainable fruit production. Unlike the most studies that analyzed only surface soils, this study compares two soil depths with multiple cultivation-age classes and deep-profile background values, supported by positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling, to distinguish fertilizer-derived and atmospheric sources. A total number of 128 soil samples were collected from two depths (0–20 and 20–40&nbsp;cm) in apple orchards of varying ages up to 30 years. Overall, the soil pH was alkaline with high soil organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium and heavy metal contents. The concentrations of Hg, Cu, and Pb in orchard soils significantly increased with cultivation age at rates of 0.00165&nbsp;mg kg−1, 0.244&nbsp;mg kg−1, and 0.208&nbsp;mg kg−1 per year (equivalent to 4.34%, 0.88%, and 1.11% per year relative to background levels), respectively, while Zn, As, and Cr showed no significant accumulation over time. The cumulative pollution load index of heavy metals was at moderate level in both depths (1.10 and 1.05 respectively). The single heavy metals pollution load index was variable Pb pollution load was high at 0–20&nbsp;cm depth and Hg at 20–40&nbsp;cm depth. The cumulative ecological risk index was at considerable level at both depths. However, the single ecological risk index of Hg was only at moderate level. Hg ecological risk is dominated by atmospheric deposition, while Cu, Pb, Zn, As, and Cr are fertilizer-driven. Ecological risk is based on total concentrations; bioavailability was not measured. The PMF model identified inorganic and organic fertilizers as the major contributing factors in Cu, Zn, As, Pb and Cr accumulation, whereas Hg accumulation was mainly due to atmospheric deposition. The study suggests regulating the use of fertilizers inputs and implementing control and remediation practices for sustainable fruit production in apple orchards.",,,,,2026-01-19 01:59:45.737318
