Bayer/Monsanto is challenging billions of dollars in jury verdicts, which affirm longstanding jurisprudence that holds manufacturers responsible for disclosing hazards even when not required to do so by regulatory authorities. In the case being challenged, Durnell, John L. v. Monsanto, the injured party successfully argued that a chemical manufacturer has a duty to warn of potential hazards on their product label even though the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not require the warning. The failure-to-warn in the Durnell case resulted in a jury verdict of $1.2 billion and the total number of jury verdicts and settlements on similar cases may amount to over $10 billion in liability if the Supreme Court upholds the lower courts and hundreds of thousands of other plaintiffs with the same claim. The cases involve exposure to the weed killer glyphosate (RoundupTM, which is the most widely used herbicide in the U.S. and worldwide, has been classified as posing a possible risk of cancer by the International Agency for […]",,https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/warning.label_.jpg,,,2026-01-17 16:59:07.603682

SO₂ has the broadest and most consistent coverage, with thousands of monitors operating in over 1,000 counties, whereas TSP is measured less frequently, O₃ data are largely unavailable prior to 1980, NO₂ coverage declines by the late 1980s, and CO data become widely available starting in the mid-1970s.  The provided .do file serves as an example for how to process the provided datasets into a daily monitor-level dataset.",,,,,2026-01-14 21:59:02.918275
