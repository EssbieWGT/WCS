Dr. Russo et al., in ‚ÄúTo improve or not to improve? The dilemma of ‚Äúbat-friendly‚Äù farmland potentially becoming an ecological trap‚Äù (2024), write, ‚Äú[W]hen restoring habitats for bats in conventional farmland, potential unintended outcomes must be considered, particularly if restoration actions are not accompanied by mitigation of key threats. These threats include the persistent and widespread use of pesticides. . .‚Äù (See also a¬†study¬†in¬†Environmental Entomology, which shows that habitat and open space near agricultural fields become a killing field of pesticides, threatening biodiversity due to contamination from toxic drift.) As this false sense of protection persists, Beyond Pesticides is calling on governors to adopt policies that support organic land management and ecological balance.¬†Organic practices are by definition a systems change that is aligned with nature and the biodiversity protection that is needed. Ecological traps are incremental steps that fail to address underlying systemic problems that allow hazards to persist. While they represent an affirmative action in an attempt to adopt restorative measures, the […]",,https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/biodiversity.flowers.jpg,,,2025-11-24 04:00:24.785642
