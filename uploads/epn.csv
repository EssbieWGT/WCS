The Trump administration announced that the Proposed Rule would “provide greater regulatory certainty and increase Clean Water Act program predictability and consistency.” The new definition is expected to reduce the number of streams and wetlands that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and will impact several federal regulatory programs, including Section 404 permitting of impacts to regulated waters. The agencies drafted the Proposed Rule to closely mirror the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, which held that the Clean Water Act extends to “relatively permanent” bodies of water connected to traditional navigable waters and wetlands with a “continuous surface connection” to those waters. The Proposed Rule adds definitions for several terms, including “relatively permanent,” “tributary,” “continuous surface connection,” “prior converted cropland,” and “ditch.” The public comment period will begin when the Proposed Rule is published in the Federal Register. If finalized, it will replace the Biden administration’s 2023 definition of WOTUS. The definition of WOTUS has changed several times in the last decade. Each new definition has been challenged in the courts. Babst Calland will stay up to date on WOTUS developments and the Clean Water Act, in general. If you have any questions or would like any additional information, please contact Lisa Bruderly at (412) 394-6495 or lbruderly@babstcalland.com, or Ethan Johnson at (202) 853-3465 or ejohnson@babstcalland.com.",,,,,2025-11-18 20:00:45.536333

Faith Burns, fellow for energy policy at Americans for Prosperity, issued the following statement:  “This is a giant step forward to unleashing American energy abundance. Nearly every earth moving activity, from the construction of LNG pipelines to oil and gas drilling to home construction, is subject to an evaluation of whether any ‘waters of the United States’ could be impacted.  It is also a strong reminder that our businesses need clarity, consistency, and predictability to plan and invest in this economy.

Katharine Lang looks at the issue

Recent news has highlighted concern about the presence in drinking water of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of more than 10 000 synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products since the 1950s.

The non-stick, water repelling, and grease repelling properties of PFAS mean they are widely used. Skin creams and cosmetics, floor and car polish, dishwasher rinse aid, fabric treatments, food packaging, non-stick cookware, and outdoor clothing and shoes are just some of the household items that rely on PFAS. Other uses include firefighting foams, human and animal medicines, and medical devices, and they are widely used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, automotive, and aerospace industries.12

Within their molecules, carbon and fluorine atoms form a strongly linked chain that is not easily broken down in the environment, leading them to be dubbed “forever chemicals.”3

PFAS enter the water system through two main pathways.2 They leach directly into groundwater from firefighting foams, plant protection products such as insecticides, landfills, and from industrial use and manufacturing processes.

Many also enter waterways from households, being shed from clothing during washing, from cookware, and from cosmetics into wastewater. Even after treatment many remain in the water that comes out of our taps.

Different PFAS have been linked to a variety of health concerns, such as affecting the reproductive system, harming the development of fetuses, changing liver enzymes, disrupting thyroid function, increasing cholesterol concentrations, and lowering antibody responses to vaccines. …",,https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmj/391/8475.cover-source.jpg,,,2025-11-17 13:04:00.345189

Such a move would, of course, leave the vast American nuclear arsenal largely intact and so invite a devastating response that would undoubtedly largely destroy the attacker’s nation.

The organization‚Äôs network is asking Mayors nationwide to lead the transition, pointing to the¬†inadequacy of the current system of regulating pesticides based on risk assessments of individual chemicals¬†or individual chemical families. Chemicals interact, causing increased impacts on¬†human,¬†ecological health, and¬†biodiversity. Moreover, humans, other species, and the biosphere rarely experience exposure to single chemicals or chemical families;¬†exposure to multiple chemicals¬†is the rule, not the exception.¬†¬† Synergistic effects associated with the use of the weedkiller glyphosate¬†have been implicated in several studies showing magnified adverse impact in soil organisms and in mixture with other chemicals:¬† The extensive use of glyphosate is linked to effects on nontarget soil organisms, with the risks to soil ecosystems widely studied.
