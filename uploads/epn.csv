In response to a petition from the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI), a certifier of packaging and products for commercial composting, the NOSB‚Äôs Crops Subcommittee (CS) voted to keep synthetic compostable materials out of compost permitted in certified organic production. According to comments submitted by Beyond Pesticides, compost from plant and animal materials is of fundamental importance to organic practices. Composting is one way that organic growers meet the requirement in law to ‚Äúfoster soil fertility, primarily through the management of the organic content of the soil through proper tillage, crop rotation, and manuring.‚Äù The integrity of organic production has always been tied to the integrity of compost.
