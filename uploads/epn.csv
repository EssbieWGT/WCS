Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic lung disease characterized by airway inflammation and variable airflow obstruction. In Bahrain and across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, there is a scarcity of data regarding asthma control, triggers, and associated outcomes. This study sought to evaluate the level of asthma control among Bahraini adults, identify prevalent triggers, examine related socio-demographic and clinical factors, and assess the impact of poor asthma control on health outcomes.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to November 2024, involving asthma patients attending primary care centers in Bahrain. Asthma control was assessed using the Asthma Control Test, and data on socio-demographics, medical history, triggers, and outcomes were collected via structured questionnaires and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.

Results

The study included 340 adult asthma patients, predominantly female (n=227, 66.8%) and Bahraini (n=321, 94.4%), with a mean age of 44.3 years. Asthma control was classified as controlled (n=195, 57.4%), partially controlled (n=77, 22.6%), and uncontrolled (n=68, 20%). No significant differences in control were found by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, or comorbidities. However, monthly family income (P=0.006) and education level (P=0.002) were significant predictors of asthma control. Uncontrolled asthma was also linked to increased hospitalizations (P=0.045), emergency visits (P&lt;0.001), salbutamol use (P&lt;0.001), and absenteeism (P=0.014). Common triggers included dust (56.2%), colds (45.6%), and perfumes/incense (42.3%). Exposure to pets (P=0.001), winter weather (P=0.00l), and viral infections (P=0.027) significantly worsened asthma control.

Conclusion

A significant proportion of patients in Bahrain did not achieve adequate asthma control, particularly those with lower socioeconomic status and who were exposed to certain triggers like pets, viruses, and cold weather. Uncontrolled asthma increased healthcare utilization, and led to higher rates of absenteeism, highlighting the importance of enhanced education, regular monitoring, and improved healthcare accessibility",,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/figure/file/1794082/article_river_b91ce5c0b83d11f09b08bf853d024ba4-492981f4-4cbc-4062-83b1-15fc23e02bdb.png,,,2025-11-03 03:18:15.179357

Environmental advocates say the bill, introduced by U.S. Representatives Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Jared Golden (D-ME) in July 2025, is a fossil fuel and agriculture industry wish list that will weaken NEPA protections. In recognition of ‚Äúthe profound impact of man’s activity on the interrelations of all components of the natural environment,‚Äù¬†NEPA’s statement of purpose¬†‚Äúdeclare[s] a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment.‚Äù¬†By requiring environmental assessments (EAs) or environmental impact statements (EISs) for federal actions, it creates a procedural barrier to environmentally damaging proposals.¬†¬† The requirements of NEPA go beyond the production of reports.¬†In the process of producing¬†EAs and EISs, NEPA requires the agency to define the purpose and need for the project and examine all reasonable alternatives.¬†This¬†alternatives¬†assessment is a model for environmental policy that should be adopted by agencies regardless of whether it is considering actions that meet NEPA’s thresholds.
