This study aimed to identify and analyze the dominant bacterial species in airborne bioaerosols at the Jahanabad Industrial Zone WWTPs in Meybod, and to examine their relationship with environmental factors. This study was conducted in the spring and summer of 2020 at the Jahanabad Industrial WWTP in Meybod. Over a period of 6 months, 96 bacterial bioaerosol samples were collected using an Anderson device, and environmental parameters were measured simultaneously. After differential tests and examination of phenotypic characteristics, the dominant colonies were maintained in TSB medium with 30% glycerol and confirmed by PCR. A total of 19 bacterial species belonging to 5 genera were identified through sequencing. The most dominant genus observed was Bacillus (52.6%), followed by Kocuria (26.3%) and Micrococcus (10.5%). The equalization tank (ET) exhibited the highest mean concentrations (176.98 ± 12.37 CFU/m3; 75.13 ± 5.25 CFU/plate), while the lowest levels were observed 100 m downstream (100D) of the treatment plant (36.81 ± 13.89 CFU/m3; 15.63 ± 5.89 CFU/plate). No significant correlation was found between bioaerosol concentrations and wind speed (r = − 0.08, p = 0.44). However, a significant positive correlation was observed with relative humidity (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001), and significant negative correlations were found with Temperature (r = − 0.56, p &lt; 0.001), UVA (r = − 0.51, p &lt; 0.001), and UVC radiation (r = − 0.59, p &lt; 0.001). This study demonstrated that industrial WWTPs, regardless of variations in wastewater characteristics, possess a high potential for emitting bacterial bioaerosols into the environment, posing potential risks to both worker health and the surrounding ecosystem.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-28692-1/MediaObjects/41598_2025_28692_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-12-29 13:00:42.941745

This study investigated the concentrations of essential and potentially toxic metals in the meat and liver of eighty small ruminants in Lorestan, Iran and assessed the risks associated with their consumption. Essential (Co, Se, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, and Zn) and potentially toxic (Ni, Cd, and Pb) metal concentrations were measured using ICP-OES. The sources and distribution patterns of essential and toxic trace metals were examined using multivariate statistical analyses including the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Human health risk was evaluated using the lifetime cancer risk, the hazard ratio and the hazard index, and uncertainty in these parameters was quantified through Monte Carlo simulation. Most metals were present at concentrations consistent with international standards, whereas Zn with values from 75.33 to 132.5&nbsp;mg/kg, Ni with values from 0.76 to 1.2&nbsp;mg /kg and Pb with values from 0.12 to 0.65&nbsp;mg/kg exceeded the limits recommended by FAO/WHO. The hazard index was less than one, indicating a low probability of non-carcinogenic effects. However, the lifetime cancer risk suggested a moderate carcinogenic risk associated with nickel in meat. Multivariate analysis showed that manganese, iron, copper and cadmium were primarily associated with natural terrestrial sources, while Ni, Pb and Zn were linked to anthropogenic inputs. These findings highlight the need to assess grazing environments and water sources, improve hygienic practices during slaughter and establish maximum permissible levels for trace elements to reinforce food safety monitoring.",,,,,2025-12-27 16:59:21.841023

These risks are particularly relevant for fossil fuel power plants located in residential and agricultural areas. High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors were employed to analyze environmental samples, including soil, water, and plants collected around the West Delta fossil fuel power station in Egypt. The activity levels of both man-made and naturally occurring radionuclides, such as 226Ra, 228Ra, and40K, were measured, and the corresponding ecological and radiological hazards were assessed using several radiological hazard indices. The findings showed elevated concentrations of 226Ra, 228Ra, and40K specifically in agricultural areas near the power station, with some values exceeding internationally recommended guideline values. The calculated radioecological indicators highlight potential long-term exposure risks for nearby populations and ecosystems. These results indicate the need for targeted monitoring and site-specific mitigation measures in the most impacted areas. while providing essential baseline data for future environmental monitoring. This study provides the first comprehensive radiological and radioecological assessment around the West Delta power station, offering new baseline data for environmental monitoring and risk management.",,,,,2025-12-27 08:58:20.917559
