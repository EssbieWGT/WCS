This breakthrough comes at a critical time. Recent data from Project Apis m. shows devastating honeybee colony losses among commercial beekeepers with 62% of colonies lost between June 2024 and March 2025. With varroa mites developing resistance to traditional treatments, beekeepers urgently need new solutions. 
¬†
What sets it apart:
üêù Targets varroa mites with precision 
üêù Long lasting mite control - up to 18 weeks
üêù Extensive field and lab testing to demonstrate efficacy, use patterns, and safety
üêù Safe for honeybees, humans, and beneficial species

This is a new chapter in protecting the pollinators essential to our food system. 

Norroa will be available for sale through Mann Lake Bee & Ag Supply. Learn more at norroa.com.
