,Costs & Impacts,2026-01-25 00:19:00+00:00,nashuatelegraph.com,"Massive sewage spill flowing into Potomac River upstream from Washington By MICHAEL PHILLIS, REBECCA BOONE and GARY FIELDS Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — A massive pipe rupture has sent sewage spilling into the Potomac River. The spill of about 40 million gallons of sewage a day is turning part of the river gray upriver of Washington, D.C. The utility, DC Water, is hooking up pumps to divert sewage around the rupture and allow crews to make repairs. It has cautioned people to stay out of the area and to wash their skin if exposed. The spill was caused by a 72-inch diameter sewer pipe that collapsed late Monday. Witnesses describe a horrific smell and sewage bursting out of the ground. The utility said says the spill is not a threat to public drinking water.  WASHINGTON (AP) — A massive pipe that moves millions of gallons of sewage has ruptured and sent wastewater flowing into the Potomac River northwest of Washington, D.C., polluting it ahead of a major winter storm that has repair crews scrambling. DC Water, which operates the sewer system, is hooking up pumps to divert sewage around the rupture and allow crews to make repairs. It has cautioned people to stay out of the area and to wash their skin if exposed. The spill was caused by a 72-inch (183-centimeter) diameter sewer pipe that collapsed late Monday, shooting sewage out of the ground and into the river. DC Water spokesperson John Lisle said the utility estimates the overflow at about 40 million gallons (about 150 million liters) each day — enough to fill about 66 Olympic-size swimming pools — but it’s not clear exactly how much has spilled into the river since the overflow began. Signs warn the public to stay away “Oh, my god, the smell is horrific,” said Dean Naujoks, the Potomac Riverkeeper and part of an environmental nonprofit. “It’s such high concentrations of sewage that just grabbing a sample is a public health risk.” Associated Press video from the scene showed signs posted near the river that read “DANGER” and “Raw Sewage” and warned people not to enter the area. Naujoks and another man donned protective gloves to take samples of water from the river to test for E. coli and other bacteria. Small bits of debris could be seen floating in some of the sample bottles. The spill occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland, along Clara Barton Parkway, which hugs the northern edge of the Potomac River near Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historic Park. Crews are removing lock gates on the C & O Canal and will set up pumps to divert the sewage into the canal, rerouting it away from the river and back into the sewage system downstream. The pumps have enough capacity to capture all of the sewage flow in dry weather, said Lisle, but they could be overwhelmed by a surge in stormwater. Crews will work through the weekend, when a bad winter storms is expected, Lisle said, and they hope to have the bypass set up by Monday. The spill does not impact drinking water, which is a separate system, DC Water said. Naujoks said the spill is happening at time when the river is low. He went out to look at it Wednesday and was “kind of stunned.” “Sewage is just bubbling up like a small geyser, maybe 2, 3 feet into the air,” he said. “Sewage water is running in every direction.” The District of Columbia Department of the Environment did not immediately respond to a request for comment, including whether it is testing the river’s water. Damaged pipeline is one of several sections identified for repair DC Water knew the pipeline was deteriorating, and rehabilitation work on a section about a quarter-mile from the break began in September and was recently completed, Lisle said. Repair work on additional “high priority” sections of the pipeline is expected to start later this year, according to the DC Water website. The pipeline, called the Potomac Interceptor, was first installed in the 1960s. There’s a huge funding gap for water infrastructure in the U.S., said Gary Belan, a senior director with American Rivers, an environmental organization that advocates for clean waterways. “I know a lot of the wastewater folks are trying to catch up as best they can, but this is something we see and will continue to see, where these pipes fail and these massive sewage dumps occur,” Belan said. “This is why we can’t defer maintenance of our wastewater infrastructure. Too often, we’re dependent on these disasters to prod us forward.” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, speaking at a press conference declaring a snow emergency for the impending storm, said authorities there were aware of the sewage spill “but I can’t give you an intelligent response right now.” She said D.C. officials would be more forthcoming as soon as they could. Kelly Offner, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson for the mid-Atlantic region, said the agency was coordinating with DC Water, the Maryland Department of the Environment and other federal, state and local authorities to assess the impact on the environment from the Potomac Interceptor sanitary sewer overflow. The federal agency oversees DC Water’s sewer operations under a 2015 federal consent decree. “DC Water has provided daily updates since the overflow was discovered on January 19, 2026, and has been coordinating efforts to contain the overflow, monitor environmental impacts, and communicate with the public,” Offner said in an emailed response to questions. An EPA survey of wastewater infrastructure needs from 2022 estimated that the District of Columbia needs roughly $1.33 billion to replace or rehabilitate structurally deteriorating sanitary or combined sewers within the next 20 years. Nationally, hundreds of billions in infrastructure investment is needed over the next two decades for clean water problems like aging sewer pipes. In other places where sewer breaks are persistent, it can lead to backups into homes and regular flooding. ___ Boone reported from Boise, Idaho. ___ The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Their routine monitoring relies on time-consuming, labour-demanding culture-based methods, which are limited to detecting total somatic coliphages. Here, we developed and validated a novel family-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay targeting four major families of somatic coliphages—Myoviridae, Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Microviridae—to enhance sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. The assays were designed using in silico primer screening against reference genomes. The qPCR assay was specific to the phage families (100% assay specificity within the tested prototypes) and had a LOD and LOQ of 10.4 copies/µl, 2.7 copies/µl, 26.5 copies/µl, and 3.3 copies/µl for Myoviridae, Microviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae, respectively. Efficiencies between 90 and 110% were achieved. Coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.993–0.996. Comparison of ISO (culture-based method) and qPCR methods revealed significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05), showing that the methods are comparable. The qPCR method was tested on a range of environmental waters to demonstrate wide application of the assay. This showed season and source-specific patterns in phage family distribution, with Podoviridae and Siphoviridae significantly enriched in winter-collected farm water samples, and Myoviridae dominating in farm summer samples, and a more even phage-family relative abundance in wastewater with no significant differences. We suggest that this qPCR assay could be used as a screening tool to complement standard protocols for regulatory monitoring, ensuring drinking water safety. It is also a valuable research tool for investigating the environmental ecology of somatic coliphages and understanding sources of faecal pollution.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41545-025-00541-8/MediaObjects/41545_2025_541_Figa_HTML.png,,,2026-01-24 11:00:32.514009

The matrix effect, together with the instability of the sensitivity are controlled by spiking the sample with Ra-226. The method is simple and fast with a detection limit around of 0.1&nbsp;fg g-1 (3.6&nbsp;mBq kg-1), which is tenfold lower than required by the EU Directive for water consumption (40&nbsp;mBq kg-1) and five times better than results obtained from alternative direct method for routine analysis described in the literature. The method can easily be implemented for routine analysis Ra-226 which was demonstrated by direct determination of Ra-226 in IAEA proficiency test water sample. This is the first time that the accuracy (trueness and precision) of a mass spectrometry method for the direct determination of Ra-226 has been tested and confirmed in an independent proficiency test.",,,,,2026-01-22 17:57:54.008775

As the climate warms, ice cover in the Great Lakes is expected to decline, which in turn will create more lake effect precipitation, reduce ice cover for recreation, and alter habitat for aquatic species. While it is important to understand the historical ice patterns to better understand past distributions of aquatic species and improve the accuracy of forecasts for future ice cover on the lakes, Great Lakes ice cover data prior to 1973 is scarce, due to the limited routine satellite observations. We used weather station data around the Great Lakes to compile daily air temperature, calculate cumulative freezing degree-days and net melting degree-days from 1897–2023, and develop raster layers estimating ice duration and variability spatially during the historical period from 1897–1960.",,,,,2026-01-22 15:58:22.258616
