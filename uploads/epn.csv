Dr. Russo et al., in ‚ÄúTo improve or not to improve? The dilemma of ‚Äúbat-friendly‚Äù farmland potentially becoming an ecological trap‚Äù (2024), write, ‚Äú[W]hen restoring habitats for bats in conventional farmland, potential unintended outcomes must be considered, particularly if restoration actions are not accompanied by mitigation of key threats. These threats include the persistent and widespread use of pesticides. . .‚Äù (See also a¬†study¬†in¬†Environmental Entomology, which shows that habitat and open space near agricultural fields become a killing field of pesticides, threatening biodiversity due to contamination from toxic drift.) As this false sense of protection persists, Beyond Pesticides is calling on governors to adopt policies that support organic land management and ecological balance.¬†Organic practices are by definition a systems change that is aligned with nature and the biodiversity protection that is needed. Ecological traps are incremental steps that fail to address underlying systemic problems that allow hazards to persist.

Colorimetric surface wipes that immediately change color on a gradient from yellow-to-red with lead could address this gap, but they have not been tested or utilized extensively in non-occupational settings. To understand the usability of colorimetric wipes in lead home investigations with different potential sources of lead. We collected 104 colorimetric wipes to assess lead levels on surfaces from nine homes and seven vehicles from lead-exposed construction workers living with children. Colorimetric wipe results (n = 81) were compared with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy laboratory analysis. Lead was detected on 46(58%) of home surface wipes, with highest percentage of red wipes from surfaces in kitchen, followed by entrance, living room, bedroom, and laundry room samples. For vehicle surface wipes, 17 (71%) detected lead, with the highest percent of red wipes in the trunk, followed by back and front seat areas. Wipe color readings were significantly and positively correlated with laboratory analysis (Kendall’s τ = 0.42). At the 18 μg/sample threshold (i.e., level at which the wipe is expected to turn pink/red), the method showed high specificity (87%), moderate accuracy (78%), high negative predictive value (87%), and low false positive rate (13%). Of the wipes above 10 µg/sample public-health lead guideline, 80% changed color, suggesting high sensitivity.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41370-025-00818-7/MediaObjects/41370_2025_818_Figa_HTML.png,,,2025-11-22 19:59:45.704596
