This follows the global consensus reached on aviation environmental policies and framework under ICAO’s leadership at its recent Assembly.  The statement to the sixty-third session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 63) will focus on updates such as:  Aviation having one of the most comprehensive and robust environmental monitoring and reporting systems, covering nearly 100% of CO2 emissions from international aviation;A record number of Action Plans from 154 Member States covering 99% of total air traffic showcases policies and roadmaps to reduce international aviation emissions; and130 Member States are voluntarily participating in implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2026.  ICAO’s submission reports on progress on ICAO’s Implementation Roadmap, including the Long-Term Global Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), ACT-SAF Programme and Finvest Hub.The ICAO delegation will also host a side event entitled “International Aviation and UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7: Clean Energy”, to highlight the initiatives by the international aviation sector on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other cleaner energies and to demonstrate how these efforts contribute to the broader clean energy transition to SDG 7.  Through ICAO's leadership, the recent Assembly concluded with the adoption of three environmental Resolutions on climate change, CORSIA, and general provisions on noise and local air quality to further strengthen air transport’s global framework for decarbonization and environmentally responsible development.ICAO’s upcoming engagement at COP30 represents an opportunity to drive accelerated climate action and implementation by Member States, international organizations, and other stakeholders to ensure that global air transport continues to decrease its environmental impact. 07 November 2025",,https://www.icao.int/sites/default/files/2025-11/CORSIA-Environment_0.jpg,,,2025-11-07 21:07:37.560321

Where a WCPP applies, owners and operators must ensure that exposures do not exceed the EPA’s limits, even if they are far below OSHA’s regulatory values. As a result, employers may be obligated to implement engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to achieve exposure levels well beneath OSHA’s PELs/STELs.",,https://ogletree.com/app/uploads/Insights/manufacturing/Manufacturing_crystal-kwok-487021-unsplash-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-05 15:21:02.169977
