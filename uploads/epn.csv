He withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, paused all US international aid assistance, and signed an executive order aimed at “unleashing American energy.” The order promoted the development of oil, natural gas, and coal; terminated the American Climate Corps; froze disbursement of federal funds for clean energy programmes approved by Congress; and called for elimination of the “electric vehicle mandate” as well as California’s long held authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards.

This was just day one of his presidency. In the weeks that followed, the newly created Department of Government Efficiency began breaking down federal climate infrastructure, including programmes that implement emissions standards and those that track and report basic climate data. The Environmental Protection Agency launched sweeping regulatory rollbacks. These include rescinding its foundational finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare and reversing rules that curb pollution from power plants and vehicles.

Bronchial asthma (BA) is a chronic lung disease characterized by airway inflammation and variable airflow obstruction. In Bahrain and across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, there is a scarcity of data regarding asthma control, triggers, and associated outcomes. This study sought to evaluate the level of asthma control among Bahraini adults, identify prevalent triggers, examine related socio-demographic and clinical factors, and assess the impact of poor asthma control on health outcomes.

Methods

A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to November 2024, involving asthma patients attending primary care centers in Bahrain. Asthma control was assessed using the Asthma Control Test, and data on socio-demographics, medical history, triggers, and outcomes were collected via structured questionnaires and analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.

Results

The study included 340 adult asthma patients, predominantly female (n=227, 66.8%) and Bahraini (n=321, 94.4%), with a mean age of 44.3 years. Asthma control was classified as controlled (n=195, 57.4%), partially controlled (n=77, 22.6%), and uncontrolled (n=68, 20%). No significant differences in control were found by age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, or comorbidities. However, monthly family income (P=0.006) and education level (P=0.002) were significant predictors of asthma control. Uncontrolled asthma was also linked to increased hospitalizations (P=0.045), emergency visits (P&lt;0.001), salbutamol use (P&lt;0.001), and absenteeism (P=0.014). Common triggers included dust (56.2%), colds (45.6%), and perfumes/incense (42.3%). Exposure to pets (P=0.001), winter weather (P=0.00l), and viral infections (P=0.027) significantly worsened asthma control.

Conclusion

A significant proportion of patients in Bahrain did not achieve adequate asthma control, particularly those with lower socioeconomic status and who were exposed to certain triggers like pets, viruses, and cold weather. Uncontrolled asthma increased healthcare utilization, and led to higher rates of absenteeism, highlighting the importance of enhanced education, regular monitoring, and improved healthcare accessibility",,https://assets.cureus.com/uploads/figure/file/1794082/article_river_b91ce5c0b83d11f09b08bf853d024ba4-492981f4-4cbc-4062-83b1-15fc23e02bdb.png,,,2025-11-03 03:18:15.179357

Environmental advocates say the bill, introduced by U.S. Representatives Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Jared Golden (D-ME) in July 2025, is a fossil fuel and agriculture industry wish list that will weaken NEPA protections.

E&E News just published a remarkable deep dive into the FOIA-released emails of EPA leadership, exposing how senior officials tracked, targeted, and retaliated against employees who signed the Declaration of Dissent.

Among those emails, Michael Molina, a senior Trump official in the EPA Office of Public Affairs, bragged:

Well, guess what? Now we have our own list of names and we will demand justice.

The event, hosted by Director of Deponija DOO Aleksandar Božović, brought together EU Ambassador to Montenegro Johann Sattler, State Secretary at the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Northern Region Development Zoran Dabetić, Mayor of Podgorica Saša Mujović, and Director of the Environmental Protection Agency Milan Gazdić. ""What we are celebrating today is not just a new piece of equipment – it's a new mindset. A mindset that says: waste is not destiny, and pollution is not inevitable. With this machine, Montenegro is turning one of its oldest and dirtiest environmental problems into a solution that benefits the entire country,"" underlined Ambassador Sattler. Copyright: Evropska kuća Director of Deponija DOO, Aleksandar Božović, expressed satisfaction with the achieved results. He emphasised that the company continues to move forward at the same pace towards new successes. “There is still work to be done. In Montenegro, we have approximately 2,000 tonnes of waste tyres,” Božović said. The Mayor of Podgorica, Saša Mujović, stated that he is very proud that a new era of environmental awareness is beginning. “We will continue in the same direction. Podgorica must be clean,” said Mujović. The Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Milan Gazdić, stated that he was proud to witness the start of a project that carries such environmental importance. He took the opportunity to thank Božović and all those who devote attention to environmental issues. The new industrial shredder can process around five tonnes of used tyres per hour, transforming a difficult waste stream into reusable material for export and recycling markets. The system is fully automated, operated by a single technician, and equipped with remote factory support via 4G for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting. Initially, Deponija will process its own tyre stock. In the near future, the facility will be able to serve municipalities and businesses across Montenegro, preventing discarded tyres from polluting rivers and landscapes. Copyright: Evropska kuća The launch of the tyre-shredding facility marks another milestone in the EU-supported national environmental campaign ""Čuvaj da te čuva"", which has achieved tangible results in just five months: Five major pollution sites cleaned or rehabilitated, a national platform launched for reporting eco-crime, a specialised police unit established to address environmental offences, and concrete steps taken to reduce single-use plastics. Earlier this week, the campaign also supported the clean-up of the Gračanica River, showing how community action, institutional leadership and partnerships can restore nature—and public trust—fast. The new shredder represents more than technology—it reflects a national commitment to environmental responsibility and a future where waste becomes a resource. Together, we can end illegal dumping, keep rivers clean, and turn waste into value. Protect it, so it protects you.",,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025/image_medium_resolution/2aae8328-7ff1-46bd-9ec6-a5198efe58bc.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 20:06:32.860102
