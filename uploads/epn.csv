,,2025-12-31 06:38:41+00:00,ChemRxiv,Toxicity Screening of Five Tire-Related Chemicals using New Approach Methodologies (NAMs),,,,,,https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/69455f62e3cb457e13a46297,"There is increasing concern around the potential environmental and public health impacts of tire wear transformation products even as significant data gaps exist on the environmental fate and potential ecological and human health impacts. Here, we provide a preliminary review and synthesis of existing information concerning five specific tire wear transformation products, including 6PPDQ, 4 ADPA, two newly identified constituents in snow and wastewater, TP 249 and TP 259_2, as well as the parent compound, 6PPD. We conduct a systematic review, relying on data sources and analytical models ranging from in silico to in vitro to in vivo, including read-across and quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR), and data gap filling techniques based on data from chemically similar analogues. We summarize the available data and modeling results for these constituents to identify commonalities and differences across them and to evaluate whether these methods provide insights into potential behavior in the environment and toxicity mechanisms. Assay results are available from the US Environmental Protection Agency Computational Toxicology dashboard for 6PPD and 4 ADPA and show that the majority of activated assays relate to cell viability and cycling, cytotoxicity, and cell proliferation and energetics, consistent with targeted in vivo and in vitro studies from the literature. Generalized read-across and other QSAR-based models for 6PPDQ, TP 249, and TP 259_2 show very few or no statistically-significant predictions, but do suggest a set of assays in common across all constituents with consistent cellular and organ targets, including nuclear receptor activation and cell energetics across genes largely expressed in the kidney and liver, supporting limited in vivo and in vitro data from the literature. No clear conclusions can be drawn around observed differences in acute mortality and sensitivity across fish species following exposure to 6PPDQ, but likely cellular and subcellular targets suggest activation of genes related to DNA repair, cell proliferation, and oxidative stress. Overall, existing data are insufficient to make conclusive evaluations of the potential impact of these tire wear particles to human health or the environment. Additional, targeted studies such as specific in vitro tests together with limited in vivo testing, and emerging transcriptomic methods as proposed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could help fill these data gaps.",,https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/69455f62e3cb457e13a46297/largeThumb/toxicity-screening-of-five-tire-related-chemicals-using-new-approach-methodologies-na-ms.jpg,,,2025-12-31 07:59:18.740083

It is therefore one of the important sectors to take into account to limit global warming. Indian Ocean cities produce significant CO2 emissions during electricity consumption. Their volume and accuracy remain practically unknown and untested. Indeed, until now, there is no methodology suggested by the researchers to evaluate Fossil Fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO2) emission, and electricity consumption in this region. Aware of these crucial problems, this study was carried out to assess and analyse CO2 emissions coming from Electricity consumption (called Scope2) in 111 cities located in the Indian Ocean from 55 Power plants between 2015 and 2022 (08 years) and in four sectors (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and On-road). To carry out a good comparison, all the data were grouped into three categories, before the lockdown measures due to COVID-19 (2015–2018); During the COVID-19-induced lockdown period (2019–2020); and after the lockdown period (2021–2022). The results showed that the CO2 emission difference is significant in the residential and commercial sectors. It was observed that CO2 emissions increased in 2019–2022 in the residential, industrial, and on-road sectors whereas, simultaneously during the same period, it decreased in the commercial sector. During the three periods, the CO2 emissions rate was the highest in the residential sector (around 52%), and the least on-road (around 1%). The significant difference in the commercial sector suggests a decrease in electricity consumption during the peak of the pandemic due to reduced business activities. Businesses adapted to new operating conditions, such as reduced hours or enhanced energy efficiency measures, which also contributed to the change in consumption patterns.",,,,,2025-12-31 10:00:35.175030
