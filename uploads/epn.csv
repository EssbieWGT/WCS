SO₂ measurements typically reflect sample durations of about one hour, while other pollutants are reported according to contemporaneous EPA monitoring practices, with substantial variation in sampling frequency and spatial coverage across pollutants and years. SO₂ has the broadest and most consistent coverage, with thousands of monitors operating in over 1,000 counties, whereas TSP is measured less frequently, O₃ data are largely unavailable prior to 1980, NO₂ coverage declines by the late 1980s, and CO data become widely available starting in the mid-1970s.  The provided .do file serves as an example for how to process the provided datasets into a daily monitor-level dataset.",,,,,2026-01-14 21:59:02.918275

A rollback proposal could come any day now — and will be a blatant giveaway to Big Oil and auto executives. While industry stakeholders rake in profits, Trump's proposal will let more cars burn more gas, resulting in more oil use, higher gas costs, and worse air pollution that harms our health and climate. 

We need to keep the EPA's current standards in place to deliver cleaner cars that improve our quality of life and help protect the climate that wildlife needs to thrive.  

Call out Trump's polluter-first agenda: Tell the EPA to protect our progress toward a better future by preserving clean-car standards — not running them off the road ➡️ https://bit.ly/3LKOBF8

The agency plans to stop considering the value of lives saved when setting regulatory limits, focusing instead on the costs to industry. The change was announced with little public attention, but it represents a significant break from decades of regulatory practice.

The Clean Air Act, dating back to 1963, established a framework in which reducing pollution was understood to save lives, and those benefits were explicitly considered in policymaking. Over time, that approach contributed to substantial improvements in air quality, reductions in pollution-related illness, and longer life expectancy across the United States. Accounting for lives saved was not incidental to this progress. It was central to how public health protections were justified and sustained.

Removing lives saved from regulatory analysis marks a shift away from that public health foundation. When benefits to human health are no longer counted, protections become easier to weaken and harder to defend. This decision belongs to a broader dismantling of public health infrastructure, where protections are weakened not by overt repeal, but by removing the tools that once made them defensible.
