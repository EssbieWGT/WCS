Katharine Lang looks at the issue

Recent news has highlighted concern about the presence in drinking water of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of more than 10 000 synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products since the 1950s.

The non-stick, water repelling, and grease repelling properties of PFAS mean they are widely used. Skin creams and cosmetics, floor and car polish, dishwasher rinse aid, fabric treatments, food packaging, non-stick cookware, and outdoor clothing and shoes are just some of the household items that rely on PFAS. Other uses include firefighting foams, human and animal medicines, and medical devices, and they are widely used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, automotive, and aerospace industries.12

Within their molecules, carbon and fluorine atoms form a strongly linked chain that is not easily broken down in the environment, leading them to be dubbed “forever chemicals.”3

PFAS enter the water system through two main pathways.2 They leach directly into groundwater from firefighting foams, plant protection products such as insecticides, landfills, and from industrial use and manufacturing processes.

Many also enter waterways from households, being shed from clothing during washing, from cookware, and from cosmetics into wastewater. Even after treatment many remain in the water that comes out of our taps.

Different PFAS have been linked to a variety of health concerns, such as affecting the reproductive system, harming the development of fetuses, changing liver enzymes, disrupting thyroid function, increasing cholesterol concentrations, and lowering antibody responses to vaccines. …",,https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmj/391/8475.cover-source.jpg,,,2025-11-17 13:04:00.345189

The organization‚Äôs network is asking Mayors nationwide to lead the transition, pointing to the¬†inadequacy of the current system of regulating pesticides based on risk assessments of individual chemicals¬†or individual chemical families. Chemicals interact, causing increased impacts on¬†human,¬†ecological health, and¬†biodiversity. Moreover, humans, other species, and the biosphere rarely experience exposure to single chemicals or chemical families;¬†exposure to multiple chemicals¬†is the rule, not the exception.¬†¬† Synergistic effects associated with the use of the weedkiller glyphosate¬†have been implicated in several studies showing magnified adverse impact in soil organisms and in mixture with other chemicals:¬† The extensive use of glyphosate is linked to effects on nontarget soil organisms, with the risks to soil ecosystems widely studied.

Conventional physical disinfection methods have proven ineffective, and chemical treatments carry potential risks to both human health and the environment. In this context, radiation technology emerges as a promising alternative due to its superior disinfection efficiency. This study examines five varieties of traditional Chinese paper: Xuan paper 1, Xuan paper 2, Bamboo paper 1, Bamboo paper 2, and Bark paper. Following electron beam irradiation, we evaluated tensile strength, polymerization, and color change in both fresh and aged samples. Our results indicate that while irradiation treatment has minor effects on tensile strength and color variability, it significantly reduces the degree of polymerization. In contrast, accelerated aging treatment negatively impacts nearly all parameters. Consequently, we propose that irradiation treatment exerts minimal influence on traditional paper, suggesting it could serve as an effective sterilization method for artifact preservation.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs40494-025-02153-4/MediaObjects/40494_2025_2153_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-11-15 13:02:22.672622
