,,2025-10-31 22:29:23+00:00,EEAS,Turning Waste into Value: Montenegro Launches First Tyre-Shredding Facility,,,,,,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/montenegro/turning-waste-value-montenegro-launches-first-tyre-shredding-facility_en,"Deponija DOO Podgorica has officially put into operation Montenegro's first tyre-shredding facility — a concrete step towards solving one of the country's most persistent pollution problems in building a circular, cleaner future. The event, hosted by Director of Deponija DOO Aleksandar Božović, brought together EU Ambassador to Montenegro Johann Sattler, State Secretary at the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Northern Region Development Zoran Dabetić, Mayor of Podgorica Saša Mujović, and Director of the Environmental Protection Agency Milan Gazdić. ""What we are celebrating today is not just a new piece of equipment – it's a new mindset. A mindset that says: waste is not destiny, and pollution is not inevitable. With this machine, Montenegro is turning one of its oldest and dirtiest environmental problems into a solution that benefits the entire country,"" underlined Ambassador Sattler. Copyright: Evropska kuća Director of Deponija DOO, Aleksandar Božović, expressed satisfaction with the achieved results. He emphasised that the company continues to move forward at the same pace towards new successes. “There is still work to be done. In Montenegro, we have approximately 2,000 tonnes of waste tyres,” Božović said. The Mayor of Podgorica, Saša Mujović, stated that he is very proud that a new era of environmental awareness is beginning. “We will continue in the same direction. Podgorica must be clean,” said Mujović. The Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Milan Gazdić, stated that he was proud to witness the start of a project that carries such environmental importance. He took the opportunity to thank Božović and all those who devote attention to environmental issues. The new industrial shredder can process around five tonnes of used tyres per hour, transforming a difficult waste stream into reusable material for export and recycling markets. The system is fully automated, operated by a single technician, and equipped with remote factory support via 4G for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting. Initially, Deponija will process its own tyre stock. In the near future, the facility will be able to serve municipalities and businesses across Montenegro, preventing discarded tyres from polluting rivers and landscapes. Copyright: Evropska kuća The launch of the tyre-shredding facility marks another milestone in the EU-supported national environmental campaign ""Čuvaj da te čuva"", which has achieved tangible results in just five months: Five major pollution sites cleaned or rehabilitated, a national platform launched for reporting eco-crime, a specialised police unit established to address environmental offences, and concrete steps taken to reduce single-use plastics. Earlier this week, the campaign also supported the clean-up of the Gračanica River, showing how community action, institutional leadership and partnerships can restore nature—and public trust—fast. The new shredder represents more than technology—it reflects a national commitment to environmental responsibility and a future where waste becomes a resource. Together, we can end illegal dumping, keep rivers clean, and turn waste into value. Protect it, so it protects you.",,https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025/image_medium_resolution/2aae8328-7ff1-46bd-9ec6-a5198efe58bc.jpeg,,,2025-10-31 20:06:32.860102

To examine the association between PFAS in public water system drinking water and concentrations in serum among a general population of California adults. The CARE (California Regional Exposure) biomonitoring study measured PFAS in serum of Southern and Eastern California adults between 2018 and 2020. Participant addresses were geocoded and geographically assigned to public water systems (PWS). Between 2019 and 2022, the California State Water Resources Control Board issued investigative PFAS monitoring orders to potentially impacted PWS, focusing primarily on source wells. PFAS detections above the required reporting limit (4 ng/L for PFAS included in the final analysis) were used to assess associations with serum PFAS levels. Out of 563 participants in Southern California included in the final analysis, 314 (56%) lived in a PWS service area with at least one PFAS detected in their untreated source water and/or treated drinking water. Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) geometric mean concentrations were 31.9% (95% CI: 11.1–56.6%) higher among participants whose PWS had at least one PFHxS detection compared to those without detectable levels. For participants with post-treatment drinking water data (n = 235), serum PFAS geometric mean concentrations were higher compared to those without detections for all modeled PFAS: PFHxS 79.9% (38.3–133.9%), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) 30.4% (5.5–61.2%), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) 31.2% (0.7–70.9%), and ∑5 PFAS 42.0% (14.5–76.1%).",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41370-025-00817-8/MediaObjects/41370_2025_817_Figa_HTML.png,,,2025-10-31 07:18:40.779550
