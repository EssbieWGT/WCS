Multiple press reports indicate not much progress has been made thus far in resolving the shutdown dispute.

The House is not in session. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on Sunday that if the President determines that negotiations are not productive, he will begin layoffs – echoing a memo issued by OMB before the shutdown (referenced in our prior alert), which stated that certain federal workers could be “RIF’ed,” essentially fired, instead of furloughed. Several press reports have stated that in past shutdowns, federal workers have not been fired.
