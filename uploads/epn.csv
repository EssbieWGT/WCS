The Fast-track Approvals Amendment Bill passed its first reading on Thursday and Chris Bishop, the minister responsible for Resource Management Act (RMA) reform, wants it through Parliament by year’s end. The bill makes changes to the fast-track regime that was passed less than a year ago, with Bishop describing it as “a range of technical and machinery amendments” to streamline processes, based on consultation with stakeholders. Bishop estimated the changes would slash up to six weeks off approval times. The bill also allows the infrastructure minister (Bishop) to refer new supermarket developments to a fast-track consenting panel on the grounds that the project would increase competition in the grocery sector, using a tool called a Government Policy Statement (GPS). “It takes, on average, 18 months and $1 million to obtain consent for a new supermarket, which, when you think about it, is totally nuts… We’re fixing that,” Bishop said.

This follows the global consensus reached on aviation environmental policies and framework under ICAO’s leadership at its recent Assembly.  The statement to the sixty-third session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 63) will focus on updates such as:  Aviation having one of the most comprehensive and robust environmental monitoring and reporting systems, covering nearly 100% of CO2 emissions from international aviation;A record number of Action Plans from 154 Member States covering 99% of total air traffic showcases policies and roadmaps to reduce international aviation emissions; and130 Member States are voluntarily participating in implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2026.  ICAO’s submission reports on progress on ICAO’s Implementation Roadmap, including the Long-Term Global Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), ACT-SAF Programme and Finvest Hub.The ICAO delegation will also host a side event entitled “International Aviation and UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7: Clean Energy”, to highlight the initiatives by the international aviation sector on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other cleaner energies and to demonstrate how these efforts contribute to the broader clean energy transition to SDG 7.  Through ICAO's leadership, the recent Assembly concluded with the adoption of three environmental Resolutions on climate change, CORSIA, and general provisions on noise and local air quality to further strengthen air transport’s global framework for decarbonization and environmentally responsible development.ICAO’s upcoming engagement at COP30 represents an opportunity to drive accelerated climate action and implementation by Member States, international organizations, and other stakeholders to ensure that global air transport continues to decrease its environmental impact. 07 November 2025",,https://www.icao.int/sites/default/files/2025-11/CORSIA-Environment_0.jpg,,,2025-11-07 21:07:37.560321
