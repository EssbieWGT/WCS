Beyond Pesticides announced an action to Tell EPA and Congress to eliminate PFAS chemicals, including those used in pesticides.¬† In its action Beyond Pesticides pointed to the long history of allowing pesticides on that market that have long residual lives and bioaccumulate in the environment, causing generations of exposure and adverse effects to health and ecosystems. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) exemplifies the generational effect of a toxic pesticide whose effects ha endured for decades, even though it was hailed as a miracle solution for agriculture and public health. PFAS, with a wide variety of uses‚Äîfrom nonstick pans to waterproofing fabrics to firefighting foams to pesticides‚Äîmight similarly lead to the characterization as a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù chemical.

In the current study, 315 frozen imported bovine samples (105 each of muscle, liver, and kidney) collected from local markets in Sohag governorate, Egypt, were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for the determination of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) concentrations. The metals determined were investigated for their potential public health hazards in humans. The mean ± SE concentrations of Hg, Pb, and Cd in beef were 0.312 ± 0.058, 0.684 ± 0.105, and 0.030 ± 0.005, respectively, while the corresponding values in liver samples were 0.273 ± 0.054, 0.763 ± 0.106, and 0.056 ± 0.007, respectively, and in kidney samples were 0.167 ± 0.04, 0.716 ± 0.119, and 0.073 ± 0.014, respectively. Beef samples contained the highest Hg level, while liver samples contained the highest level of Pb, and kidney samples contained the highest level of Cd. More than half of the samples tested exceeded the permissible limits set by International and local food agencies for Hg and Pb; exactly, 62.9, 60, and 54.3% of muscle, liver, and kidney samples, respectively, exceeded the maximum limits of Pb, while 54.3 and 57.1% of muscle and liver samples exceeded the limit of Hg. In contrast, none of the tested liver or kidney samples exceeded the limit of Cd, although only 22.9% of the beef samples exceeded their maximal limit. Although the human health risks estimated in the current study for consuming the contaminated samples were low, high proportions of samples exceeded the permissible limit, and therefore, continuous monitoring of heavy metal residues in food, especially of animal origin, is of great significance.",,,,,2025-12-14 17:58:04.284388

To examine the individual and combined effects of prenatal PAHs exposure and maternal psychological distress on birth outcomes, with emphasis on effect modification by pre-pregnancy BMI. In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 699 pregnant women from two primary hospitals in Hefei, China, from April 2020 through October 2022. Urinary PAHs were assessed using gas chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed via Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), respectively. Logistic regression and BKMR models were used to explore the individual and combined effects of prenatal PAHs exposure and psychological distress on birth outcomes. Logistic regression revealed significant associations between PAHs and anxiety symptoms with adverse birth outcomes. In the overall population, 1-OHPHe is significantly associated with low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.25, 4.03), 2-OHDBF and 2-OHPHe were significantly associated with preterm birth (PTB), respectively (1.43, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.98; 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.90). GAD-7 score in the third tertile was positively linked to macrosomia (OR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.28, 10.06). BKMR demonstrated that among pre-pregnancy overweight/obese women (BMI ≧ 24.0), combined exposure to PAHs, depression, and anxiety was positively associated with LBW. Meanwhile, among the women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI (18.5–23.9), combined exposure was positively associated with macrosomia and PTB.
