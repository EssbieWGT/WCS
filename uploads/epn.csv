Two hundred forty fish samples, comprising 80 each of the three identified species, were collected from the Mediterranean Sea at Damietta coast, Egypt and analyzed for arsenic, mercury, lead, and cadmium contents, which were detected at mean ± SE concentrations (mg/kg) of 2.29 ± 0.22, 0.119 ± 0.019, 0.651 ± 0.131, and 0.042 ± 0.007 in thinlip grey mullet; 1.68 ± 0.18, 0.098 ± 0.018, 1.011 ± 0.169, and 0.049 ± 0.008 in sardine; and 1.87 ± 0.16, 0.055 ± 0.057, 0.965 ± 0.186, and 0.052 ± 0.009 in sand smelt, respectively. Alarmingly, 100% of fish samples exceeded the permissible limit for As, while Hg levels were within the safe limits for all tested samples. Frying and grilling significantly reduced the metal levels. The target hazard quotient, total target hazard quotient in all tested fish samples, exceeded their approved limits for arsenic and lead, while the assessment of the cancer risk values for arsenic in all tested fish species surpassed the cancer slope factor, indicating potential public health risks associated with consuming such fish. This study highlights the need for strict control measures to limit contamination of aquatic resources, especially by arsenic and lead, and to ensure the safety of seafood for human consumption, protecting public health and reducing the risk of fish contamination.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-33257-3/MediaObjects/41598_2025_33257_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2026-01-12 08:59:28.108679

At issue is the reliance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on industry data and agency collusion with chemical manufacturers on its decisions. Beyond Pesticide is questioning the underlying reliability of the data in addition to limitations of the regulatory review process in meeting its statutory duty to protect health and the environment. In addition to the deception, key underlying deficiencies are EPA‚Äôs failure to evaluate endocrine disrupting pesticides and synergistic effects of chemical mixtures.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Friday it will reject Colorado’s latest plan to protect air quality over wilderness areas and national parks, citing the state’s attempt to shutter coal-fired power plants. 
The disapproval marks the latest example of the Trump administration using its authority to buoy the state’s struggling coal industry. Over the last decade, utilities have agreed to shutter all six of Colorado’s coal-fired power plants by 2031 due to state-level climate laws and high costs associated with maintaining the aging facilities.
Coal power plants are also a leading source of dangerous air pollutants like mercury and particulate matter. In 2022, state air quality regulators added planned coal plant closure dates into the draft Regional Haze Plan, which details how the state will protect air quality in highly protected federal lands. The U.S. EPA had previously allowed Colorado and other states to include power plant retirements in those plans.
The Trump administration has repeatedly intervened to keep coal plants open. In December, the Department of Energy issued emergency orders to keep four coal-fired facilities running past closing dates set for the end of 2025. That includes Craig Unit 1, a power plant in northwest Colorado operated by Tri-State Generation and Transmission.

Utility officials asked the EPA to intervene because Colorado’s regional haze plan would have required it to close the Ray Nixon Power Plant, a coal-fired generating station south of Fountain, by the end of 2029.

Burial at sea is completely legal in the United States, provided it follows strict environmental regulations set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The practice has long been associated with naval traditions and is still used today, especially for military veterans.

Bodies must be prepared using biodegradable materials, weighted appropriately, and released at least three nautical miles offshore in waters deeper than 600 feet to minimize environmental impact.

Important Details:

• Burial at sea is legal under U.S. law
• Regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
• Must occur at least 3 nautical miles offshore
• Water depth must exceed 600 feet
• Only biodegradable materials are permitted
• The U.S. Navy offers ceremonies for veterans
• Requires official reporting and permits

This practice blends tradition with environmental responsibility. Burial at sea remains a solemn option that respects both human dignity and marine ecosystems.
