The Trump administration is, once again, using crime as a pretext to carry out its anti-immigrant agenda. In this case, officials are claiming that Operation Midway Blitz is in honor of Illinois resident Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving accident about 100 miles outside of Chicago, allegedly caused by a person who was undocumented.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” DHS said on X. “President Trump and Secretary Noem stand with the victims of illegal alien crime while Governor Pritzker stands with criminal illegal aliens.”

The DHS press release announcing Operation Midway Blitz contains no details about what it will entail, although news reports and officials’ statements have provided more information.

In a social media post on Tuesday, DHS announced: “Operation Midway Blitz will FLOOD THE ZONE with DHS law enforcement in Chicago. @POTUS Trump and @Sec_Noem have a clear message: no city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

Days before DHS’s announcement, Trump posted to social media a bizarre play on the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now, in what appeared to be a threat to declare war on Chicago. (Trump later claimed he only wanted to “clean up” the city, not go to war with it.)

“I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” the post states over an image of Trump as the movie’s lead character with a helicopter and billowing smoke behind him and “Chipocalypse Now” scrawled across the bottom.

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” the post reads, referencing the Department of Defense’s recent name change.

Illinois’s elected officials, community leaders, and city residents have roundly rejected Trump’s attacks on Chicago, which has seen a record decline in crime in recent years.

“We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) posted on X, adding that the city did not receive notice of DHS’s so-called operation.

The mayor then detailed the administration’s abuses against immigrants who are detained, stating, “[t]here are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) also pushed back, posting on X, “this isn’t about fighting crime,” and that the “Trump Administration is focused on scaring Illinoisians.”

Community members and local leaders have held protests, press conferences, and meetings to protect their city from federal agents and, potentially, military troops.

“There is no emergency justifying these harsh and destabilizing operations — other than the Trump Administration’s authoritarian impulses to attack communities that do not support his unpopular and harsh immigration policies,” ACLU of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka told Truthout in an email.

Community members have confirmed that several abductions have already occurred. One of the people taken was a local flower vendor, according to WGN News. Surveillance video shows a man detained by people who appear to be federal agents wearing bulletproof vests, the outlet reported. One of the agents was wearing a Donald Trump-shaped pin.

“This is the type of racial ethnic profiling that is going on,” Illinois Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D) told WGN News. “They didn’t have a court order to come and pick up someone who sells flowers.”

Brandon Lee, director of communications for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), condemned the recent raids in Chicago in an email to Truthout.

“Since the start of last week we have seen the Trump administration escalate its terror campaign on our neighbors and our city,” Lee said, adding that ICIRR is committed to “making sure our community members in Illinois know their rights, and know the resources available to them,” which includes the Family Support Hotline at 855-435-7693.

“The hotline sends called-in tips to our network of Rapid Response Teams who verify ICE presence, and operators offer support to families whose loved ones have been taken,” Lee said.

“No matter how much he tries to make this seem like a narrow operation, Trump’s attacks are broad based and meant to target all immigrants — from grandparents in Albany Park, to flower vendors on Archer Avenue,” Lee continued. “This is a moment when people all across Chicagoland are coming together to reject Trump’s impending occupation and commit to looking out for all of our neighbors.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2233493193-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 16:57:06.349165

After several days of U.S. President Donald Trump threatening a militarized invasion of Chicago, his administration on Monday announced ​“Operation Midway Blitz,” claiming it is ​“in honor of” a young woman allegedly killed by an undocumented immigrant accused of drunk driving about 140 miles south of the Illinois city.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unveiled the immigration operation with a nearly five-minute video featuring Michelle and Joe Abraham, whose 20-year-old daughter Katie was killed in a hit-and-run crash in Urbana in January. The alleged driver, a Guatemalan national, was arrested in Texas a few days later.

DHS Assistant Secretary [for Public Affairs] Tricia McLaughlin said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation ​“will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,” even though the libertarian CATO Institute revealed in June that 65% of immigrants booked by the agency under Trump had no criminal convictions and over 93% were never convicted of violent offenses.

Like Trump has in recent days, McLaughlin took aim at Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, saying that he ​“and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago’s streets — putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals.”

""If President Trump had listened to the city's leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,"" wrote Mayor Brandon Johnson.

While Chicagoans have made their thoughts on a federal invasion clear, carrying signs that said ​“No Trump! No Troops!” and ​“No Nazis — No Kings” during a weekend protest, McLaughlin said that Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ​“have a clear message: No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

Pritzker and Chicago’s Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson, have forcefully pushed back against Trump’s threats to launch a major anti-migrant operation in the city and possibly deploy the National Guard, as he has done in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles, California.

In a New York Times opinion piece published hours before the widely anticipated DHS announcement, Johnson argued that ​“lowering crime rates here does not require an occupation of our city by armed members of the National Guard, as the White House continues to threaten us with. Chicagoans, including survivors of violence, have spoken out against such an extreme measure.”

“If President Trump had listened to the city’s leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,” wrote the mayor, who signed an executive order ahead of the federal operation and is raising a family in Austin on the West Side, ​“one of the parts of our city where gun violence is most pervasive.”

“My administration has managed to make progress in crime reduction with three interconnected strategies: effective and law-abiding policing, violence prevention, and addressing the root causes of crime,” Johnson explained. ​“Our violence prevention work includes programs that employ former gang members to de-escalate conflicts as well as initiatives that connect people to jobs and resources.”

“We have directed funding to neighborhoods that have suffered from chronic disinvestment to create jobs, provide mental health services, and more. We are on track to build, rehab, or preserve over 10,000 units of affordable housing,” he continued. ​“We don’t need the National Guard; we just need to invest in what works.”

In a statement, Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates acknowledged ​“the successful efforts of our mayor in reducing crime and investing in our community,” and similarly stressed that whatever Trump is ​“spending on his raids is better spent on building affordable housing, reopening school libraries, and funding social workers to support children through the trauma this administration is inflicting on an entire generation who are worried every day if they will ever see their parents again.”

“As a history teacher, I can tell you that history will not look kindly on Donald Trump or the individuals who are acting as his personal army,” Davis Gates also said. ​“For weeks, the people of Chicago have made it clear that we do not need federal agents in our city whether that is to separate immigrant families or racially profile in our Black neighborhoods.”

“Chicago might have been built to keep our communities divided, but we are coming together now, like working people do against any bad boss, in radical solidarity to keep each other safe,” the union leader added. ​“Donald Trump and his departments of alphabet boys and National Guard troops aren’t welcome and aren’t needed in Chicago.”

Congressional Democrats who represent Illinois have also denounced the president’s targeting of the country’s third-largest city — including Sen. Dick Durbin, who took to the chamber’s floor on Monday following the DHS announcement. Durbin accused Trump of attacking Chicago for ​“political theater.”

While the Trump administration hasn’t yet provided any update on the involvement of the National Guard, after the president moved to rename the U.S. Department of Defense, he took to his Truth Social platform on Saturday morning with an image referencing the 1979 film Apocalypse Now and said, ​“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

Appearing on CBS News’ ​“Face the Nation” on Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), said that ​“we don’t have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago,” but also that ​“the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal… This is not acceptable behavior.”

Responding to the recent developments in a Monday statement, Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the national advocacy group America’s Voice, said that ​“we have gone from a supposed war on immigrants to a war on Americans.”

“America’s Voice has long said that immigration was merely the ​‘tip of the spear’ for this administration to justify and lead an attack on all of us — including violating due process, constitutional rights and core democratic norms and pillars, such as deploying the military against American communities,” she noted. ​“Sadly, all are coming to pass.”

Cárdenas continued: ​“Why is the American president openly threatening an American city, as he readies the deployment of American troops against those residents? It’s not about immigration, just as the Washington, DC deployment wasn’t about crime. Instead, it’s for purposes of retribution; sowing fear and dissent; provoking violence and dividing us as a nation.”

“Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court just sided with the president and his plans to target indiscriminately and racially profile with impunity, effectively making racial profiling now the law of the land,” she added, citing a Monday decision. ​“Whether calling it ​‘authoritarianism’ or something else, it’s clear we are fighting not just for immigrants, but also for a different vision of America that’s now imperiled.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/itt-images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GettyImages-2233503222.jpg?mtime=1757439429,N,,2025-09-09 16:57:03.176984

Mohamod repeatedly denied Pence’s allegations, adding that care services billed to the State of Minnesota on his behalf were provided.","Cain Pence reached out to 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS, alleging that his taxpayer-funded provider wasn’t always helping with daily care assistance, and he was concerned if the state was being billed.

Pence relies on assistance from the Minnesota Department of Human Services’ Integrated Community Supports (ICS) program for daily care and housing needs.

The ICS program helps over 1,000 vulnerable Minnesotans daily through a variety of providers, according to the state. “I’m physically hurting, but I’m sharp mentally,” Pence said.

Last year, Pence alleged that his provider wasn’t giving him the full care that he was entitled to through the ICS program.

“I’d say, ‘Hey, I need help with these things.’ … ‘do it yourself,’” recalled Pence when he asked sometimes for help.

Pence said that he called the DHS tipline to file complaints against the provider.

Pence shared two copies of letters with 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS that he received from the Minnesota Department of Human Services’ Office of Inspector General in response to the complaints filed in October and May. In a letter dated May 27, the DHS Office of Inspector General’s Megan Kleineck wrote in part, “After carefully reviewing all the information you provided and gathering some additional information, your report was referred to the Program Integrity Oversight Division with the Department of Human Services for fraud review.”

In an Aug. 29 email to 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS, DHS wrote in part, “To protect the integrity of our investigations, we do not disclose active fraud investigations unless the DHS Commissioner determines it will not impede the investigation. We cannot confirm if there is an active investigation into American Home Health Care LLC.”

At the time, the state did confirm “…there are current open licensing complaints against this provider.”

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS reached out to the care company by email to get their side of the story and then went to the address listed for their Maple Grove offices.

Jama Mohamod, who oversees the provider mentioned in Pence’s allegations, agreed to speak with reporter Eric Chaloux.

“I’m just asking about the allegations he raised that there were services he wasn’t provided during the time he was there,” Chaloux questioned.

“He do that, he do that, that guy he complaining … all his life he’s been complaining,” Mohamod said.

Mohamod repeatedly denied Pence’s allegations, adding that care services billed to the State of Minnesota on his behalf were provided.

Since 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS first reached out to DHS, we found a corrective order in late August, which was the result of a state investigation.

DHS issued a correction order against American Home Maker Services, which operates under the state license of American Home Health Care LLC, alleging violations of licensing statutes at the complex where Pence used to live in Minnetonka.

The Aug. 27 correction order lists the number of a complaint report — that same number matches the report number found on the Office of Inspector General’s October letter to Pence.

DHS alleges a violation of Minnesota Statutes, saying, “… the license holder did not provide services as assigned in the support plan that complied with the requirements of this chapter and the federal waiver plans as required.”

The provider was given time to dispute the state’s allegations listed in the corrective order.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has learned Republicans on the Minnesota House committee who investigate allegations of fraud in state government say they’ve “flagged” the ICS program for a deeper look.

With reports from across the country of ICE indiscriminately arresting and detaining individuals and Border Czar Tom Homan’s warning of “more collateral arrests,” Governor Pritzker met with ICIRR and its member organizations to discuss their work to protect the Constitutional Rights of Illinois residents. To combat tactics that leave communities at risk of having their rights violated, the state supports Illinois’ strong network of community organizations that provide legal and services support.

“Many families who have lived in Illinois for years are fearful to pick up their kids from school, go to work, and live their lives freely,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “At such an uncertain moment for our immigrant communities, it is more important than ever that people know their rights and have someone looking out for them. We are fortunate to have a strong network of immigrant rights organizations working to keep our neighbors informed and protecting their rights. I commend the volunteers and staff on the front-line for leading this critical work.”

During his visit, Governor Pritzker toured BPNC offices, where he met and heard from the organization’s rapid response team, ICIRR’s Family Support Network hotline operators, and other staff providing citizenship and public benefits assistance. As the Trump Administration ramps up its presence in Chicago and surrounding communities, these resources are critical in ensuring that community members know their rights and have access to legal services, and that the actions of federal officials are monitored to identify unlawful tactics.

Following the tour, Governor Pritzker then joined a roundtable with leaders from ICIRR member organizations to hear directly about the impact of federal overreach on immigrant families, including some of the harrowing stories of families being ripped apart, U.S. citizens being detained, and other inhumane tactics being used by the Trump administration. During the roundtable, Governor Pritzker reiterated the state’s commitment to supporting the organizations that protect the Constitutional Rights of Illinois residents and encouraged community members to document enforcement activities and speak out.

He concluded the day with a visit to the National Museum of Mexican Art, lifting up Illinois’ rich Mexican immigrant community and their cultural contributions as the city prepares for the annual celebration of Mexican Independence Day that the Trump administration threatens to also disrupt.

While the Trump Administration continues to target and vilify immigrant communities, Governor Pritzker has worked alongside immigrant organizations and lawmakers to implement humane policies that support Illinoisans. ​

Immigrants are essential to Chicago’s economy, culture, and communities. In the Chicago metro area, an estimated 1.86 million immigrants make up 19% of the population, contributing $66.2 billion in annual spending power and $23.7 billion in taxes, according to FWD.US.

In May, the Supreme Court stepped in and stayed the NLRB and MSPB decisions pending litigation, allowing the removals to take effect.
Circuit determined it was bound by Humphrey’s Executor until the Supreme Court expressly overrules the 1935 precedent.
Overruling Humphrey’s Executor would be an unprecedented shift in the balance of power between the president and the administrative state.","Earlier this month, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled President Trump’s removal of Democrat commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was unlawful. In a 2-1 decision, the panel held that the case was squarely controlled by Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor. The D.C. Circuit decision upheld the district court’s ruling in July and sets the stage for the Supreme Court to determine whether to uphold or overrule long-standing precedent regarding removal protections for “independent” executive agencies.

On Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts granted the Trump administration’s request and stayed the D.C. Circuit’s decision pending further orders from Roberts or the Supreme Court, which effectively removes Rebecca Slaughter (again) from her role as an FTC commissioner. The stay order directs Slaughter to respond to the administration’s appeal by September 15. During her brief reinstatement, Slaughter dissented from several FTC actions.

Supreme Court Likely to Decide Scope of Administrative Agencies’ Independence

As we previously discussed, the Trump administration has fired individuals from administrative agencies that historically enjoyed protections against at-will removal, such as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). In all three cases, the lower courts had ruled those removals unlawful according to the governing statutes and Supreme Court precedent.

In May, the Supreme Court stepped in and stayed the NLRB and MSPB decisions pending litigation, allowing the removals to take effect. Then in July, the Supreme Court allowed the CSPC removals to take effect and cited to its interim order in the NLRB/MSPB decision, reiterating that “our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”

Humphrey’s Executor on the Chopping Block?

In the FTC case, the D.C. Circuit acknowledged the Supreme Court’s stay orders permitting those removals pending litigation but distinguished them from the FTC, as those cases “presented the never-before-decided question of whether Humphrey’s Executor should be extended to the statutes providing for-cause removal protection to those officials.” In contrast, Humphrey’s Executor specifically addressed and upheld the FTC’s removal protections. Thus, the D.C. Circuit determined it was bound by Humphrey’s Executor until the Supreme Court expressly overrules the 1935 precedent.

While the Supreme Court has so far avoided ruling on the agency removal cases on the merits, the FTC’s case is almost certain to force the justices to decide whether Humphrey’s Executor remains good law. Overruling Humphrey’s Executor would be an unprecedented shift in the balance of power between the president and the administrative state.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16153_4556.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:57:12.517550

… “For the foregoing reasons, dos Santos’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C.
… The respondents are further ordered to file a status report on or before August 18, 2025, confirming that dos Santos has been released from custody.” Dos Santos v. Noem, et al.","Where a habeas corpus petitioner has requested an order of immediate release from detention, that request should be granted because 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(2) does not mandate the detention of a noncitizen like the petitioner who has been released on bond pursuant to Section 1226, is in the midst of standard removal proceedings, and is otherwise subject to Section 1226(a)’s discretionary detention framework.

“Petitioner Adriano Maia dos Santos, a citizen of Brazil, has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §2241 seeking an order of immediate release from detention. In October 2017, dos Santos was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (‘CBP’) officers and placed in expedited removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. §1225(b)(1) after crossing into the United States between ports of entry. Dos Santos claimed a fear of returning to Brazil, which the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (‘USCIS’) found credible. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’) consequently filed a Notice to Appear in Immigration Court, thus terminating dos Santos’ expedited removal proceedings and commencing standard removal proceedings against him under 8 U.S.C. §1229a. In January 2018, pursuant to a stipulation between dos Santos and the Department of Homeland Security, an Immigration Judge ordered dos Santos released on bond after conducting a custody redetermination hearing under 8 U.S.C. §1226. For over seven years, dos Santos resided in the United States subject to that bond.

“On May 30, 2025, following a traffic stop, ICE officers arrested dos Santos pursuant to a warrant, ordered him detained under 8 U.S.C. §1226, and cancelled his bond. …

“Dos Santos’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus contends that he is not lawfully detained under Section 1225(b) and requests that the Court order his immediate release from detention. The government responds that although dos Santos is in removal proceedings and was arrested on a warrant citing Section 1226, he is, and has always been, subject to mandatory detention under Section 1225(b)(2). For the reasons articulated in Gomes v. Hyde, No. 25-cv-11571-JEK, 2025 WL 1869299 (D. Mass. July 7, 2025), the Court disagrees. The government’s argument contravenes the plain text of Section 1226(a) and would render superfluous Section 1226(c), which mandates the detention of certain noncitizens and is the sole exception to Section 1226(a)’s discretionary framework. Because dos Santos was arrested on a warrant and ordered detained under Section 1226, his detention continues to be governed by Section 1226(a)’s discretionary framework. The Court will, accordingly, grant his petition and order that he be immediately released from detention, subject to the Immigration Judge’s 2018 bond order. …

“The central question posed by dos Santos’ habeas petition is whether he is lawfully detained under Section 1225(b)(2), as the government now contends, or is instead subject to discretionary detention under Section 1226(a), as the government represented in its Notice of Custody Determination. …

“… Thus, the question is whether Section 1225(b)(2) mandates the detention of a noncitizen, like dos Santos, who has been released into the United States on bond pursuant to Section 1226, is in the midst of standard removal proceedings, and is otherwise subject to Section 1226(a)’s discretionary detention framework.

“For the reasons explained by this Court in Gomes v. Hyde, the answer to that question is no. …

“The government has not argued, much less presented any evidence to suggest, that ICE’s decision to unilaterally cancel the Immigration Judge’s 2018 bond order was justified by ‘a change of circumstance.’ … Rather than basing its decision on dos Santos’ own conduct and circumstances, ICE appears to have cancelled his bond for no reason other than the fact that it encountered him by chance while conducting a traffic stop. … The government has, accordingly, failed to carry its burden to show that a change in circumstances supported its decision to revoke the Immigration Judge’s 2018 bond order. … Unless and until ICE carries that burden at a hearing before an Immigration Judge, dos Santos must be released from custody subject to the 2018 bond order. …

“We’d love to go into Chicago,” Trump said in a speech touching on religious liberty and other topics.

Trump previously surged federal officers into major cities, including Chicago, in 2020 as part of the multi-agency Operation Legend.
“Over the first five weeks of Operation Legend in Chicago, murders dropped by 50% over the previous five weeks,” Barr said.","WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security kicked off a crackdown on illegal immigrants in Chicago Monday — after local Democrats spent the weekend protesting President Trump’s threat of a federal law enforcement surge in America’s third-largest city.

“DHS is launching Operation Midway Blitz in honor of Katie Abraham who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by criminal illegal alien Julio Cucul-Bol in Illinois,” the department announced on X.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew [Democratic] Governor [JB] Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The statement concluded: “President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem stand with the victims of illegal alien crime while Governor Pritzker stands with criminal illegal aliens.”

Later in the day, DHS took the unusual step of identifying 11 illegal immigrants believed to be in Chicago — tweeting out their photos, names and rap sheets — in an attempt to frame coverage of the mission.

The wanted list includes Pedro Gonzalez, 34, of Venezuela, described as a “Tren De Aragua gang member with a past criminal history of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, sexual assault, domestic battery, and kidnapping.”

“He was released multiple times despite ICE lodging a detainer,” the post says.

Abdul Al Kaby, 60, of Iraq was described as having “convictions for felonious assault, assault with a deadly weapon, and murder/intent to kill.”

“Al Kaby had an order for removal by an immigration judge in 1997 but was repeatedly released from Illinois jails despite ICE detainers,” DHS said.

ICE has been positioning staff to carry out operations in the Windy City for more than a week, leading sources to say that a crackdown was imminent.

“For years, Democrat politicians looked the other way while criminal illegal aliens terrorized American communities — even embracing ‘sanctuary’ policies to protect these sick criminals. No more,” said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson.

“The Trump Administration is committed to arresting and deporting these dangerous criminal illegal aliens and Operation Midway Blitz, honoring Katie Abraham who was killed by a criminal illegal alien, will make Illinois communities safer.”

The mission is separate from a possible federal law enforcement intervention against common street crime — and Trump has vacillated in public remarks about whether he will order a surge of agents to the City of Big Shoulders.

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, also a Democrat, reacted with outrage over the weekend at the president using a meme to tease the immigration raids.

The “Apocalypse Now”-themed image, titled “Chipocalypse Now,” depicted Trump as a military commander with helicopters, fires and the Chicago skyline looming in the background.

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning…’ Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” the Saturday social media post said, playing off Robert Duvall’s “I love the small of napalm in the morning” riff in Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War-set masterpiece.

Trump indicated Monday morning that the ICE raids do not portend a broader policing intervention.

“We’d love to go into Chicago,” Trump said in a speech touching on religious liberty and other topics. “We’re waiting for a call from Chicago.”

Trump did pressure city leaders, however, over the fact that six people were murdered over the weekend.

“This would mean that over the past number of weeks, approximately 50 people were killed, and hundreds were shot, many expected to die,” the president wrote on Truth Social.

“Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn’t want Federal Government HELP! WHY??? What is wrong with this guy, and the 5% in Polls Mayor. I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them. Only the Criminals will be hurt!”

Pritzker fired back: “‘I want to help people, not hurt them,’ says the guy who just threatened an American city with the Department of War.”

“The City of Chicago received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration,” Johnson said in a statement.

“We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.”

The ICE mission in Chicago follows Trump’s wholesale policing takeover in DC, where he federalized the local police force and deployed the National Guard Aug. 11 and federal agents four days earlier to crack down on violent crime and illegal immigrants.

Trump previously surged federal officers into major cities, including Chicago, in 2020 as part of the multi-agency Operation Legend.

Then-Attorney General Bill Barr said at a September 2020 press conference that the feds had arrested 500 people in five weeks and halved the murder rate in Chicago.

“Over the first five weeks of Operation Legend in Chicago, murders dropped by 50% over the previous five weeks,” Barr said. “August ultimately saw a 45% decrease in murders compared to July, and a 35% decrease compared to June.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/trump-chicago-immigrants-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-09 15:56:44.794556

Immigrant rights, labor, and community groups are condemning the operation as a “ruthless crackdown that resembled a military operation” and are calling for joint accountability from both the government and the corporations involved.

Migrant Equity Southeast (MESE) and its partner organizations, who are providing aid to the detained workers, held a press conference on September 8th in Savannah to strongly condemn the operation. The organization alleged that “ICE agents sealed off the site using military-grade weapons, helicopters, drones, and armored vehicles” and condemned the operation as a “military-style action targeting civilian workers, not a simple workplace check.”

According to MESE, the foreign workers who were arrested were put on buses, had their phones confiscated, and were pressured to sign documents without legal counsel.

MESE Executive Director Daniela Rodriguez stated, “All workers, regardless of their status, including pregnant women, were intimidated, and families were torn apart.” She added, “The people who are building our society’s future should not be treated this way.”

Scapegoating Workers

In statements, ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) confirmed that 475 people were detained on September 4 at Hyundai’s “Metaplant” construction site in Ellabell, Georgia. “A significant number of those detained are South Korean nationals who were either unlawfully present in the U.S. or working in violation of their visa status. This action followed months of investigation and was carried out under a court-issued warrant.”

The operation also involved the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Witnesses reported that agents used chains and zip ties to restrain workers, leaving many shocked and fearful.

One Korean worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Many of those arrested were unable to retrieve their phones. The worksite was shut down, offices were closed, and chaos spread as no one could communicate.”

Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition (KAC), pointed to the failure of the immigration system as the root cause of the incident. She emphasized that “highly specialized technicians” were needed to operate the plant, but that “visas were not issued on the required scale.”

According to HSI, most of the Koreans detained were dispatched engineers, subcontractor employees, or locally hired staff working at the construction site. They had entered the U.S. on short-term business visas (B1/B2) or under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), rather than formal work visas.

Only 85,000 H-1Bs are issued by the U.S. annually, with hundreds of thousands of applicants competing in a lottery system. This makes it difficult for foreign companies to secure visas for specialized staff. As a result, many firms have relied on business visas for short-term technical support or training, a practice long considered routine.

Park said, “Despite both corporations and government leaders understanding this reality, they are now making workers scapegoats as soon as a problem arises.”

Political, Economic Fallout

In a statement, President Trump stressed, “Foreign companies investing in America must respect our immigration laws,” also noting that the U.S. “needs foreign experts to help train American workers in advanced manufacturing.”

Trump added that he is open to streamlining legal pathways for skilled foreign professionals but insisted that “American jobs and security come first.”

But analysts warn the crackdown could have far-reaching consequences for Korean corporate operations and investments in the United States. In an environment of hardening anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S., the operation underscores that even companies from allied nations are not immune to politically charged enforcement.

Reports suggest that since the raid, workers at other sites—including Kia’s Georgia plant and Hyundai facilities in Alabama and Tennessee—have skipped shifts amid rumors of further ICE inspections, leading to production delays.

“Even those with legal status were treated like criminals,” said one community member.

Parents are particularly concerned about the safety of their children. “Some are debating whether to send kids to school, fearing they may face bullying or hate crimes after news spread that so many Koreans were arrested,” one attorney assisting families reported.

Calls for Solidarity

With a significant number of both Korean and Latino workers detained, there is a growing sense all communities are being impacted. “Injustice against one community is injustice against us all,” said Park, who called for “all communities to stand in solidarity so that no one faces this injustice alone.”

The legality and procedural integrity of the raid are also being questioned. Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, stated, “Individual rights must not be violated,” and noted that they are working to “determine to what extent the federal government and employers have violated the rights of the workers.”

Currently, MESE is providing emergency support to affected families and is preparing to offer legal assistance, including setting up legal clinics. The organizations are urging state and federal legislators to conduct a thorough investigation into the raid, hold corporations accountable for labor abuses, and establish legal protections to keep families together and ensure worker safety.

“If we stay silent, we are condoning injustice,” Park said. “We must act together to show that America protects both the rule of law and the dignity of people.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity near the George Eastman Museum early Tuesday was met with vocal opposition from activists and community leaders as roofers targeted by officers remained in a standoff.

Officers first stationed near Westminster Road and East Avenue, arresting one person who was completing work on a roof. Two other workers remained on the roof as a crowd of activists, attorneys, clergy, and community members gathered until 11 a.m. to protest the unfolding event.

“There’s two guys on the roof right now that are day workers,” said bystander Patrick Tobin. “I showed up, there (were) other workers here, and they took one guy who had a permit, he’s been working here for 25 years, he’s got a baby on the way, (and) never had any legal issues whatsoever.”

“There are a lot of people here who care very deeply about what’s happening in our country, and people are just not going to tolerate this,” said Monroe County Legislator Rachel Barnhart, who was in the crowd. “It just so happened that people were able to respond quickly to get here and to make it known that this is not acceptable in our communities.”

Organizations like Metro Justice and the Graduate Labor Union at the University of Rochester had notified the public of ongoing activity, alongside members from Spiritus Christi Church and First Unitarian Church. More than 200 people showed up in unified opposition to the ICE raid. Speakers with bullhorns provided words of support to those on the roof in Spanish, while attorneys sought to assist them in any way they could.

“Within an hour, several hundred people, including lawmakers and clergy, showed up to witness and protect our neighbors,” said Michi Wenderlich, Metro Justice campaign and policy coordinator, in a statement. “Rochester shows up to protect each other, and I’m proud of our community.”

With their vehicle tires slashed and a growing crowd surrounding officers and vehicles, ICE agents left the area without arresting those remaining on the roof. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

While many employees signed anonymously, about three dozen current FEMA staff members signed the declaration with their names.
Abby McIlraith, an emergency management specialist at FEMA, was among those who publicly signed the letter and was then placed on administrative leave.
The whistleblower complaint, released by the Government Accountability Project, argues that the FEMA dissent letter contains “multiple protected disclosures.” Placing the employees on administrative leave, the letter argues, violated whistleblower retaliation laws.","Employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency who signed a public dissent letter say the Department of Homeland Security violated whistleblower laws when placing them on administrative leave last week.

In a Sept. 2 letter, lawyers representing FEMA staff argue DHS’s actions amount to “illegal retaliatory personnel actions”. The letter is addressed to congressional committees, the Office of Special Counsel and the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“We ask you to open an investigation, if not already done, and, once completed, find that DHS has illegally retaliated against the FEMA whistleblowers and order immediate corrective action,” the letter states. “That action should include, but is not limited to, full reinstatement.”

More than 190 current and former FEMA employees signed the dissent letter, called the “Katrina Declaration,” in late August. It warns that changes at FEMA under the Trump administration, including personnel cuts, risk leaving the agency unprepared to deal with a major disaster.

While many employees signed anonymously, about three dozen current FEMA staff members signed the declaration with their names. FEMA placed those employees on administrative leave last week.

Abby McIlraith, an emergency management specialist at FEMA, was among those who publicly signed the letter and was then placed on administrative leave. She said those who were placed on leave want to get back to work as soon as possible, especially amid Atlantic hurricane season.

“We hope that they’ll respond, ideally be reinstating us immediately,” McIlraith told Federal News work. “But if they don’t, we’re prepared to keep fighting to return to work as soon as possible.”

DHS has come out strongly against the letter. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a statement released late last month, said the signers are “the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.”

McIlraith, who has been with FEMA less than a year, said she and her colleagues want to improve outcomes for disaster survivors.

“I personally was three years old when Hurricane Katrina made landfall, so it’s not like I’ve been presiding over decades of government inefficiency,” she said.

The whistleblower complaint, released by the Government Accountability Project, argues that the FEMA dissent letter contains “multiple protected disclosures.” Placing the employees on administrative leave, the letter argues, violated whistleblower retaliation laws.

Michael Fallings, managing partner at the law firm Tully Rinckey, said federal employees have the right to make protected disclosures, but agencies can argue that such disclosures are mere disagreements over policy.

“It’s not necessarily enough to say that FEMA was violating the law, but it is important to note that the employee just has to have a reasonable belief that the agency was violating the law,” Fallings said. “But that does take an analysis of the law being pointed to and the actions taken by the agency.”

The Office of Special Counsel can review such claims to determine whether there’s enough evidence to show that a prohibited personnel practice, such as whistleblower retaliation, occurred. OSC can then choose to move forward by mediating the case or even filing a legal request for a stay before the Merit System Protections Board.

“The Office Special Counsel does have many, many complaints that it has received since the new administration, so the speed in which they conduct investigation has been slower, but given that this has received national news, that’s probably something they’ll focus on trying to complete,” Fallings said.

Employees can also go directly to the MSPB with whistleblower complaints if OSC decides not to pick up the case or takes more than 120 days to make a decision.

Kevin Owen, a partner at Gilbert Employment Law, often represents federal employees in whistleblower cases brought to OSC and the MSPB.

Owen said he typically tries to assess a client’s motivation and whether they have evidence to back up their claims.

“Once we get that, that’s when you can start telling that this is something that has traction,” Owen said. “The one thing that usually leads me to believe that my clients have a compelling whistleblower disclosure is when management immediately puts them all on admin leave, because if it was frivolous, they would ignore it, or they would go through some sort of administrative disciplinary process that would be appropriate to handle those sorts of issues. Handling it this way leads me to think there’s smoke and fire.”

Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency has fired some employees for signing a dissent letter earlier this summer. Other EPA employees have been suspended for two weeks without pay.

An EPA spokesperson said the letter “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business.”

“The Environmental Protection Agency has a zero-tolerance policy for career officials using their agency position and title to unlawfully undermine, sabotage and undercut the will of the American public that was clearly expressed at the ballot box last November,” the spokesperson said.

But Owen said protected disclosures can be made public, so long as the information contained within them is not prohibited by law from being released.

“If there’s a statute that says you can’t share this information, then releasing it publicly is problematic,” Owen said. “Absent that, then it is a protected disclosure.”

McIlraith said she has been alarmed by the firings of the EPA signers, but does not regret signing the Katrina Declaration. “I stand by everything in the letter,” she added.

Blasting so-called sanctuary laws in Chicago and Illinois, the latest effort targets people without legal permission to live in the U.S. who have criminal records. Like other Trump administration plans, it was stamped with a splashy name, “Operation Midway Blitz,” and circulated on social media with the mugshots of 11 foreign-born men it said should be deported.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor (JB) Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” said a statement from DHS.

Pritzker, who has been locked in a back-and-forth with Trump for days, criticized the move. He and Mayor Brandon Johnson have defended the state and city’s extensive sanctuary laws which bar coordination between local police and immigration agents. They’ve accused the Trump administration of using scare tactics, particularly with Latino residents in the nation’s third-largest city.

“Once again, this isn’t about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination — yet we’ve experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,” Pritzker said in a statement. “Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump administration’s focused on scaring Illinoisians.”

Chicago has been bracing for an influx of immigration agents and possibly the National Guard for two weeks. Numerous protests have cropped up downtown, outside a suburban military base DHS plans to use and at an immigration processing center that’s expected to be a hub of activity.

Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C., where he has direct legal control. For the federal intervention in Los Angeles, a judge deemed the National Guard deployment illegal, but the Trump administration got a victory related to immigration enforcement there when the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a restraining order barring agents there from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, rejected the latest operation announced in Chicago.

“These actions don’t make us safer,” he said in a statement. “They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction.”

It remained unclear what role Monday’s announced program would play in a Chicago surge.

Adding to the confusion was a handful of immigration arrests over the weekend in Chicago, which galvanized the city’s vocal activist network and worries that it was the start of something bigger.

“This is about terrorizing our communities,” said Chicago City Council member Jeylú Gutiérrez said. “But we will not be intimidated.”

She and immigrant rights activists said that five people arrested were “beloved community members.” Some were on their way to work when arrested Sunday. Another works as a flower vendor.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed four arrests but gave sparse information, noting criminal histories with previous arrests and one conviction for driving under the influence.

“ICE has always operated in Chicago,” the agency said in a statement. “We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners.”

DHS said the operation announced Monday would be in honor of Katie Abraham, one of two Illinois women killed in a January fatal car crash. A grand jury indicted a 29-year-old man in the hit-and-run. The Guatemalan national also faces federal false identification crimes.

Under the agreement, El Salvador was paid $4.76 million to house 300 immigrants accused of being part of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) at its CECOT high-security prison, as long as certain conditions were met, including not assisting asylum seekers.

The document was released by Democracy Forward, one of the groups suing the U.S. Department of State, alongside Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, for the use of the AEA to speedily deport alleged illegal immigrants earlier this year.

Newsweek reached out to the U.S. Department of State and Homeland Security, and El Salvador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment via contact form and email on Tuesday.

Why It Matters

The Trump administration's use of the AEA to quickly deport alleged TdA members was challenged in court in March, with plaintiffs arguing that immigrants were being denied their right to due process – or a full court hearing – before being removed from the U.S. The use of El Salvador's CECOT prison was denounced by human rights groups and Democrats in Congress for its reputation as a place where prisoners were tortured and never released.

What To Know

Democracy Forward and RFK Human Rights said they secured the release of the agreement following efforts by the federal government to keep it out of public view.

The document, from the Ministry of Foreign Relations in El Salvador, showed that initially the deportees would be held for up to a year at CECOT, unless another decision was made on their detention.

Under the $4.76 million agreement, El Salvador had to agree to only use the funds for the holding of the alleged gang members, and not to give any of it to a third party. It specifically stated that money should not make its way into the hands of those linked to criminal activities.

The document, dated March 22, 2025, said the agreement had been reached on March 14, the day before two flights carrying U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees left the U.S. for El Salvador, despite a court hearing being underway at the time which resulted in a ruling seeking to halt the flights.

Among those on board was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man the administration later admitted had been deported because of an administrative error, and several Venezuelan nationals who had not had their day in immigration court.

On March 22, the Department of State paid El Salvador the money agreed, while legal challenges around the deportations were continuing in U.S. courts.

The White House insisted that those who were sent to CECOT were known gang members and violent criminals, and insisted that the U.S. did not have the power to bring them back.

Later, under an agreement between the U.S., El Salvador, and Venezuela, the U.S. deportees held at the prison were released back to Venezuela.

What People Are Saying

Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward, in a press release: ""While the American people should not be required to go to court to secure this information, we are pleased that our litigation led to this important information being released.

""The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses. The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.""

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, in a post on X in February: ""We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee. The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.""

Dive Brief:

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled 6-3 to stay a temporary restraining order that had prohibited federal agents from stopping people in Los Angeles County based on their apparent race or ethnicity, their speaking Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence in a particular location such as a car wash, bus stop or day laborer pickup site.

The decision sets a temporary precedent as the case proceeds in federal district court as scheduled for Sept. 24. Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law attorney and retired professor at Cornell Law School, said a final decision is not likely until June 2026 at the earliest. “That’s a long time for mayors to have to deal with this issue in the meantime,” he said.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the ruling, saying the result is that “the White House and masked federal agents can racially profile Angelenos with no due process, snatch them off the street with no evidence or warrant, and take them away with no explanation. This decision will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect — not persecute — our people.”

Dive Insight:

Los Angeles County, Los Angeles city and seven other cities within the county on July 2 filed a motion to intervene in a federal class action lawsuit alleging federal agents were engaging in “unconstitutional and unlawful immigration raids by targeting Angelenos based on their perceived race and ethnicity and also denying detainees constitutionally mandated due process.”

On July 11, a federal judge in Los Angeles issued a temporary restraining order that barred federal immigration agents from stopping suspected undocumented immigrants based on those factors. The Trump administration in August asked the Supreme Court for an immediate administrative stay on the order, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer stating those factors “can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.”

Noting that about 10% of people in the Los Angeles region, or about 2 million people, are estimated to be in the United States illegally, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in granting the stay that immigration stops “based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence have been an important component of U.S. Immigration enforcement for decades.”

While Kavanaugh said “apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” it can be considered “a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the Fourth Amendment prohibits seizing individuals based on the factors, which “in no way reflect the kind of individualized inquiry the Fourth Amendment demands.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on X called the decision “a win for the safety and security of the American people and the rule of law” and said that federal immigration officials “will continue our operations in LA to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens that pose a danger to public safety.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/D96p9kXpX4EAKJDqsdxiRI2Spn_BxGe_ZHZ0mSl0X-A/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjM0MzY5MDkzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-09 13:57:26.750564

The law applies to law enforcement unless an officer has secured a judge's order granting them access to the information.","The Department of Homeland Security stressed in a Tuesday memo that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does not target or raid schools.

The big picture: But DHS guidance on sensitive spaces updated in January to greenlight arrests in schools and churches has contributed to a culture of concern in America's classrooms and school communities.

Driving the news: The DHS chided news stories about children and families being fearful about returning to school under President Trump's immigration crackdown, saying, ""U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) does NOT raid or target schools.""

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release ICE would not go into schools to arrest children and that officers would require secondary supervisor approval before taking action in a school, a scenario the memo said would likely be ""extremely rare.""

She said ""criminals"" will ""no longer be able to hide in America's schools to avoid arrest.

""The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.""

Flashback: In an interview with ABC's Martha Raddatz shortly after DHS removed prior guidance to avoid so-called sensitive areas, border czar Tom Homan was asked what criminals would be hiding in schools. He replied, ""How many MS-13 members are the age 14 to 17? Many of them.""

He continued, ""If it's a national security threat, public safety threat and ... what you need to understand is that it's case by case, name another agency, another law enforcement agency, that has those type of requirements, that they can't walk into a school or doctor's office or a medical campus.""

The White House told NBC News in January that the policy change was not a directive to go into schools.

State of play: But many school districts, boards and administrators, faced with an information bedlam, rushed earlier this year to spell out their policies on interacting with immigration enforcement.

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, schools can't share information about students without parent permission, Axios' Jessica Boehm reports. The law applies to law enforcement unless an officer has secured a judge's order granting them access to the information.

The bottom line: Even if ICE activity on campus is rare, families and school-aged children have been affected by the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

According to the American Immigration Council, more than 5 million U.S. citizen children have at least one undocumented family member.

And research suggests immigration sweeps can contribute to student absenteeism and disrupt classroom life, even when there are no boots on school grounds.

The Trump administration has moved to punish nonprofits and faith-based groups that engage in sanctuary practices like accompaniment, alleging that they promote and facilitate immigration law violations.
Many citizens developed political consciousness during this period and dedicated themselves to sanctuary practices like accompaniment — practices that continue to this day, often led by faith-based organizations.
They must continue to put up a fight, as sanctuary practices represent an essential part of the struggle for migrant rights and indeed all human rights.
Of course, getting migrants to participate in sanctuary practices becomes difficult in a climate of heightened fear amid stepped-up deportations.","On June 17, 2025, New York City comptroller Brad Lander, at that time a mayoral candidate, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Lander was engaged in the process of immigrant accompaniment, which is when humanitarian supporters accompany immigrants to their court proceedings. Their presence can throw sand in the system’s gears and slow down deportations. Donald Trump’s second administration is criminalizing this practice precisely because they know it works.

In researching my book The Politics of Sanctuary, I spent years during Trump’s first term observing activists who practice immigrant accompaniment, trying to understand its mechanics and effectiveness. “We can stop or slow down the deportation process,” said one volunteer with the New Sanctuary Coalition (NSC), an organization dedicated to assisting migrants and asylum seekers. The Trump administration has moved to punish nonprofits and faith-based groups that engage in sanctuary practices like accompaniment, alleging that they promote and facilitate immigration law violations.

“The judges know us, ICE knows us. They fear us,” the NSC volunteer continued. “They have blocked us [from accompaniments], but we will keep going. We show up to doctors’ appointments, to family court, to lawyers’ appointments, [and] to Varick Street,” where New York City’s immigration court is located.

The volunteer was not bluffing about the effectiveness of the accompaniment strategy. I observed numerous cases where NSC volunteers accompanying immigrants slowed down the deportation process. The volunteers I observed were mostly native-born, white, female New Yorkers, ranging from middle-aged to senior citizens. Their presence was critical for the success of migrants’ cases. At times they were a silent presence at ICE check-ins and case hearings, while at other times they were vocal in their advocacy. “We are literally standing at that line and making sure that we hold that line and enforce rights,” one volunteer told me.

During Trump’s first term, migrant advocates sought to counter the administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric with evidence that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans. These efforts did not completely reverse public opinion, which carried Trump to a second victory on an even more anti-immigrant platform in 2024. However, activism during the first Trump term did bring citizens and noncitizens together at demonstrations and protests, strengthening the movement for migrant rights. Many citizens developed political consciousness during this period and dedicated themselves to sanctuary practices like accompaniment — practices that continue to this day, often led by faith-based organizations.

These citizen activists didn’t just sympathize with immigrants but felt they had a duty to defend them. This sense of responsibility led many to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan to support migrants attending ICE appointments. Living near immigrant neighborhoods, having immigrant friends, and believing that New York City’s institutions could be pushed to protect migrants all contributed to their support. The immigrants involved in these networks, meanwhile, saw themselves not as criminals but as tentative residents whose rights were being violated — a perspective that grew stronger through their participation in sanctuary practices. Their own activism challenged the idea that migrants are simply victims of an exploitative economic system.

Cities as Battlegrounds for Citizenship

Sanctuary practices in cities create space for undocumented people, asylum seekers, and refugees to engage in political struggle. But they can’t do it alone: their effectiveness depends on building alliances with citizens and permanent residents who join these struggles with practices like accompaniment and acts of civil disobedience. It is precisely this solidarity that the Trump administration is seeking to criminalize.

Nor can migrants claim rights without the dedicated assistance of sympathetic political leaders. Many of them lack the right to vote; the New York Court of Appeals ruled six to one in March 2025 that the state constitution requires citizenship for voting. Systematically barred from the formal representational political process, they must rely instead on voluntary action from political figures — actions like Lander’s arrest as a mayoral candidate during an accompaniment action.

Trump has made outright threats to defund sanctuary cities (though only small percentages of budgets would actually be affected). He has also threatened to expand the criminalization of immigrants, which city administrations have resisted by refusing police cooperation with ICE. These words have turned into violent acts against protesters and political representatives seen as obstructing ICE enforcement.

Trump’s threats against grassroots sanctuary efforts serve to heighten racial hostilities, scapegoat immigrants, manufacture emergencies, and instill fear in immigrants to keep them from using social and health services. Meanwhile, urban disinvestment and austerity programs are creating a false sense of scarcity for which immigrants are held responsible. Amid urban inequality, blaming immigrants can mask the lack of real solutions for urban problems like affordable housing, high-functioning social services, accessible transit, and so on.

Trump’s executive orders earlier this year intensified threats to sanctuary jurisdictions by calling to cut federal funding, penalize the granting of public benefits, and target local officials for prosecution. Federal courts largely blocked these measures as unconstitutional, and cities continue to fight the policy in court. They must continue to put up a fight, as sanctuary practices represent an essential part of the struggle for migrant rights and indeed all human rights.

The sanctuary movement offers migrants more than simply hope that they won’t be deported. It provides concrete assistance toward the goal of avoiding deportation. Of course, getting migrants to participate in sanctuary practices becomes difficult in a climate of heightened fear amid stepped-up deportations. This makes the participation of native-born activists all the more necessary to create conditions of safety and solidarity. Only when migrants and nonmigrants stand together can they thwart Trump’s anti-migrant agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09104051/GettyImages-2221177518-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 12:58:18.208256

Later that month, about 18 people from Berger’s West Berkeley neighborhood met in her home for a know-your-rights workshop.
Following a recommendation from the task force, the Berkeley City Council is expected to consider an ordinance Tuesday night that would codify city sanctuary protections into law.","Ellen Moore, a social worker at Oakland’s La Clinica de la Raza, has been distributing red “know-your-rights” cards to immigrants in the East Bay since the start of President Trump’s first term in 2016. But what’s occurred in recent months, she said, calls for something greater.

“Both Trump administrations, but particularly this administration, have been so cruel and targeted immigrants in such an inhumane and aggressive way that I can’t help but see how this is affecting our community, my friends, neighbors, and co-workers,” said Moore, who lives in Berkeley. “It made me realize that I need to do more.”

Nine months into President Donald Trump’s second term, concerned Berkeley residents like Moore have been stepping up to meet the increasing demand for advocacy and support for migrant residents. Heightened threats of deportation and reduced access for immigrants to public health and safety net programs have led to the formation of neighborhood groups, frequent street protests, and calls for stronger sanctuary protections.

California, which is home to about 2 million undocumented immigrants, has borne the brunt of the Trump administration’s crackdown in the last several months, along with other states with large immigrant populations such as Texas and Florida. Communities in Los Angeles have experienced ICE raids at workplaces in which people were tackled to the ground and detained by masked federal agents. Similar enforcement tactics haven’t been seen in the Bay Area to the same extent. But the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted migrants at courthouses in San Francisco and Concord, arresting dozens. In early August, Berkeley was among 18 “sanctuary jurisdictions” — a group of cities that also included Oakland, Emeryville, Richmond, El Cerrito and Albany — targeted by the Trump administration for not doing enough to enforce federal immigration laws.

Monica Marini became involved with Berkeley’s La Peña Cultural Center when it was founded in the 1970s as a gathering place for Chileans who fled their country following a military coup. She’d immigrated to the U.S. from Argentina and became involved in advocacy from the start. She has lived in Berkeley for more than 50 years.

Now 84, she continues to advocate for the immigrant community through La Peña. She attends know-your-rights workshops and “court watch,” a training that teaches people to observe and document due process violations in court and bring transparency and accountability to legal immigration procedures. She attended the Concord Immigration Court several times this year as an observer.

“I am an immigrant too,” she said. “I wanted to go and see what happens there. I have the idea that I would protect them. If ICE is present, I will have to do something.”

Berkeley residents adopt East Bay day labor work sites

Maryann O’Sullivan, 72, has lived in Berkeley for nearly a decade. A retired lawyer, she’s continued to work as a volunteer for progressive causes in the East Bay.

She joined the grassroots group Indivisible East Bay after attending one of the organization’s monthly meetings with a friend at a Berkeley park. Soon after, O’Sullivan began volunteering as a “peacekeeper,” or safety monitor, at local protests and demonstrations.

She also joined Indivisible’s rapid response team, which led to her involvement with the “adopt a corner” campaign, a project of the National Day Laborers Organizing Network (NDLON), where volunteers work two-hour shifts keeping a lookout for ICE at locations where day laborers routinely gather in the morning to pick up jobs. In the event of a raid or other enforcement activity, they are there to act as observers, record video, and collect information such as officer badge numbers. They can also serve as mediators to connect families with missing people and legal aid if raids occur. O’Sullivan has mostly volunteered at sites in Oakland.

“You think, ‘Why are they out there? They look like sitting ducks.’ And then you realize that they have to work for themselves and their families,” she said.

O’Sullivan said NDLON and Indivisible provided training to her and other campaign volunteers, which included education on the potential risks of joining these actions, such as being arrested themselves. Before retirement, when she had her law license, O’Sullivan was more cautious with her activism. But things are different now, she said.

“I don’t want to go to jail, but I also feel like what’s happening now is so beyond anything I ever expected,” O’Sullivan said. “If standing up for what I think is right requires that I get arrested now, then I’m willing to take that risk.”

Neighbors organize ‘know-your-rights’ workshops and trainings

Moore said she started becoming interested in human rights as an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley in the late ‘70s. Around the same time, she learned about La Peña Cultural Center, where she now volunteers as a member of the Old Guard, a group of longtime advocates. This year, she and other members formed the Friends of La Peña Immigrants’ Rights Group to build community and a support network among immigrants and allies.

The trainings and workshops they help organize at the center are facilitated by local lawyers and community advocates, who teach volunteers about their constitutional rights (particularly the Fourth and Fifth amendments, which protect against illegal searches and guarantee due process) and how to assert them in public settings when confronted with law enforcement.

Community members who volunteer to observe cases and hearings in immigration courts are taught what to look for and document. They cannot interfere with work conducted by ICE, but they can be a resource to connect people with legal representation.

“Our role as court observers is very different than the role of somebody in the street protesting,” Moore said. “We have to observe the rules of the court. We are there to support immigrants who are applying for legal status, to make sure that their rights are not violated and that they’re not illegally detained in the courtroom without due process.”

This type of advocacy takes significant time out of the day, Moore said, making it difficult for people with full-time jobs to become involved. As such, many volunteers are older. Some have experience working in social justice; they might come from a religious background; or “they just care about human rights, want to be in solidarity with newcomers, and want to hold our country accountable,” she said.

Activist Amanda Berger jokingly calls it the “geriatric resistance movement.” She said many retired people in Berkeley, like herself, are interested in social justice.

Berger, who moved to Berkeley in 2001 from New York City, has long been involved with progressive and philanthropic organizations, working in literacy and re-entry support programs in California prisons, and canvassing to increase voter turnout.

As an active member of Bay Resistance, a grass-roots social justice organization, she recently became part of a Berkeley neighborhood “pod” where members communicate over secure group chats and participate in local actions each month. Berger has joined protests against the reopening of a federal women’s correctional facility in Dublin, which the Trump administration has floated turning into an immigration detention center.

“When Trump was elected, I started feeling a lot of urgency around immigration issues,” she said.

In January, Berger’s neighbor across the street sent out a group text checking in on people in the neighborhood. Anxious feelings were soon channeled into organizing.

Later that month, about 18 people from Berger’s West Berkeley neighborhood met in her home for a know-your-rights workshop. At a subsequent meeting, about 35 people attended. The growing collection of volunteers created a WhatsApp group to remain in touch and report on any incidents.

Berger said her neighbors — who include people on visas, mixed-status households, and immigrant students — were “super freaked out” following the inauguration. But she thinks the neighborhood has become more organized since the reelection.

“Should something happen, like Trump takes the National Guard to Oakland or there’s an ICE raid in the neighborhood, I feel like we have 65 people who I know will be responsive,” she said.

Meanwhile, city of Berkeley officials are also preparing for the Trump administration to escalate attacks on local immigrant communities, and pulling in grassroots groups. Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii reaffirmed Berkeley as a sanctuary city in January, reconvening a sanctuary task force with representatives from a variety of local immigration, faith, legal, and education stakeholders, including La Peña, Oasis Legal Services, Berkeley Unified School District and Berkeley City College.

Following a recommendation from the task force, the Berkeley City Council is expected to consider an ordinance Tuesday night that would codify city sanctuary protections into law. This would prohibit city workers from disclosing personal information to immigration enforcement and create new procedures to report collaborations with these federal agencies, according to the proposed ordinance.

“I am outraged and I am disturbed to see the country that I grew up in and believed in, throw due process out the window,” Moore said.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a 6-3 decision on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the rulings of two lower courts in Vazquez Perdomo v. Noem, allowing federal immigration agencies to continue using enforcement practices that critics call unconstitutional and racially discriminatory.

The ruling followed protests in Los Angeles earlier this year against the Trump administration’s mass deportation program led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A press release from the ACLU of Southern California detailed the decision’s impact on immigrant communities and their support networks.

The lawsuit, brought by workers, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security unlawfully arrested and detained people to meet deportation quotas. Plaintiffs said agents targeted individuals “solely on four factors… including apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or English with an accent; presence in a particular location like a bus stop, car wash, or agricultural site; or the type of work a person does.”

Pedro Vazquez Perdomo, the lead plaintiff, said, “When ICE grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why. I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

Teresa Romero, president of UFW, called the decision dangerous. “Today’s SCOTUS ruling puts farm workers — and every Californian who looks or sounds like they might be an immigrant — in great danger. This does not impact immigrants in a vacuum, it will affect all of us,” she said. “We will continue to seek a preliminary injunction in this case, and we will keep fighting.”

Alvaro M. Huerta of Immigrant Defenders Law Center said, “Sadly, today’s decision effectively greenlights racial profiling while the case plays out in the lower courts.”

Mark Rosenbaum of Public Counsel added, “Today’s decision gives license to the Trump administration to resume racially discriminatory raids across Los Angeles, detaining people without evidence or due process simply because of the color of their skin, the language they speak, or the work they do.”

Armando Gudino, executive director of the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, called it a constitutional setback. “The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of racial profiling. A dark shadow had been cast over this country’s Constitution and its future,” he said. “The decision legitimizes the unconstitutional practice of targeting individuals based on their race, language or neighborhood.”

Annie Lai, director of the Immigrant and Racial Justice Solidarity Clinic at UC Irvine School of Law, said the ruling undermined the Fourth Amendment but praised her clients’ resilience. “Our clients have faced the government with incredible bravery and will continue to do so. We will be right alongside them,” she said.

Chandra Bhatnagar of the ACLU Foundation of Southern California compared the government’s tactics to other forms of targeted discrimination. He said the raids were “another physical manifestation of the Trump administration’s attempt to treat people as second-class citizens due to who they are, what they look like, and who they love.”

Despite the ruling, immigrant rights leaders expressed determination to keep fighting. Angelica Salas, executive director of CHIRLA, said, “The administration’s war on immigrants is going to fail. Very soon, we’ll be back in court continuing to fight against these obviously illegal policies. We will continue to watch, document, and protest peacefully what we see is lawless, mass roundups and a federal policy of cruelty and detention.”

Huerta echoed that sentiment, saying, “Despite the Supreme Court’s disheartening decision to greenlight ICE’s unlawful terror tactics, our commitment to Southern California’s immigrant communities is unwavering.”

Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, emphasized community action. “Angelenos are not waiting to be saved by courts or politicians. Only the people will protect the people. Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo,” he said.

They must continue to put up a fight, as sanctuary practices represent an essential part of the struggle for migrant rights and indeed all human rights.
Of course, getting migrants to participate in sanctuary practices becomes difficult in a climate of heightened fear amid stepped-up deportations.","On June 17, 2025, New York City comptroller Brad Lander, at that time a mayoral candidate, was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Lander was engaged in the process of immigrant accompaniment, which is when humanitarian supporters accompany immigrants to their court proceedings. Their presence can throw sand in the system’s gears and slow down deportations. Donald Trump’s second administration is criminalizing this practice precisely because they know it works.

In researching my book The Politics of Sanctuary, I spent years during Trump’s first term observing activists who practice immigrant accompaniment, trying to understand its mechanics and effectiveness. “We can stop or slow down the deportation process,” said one volunteer with the New Sanctuary Coalition (NSC), an organization dedicated to assisting migrants and asylum seekers. The Trump administration has moved to punish nonprofits and faith-based groups that engage in sanctuary practices like accompaniment, alleging that they promote and facilitate immigration law violations.

“The judges know us, ICE knows us. They fear us,” the NSC volunteer continued. “They have blocked us [from accompaniments], but we will keep going. We show up to doctors’ appointments, to family court, to lawyers’ appointments, [and] to Varick Street,” where New York City’s immigration court is located.

The volunteer was not bluffing about the effectiveness of the accompaniment strategy. I observed numerous cases where NSC volunteers accompanying immigrants slowed down the deportation process. The volunteers I observed were mostly native-born, white, female New Yorkers, ranging from middle-aged to senior citizens. Their presence was critical for the success of migrants’ cases. At times they were a silent presence at ICE check-ins and case hearings, while at other times they were vocal in their advocacy. “We are literally standing at that line and making sure that we hold that line and enforce rights,” one volunteer told me.

During Trump’s first term, migrant advocates sought to counter the administration’s anti-immigrant rhetoric with evidence that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans. These efforts did not completely reverse public opinion, which carried Trump to a second victory on an even more anti-immigrant platform in 2024. However, activism during the first Trump term did bring citizens and noncitizens together at demonstrations and protests, strengthening the movement for migrant rights. Many citizens developed political consciousness during this period and dedicated themselves to sanctuary practices like accompaniment — practices that continue to this day, often led by faith-based organizations.

These citizen activists didn’t just sympathize with immigrants but felt they had a duty to defend them. This sense of responsibility led many to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan to support migrants attending ICE appointments. Living near immigrant neighborhoods, having immigrant friends, and believing that New York City’s institutions could be pushed to protect migrants all contributed to their support. The immigrants involved in these networks, meanwhile, saw themselves not as criminals but as tentative residents whose rights were being violated — a perspective that grew stronger through their participation in sanctuary practices. Their own activism challenged the idea that migrants are simply victims of an exploitative economic system.

Cities as Battlegrounds for Citizenship

Sanctuary practices in cities create space for undocumented people, asylum seekers, and refugees to engage in political struggle. But they can’t do it alone: their effectiveness depends on building alliances with citizens and permanent residents who join these struggles with practices like accompaniment and acts of civil disobedience. It is precisely this solidarity that the Trump administration is seeking to criminalize.

Nor can migrants claim rights without the dedicated assistance of sympathetic political leaders. Many of them lack the right to vote; the New York Court of Appeals ruled six to one in March 2025 that the state constitution requires citizenship for voting. Systematically barred from the formal representational political process, they must rely instead on voluntary action from political figures — actions like Lander’s arrest as a mayoral candidate during an accompaniment action.

Trump has made outright threats to defund sanctuary cities (though only small percentages of budgets would actually be affected). He has also threatened to expand the criminalization of immigrants, which city administrations have resisted by refusing police cooperation with ICE. These words have turned into violent acts against protesters and political representatives seen as obstructing ICE enforcement.

Trump’s threats against grassroots sanctuary efforts serve to heighten racial hostilities, scapegoat immigrants, manufacture emergencies, and instill fear in immigrants to keep them from using social and health services. Meanwhile, urban disinvestment and austerity programs are creating a false sense of scarcity for which immigrants are held responsible. Amid urban inequality, blaming immigrants can mask the lack of real solutions for urban problems like affordable housing, high-functioning social services, accessible transit, and so on.

Trump’s executive orders earlier this year intensified threats to sanctuary jurisdictions by calling to cut federal funding, penalize the granting of public benefits, and target local officials for prosecution. Federal courts largely blocked these measures as unconstitutional, and cities continue to fight the policy in court. They must continue to put up a fight, as sanctuary practices represent an essential part of the struggle for migrant rights and indeed all human rights.

The sanctuary movement offers migrants more than simply hope that they won’t be deported. It provides concrete assistance toward the goal of avoiding deportation. Of course, getting migrants to participate in sanctuary practices becomes difficult in a climate of heightened fear amid stepped-up deportations. This makes the participation of native-born activists all the more necessary to create conditions of safety and solidarity. Only when migrants and nonmigrants stand together can they thwart Trump’s anti-migrant agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09104051/GettyImages-2221177518-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 11:57:51.897648

For the Chicago Police Department, the challenge is acute. The force must preserve public safety in a city already under strain while avoiding the appearance of working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities, a stance that could erode community trust and ignite new protests.

The same balancing act has confronted other big-city departments in recent months. Local police in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., were drawn into fraught arrangements with federal agencies that experts say left residents wary and, at times, undermined public confidence in their police.

Now, Chicago finds itself on the same path, with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker objecting to any National Guard deployment and city officials bracing for how the added federal presence could reshape the dynamic on the ground. The outcome, policing experts warn, may determine whether Chicago police can maintain credibility in immigrant communities likely to be targeted by a president determined to show force.

“What the Trump administration is doing here is engaging in federal policing in a way that really rips at the seams of the relationships between state and local police and the federal government, between communities and law enforcement,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council. “Those kinds of standoffs and contentious practices is what erodes public safety.”

Sanctuary City Conflicts

Over the course of the Trump administration’s immigration surges, Chicago officials repeatedly reaffirmed the city’s so-called sanctuary policies that have been place for four decades. But as fear grew about looming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions, the city’s mayor has avoided detail about how local police will navigate tensions on the ground.

Chicago’s policies bar local law enforcement from asking about or detaining someone for their immigration status or from supporting ICE, including by securing perimeters for raids, transporting detainees or sharing information about undocumented immigrants.

Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order last week declaring city police would not collaborate with federal immigration agents. It also requires Chicago officers to wear uniforms and not wear masks to “clearly distinguish them from federal agents.”

“We will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” Johnson said before signing the order.

Craig Futterman, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said any cooperation between ICE and local officers hurts public trust and blurs the lines between agencies.

“It can get really messy,” Futterman said. “There’s how sanctuary cities are supposed to work on paper vs. what happens in practice.”

Caught Between Protesters and ICE Officials

Gupta said Chicago police will have to coordinate with federal agencies to some degree, even to respond to protests against immigration raids and detentions.

In the meantime, city officials say they’re following a similar strategy to policing as the one in place around the 2024 Democratic National Convention, which cost the city about $27 million in officer overtime.

ICE detained at least 10 Chicagoans at an immigration office on June 4, drawing dozens of protesters and local elected officials to the street outside. Police didn’t originally know it was an immigration action and left after realizing that, officials said.

Some protesters and local elected officials claimed they saw Chicago officers clearing the way for ICE agents and protecting their vehicles. Chicago City Council members demanded an internal probe into officers’ behavior.

Similar tensions played out in California, where hundreds of protesters clashed with federal immigration authorities in June, prompting Trump to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, despite the objections of local authorities.

Los Angeles police made hundreds of arrests and dispersed demonstrations, including at locations where ICE agents were conducting raids.

Sanctuary city policies “don’t mean a local police officer will stand in between an ICE officer and a non-citizen,” which would be considered an obstruction of justice, said Rose Cuison-Villazor, a professor at Rutgers University Law School.

But whether local officers step in if they disagree with federal agents’ interactions with protesters is also uncertain.

“Do they have the power to intervene?“ Futterman asked. ”These are really difficult legal questions. It’s a really fraught situation.”

Local Police, National Guard Interactions Not Clearly Defined

Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Washington D.C.-based think tank the Police Executive Research Forum, said local police leaders are used to working with federal authorities including joint task forces aimed at terrorism, drugs or organized crime. But if the National Guard is deployed in Chicago, its role in performing local policing hasn’t been clearly defined.

On Thursday, the District of Columbia sued to stop President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard during his law enforcement intervention there.

“As far as the National Guard as police, they have traditionally assisted in natural disasters, large scale disturbances and aiding law enforcement in support functions like traffic and crowd control,“ Wexler said. ”I don’t recall the National Guard being deployed to deal directly with day-to-day crime issues.”

Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling has asked for more communication from federal authorities so “we don’t have people running scared and it doesn’t create chaos on our streets.”

In Philadelphia, District Attorney Larry Krasner says the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard is a threat to successful prosecutions of crime, risking witness statements being thrown out and evidence suppressed.

“None of these people are trained in evidence gathering procedures,“ Krasner said. ”None of them are trained in Miranda warnings. None of them are trained in Fourth Amendment rights and procedures and illegal searches and seizures.”

Kenneth Corey, a former department chief with the New York City Police Department, warned that surging resources like the National Guard leads to an artificial and often temporary reduction in crime.

“Any time you surge resources like that you are going to see an immediate reduction in crime because it has a deterrent effect,” said Corey, who now works at the University of Chicago Crime Lab’s Policing Leadership Academy.

“But the problem is it’s short-lived. It can’t be sustained. When they leave, crime returns. You haven’t addressed the root causes of crime.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-09 14:57:14.583359

The officer said he and other law enforcement intentionally took firefighters to a remote location for officer “safety,” according to meeting attendees.","New details are emerging about the events leading to the arrests of two firefighters by federal officers last month at a wildfire on the Olympic Peninsula.

In an interview with The Seattle Times, Tom Clemo, who was the leader of the fire response at the time of the arrests, said they stemmed from an investigation of alleged time-card fraud by private crews working the fire.

Clemo and seven other people interviewed for this story who had direct knowledge of the incident, as well as information garnered from videos, photos and a virtual meeting invite for a debrief on the action, shed light on what preceded the arrests, and those who were involved.

Clemo has sought to distance himself and his team from the arrests.

“My primary concern is the safety of firefighters,” he said last week, “not immigration status.”

The Aug. 27 incident on the Bear Gulch fire reverberated around the country as President Donald Trump’s administration ramps up immigration enforcement actions. Fifty members of Congress demanded answers about the arrests.

The firefighters are being detained at the Northwest Immigration and Customs Enforcement Processing Center in Tacoma.

Clemo said his team’s finance staff discovered the alleged discrepancies between hours worked and hours submitted among several contract crews. His team reported them to the federal law enforcement officer assigned to the team, Clemo said. The officer’s position is to manage security on large fire responses.

A Department of the Interior spokesperson said on Monday the security manager on the fire at the time was a “uniformed ranger” with the Bureau of Land Management.

The spokesperson said fire response leadership asked the security manager to look into “potentially significant timecard fraud” on the part of two contract fire crews.

The agency said the BLM ranger found the two crews “had individuals working under visas,” and asked U.S. Border Patrol to verify visas.

Incident management teams are often made up of federal, state and local fire officials who have signed up to lead fire responses outside their day jobs, dispatching to fires across a region or the country.

When asked how the time-card investigation was related to the immigration-related arrests, Clemo said it was all in the hands of federal law enforcement.

The arrests did not follow a Biden-era Department of Homeland Security policy, which limits immigration enforcement where disaster and emergency response and relief is being provided. Under the first Trump administration, a similar policy was in place during the Northern California wildfires.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment about its policy of enforcing immigration law at locations where disaster and emergency response is being provided.

The fire crews

Private fire crews play a critical role in the nation’s wildfire response.

The two contract crews that were questioned were Arden Solutions and Table Rock. They are 20-person crews.

The U.S. Forest Service has awarded agreements with more than 800 Type 2 private hand crews, like Table Rock, in 2025. These firefighters dig fire lines, clear brush and snuff out hot spots.

There are roughly 40 national Type 2 Initial Attack crews, like Arden Solutions, under contract with the Forest Service. They are considered to be the elite firefighters of the private industry, and can be called upon when a fire breaks out to be the first layer of defense.

The DHS claimed the two men arrested were not firefighters. Wildfire veterans have emphatically rejected the notion, with some noting that anyone dispatched to an active fire needs to have an Incident Qualification Card, commonly referred to as a red card, which certifies the person can complete firefighting duties.

About 75% of hand crew companies are based in the Pacific Northwest, according to the executive director of the National Wildfire Suppression Association, which represents 365 member companies in 29 states. The private industry also provides other resources, including medical units, heavy equipment, tree fallers, water handling and specialty equipment.

The industry relies on a strong immigrant workforce, firefighters say. In Oregon, forestry companies requested more than 3,000 H-2B visas for temporary foreign workers this fiscal year. Not all forestry companies fight wildfires, though some have transitioned to do so during the fire season.

These crews typically document their hours worked on paper sheets called a “Crew Time Report,” get them signed off by their division or task force leader and submit them to the finance section of the fire’s incident command every day. The finance team typically flags any issues or discrepancies for the team to correct.

Before leaving any fire, the finance team will review time cards for firefighters and make sure everything looks accurate — including identifying information, hours and equipment.

Time-card investigation

In a morning briefing days before the arrests, Scot Roeber, who was supervising one area of the fire, said he encouraged firefighters, which included Arden Solutions, to complete their time cards to reflect the terms in their contracts.

That’s not an uncommon request on fires. He said Arden was not singled out.

Arden updated their time cards that morning, according to a firefighter who requested not to be named for fear of retaliation.

Firefighters and other fire personnel say such discrepancies pop up, and they are almost always corrected on-site.

Clemo, the incident commander, said the crews as a whole, not individual firefighters, were being investigated.

Clemo said he requested the questioning related to time-card fraud allegations not be done at fire camp due to safety concerns, and law enforcement obliged.

He said he was told the firefighters would be questioned about the allegations at the remote location where federal agents met the crews. He said there was no mention of immigration enforcement.

Day of the arrests

The crews got to their assigned firefighting location for the day around 8:30 a.m. An hour later, federal officers pulled up.

Table Rock Crew Boss David Diaz said upon arriving federal officers stated the reason they were brought there was because of allegations of time-card fraud.

Diaz said a BLM officer told crew leaders that the officer had been watching the firefighters since they got on the fire, taking timestamps for their meal breaks, showers and time sleeping, and that he was reporting it to the finance team.

Federal law enforcement then lined up firefighters to check their IDs.

Some firefighters who were cleared after their IDs were checked stayed in line in solidarity with those who were waiting. They said law enforcement threatened to arrest those who wouldn’t get back in their trucks.

“You can either cooperate with us or we throw you in handcuffs and put you in the back of the vehicle,” an officer appears to say to firefighters in a video shared with The Seattle Times.

Clemo said it was only after the incident that he found out Border Patrol was there and the arrests had happened.

“I was lied to,” Diaz said. “I brought the crew out there to do an assignment that never happened.”

Before leaving the fire, Diaz said he was escorted by two officers to finance and his team’s time cards were corrected and resubmitted.

Crew members over several days had logged an extra half-hour for the time they were waiting for their bosses to finish up getting a morning briefing. Crew members often use that time to prepare lunches and gear before they head out. Diaz said only crew bosses can log time for the morning briefing.

Debrief

In a meeting later that day, held in person and on a video call, a BLM officer gave a synopsis of the operation, according to several attendees interviewed by The Seattle Times.

There was no elaboration, attendees say, on whether those engaged in the alleged fraud were found or if the time cards were corrected.

The officer said he and other law enforcement intentionally took firefighters to a remote location for officer “safety,” according to meeting attendees.

He said the operation needed Border Patrol agents to confirm work status, according to attendees. He said that operation resulted in two people being detained by Border Patrol.

According to one attendee, the officer’s report was upbeat until others in the meeting shared that a Seattle Times reporter had photos of the arrests.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09082025_tzr_tzr_174852.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-09-09 14:56:49.179433

The big picture: The launch of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" follows weeks of threats from President Trump to tackle crime in Chicago and other Democrat-run cities by expanding ICE's presence and possibly deploying National Guard troops as part of his agenda against undocumented immigrants despite opposition from Democratic leaders.

Despite Trump's threats, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) have doubled down on the state and city's sanctuary city policies, which provide protections to undocumented people by barring local police from assisting federal law enforcement activity without a criminal warrant.

Driving the news: The Department of Homeland Security said on X it was launching the blitz ""in honor of Katie Abraham,"" a 20-year-old Illinois woman whom police say was killed along with a friend in a suspected drunken-driving, hit-and-run crash in Urbana in January.

The suspect charged is a 29-year-old man from Guatemala, whom authorities say is an undocumented immigrant.

""This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,"" the DHS X post said.

The DHS did not outline details of the operation, such as how long it will run for, and representatives for the agency, the White House and ICE did not immediately respond to Axios' requests for comment on the matter.

What they're saying: Pritzker said on X the crackdown was not about fighting crime.

""That requires support and coordination — yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,"" he said. ""Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians.""

Johnson said on X the city of Chicago ""received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration.""

He added: ""We remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.""

Meanwhile, Johnson wrote in a New York Times op-ed Monday that sending in the National Guard would be ""the wrong solution"" to a real problem.

""If President Trump had listened to the city's leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,"" he said.

""While the causes of crime and violence are complex, it is clear that poverty plays a central role.""

Zoom out: The Trump administration has repeatedly targeted sanctuary cities since the president signed an executive order in April directing federal agencies to document those that were not complying with his hardline immigration agenda.

Washington, D.C. — The terms of a previously secret grant agreement between the United States and El Salvador facilitating the Trump-Vance administration’s practice of disappearing people indefinitely from U.S. territory into El Salvador’s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) prison without due process, legal justification, or public accountability have, for the first time, been made available as part of an ongoing lawsuit. The suit, which is pending in federal court in the District of Columbia, is Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights et al. v. U.S. Department of State et al. Plaintiffs, represented by Democracy Forward and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights (who represent themselves), secured the release of the document after filing a motion challenging the federal government’s broad claim that it should remain out of public view.

“This disclosure shows, yet again, that litigation is playing a critical role in securing some measure of transparency from the U.S. government. After the Trump-Vance administration insisted that the terms of its arrangement with El Salvador to facilitate the disappearance of people from U.S. territory be kept secret and out of public view, our team secured the release of this information so the American people can know what their government has done,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “While the American people should not be required to go to court to secure this information, we are pleased that our litigation led to this important information being released. The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses. The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

The public disclosure of this document and its terms marks a significant victory in the ongoing lawsuit. The Trump-Vance administration sought to invoke broad protections from public disclosure over the information, but ultimately backed off after the parties had fully briefed the plaintiffs’ motion for the court to compel the public release of the information.

This first-of-its-kind lawsuit challenges the legality and constitutionality of the agreement between the Trump-Vance administration and the government of El Salvador. During the ongoing litigation, the administration produced correspondence between the U.S. Department of State and El Salvador that outlines key terms of a financial arrangement by which the U.S. paid El Salvador to detain individuals who had been in U.S. territory.

According to the newly released correspondence, El Salvador agreed to detain people rendered from the U.S. before President Trump signed a proclamation purporting to invoke the Alien Enemies Act and to remove individuals from U.S. territory. On March 22, 2025, after the administration ignored a federal court order and removed more than 200 individuals to El Salvador without proper process, the U.S. Department of State provided El Salvador with $4.76 million.

The correspondence indicates that, as a condition of the funds, the U.S. required El Salvador to agree, among other things, to refrain from assisting asylum seekers in obtaining resources and counsel or using the funds to provide reproductive health care. Notably, the grant agreement does not have any provisions requiring that El Salvador refrain from torturing, detaining people in indefinite confinement, or avoiding other abusive practices inside CECOT.

Plaintiffs in the suit are Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Immigration Equality, and the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice.

Much has been written about building a southern border wall to stop immigration. But while the fight over black paint, bricks, and steel has dominated headlines, another wall—larger, quieter, and potentially far more damaging—is already rising. This one is invisible. It’s made of visa denials, delays, and mounting barriers that keep students, workers, tourists, and families from reaching the U.S.

Unlike a wall in Texas or Arizona, this new wall stretches across the globe. And it threatens to isolate America in ways we can ill afford.

Consider the numbers. In fiscal year 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered over 2 million people at the southern border. By contrast, the State Department issued almost 11 million temporary visas and hundreds of thousands of green cards during the same time. Many of those people need a visa to enter the U.S. But foreigners are facing a combination of expanded interview requirements, longer wait times, social media vetting, and higher costs to come to the U.S.

Starting this month, the State Department is sharply limiting waivers of visa interviews. Until now, many people did not have to have a visa interview, especially if they were renewing their visa. Although requiring a visa interview sounds innocuous, it will supercharge already crushing wait times.

U.S. consulates are grappling with reduced staffing and increased workload, leading to systemic bottlenecks. For example, it currently takes 11 months to get a tourist visa at the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The next available tourist visa appointment in Abu Dhabi is in 18 months. And visa wait times in India can exceed a year. For employers who need to hire quickly, this is a deal-breaker.

The hurdles don’t stop there. The State Department is reviewing more than 55 million people who have U.S. visas for any violations that might lead to deportation. That will result in more visa delays, denials, and revocations. Indeed, the department has stated that it has revoked more than twice as many visas since the end of January as during the same time period the previous year.

The State Department has also expanded social media vetting of all international student visa applicants to see if they have “hostile attitudes” toward the U.S. The predictable result: a projected 30 to 40 percent plunge in new international student arrivals this fall. That’s a loss not just for universities—it means $7 billion less in revenue for the U.S. and 60,000 jobs wiped out.

Congress has piled on by recently adding a $250 “visa integrity” fee on top of the $185 visa application cost, making U.S. visas among the most expensive in the world. The U.S. Travel Association projects that the integrity fee could cost the U.S. economy $11 billion over three years, including $9.4 billion in lost visitor spending and $1.3 billion in lost tax revenue. That comes on top of a pilot program imposing visa bonds as high as $15,000 for visitors from some countries with high overstay rates.

Meanwhile, a sweeping travel ban now restricts or blocks nationals from 19 countries. In 2022 nearly 300,000 people from those countries arrived in the U.S. According to a report by the American Immigration Council, those new arrivals made significant contributions to the U.S. economy. In 2023 alone, households led by those recent arrivals “earned $3.2 billion in income, paid $715.6 million in combined federal, state and local taxes, and held $2.5 billion in spending power.”

Media reports suggest that the administration is weighing imposing restrictions on 36 additional countries. That hasn’t happened yet, but if it does, expanding the bans would choke off even more economic activity.

The damage is already showing. According to one report, U.S. consulates issued 16 percent fewer temporary visas and 20 percent fewer green cards in May 2025 than in May 2024. Over 300,000 fewer overseas visitors came to the U.S. during the first seven months of 2025 compared with the same time period in 2024. The World Travel and Tourism Council projects that international visitor spending in the U.S. will plunge 22 percent this year—a staggering $12.5 billion loss. Among 184 countries studied, the U.S. is the only one expected to see a decline.

The administration defends these measures as necessary for national security. But treating every visitor as a threat keeps out not just terrorists. It keeps out talent. It keeps out paying students. It keeps out families who want to reunite. And it keeps out the millions of ordinary travelers whose spending supports American jobs from Miami to Seattle.

America has prospered for centuries not by walling itself off but by attracting people who bring energy, ideas, and investment. If we continue down this path of suspicion and obstruction, we risk turning the U.S. into a country that fewer and fewer people want to visit, let alone build a future in.

We don’t need another border wall, visible or invisible. We need a visa system that keeps America open, competitive, and connected to the world. Right now we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.",https://compote.slate.com/images/b5039e1b-8448-42c9-a951-e8e059d071e2.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-09-09 12:58:00.598009

LA community urges Chicago to confront ICE 'head-on' The enforcement raids in Chicago come after the Trump administration targeted the Democrat-led cities of Los Angeles and Washington.","CHICAGO – President Donald Trump's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" is hitting a fever pitch as local leaders claim immigrants are wrongfully being snatched off the street by federal agents looking to root out violent criminals.

The White House vehemently argues that the Chicago operation is aimed at targeting undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, but local community members say it's causing fear among law-abiding neighbors. At least four people have been arrested, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

""These abductions were seemingly random, with agents profiling and approaching community members on the street,"" Rey Wences of the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights said at a news conference. ""What we're experiencing today is not normal. People going out in the street and being snatched from their family members is not normal.""

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids began Sunday, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump has said federal agents are targeting ""the worst of the worst"" criminals. The four people arrested have been charged with crimes, an agency spokesperson said in an official statement.

Some Chicagoans say local workers and business owners are being targeted instead of criminals.

""It’s never been about arresting the worst of the worst,"" Alderwoman Jeylú Gutiérrez, the City Council representative for Chicago’s 14th Ward, said at Monday’s news conference. Gutiérrez is an immigrant from Mexico. ""It’s about terrorizing our communities. But we will not be intimidated.""

The Chicago arrests come as the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration in ruling that federal authorities can resume for now the indiscriminate immigration-related stops in Los Angeles that sparked protests and accusations of racial profiling.

In addition to being Democratic strongholds, Chicago and Illinois have long been destinations for immigrants. About a third of the city’s population is Hispanic, according to U.S. Census Data.

Local politicians have responded by protecting immigrants from federal law enforcement. Illinois enacted sanctuary state laws in 2017. Chicago has had sanctuary protection in place since 1985.

Immigrant rights groups are urging Chicagoans to report sightings of federal agents to a hotline. Advocates say they will respond to the reported sightings in person, distribute information on what rights people have when confronted by immigration agents, and record the detainments if advocates arrive in time.

Hundreds of Homeland Security officials are expected to operate from a naval base outside Chicago.

What to know about the ICE raids

Charges against the four people arrested in Chicago Sept. 7 include aggravated sexual assault of a child, domestic battery and armed robbery.

Immigration officials did not immediately respond to questions about where the four men were charged. USA TODAY is not naming them, because it was unclear whether they been convicted on the criminal charges shared by Homeland Security.

In an official statement, an agency spokesperson said ""ICE has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city, which protects them over law-abiding citizens. Since January 20, ICE has arrested some of the worst of the worst illegal aliens in Chicago − gang members, murderers, child rapists, drug traffickers − that roam the community and wreak havoc on neighbors. We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city.""

Latino neighborhoods shutter ahead of raids

Chicago’s Southwest Side has long been a haven for Mexican immigrants. Locals say people living in the area have responded to the raids by taking precautions when leaving for work or by simply not showing up.

""We’ve already seen a huge decrease in people going outside,"" said Any Huamani, a member of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council on the Southwest Side. ""No vendors are outside, people are scared, people are afraid.""

Huamani said people knowing what rights they have when confronted by immigration agents, including the right to ignore questions about immigration status or open a door to agents who lack a warrant, is essential.

""This is what stops agents from trying to kidnap us,"" she said.

Huamani also serves on a team that responds in person to calls to the immigrant rights coalition’s hotline. About 30 such rapid-response teams have been set up around the state in response to the raids, immigration advocates said at the news conference.

LA community urges Chicago to confront ICE 'head-on'

The enforcement raids in Chicago come after the Trump administration targeted the Democrat-led cities of Los Angeles and Washington.

Angeleno immigration advocates told USA TODAY they have already begun sharing information with Chicago advocates on how to handle the raids.

""One of the ways we believe fighting back is important is to not cower when troops are deployed and when ICE raids start to increase,"" said Marisol Marquez, an activist with Centro CSO, an LA immigrant rights group. ""We think that confronting it head-on is the best source of courage for people and resilience.""

Having teams of people ready to respond to immigration agent sightings is a key first step to ensuring people feel safe walking their neighborhoods, Marquez said.

She also said it’s important for communities to continue living their normal lives as much as possible, including proceeding with public events.

""We can’t be shy. We can’t show that we accept the patrolling of the National Guard to terrorize our community,"" Marquez said. ""We want to let our neighbors know not to be discouraged, our community is united, and we will continue to be united.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/USAT/86046316007-chicago-trump-ice-02.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-09 10:58:38.514254

So when we talked, uh, you said we assembled, um, that's, that, that's, uh, uh, uh, *** little different than what happened.
That day we had approximately 40 teams spread across, uh, Los Angeles, uh, whether it was the inner city or some of the communities in and around Los Angeles.
And I think more important is the fact that that roving patrol did apprehend, uh, uh, targets.
We just had two assaults on federal officers yesterday here in Los Angeles, just in Los Angeles.","Joining us now is the US Border Patrol sector Chief Gregory Bovino. Chief Avino, thank you so much for making time for us today. Well thank you it's good to be here. Earlier this summer, uh, Chief Pavino, we saw you standing on the steps of the state Capitol after you had just carried out *** raid at *** Home Depot in South Sacramento. You noted you're not going anywhere. I understand *** lot of your work is down there in Southern California, but how are you deciding which communities you go into? Sure, uh, our, the, the communities that we go into and our law enforcement actions like the one you saw in Sacramento, are based on what we call targeted enforcement. Uh, we have predetermined or predefined targets. That we look to uh create *** law enforcement function to to go to, to go after. So that's what we did in Sacramento, uh, that, that, that particular operation, there were some individuals that we were after and we did end up apprehending several individuals that were aggravated felons and some folks that you would not want walking the streets of your community with impunity. Could we expect to see more operations like those up here in Northern California? I know we mainly saw just the one. I understand there are smaller operations, but could we see something like that again? Yes, ma'am. It's, it's very possible. We go where the threat takes us, and Los Angeles, as you know, is rife with illegal immigration and some pretty bad, some pretty bad actors down here in Los Angeles, but we go where that threat is, and if we see *** threat in Sacramento or San Francisco or anywhere else that, that we think we need to go, then, then, then we'll certainly go there and do that. Something we've heard from our local law enforcement up here in Northern California is that California's sanctuary state law, also known as Senate Bill 54, that has tied their hands from working with you there at Border Patrol and with immigration officials overall. I mean, is that accurate in your eyes? Is there *** way you all could work together under the law right now? Sure, well, yeah, they're exactly right. Uh, SB 54 does tie their hands. You know, I started law enforcement in California back in 1996 when there wasn't an SB 54, and the cooperation between state and local law enforcement and immigration officers, whether it was Border Patrol or ICE. It was fantastic and we didn't have the immigration problem that we see now. But with SB 54 and sanctuary cities, sanctuary states and things like that, it creates an atmosphere of lawlessness, especially with immigration, and that's why we're in the communities now, because it's us and us alone. That that prosecute those immigration laws. If we had that, that, that buy-in and that help from the state and locals like we used to, I think you would, you would see *** lot of the communities would be *** lot safer and then you might not see border patrol as much in *** place like Sacramento. But right now when you have child rapists standing in front of Big box stores or aggravated felons that have spent years and years in prison or individuals that may have *** significant criminal record in *** foreign country when those folks are in the community and nothing can be done about it, that's why you're going to see us in those communities and when I said we're not going anywhere, that's what I'm talking about. The mission's not. Accomplished until those individuals are taken off the streets and as you know as we go after those individuals, anyone else that is an illegal alien is subject to arrest. Are there any local jurisdictions that you think are handling this properly or doing *** lot? Therefore, you are not in those communities that you could share? Uh, uh, again, we'll go where that threat is. I think there are some, some jurisdictions that, uh, that do the best job that they can. Again, that they are restricted from, from working with immigration officers, uh, with, with *** few exceptions. However, there are some jurisdictions that, uh, that we know do *** fantastic job, you know, whether it's Sheriff Youngblood. Uh, down in Bakersfield, Sheriff Bianco and, and, and some of the sheriffs do *** fantastic job in keeping their community safe. I can't say enough about the fact they, they do communicate and would love to work with us if they could. So we're we're, we, we'll work with anyone that we can, any state or local agency, anywhere, anytime, any place. Switching gears to an operation. *** group of Southern California Democrats in Congress are demanding answers from you and other high ranking officials in the Trump administration after you and several agents assembled outside of Governor Gavin Newsom's recent press conference in LA. He was launching *** push by Democrats to try to redistrict here in California to send more Democrats to the US House of Representatives. Chief, why were you there outside of that press conference? So when we talked, uh, you said we assembled, um, that's, that, that's, uh, uh, uh, *** little different than what happened. That's called *** roving patrol function, something that we do every day in Los Angeles. That day we had approximately 40 teams spread across, uh, Los Angeles, uh, whether it was the inner city or some of the communities in and around Los Angeles. So there were over. 40 law enforcement teams, several 100 law enforcement officers. You just happen to see us and me there, but I think what's important is that roving patrol function was within about *** block of our ICE facility, *** facility that we that we work out of every day. So, uh, you know, I'm, I'm glad that Governor Newsom and anyone else was in, in our territory. which is, is, is what that was, um, within just *** few steps of, of *** location that we work out of every day. And I think more important is the fact that that roving patrol did apprehend, uh, uh, targets. One of those targets was *** train de Aragua member Train Day Aragua, as you know, is the Venezuelangan. that terrorizes Ma and Pa America, that individual was within about 2 blocks of the location that you just talked about. That individual was taken off the streets. So I think that, uh, we accomplished the mission that day and we're going to continue to be in that area and all areas of Los Angeles, anywhere, anytime, uh, that the threat dictates that we're there. Governor Gavin Newsom and other California leaders have been pointing specifically to your operations as *** key reason for why people should show up to the polls this November to approve that democratic redistricting effort to allow again more Democrats to go to the US House of Representatives. I mean, what's your response to that, chief? Yeah, as far as the politics, I'm gonna, I'm going to stay out of the politics. I'm definitely apolitical, but what I will say is anyone that chooses illegal aliens over American citizens, that chooses criminals, that chooses Train dearagua walking our streets, whether it's Los Angeles. Or your fine city of Sacramento, uh, I, you know, I've got *** problem with that, and, um, I, I, I, I think that that's probably *** message that uh people don't want to hear, uh, uh, whether it's paying an illegal alien $300 to stay. In the United States and possibly continue to commit crimes or supporting criminality in general. So if that's *** message that anyone wants to send, whether it's the governor or anyone else, then you know, I can't imagine anyone that would be in support of something like that. I think that the citizens of California, the citizens of America, are ready for law and order when you have several million. Individuals pour across that border over *** 4 year period. Several million, many of whom have significant criminal histories. Uh, something has to be done about that because those individuals go on to prey on the citizens in our great country, you know, I'm talking about that just this morning. We apprehended our 5,000th apprehension here in Los Angeles since I've been here. That's just over the past couple of months, our 5000. And guess what that 5,000th was? That individual spent approximately 164 months in prison, was an aggravated felon. That was our 5,000th apprehension today. Um, so do we want people like that walking the streets of Sacramento or Los Angeles or Bakersfield or San Francisco? Uh, think about that and what damage that individual or other individuals or the thousands of other individuals nationwide could do to our communities, our families, our children, that's the way I look at it. And as long as those individuals are walking the streets. I'm going to be here taking them off the streets. The US Border Patrol, the green team, will be on the streets, whether it's Sacramento or anywhere else. We're going to be on the streets taking them off the streets because that's why we're here and we're not going anywhere. I keep saying we're not going anywhere. The more of those that we apprehend, the harder we go. Understood, Chief Avino, before I let you go, my last one here, there's still this proposal moving through our state capital that would prohibit all officers, and it attempts to include those officers at the federal level from covering their faces. This was filed in response to some of your operations. I mean, what's your response to the existence of this proposal and, and why are your officers covering their faces? Sure, you know, that, that it reminds me *** lot of SB 54, um, supporting criminality over the protection of our American citizens and our communities. Uh, they can pass those state laws, but again, we're federal officers that, uh, Title 10. Uh, privilege privileges and immunities, um, would exempt us obviously from something like that. So they can pass all the laws that would be more, um, you know, wishful thinking, I think, than an actual law. We're going to protect our agents, you know, many, uh, politicians, many individuals are calling for, take MS-13, for instance, to take positions up against law enforcement, specifically immigration officers, and that type of Rhetoric. That type of damaging rhetoric is why we have *** 1,000% increase in assaults on federal officers, 1,000% increase. We just had two assaults on federal officers yesterday here in Los Angeles, just in Los Angeles. So while that's being, while that's being done, and it puts our agents in danger, whether they're being docked or followed or, or, or whatever. I'm gonna protect those agents and face coverings make sense. And the protection of our agents. So, you know, as long as that rhetoric's out there, um, I'm gonna make sure those agents are protected, and that's one method for protecting our agents. So, you know, uh, scale down that rhetoric and cooperate so we can get the, the violent criminals and the bad people and bad things off the streets, and then you might not have us there in the first place. All right, Chief Gregory Bovino, thank you so much for your time. Thank you very much.

About two months after border patrol agents raided a Home Depot parking lot in South Sacramento, federal officials have confirmed more immigration raids like that are likely in Northern California. ""Yes ma'am, it's very possible,"" U.S. Border Patrol's El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino said in response when KCRA 3's Ashley Zavala asked him about the possibility on a recent episode of California Politics 360. Bovino has been coordinating and leading raids, mostly seen in the Los Angeles area ""We go where the threat takes us,"" Bovino said. ""If we see a threat in Sacramento or San Francisco or anywhere else that we think we need to go, then we'll certainly go and do that."" Bovino pointed to California's sanctuary state law as the driving force behind the immigration raids he has been leading. Bovino said his operations target violent criminals and acknowledged non-violent people are getting detained if they are violating federal immigration law and are swept up in the operations. He said before California passed its sanctuary state law, known as SB 54 in 2017, the cooperation between state, local and federal law enforcement on immigration was ""fantastic."" SB 54 limits local law enforcement's ability to work with federal immigration officers when an immigrant has been accused of a crime. ICE, for example, has placed hundreds of detainer requests across agencies in Northern California. A handful have been fulfilled. ""It creates an atmosphere of lawlessness and that's why we're in the communities now, because it's us and us alone,"" Bovino said. ""If you had that buy-in from state and locals like we used to, I think communities would be a lot safer and then you might not see border patrol as much in a place like Sacramento."" ""They are profiling,"" U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, D-California, told California Politics 360. Padilla called the raids unlawful and noted federal agents are arresting people based on their skin color and what language they speak. ""That's not enforcing the law, that's violating the law,"" Padilla said. Democratic leaders in California have been citing Bovino's work and the Trump administration's immigration raids as a top reason why voters this November should approve new Congressional Districts in California that are meant to boost Democratic representation in the U.S. House of Representatives halfway through President Donald Trump's term. ""I'm going to stay out of the politics because I'm apolitical,"" Bovino said. ""But I will say, anyone that chooses illegal aliens over American citizens, that chooses criminals, that chooses Tren de Aragua walking our streets, whether it's Los Angeles or your fine city of Sacramento, then I've got a problem with that."" ""I think that's probably a message that people don't want to hear,"" Bovino added. ""As long as those individuals are walking the streets, I'm going to be here taking them off the streets.""

He said before California passed its sanctuary state law, known as SB 54 in 2017, the cooperation between state, local and federal law enforcement on immigration was ""fantastic.""

SB 54 limits local law enforcement's ability to work with federal immigration officers when an immigrant has been accused of a crime. ICE, for example, has placed hundreds of detainer requests across agencies in Northern California. A handful have been fulfilled.

""It creates an atmosphere of lawlessness and that's why we're in the communities now, because it's us and us alone,"" Bovino said. ""If you had that buy-in from state and locals like we used to, I think communities would be a lot safer and then you might not see border patrol as much in a place like Sacramento.""

""They are profiling,"" U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, D-California, told California Politics 360. Padilla called the raids unlawful and noted federal agents are arresting people based on their skin color and what language they speak.

""That's not enforcing the law, that's violating the law,"" Padilla said.

Democratic leaders in California have been citing Bovino's work and the Trump administration's immigration raids as a top reason why voters this November should approve new Congressional Districts in California that are meant to boost Democratic representation in the U.S. House of Representatives halfway through President Donald Trump's term.

""I'm going to stay out of the politics because I'm apolitical,"" Bovino said. ""But I will say, anyone that chooses illegal aliens over American citizens, that chooses criminals, that chooses Tren de Aragua walking our streets, whether it's Los Angeles or your fine city of Sacramento, then I've got a problem with that.""

""I think that's probably a message that people don't want to hear,"" Bovino added. ""As long as those individuals are walking the streets, I'm going to be here taking them off the streets.""

The case is one of many lawsuits challenging the White House’s efforts to supersede Congress’ spending authority by canceling funding without lawmakers’ explicit approval.

This particular case became more complicated in late August when the Trump administration sent Congress a rescission request, asking lawmakers to cancel billions in foreign aid, including some of the funding subject to this lawsuit.

This “pocket rescission,” as it’s sometimes called, came within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year. Under the Trump administration’s interpretation of the law, they believe that allows them to cancel the funding even if Congress refuses to go along with the proposal.

The move is considered illegal by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and evoked ire from senior lawmakers, including Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine.

“Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse,” Collins wrote in a statement. “Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”

Administration sees executive branch ‘at war with itself’

The appeal to the Supreme Court filed Monday urges the justices to let the legislative and executive branches figure out the spending dispute on their own and criticizes a federal district court for ordering the Trump administration to spend the money.

“The injunction requires the Executive Branch to rush to obligate the same $4 billion that the President has just proposed rescinding between now and September 30, and thus puts the Executive Branch at war with itself,” wrote Solicitor General D. John Sauer. “Just as the President is pressing for rescission and explaining to Congress that obligating these funds would harm U.S. foreign policy interests, his subordinates are being forced to proceed to identify and even negotiate with potential recipients.”

The pocket rescissions request at the center of this case is separate from the one Trump sent Congress in early June that asked members to eliminate funding for numerous foreign aid accounts and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Lawmakers approved that proposal in July after preserving full funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

Congress has yet to act on the second rescissions request as its leaders look for ways to fund the government ahead of an Oct. 1 shutdown deadline.

Attorneys for the organizations that brought the lawsuit — the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Global Health Council — wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court submitted Monday that they opposed the Trump administration’s request to overturn the lower court’s preliminary injunction.

“USAID and the State Department have been under a duty to obligate these funds since at least March 2024, when Congress enacted the appropriations; they chose not to act sooner,” they wrote. “The government faces no cognizable harm from having to take steps to comply with the law for the short period while this Court considers its stay application.”

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unveiled the immigration operation with a nearly five-minute video featuring Michelle and Joe Abraham, whose 20-year-old daughter Katie was killed in a hit-and-run crash in Urbana in January. The alleged driver, a Guatemalan national, was arrested in Texas a few days later.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation ""will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,"" even though the libertarian CATO Institute revealed in June that 65% of immigrants booked by the agency under Trump had no criminal convictions and over 93% were never convicted of violent offenses.

Like Trump has in recent days, McLaughlin took aim at Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, saying that he ""and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago's streets—putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals.""

While Chicagoans have made their thoughts on a federal invasion clear, carrying signs that said ""No Trump! No Troops!"" and ""No Nazis—No Kings"" during a weekend protest, McLaughlin said that Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ""have a clear message: No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.""

Pritzker and Chicago's Democratic mayor, Brandon Johnson, have forcefully pushed back against Trump's threats to launch a major anti-migrant operation in the city and possibly deploy the National Guard, as he has done in Washington, DC and Los Angeles, California.

In a New York Times opinion piece published hours before the widely anticipated DHS announcement, Johnson argued that ""lowering crime rates here does not require an occupation of our city by armed members of the National Guard, as the White House continues to threaten us with. Chicagoans, including survivors of violence, have spoken out against such an extreme measure.""

""If President Trump had listened to the city's leaders, he would recognize that Chicago just experienced record-low homicide numbers, making this the safest summer since the 1960s, a result of effective collaboration between communities and law enforcement,"" wrote the mayor, who signed an executive order ahead of the federal operation and is raising a family in Austin on the West Side, ""one of the parts of our city where gun violence is most pervasive.""

""My administration has managed to make progress in crime reduction with three interconnected strategies: effective and law-abiding policing, violence prevention, and addressing the root causes of crime,"" Johnson explained. ""Our violence prevention work includes programs that employ former gang members to de-escalate conflicts as well as initiatives that connect people to jobs and resources.""

""We have directed funding to neighborhoods that have suffered from chronic disinvestment to create jobs, provide mental health services, and more. We are on track to build, rehab, or preserve over 10,000 units of affordable housing,"" he continued. ""We don't need the National Guard; we just need to invest in what works.""

In a Monday statement, Chicago Teachers Union president Stacy Davis Gates acknowledged ""the successful efforts of our mayor in reducing crime and investing in our community,"" and similarly stressed that whatever Trump is ""spending on his raids is better spent on building affordable housing, reopening school libraries, and funding social workers to support children through the trauma this administration is inflicting on an entire generation who are worried every day if they will ever see their parents again.""

""As a history teacher, I can tell you that history will not look kindly on Donald Trump or the individuals who are acting as his personal army,"" Davis Gates also said. ""For weeks, the people of Chicago have made it clear that we do not need federal agents in our city, whether that is to separate immigrant families or racially profile in our Black neighborhoods.""

""Chicago might have been built to keep our communities divided, but we are coming together now, like working people do against any bad boss, in radical solidarity to keep each other safe,"" the union leader added. ""Donald Trump and his departments of alphabet boys and National Guard troops aren't welcome and aren't needed in Chicago.""

Congressional Democrats who represent Illinois have also denounced the president's targeting of the country's third-largest city—including Sen. Dick Durbin, who took to the chamber's floor on Monday following the DHS announcement. Durbin accused Trump of attacking Chicago for ""political theater.""

While the Trump administration hasn't yet provided any update on the involvement of the National Guard, after the president moved to rename the US Department of Defense, he took to his Truth Social platform on Saturday morning with an image referencing the 1979 film Apocalypse Now and said, ""Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""

Appearing on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), said that ""we don't have any indications of them getting ready to send troops into Chicago,"" but also that ""the president of the United States essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation. This is not normal... This is not acceptable behavior.""

Responding to the recent developments in a Monday statement, Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the national advocacy group America's Voice, said that ""we have gone from a supposed war on immigrants to a war on Americans.""

""America's Voice has long said that immigration was merely the 'tip of the spear' for this administration to justify and lead an attack on all of us—including violating due process, constitutional rights, and core democratic norms and pillars, such as deploying the military against American communities,"" she noted. ""Sadly, all are coming to pass.""

Cárdenas continued: ""Why is the American president openly threatening an American city, as he readies the deployment of American troops against those residents? It's not about immigration, just as the Washington, DC deployment wasn't about crime. Instead, it's for purposes of retribution; sowing fear and dissent; provoking violence and dividing us as a nation.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61567913&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C84%2C0%2C85,N,,2025-09-09 12:58:04.881845

Gavin Newsom vowed to “continue fighting” after the U.S. Supreme Court lifted restrictions on immigration raids in Los Angeles, but the state might not have many options.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged as much during a press conference Monday where he said he was disappointed in the decision but added that he respects the rule of law.

Bonta: “The rationale articulated by Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh is dangerous and wrong. But he’s a Supreme Court justice and I’m not.”

As CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos explain, the country’s highest court handed President Donald Trump’s administration a win by lifting a restraining order that limited agents from conducting “roving patrols” and stopping people in part based on their appearance.

In addition to L.A., the ruling will likely have major impacts across the country, as immigration agents ramp up operations in Chicago, Boston and elsewhere.

L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, on social media: “This is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous — it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the U.S.”

While noting that California is not a party in the lawsuit, Bonta remained non-committal about the state’s options following the ruling, saying that it will monitor the dispute and potentially file an amicus brief should the involved parties respond to the court’s decision.

Meanwhile Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas hinted at possible legislative actions to push back against Trump “with everything we’ve got.”

Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, in a statement: “We’ve already passed laws to prevent raids in our schools and hospitals. … The only way we stop Trump is by standing together.”

A federal judge issued the restraining order in July, siding with civil rights, immigrant rights and local government agencies that argued that immigration agents were violating Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.

But in a 6-3 decision the Supreme Court granted the administration’s emergency request to lift that order, with the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents dissenting.

Justice Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion explaining his reasoning to lift restrictions: “Ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her dissent: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

CA officials honor ‘progressive warrior’ John Burton

The California Senate took a moment to honor one of its legends when it returned to business, recognizing John Burton, who died Sunday at the age of 92.

Describing him as one of the Senate’s “finest members,” Senate president pro tem Mike Mcguire of Santa Rosa led the chamber on Monday in a moment of silence to honor the former lawmaker and California Democratic Party leader.

Known for his brash way of speaking, Burton was a key figure in Democratic politics in California for decades. News of his passing drew multiple honors and tributes from California’s top officials, including from those whose careers were shaped by Burton, such as Gov. Newsom and Rep. Nancy Pelosi.

Newsom, in a statement: “There was no greater champion for the poor, the bullied, the disabled, and forgotten Californians than John Burton. … His legacy is not only written in the policies he helped enact, but in the countless lives he touched and uplifted, including my own.”

Newsom directed flags to be flown at half-staff, and the governor plans to posthumously induct Burton into the California Hall of Fame. In her tribute, Pelosi described Burton as a “towering progressive warrior,” while close friend and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown told the San Francisco Chronicle that Burton’s influence was “immeasurable.”

School unions a maybe on sex abuse bill

California lawmakers are considering a bill that would help protect schoolchildren from being sexually abused by educators, but the measure faces opposition by some teacher’s unions, writes Matt Drange for CalMatters.

In addition to requiring training for teachers and students on how to recognize signs of sexual grooming, Senate Bill 848 would mandate district officials to report and track “egregious” instances of employee misconduct. It would also create a hiring database that administrators must use to vet prospective teachers for potential misconduct.

The database is intended to curb the practice of schools re-hiring teachers who have resigned from another school after being accused of sexual misconduct. The California Teachers Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, notably does not oppose the bill, despite opposing similar legislation in past years. The California Federation of Teachers and the California School Employees Association do, however, citing concerns over due process.

Tristan Brown, California Federation of Teachers’ legislative director. “We need to ensure a policy that captures individuals that are unfit to work in education while making sure innocent and unfairly charged employees have fair access to justice.”

Recently Nigel Farage outlined Reform UK’s policies for “deporting all illegal migrants and securing the UK’s borders”, titled “Operation Restoring Justice”. The policies can be summarized as “detect, detain, deport”.

A main – though not the only – target of these policies is those crossing the Channel in small boats who, while their entry to the UK is unauthorized, almost all currently claim asylum when current laws give them protection against immediate detention and deportation. Under Reform UK’s proposals those crossing will not be allowed to settle in Britain and will be removed asap, perhaps to their own countries or perhaps to third countries. For this to be legal, laws need to be changed and the proposals suggest an emergency 5-year suspension of a variety of human rights laws and international obligations, including the Refugee Convention and the European Court of Human Rights. The right to claim asylum would be removed and with it the right not to be imprisoned and to avoid non-refoulement (removal to unsafe countries). Nigel Farage explicitly said that he is prepared to negotiate a returns agreement with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Asylum might still be offered by the UK to some groups but who and in what numbers would be determined by the UK government, not who manages to arrive in the UK.

Almost certainly Reform UK are under-estimating the difficult of the “detect” part of their proposal.

A lot of objections to these proposals have been on legal and ethical grounds. I am neither a lawyer nor a philosopher so will not primarily comment on these aspects. Instead, what would this strategy mean in practice, and would it work?

The practical difficulties of detecting and detaining asylum seekers

First, consider the “detect” part. At the moment those arriving in small boats are not worried about being detected as almost all claim asylum. But, if the consequence of detection was detention and deportation, those entering the country would seek ways to enter without detection. Smugglers’ strategies would evolve. And many illegal migrants in the UK are visa over-stayers or who arrived by other means. To find them is a difficult and costly exercise. In the US Donald Trump has tripled the budget for ICE. Inevitably some of the accused of being illegally in the UK will claim they are legal (and some will be, and minorities will be more likely to be victims) so it is hard to avoid some type of due process to determine legality which takes time and costs money. Almost certainly Reform UK are under-estimating the difficult of the “detect” part of their proposal.

What about “detention”. If detention (potentially of unlimited and indeterminate duration) is deemed legal, problems are likely if the numbers being held are large as there are likely to be allegations of ill-treatment and self-harm (there always have been in other countries) and it can be expensive. If most in detention are quickly deported then the policy may be effective in reducing the numbers of unauthorized border crossings as the threat of deportation will be credible; numbers detained will then be small. But if deportation is harder than anticipated then not only will the outflow from detention be lower but the absence of a credible threat to deport means that fewer unauthorized migrants are deterred so the inflow into detention would also be higher. The numbers liable to detention could grow fast, proving difficult for the government to maintain the policy at all.

Making deals with unpleasant regimes

So the success of the policy (in its own terms) depends on how easy deportation is. Deportation can only proceed with the agreement of a receiving country. The receiving country might be the country of origin of a third country. Third-party agreements may make striking headlines (think of Donald Trump sending handfuls of migrants to Eswatini and South Sudan) but are small-scale. The doomed Rwanda scheme of the previous government had a capacity of at most 200 people, and would quickly have been at capacity at which point it would be unlikely to have any deterrent effect.

So agreements with origin countries would be needed for large-scale deportations and the proposal is explicit about being prepared to negotiate agreements some unpleasant regimes, specifically the Taliban in Afghanistan, currently the most common nationality crossing in small boats. In these negotiations all countries will see the possibility for advantage. Sometimes it is argued that the UK should use the threat of lower aid or harder trade or fewer visas. But the countries with the most citizens crossing are not countries where there is much scope for this. Aid to places like Afghanistan and Eritrea are largely routed through humanitarian NGOs rather directly to the government. The UK government could threaten the Taliban with reducing support to women there but it is hard to imagine them caring very much.

So there will be payments from the UK to some unpleasant governments – Farage has made no secret that he is prepared to strike such deals. But they are likely to be subject to protracted negotiations; meanwhile the numbers in detention may rack up. In July 2025 Germany returned 81 failed Afghan asylum-seekers with criminal convictions but in a deal brokered by Qatar in the absence of direct links with the Taliban and with little indication of what the Taliban received in return. The Taliban probably know that Nigel Farage wants this deal much more than them, so will negotiate hard if the aim is to deport thousands. It is also not hard to imagine governments undermining the agreements in plausibly deniable ways – perhaps surreptitiously encouraging emigrants and then arguing more money is needed to take back more people.

There are many ways in which Reform UK’s policy could end in failure, even on its own terms.

I suspect that Nigel Farage might want the message “I don’t like the Taliban any more than you but the fact that I am prepared to strike a deal with them shows how serious a problem this is for the UK”. Whether that message could survive the reality is debatable. Some sent back would very likely be persecuted, tortured or killed leading to scandals. Some in the UK may not care but most will think it wrong. Within a few days of the policy being launched Nigel Farage has said that women and children would not be sent back, then said they would, and it’s not hard to envisage carve-outs (perhaps Afghans claiming they served with the British there) from what was initially billed as a “no exceptions” policy. And a possible exception means a process to determine whether someone should be returned and a weakening of the deterrent.

Brexit has made things harder, not easier

There are many ways in which Reform UK’s policy could end in failure, even on its own terms. Nevertheless, some voters may think it worth a shot as nothing else has worked. But, from previous similar episodes we actually know what works. It’s not been the “safe and legal” routes one often hears mentioned as an alternative – those ideas have their own problems.

Let’s give some examples. Australia has managed to end maritime arrivals, through a range of international cooperative agreements notably an agreement to return those who try to Indonesia, something Nigel Farage mentioned as working but does not seem to have understood the implication. The US has reduced encounters at its Southern border from a peak of 360 thousand in December 2023 to a level of 4,600 in July 2025. This has not mostly happened because of high-profile stunts like deporting migrants to third countries but through a policy (starting under Biden but continued under Trump) of expediting removals through agreements with countries to return illegal migrants home or to remain in Mexico. In these and other examples, it is agreement with the countries of departure which has worked; think of the EU’s agreement with Turkey in 2016. For Channel crossings that means cooperation with Europe, or at the very least France. That is probably anathema to Nigel Farage and the cheerfully discusses negotiations with the Taliban but not with the French.

Brexit made it easier to control managed migration even if Boris Johnson’s government did not exercise much control. But Brexit made it harder to manage unauthorized migration – a loss of access to European databases and the disappearance of returns agreements. Brexit has made the UK an appeal court for failed asylum seekers from the EU. But it’s through working primarily with Europe not Afghanistan, Eritrea and Iran that the solution to the small boat crossings will be found if it is found at all. That is basically the strategy of the current government.

The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters.

The case is likely to have an enormous impact, not just for Los Angeles but across the country, several experts told CalMatters. It means immigration agents can legally resume aggressive street sweeps that began in early June in Los Angeles, the epicenter for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

In a 31-page ruling, the Supreme Court, by a 6-3 majority, agreed with the Trump administration that federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate individuals about whether they are lawfully in the United States and that they can rely on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion. That means everything the officer knew and observed at the time of the stop.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s emergency docket, also known as the shadow docket, is used for cases that are handled speedily with limited briefing and typically no oral argument. The justices often issue unsigned orders with little or no explanation.

The ruling means the Border Patrol can resume the aggressive tactics a district federal judge said violated people’s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.

In a brief asking justices to remove restrictions on immigration stops, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security wrote that the lower-court injunction interfered with agents’ efforts to remove unauthorized immigrants.

“The injunction raises the specter of contempt for every stop in the district, threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop. It chills the exercise of Executive authority and usurps the President’s Article II powers to enforce our immigration laws,” attorneys for the Trump administration wrote.

The district court found, based on a “mountain of evidence,” that the government engaged in a pattern of conducting stops without reasonable suspicion—relying solely on traits like race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or accented English, the location a person is in, and the type of work a person does.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the lower court’s ruling, chiding the Trump administration for misrepresenting the restraining order in their appeal.

“If, as the Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing … stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the three-judge panel from the 9th Circuit wrote.

A coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the United Farm Workers, sought the order, arguing the LA-area raids have violated people’s rights by allowing federal immigration agents to stop people who simply appear to be Latino, including U.S. citizens.

“The federal government is seeking to detain individuals solely because they are not white, speak Spanish or speak accented English. That idea is anathema to everything the United States stands for, and it should be rejected,” a group of cities in Los Angeles County wrote in amicus brief supporting restrictions on immigration agents. They wrote that this summer’s raids had “sown terror” in their communities.

Despite the previous order barring profiling, agents have continued an aggressive enforcement blitz in the nation’s second-largest city.

About 40 agents hit a Westlake Home Depot on Aug. 28, using tear gas and pepper pellets to disperse a crowd before detaining eight people, a Border Patrol official confirmed Friday. That’s the same location where agents previously made a hype video set to rap music of themselves hiding in a Penske rental truck before bursting out to detain day laborers in a raid dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.

Under Operation-At-Large Chief Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol has detained Latino daylaborers, swarming Home Depots and carwashes across the nation’s second largest city. Bovino has vowed to bring similar tactics to cities across the country.

Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law said the federal government’s racial profiling has consequences beyond immigration enforcement. He wrote to CalMatters and also in a paper for the SMU Law Review that “race-based immigration enforcement undermines Latina/o sense of belonging in the national community for generations.”

“Importantly, the Trump administration’s campaign against people of color goes well beyond immigration law and immigrants. As exemplified by the administration’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion, the President has sought to eliminate programs that seek to promote the full integration of racial and other minorities into U.S. society,” Johnson wrote.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/062025-us-cbp-la-raids-getty-cm-021757348850.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=bz3J4Y2y,N,,2025-09-09 12:58:09.338107

In a series of posts on X, Johnson said the city of Chicago did not receive notice about the initiative, and he raised concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement's track record and links to human rights abuses.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment via email on Tuesday outside regular working hours.

Why It Matters

Operation Midway Blitz is the latest instance of the Trump administration intensifying federal immigration crackdowns on Democratic-led cities this summer, citing crime and public safety concerns as justification.

The move has drawn sharp criticism from local leaders—including Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker—who argue that it is intended to intimidate rather than reduce crime, noting that federal authorities have not attempted to coordinate with local officials.

What To Know

The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that it was launching the initiative in Chicago and across Illinois following the death of Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old college student killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run allegedly caused by Guatemalan national Julio Cucul-Bol.

The department said ""criminal illegal aliens"" had flocked to the state because Pritzker's sanctuary policies allowed them ""to roam free on American streets.""

Johnson said on X that the city of Chicago received no notice on the new ICE operation before it launched.

He said the city remained opposed to ""any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process"" and cited ICE's track record of ""detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.""

The mayor went on to name several examples of ICE's enforcement practices and reported misconduct.

He cited one incident in which ICE deported an American child with Stage IV kidney cancer to Honduras along with his mother, a case that is now the subject of a lawsuit.

Johnson also referenced a report from Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff's office that identified hundreds of cases of human rights abuses in immigration detention centers around the county.

What People Are Saying

President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday, along with a meme referencing the 1979 Vietnam War movie Apocalypse Now: ""'I love the smell of deportations in the morning...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker wrote on X: ""This isn't about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination—yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks. Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson wrote on X: ""Chicago doesn't want to see reckless, unconstitutional, militarized immigration enforcement in our city.""

What Happens Next

The government has released few details about what Operation Midway Blitz will entail.

It remains to be seen whether Trump will send National Guard members to Chicago to accompany ICE, as he did in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer.

The move came in response to a federal judge's ruling last week that requires the administration to spend the funds despite President Donald Trump notifying Congress that he intends not to.

The case marks a showdown over to what extent the president can refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated, a brewing issue as Trump has embraced a sweeping view of presidential power since taking office again in January.

In the new filing, Solicitor General D. John Sauer described the case as raising “a grave and urgent threat” to the power of the presidency.

Under the Constitution, it is the job of Congress to allocate funds that the president can spend.

Current federal funding expires on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.

The dispute involves a law called the Impoundment Control Act, which was passed in 1974 to regulate the president’s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.

Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali has been at the center of the complicated litigation, which has raged for months as the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The underlying lawsuit was brought by various groups that receive foreign-aid funding, led by the Global Health Council.

Prior to the current administration, USAID spent billions every year on programs in developing countries addressing such issues as malaria and AIDs prevention and improving access to water.

In his ruling last week, Ali said the government must spend the money unless Congress votes to approve Trump's request.

But in Monday's filing, Sauer said that Ali's order imposes impossible burdens on the administration.

""To have any hope of complying in time, the executive branch would have to immediately commence diplomatic discussions with foreign nations about the use of those funds — discussions the President considers counterproductive to foreign policy — and notify Congress about planned obligations that the President is strongly opposing,"" he added.

In a filing in response, the plaintiffs urged the court not to immediately block Ali's ruling, saying it merely requires the government to make plans to spend the money by the end of the month. If Congress approves Trump's request, the money would not have to be spent, they added.

On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit declined to block Ali's decision, prompting the Trump administration to turn to the Supreme Court.

The crux of the legal fight is over nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved aid that President Donald Trump last month said he would not spend, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that the Republican administration’s decision to withhold the funding was likely illegal.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter on Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice means Congress cannot act on the request in the required 45-day window and the money goes unspent.

Ali said Congress would have to approve the rescission proposal for the Trump administration to withhold the money. The law is “explicit that it is congressional action — not the President’s transmission of a special message — that triggers rescission of the earlier appropriations,” he wrote.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer called the ruling “an unlawful injunction that precipitates an unnecessary emergency and needless interbranch conflict.” He urged the justices to immediately block it.

But lawyers for the nonprofit organizations that sued the government said it’s the funding freeze that violates federal law, noting that it has shut down funding for even the most urgent lifesaving programs abroad.

“This marks the third time in this case alone that the Administration has run to the Supreme Court in a supposed emergency posture to seek relief from circumstances of its own making — this time to defend the illegal tactic of a ‘pocket rescission,’” attorney Lauren Bateman of Public Citizen Litigation Group, lead counsel for the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition plaintiffs, said in a statement. “The Administration is effectively asking the Supreme Court to bless its attempt to unlawfully accumulate power.”

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

After Trump issued his rescission notice, the plaintiffs returned to Ali’s court and the judge issued the order that’s now being challenged.

This story is a collaboration between the newsletter Down from DC and The Assembly.

The company that owns North Carolina’s only private federal prison facility is negotiating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to reopen it as a detention center, potentially for immigrants awaiting deportation.

Rivers Correctional Institution, in rural Hertford County, closed in 2021 when the Biden administration ended federal contracts with the private prison industry, citing dangerous conditions at those facilities.

ICE has contracts with county jails in Alamance and New Hanover counties for about 30 prisoners, but a contract with Rivers, which has capacity for more than 1,000 prisoners, could introduce large-scale detention of immigrants to North Carolina and a return to for-profit detention in a state where immigration enforcement remains a deeply partisan issue.

The GEO Group, among the largest private prison companies in the country, told investors last month that it was talking with ICE about reopening Rivers and five other idled prisons as part of the $45 billion expansion in immigration detention Congress approved in the massive budget and spending bill it passed this summer.

George C. Zoley, executive chairman of GEO, described the negotiations during an August 6 call with investors about second-quarter earnings. He named Rivers and prisons in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Colorado as the six he hoped to reopen. Combined, the facilities would hold 5,900 people.

“We are in active discussions with both ICE and U.S. Marshals Service for the potential activation of these facilities,” Zoley said on the call, adding: “We continue to be pleased with the pace of these contract discussions and remain optimistic that additional contract awards will materialize during the third and fourth quarters of the year.”

Christopher V. Ferreira, director of corporate relations for GEO, referred questions about the potential reopening of Rivers to ICE. ICE did not reply to multiple emails or a phone call requesting comment.

An August Washington Post story identified Rivers as part of an unprecedented expansion in detention to temporarily hold the immigrants the Trump administration intends to deport. The Post obtained ICE internal documents which reportedly indicate a detailed plan for a vast system of public and private prisons to meet ICE’s goal of doubling detentions from 50,000 to more than 100,000 by January. The Post reports that GEO stands to gain at least nine new or modified detention contracts worth $500 million.

This week, the Post followed up that story with a close look at the safety records of three of the facilities under consideration by the Trump administration–including one operated by GEO in Texas–and found a history of violence and abuse with fewer standards today than under earlier administrations for humane treatment of prisoners. An ICE official told the Post that specific facilities laid out in the planning documents obtained by the newspaper could change.

Even before Congress approved money for new detention facilities, federal authorities had been setting up centers to hold the surging number of detainees being held for violating immigration law. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis invoked emergency powers to build one such facility at a remote airfield in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The makeshift facility holds 3,000 in what news reports describe as unsanitary conditions, with migrants living in mosquito-infested tents. A federal judge in Florida ordered it closed last month over violations of environmental protection rules, but an appeals court last week overruled that order to keep the facility open.

The largest detention facility, a 1,000-bed tent camp, opened last month at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, with a planned expansion to 5,000. The Trump administration now faces questions over the $1.2 billion building contract awarded to a company, Acquisition Logistics, with no prior prison experience.

GEO has contracted with federal agencies for decades. Rivers closed in 2021, when the Federal Bureau of Prisons let its contract with GEO expire as part of an overall policy to shrink the federal prison system, especially its reliance on for-profit facilities.

President Joe Biden laid out that policy in an executive order he signed at the beginning of his term. “There is broad consensus that our current system of mass incarceration imposes significant costs and hardships on our society and communities and does not make us safer,” the order said. “To decrease incarceration levels, we must reduce profit-based incentives to incarcerate by phasing out the Federal Government’s reliance on privately operated criminal detention facilities.”

The executive order also cited dangerous conditions for inmates and staff at private prisons as a reason for ending those contracts. “The Federal Government also has a responsibility to ensure the safe and humane treatment of those in the Federal criminal justice system,” the order read, citing a 2016 report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice that found that “privately operated criminal detention facilities do not maintain the same levels of safety and security for people in the Federal criminal justice system or for correctional staff.”

That report, which included findings from a visit by inspectors to Rivers, described high rates of violence, contraband, inadequate medical care, and drug use among all 14 private federal prisons. Of the North Carolina prison, the report said: “Rivers had the highest rates of contraband finds (excluding cell phones), inmate assaults on staff, uses of force, guilty findings on inmate discipline cases, inmate grievances, positive drug tests, inmate-on-inmate sexual misconduct and the lowest phone monitoring rate.”

When it closed four years ago, Rivers held 1,450 inmates, mostly migrants serving sentences for criminal convictions before being deported and about 160 U.S. citizens with criminal convictions from Washington, D.C., many of them mentally ill, according to press reports. The 336 people who worked at Rivers at the time were laid off. According to the GEO website, Rivers now has capacity for 1,320 prisoners.

U.S. Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.), whose district includes Hertford County, said in an email: “It is crucial that any facility converted into an ICE detention center complies with operational standards to ensure the humane treatment of its detainees. I would expect nothing less. I also believe that stakeholders, including community members, should be included in these discussions.”

U.S. Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd, both Republicans from North Carolina, did not respond to requests for comment.

In the first six months of his administration, President Donald Trump has made good on his campaign promise to crack down on undocumented immigrants. As of the end of August, the number of immigrants in detention had reached an all-time high of 61,226 according to Austin Kocher, a researcher at Syracuse University who publishes a newsletter on immigration data.

On the campaign trail, Trump frequently railed against “the worst of the worst” and “Biden’s migrant crime.” But his administration has not solely focused on removing convicted criminals–far from it. So far, according to Kocher’s analysis, only 36 percent of those detained have criminal convictions, while about a third face criminal charges for which they have not yet been tried. The last third are accused only of immigration violations.

ICE has arrested 2,200 people in North Carolina since President Trump took office, but the enforcement activity here has not been as visible as in larger urban centers like Los Angeles, Miami, and New York. According to press reports, about 60 percent of undocumented immigrants deported from North Carolina were not arrested in raids of businesses or homes. Rather, they were already in jail and turned over to ICE by local sheriffs.

In their call with investors last month, officials at GEO said that the company is imprisoning 20,000 immigrants, the highest number in its history, through existing contracts with ICE at 21 facilities. These facilities could hold as many as 25,000. In addition to detention facilities, GEO officials said that the company also expects significant growth in its electronic monitoring of immigrants and ground transportation and flights used for deportations. Throughout the call, Zoley referred to “unprecedented growth opportunities” for GEO.

The GEO group invested heavily in President Trump’s reelection. According to an analysis by ABC News, a subsidiary of GEO contributed $1 million to Make America Great Again Inc. In its earnings call with investors following the election, company officials predicted revenue growth of $400 million just from expanding or filling unused capacity at existing prisons. ABC quoted Zoley: “What is new is a potential sea change by the incoming Trump administration that is expected to implement a much more aggressive policy towards interior and border immigration enforcement.”

In its most recent financial reports, GEO reported total revenue of $1.2 billion and net income of $48.6 million in the first six months of the year. Its leadership sees that increasing if the contracts for the six idle facilities are awarded.

“If fully utilized, these six facilities could generate up to approximately $310 million in annualized revenue,” Zoley said in the August earnings call.

A HISTORIC TEST Congress, under its constitutional duties, has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically.","It’s ground that presidents have hardly ever crossed outside of times of war, and experts say it’s remaking the role of the most powerful military in the world and its relationship with the American public.

National Guard troops have been patrolling the streets of U.S. cities, as a prelude to weapons of war being deployed against American citizens.

Yet as Trump has dramatically stepped up his use of military force, fellow Republicans in Congress — where authorization for such actions is supposed to originate — have done little but cheer him on.

That’s giving the president significant leeway as he raises plans to send troops next to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans.

“If I were one of those mayors, I’d be glad to have the help,” said Senator Roger Wicker, R-MS, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, speaking from a Capitol building where National Guard troops were patrolling the surrounding city. “I think the big city Democrats are really making a mistake. I think they’re being tone deaf.”

Lawmakers from Louisiana — a red state that surrounds politically blue New Orleans — said it was a great idea for National Guard troops to go there next.

“New Orleans, like most Democrat-run cities, has a high crime rate, so it would be helpful,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told The Associated Press.

Senator John Kennedy, R-LA, agreed: “We need all the help we can get. I’m delighted to bring in the National Guard.”

Republicans have in recent years found political success focusing on the issue of crime. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities, according to recent polling from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents, and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats. However, statistics show overall crime is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.

HOW TRUMP’S USE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD IS UNIQUE

In the past, the use of National Guard troops on American soil was reserved for extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters or when local officials became overwhelmed by civil unrest or disorder. Rarely have presidents used the troops for law enforcement purposes.

Notable examples include the 1894 Pullman strike in Chicago, during the Civil Rights era to enforce desegregation in the South, and in 1992 during deadly rioting after police officers brutally beat motorist Rodney King and were acquitted on state charges.

Experts say that Trump’s crime mission stands out because he’s not responding to a particular crisis. Instead, Trump is using the military to implement his domestic policies, whether that means using military aircraft for deportation flights, beefing up military at the U.S.-Mexico border or ordering National Guard troops to be ready for law enforcement duties.

“All of these things indicate an administration that is making a broad, concerted effort to insert the military into civilian law enforcement in a way and on a scale that has no precedent in American history,” said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program.

Trump says he has the “right” to send National Guard troops to the cities, even over the objections of state governors.

“I’m the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger — and it is in danger in these cities — I can do it,” he said recently.

A HISTORIC TEST

Congress, under its constitutional duties, has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically. But as Trump has pushed the limits of those laws, the Republican-controlled Congress has stood by. Instead, it’s been left to the courts to put any guardrails on Trump’s maximalist approach to the presidency.

A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration “willfully” broke the Posse Comitatus Act, a nearly 150-year-old federal law that limits the U.S. military’s role in domestic law enforcement, when he sent National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area in early June after days of protests over immigration raids.

U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco noted Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated they intend to deploy National Guard troops to other cities across the country, raising concerns they’re “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”

That sort of use of the National Guard was just what the writers of the Constitution were trying to guard against, said Andrew Wiest, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the National Guard at the University of Southern Mississippi.

The young nation had just endured a war of independence that was sparked by a British military acting as a police force on the colony, and its early leaders were reticent to give the president too much control over the military. Since then, presidents have increasingly exercised more power over the troops that started as state-based militias.

“This is another one of those pendulum moments where the Guard will become more federal or maybe it will swing back in the other direction,” Wiest said. “But since the founding of the Republic, it’s been swinging towards the federal side.”

THE GOP’S MORAL BANKRUPTCY

Despite decades of fevered rhetoric warning that an overreaching federal government might someday turn its guns on its own people, the nation’s loudest defenders of the Second Amendment — including the National Rifle Association — have met Trump’s unprecedented domestic deployment of military force not with outrage, but with resounding silence or open approval.

The same voices that have long claimed an armed citizenry is a bulwark against government tyranny are now watching, even applauding, as military vehicles roll into American cities not during natural disasters or riots, but as part of a politically driven campaign to project federal authority.

Their absence from this national moment exposes a contradiction at the core of their advocacy, the supposed fight for liberty collapses when authoritarianism aligns with their ideology.

Legal scholars and civil rights organizations have noted the chilling precedent being set, warning of a dangerous shift toward a militarized police state. Yet gun rights organizations have offered no resistance, no constitutional concern, no defense of the very citizens they claimed for decades to protect.

In choosing political loyalty over principle, they have abandoned their own stated mission and affirmed that their crusade was never about safeguarding democracy — only about enabling power.

Among those praising the use of National Guard troops on American streets are some of the Republican Party’s most vocal Second Amendment advocates — lawmakers who have received top ratings from the National Rifle Association and have long warned that unchecked federal power threatens American liberty.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-LA, a staunch NRA ally who has consistently invoked constitutional protections against government overreach, has now welcomed the federal militarization of local streets, calling the deployments “helpful.”

Senator Josh Hawley, R-MO, another lawmaker who has publicly aligned with the NRA and warned of “deep state” abuses of power, has likewise offered no opposition to Trump’s domestic military agenda.

And Senator Ted Cruz, R-TX, who once claimed gun rights exist “to protect the citizenry from the government,” has remained notably quiet as the president advances what legal experts are calling a civilian-targeted show of military force.

Such approval of domestic troop deployments stands in sharp contrast to the rhetoric that the gun rights movement has spouted for decades — framing themselves as defenders of Americans against potential tyranny.

Yet with Trump asserting unilateral power to override governors and send troops into cities without consent, their silence on constitutional checks has been deafening. Critics argue the disconnect reveals a deep moral bankruptcy. A willingness to abandon foundational principles when the abuse of government power comes from within their own party.",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090825_GOPMiltaryDeploy_01_JScottApplewhite.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 10:58:34.412491

“Stop playing politics with the lives and safety of law enforcement officers.” But in an emailed statement to The Florida Phoenix, Worrell’s office said investigations are typically conducted by law enforcement, not by her staff.
That function lies with law enforcement.
To date, we have not received a criminal case package from law enforcement,” said Anika Hamilton, Worrell’s communications specialist.","Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier wants a former state senator investigated over a Facebook post in which she revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were massed at an Orlando bus station.

In an X post Monday, Uthmeier said former Sen. Linda Stewart, an Orlando Democrat, may have been “harassing law enforcement” by telling Floridians on Aug. 15 that ICE was at the Lynx Central Station in downtown Orlando.

In an interesting twist, just hours after hinting at a suspension from her post, Uthmeier asked Orange County’s Democratic state attorney, Monique Worrell, to do the investigating.

Stewart, 76, protested.

“I have done absolutely nothing wrong!” Stewart told The Florida Phoenix on a phone call, alleging that Uthmeier had not reached out to her before posting on social media. “I’m shocked. I don’t know why [Uthmeier] would do such a thing for me saying that ICE is in a public space. I didn’t go into ICE headquarters and find out all the details of where they’re going to be. … I just posted [on Facebook].”

“Big deal,” she continued, insisting that she’s not worried. “In all of their freedom of speech, I don’t know what reason they would think that that could cause me to be arrested.”

Stewart said that a friend had told her that ICE was at the station, informing her Aug. 15 Facebook post. Soon after, MAGA podcaster and right-wing influencer Laura Loomer, who boasts nearly 2 million followers on X, alerted Uthmeier on social media that Stewart was allegedly “doxxing” ICE.

Doxxing involves maliciously publicizing a person’s personal information. In June, Uthmeier rolled out a new program specifically designed to protect ICE agents from being doxxed.

“Harassing law enforcement to prevent them from doing their jobs is unlawful in Florida,” Uthmeier said, calling on Orange County State Attorney Worrell to investigate. “Stop playing politics with the lives and safety of law enforcement officers.”

But in an emailed statement to The Florida Phoenix, Worrell’s office said investigations are typically conducted by law enforcement, not by her staff.

“Traditionally, our office does not conduct investigations. That function lies with law enforcement. To date, we have not received a criminal case package from law enforcement,” said Anika Hamilton, Worrell’s communications specialist. “Should one be submitted, we will review it and handle the matter in the same way we handle all other criminal cases presented to us.”

Uthmeier’s call to action came just hours after he sent a lengthy letter to Worrell, demanding she stop pressing charges against a woman accused of second-degree murder. Uthmeier, who believes the woman acted in self-defense, claimed Worrell’s prosecution could constitute an ethical violation demonstrating ground for a suspension from office.

It wouldn’t be the first time Worrell’s been suspended. In 2023, when Uthmeier served as chief of staff to Gov. Ron DeSantis, the governor removed Worrell from office for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.” Last November she won re-election to the post, defeating the DeSantis appointee who replaced her by 15 points.

“There’s just no reason for it,” Stewart said. “I can’t imagine [Worrell] saying I did anything wrong. I just don’t get it.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-14-at-11.20.56 AM-2048x1019.png,N,,2025-09-09 11:58:26.881643

Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles and elsewhere have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.","By Andrew Chung

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court again backed President Donald Trump's hardline immigration approach on Monday, letting agents proceed with Southern California raids targeting people for deportation based on their race or language in a ruling its liberal justices said makes Latinos ""fair game to be seized at any time.""

The court granted a Justice Department request to put on hold a judge's order that had barred agents from stopping or detaining people without ""reasonable suspicion"" that they are in the country illegally, by relying on race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent, among other factors.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the court's decision in harsh terms.

""Trump's hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the grand marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles,"" Newsom said in a statement, alluding to the fact that Trump appointed three of the six conservative justices serving on the nine-member court.

The court's brief and unsigned order, issued without any explanation, lifts the judge's restrictions while a legal challenge brought by a group of Latino people caught up in the raids plays out.

Trump's administration quickly vowed to continue ""roving patrols."" The Republican president returned to office in January promising to escalate deportations, and immigration raids by masked and armed federal agents triggered street protests in Los Angeles that led him to send military troops in June into the largest city in the most-populous U.S. state.

The administration ""has all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low-wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents' satisfaction,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in 2009 became the court's first Hispanic member, wrote in a dissent joined by the court's other two liberals.

""Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,"" Sotomayor added.

Los Angeles-based U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong found on July 11 that the Trump administration's actions likely violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The judge's order applied in an area covering much of Southern California.

""This isn't about enforcing immigration laws - it's about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn't look or sound like Stephen Miller's idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California's families and small businesses,"" Newsom said, referring to Trump's senior aide.

""Trump's private police force now has a green light to come after your family - and every person is now a target - but we will continue fighting these abhorrent attacks on Californians,"" Newsom added.

Miller, the architect of Trump's immigration crackdown, in May demanded that the leaders of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ramp up deportations, setting a goal of 3,000 daily arrests.

'JUDICIAL MICROMANAGEMENT'

Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called Monday's decision a ""massive victory,"" writing on social media that immigration enforcement officers now can ""continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement.""

The plaintiffs, including some who are U.S. citizens, filed the proposed class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court in July.

""Individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from,"" the lawsuit stated.

Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California who helps represent the plaintiffs, vowed to continue to fight the administration's ""racist deportation scheme.""

""This decision is a devastating setback for our plaintiffs and communities who, for months, have been subjected to immigration stops because of the color of their skin, occupation, or the language they speak,"" Tajsar said.

Concurring with Monday's decision, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that ""apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion"" but it can be a ""'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors.""

Kavanaugh added: ""If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.""

Trump's administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court this year to allow it to proceed with policies that lower courts have impeded after casting doubt on their legality.

The court has backed Trump in most of these cases. For instance, it has allowed Trump to deport migrants to countries other than their own without offering a chance to show harms they may face and to revoke temporary legal status previously granted by the government on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles and elsewhere have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.

Trump's decision to send National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles in response to the protests represented an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations. Newsom and local officials contested the deployment as unlawful and unnecessary.

Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order halting stops or arrests based on race, language, presence at a particular location such as a car wash or tow yard, or type of work to establish ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegality. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 declined to lift Frimpong's order.

The Trump administration said on Monday that it had launched an immigration enforcement action in Chicago and other parts of Illinois dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" but the scope of the operation was unclear and the state's Democratic governor said he was in the dark.

In a press release, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the operation was necessary because of city and state ""sanctuary"" laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, for weeks has signaled that he could send National Guard troops and federal officers to the Democratic stronghold of Chicago to combat crime and illegal immigration.

The immigration operation announced on Monday appeared to resemble more typical Trump-era immigration enforcement operations rather than troop deployments he had authorized in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have criticized the plans, with Pritzker saying Trump would use troops to manipulate the 2026 midterm elections.

""The Governor's Office has received no formal communication or information from the Trump Administration,"" Pritzker spokesperson Matt Hill said. ""Like the public and press, we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show.""

In a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump cited recent murders and shootings in Chicago and blamed Pritzker for making no requests for assistance from the Trump administration.

""I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them,"" Trump wrote. ""Only the Criminals will be hurt! We can move fast and stop this madness.""

In a separate post on Saturday, Trump posted a meme based on the 1979 Vietnam War movie ""Apocalypse Now"" that showed an image of the Chicago skyline with flames and helicopters, reminiscent of the deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village in the film.

In the press release announcing the Chicago operation, the Homeland Security Department released a list of several immigrants in the U.S. illegally who were convicted of crimes and allegedly released by Illinois jails. The crimes included assault, burglary, drug possession, and other offenses, as well as allegations of gang membership.

Mitchell has long called for voting restrictions and was on the infamous January 2021 phone call Trump made to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger in which Trump pressed Raffensperger to “find 11,780 votes” that would give the state’s electoral votes to him rather than the victorious Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.

Democracy Docket, the media organization founded and run by voting rights and election lawyer Marc Elias, has been tracking the administration’s assault on democracy and has repeatedly called out both such language and Trump’s attempts to monkey with the machinery of our democracy through gerrymandering, voter suppression, and now the use of the military in Democratic-led cities.

In August, Jim Saksa of Democracy Docket explained that through intimidation, harassment, and delays, troops could keep large numbers of voters from casting ballots. The administration might even claim fraud to seize voting machines, as Trump contemplated doing in 2020. Today in Mother Jones, Ari Berman noted the administration has dismantled efforts to promote election security and is working to stack state elections boards with loyalists.

MAGA loyalist Steve Bannon recently said: “They’re petrified over at MSNBC and CNN that, hey, since we’re taking control of the cities, there’s going to be ICE officers near polling places. You’re damn right.” Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker, speaking of Trump’s threatened military incursion into Chicago, observed: “This is not about fighting crime. This is about the President and his complicit lackey, Stephen Miller, searching for ways to lay the groundwork to circumvent our democracy, militarize our cities, and end elections.”

Yesterday the administration announced a surge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into Boston, and today it announced a surge into Chicago. Although Trump has been threatening to send in federalized National Guard troops, at least so far the announcement appears to be limited to ICE agents, who are part of the country’s regular law enforcement systems. Pritzker noted that the administration had made no effort to reach out to state officials as it would have if it actually wanted to combat crime. Instead, Pritzker said, “we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show.”

The apparent plan of the Trump administration reflects the strategy of Nazi political theorist Carl Schmitt, whose writings seem lately to have captivated leaders on the American right, including billionaire Peter Thiel and the man who influenced him, Curtis Yarvin. Schmitt opposed liberal democracy, in which the state enables individuals to determine their own fate. Instead, he argued that true democracy erases individual self-determination by making the mass of people one with the state and exercising their will through state power. That uniformity requires getting rid of opposition. Schmitt theorized that politics is simply about dividing people into friends and enemies and using the power of the state to crush enemies. As J.D. Vance described Schmitt’s ideas in 2024: “There’s no law, there's just power.”

Much of Schmitt’s philosophy centered around the idea that the power of a nation that is based in a constitution and the rule of law belongs to the man who can exploit emergencies that create exceptions to the constitutional order, enabling him to exercise power without regard to the law. Trump—who almost certainly has not read Schmitt himself—asserted this view on August 26: “I have the right to do anything I want to do. I’m the president of the United States. If I think our country’s in danger—and it is in danger in the cities—I can do it.”

Although the Republicans have control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, meaning Trump should be able to get his agenda passed according to the normal constitutional order, since taking office he has operated under emergency powers. On August 22, Karen Yourish and Charlie Smart noted in the New York Times that since he took office, Trump has declared nine national emergencies and one “crime emergency” in Washington, D.C. The journalists report that since 1981, presidents have declared on average about seven national emergencies per four-year term. Trump declared that many in his first month back in office, although experts say no such emergencies exist.

Under normal constitutional provisions and laws, Trump’s actions would have required congressional approval or long regulatory review, the journalists note. Instead, he has enacted sweeping immigration measures, deregulated energy, launched a tariff war that is crushing the U.S. economy, and now put troops in U.S. cities, all on his own hook.

Even when Trump didn’t announce a new emergency, he has cited crises to justify new extreme actions, as when he (or someone; he told reporters he did not sign the order) invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to justify rendering undocumented Venezuelan immigrants to the notorious terrorist prison CECOT in El Salvador and when he justified the cuts billionaire Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” made to congressionally-approved funding because such cuts addressed “waste, fraud, and abuse.”

Although the administration continues to insist voters wanted what Trump is doing, his poor job approval rating and the popular dislike of his policies across the board say the opposite. Perhaps more to the point was this weekend’s social media post from J.D. Vance, who pushed back on widespread concern that the administration’s strike against a boat in international waters last week was illegal. The administration claims that the 11 men in the boat were gang members smuggling drugs, but even if it offered evidence for such an assertion, which it has not done, the U.S. cannot legally kill civilians of a nation with whom we are not at war.

This weekend, Vance posted on social media: “Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.” Political commentator Brian Krassenstein replied: “Killing the citizens of another nation who are civilians without any due process is called a war crime.” Vance replied: “I don’t give a sh*t what you call it.”

The federal courts are working overtime to hold the administration to the rule of law. As Jay Kuo noted on September 3 in The Status Kuo, just last week saw courts invalidating most of Trump’s tariffs, stopping the administration from deporting unaccompanied children to Guatemala, and declaring his cuts to Harvard University’s funding, his use of troops in Los Angeles, and his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act illegal. Today an appeals court upheld the $83.3 million judgement a jury rendered last year against Trump in a defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll.

But the Supreme Court has been overruling lower court decisions, deciding in favor of Trump’s expansion of power. Today it allowed Trump to ignore the decision of a lower court that he could not fire the last remaining Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, Rebecca Slaughter, while her case was in the courts. Since 1935, the court had said the president does not have the power to fire members of independent agencies created by Congress.

It also said today that the administration can use racial profiling, including personal appearance, language, or type of employment, to stop people in order to check their immigration status, even though that will necessarily mean that U.S. citizens and legal residents will be swept up. Essentially, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, Latino Americans must now keep papers on them at all times to prove they are citizens or they can find themselves incarcerated.

The court decided these cases without hearings, briefs, or a written decision, under what is called the “shadow docket.” Traditionally, such unsigned, unexplained decisions are used for emergencies either to keep the status quo or to resolve a procedural issue, but under Trump the court’s use of them has exploded. The court, three of whose justices Trump appointed, has sided with him in shadow docket decisions more than 70% of the time.

On September 4, Lawrence Hurley of NBC News noted that this new practice of overturning lower court rulings with no explanation is undermining faith in the judiciary. It supports the administration’s narrative that the courts are trying to subvert Trump’s presidency. As the administration has attacked the courts, violent threats against judges have dramatically increased. Hurley notes that the lower courts painstakingly research the law to reach a decision, then administration officials criticize any that doesn’t support their actions, Then Trump appeals to the Supreme Court, which rejects the judges’ decisions with little or no explanation.

Under the control of Republicans, Congress has also declined to assert its constitutional power. Yesterday, Julian E. Barnes and Catie Edmondson of the New York Times reported how Republican leaders have accepted the administration’s unilateral cuts to programs Congress approved, launches of military strikes without informing Congress, and, last week, the Pentagon’s cancellation of a classified visit to the Virginia headquarters of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency by Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Far-right activist Laura Loomer had complained about the visit. The administration has already limited congressional oversight of immigrant detention centers; now the Pentagon says it is also imposing new limits to congressional oversight of intelligence facilities.

“Is congressional oversight dead?” Senator Warner asked. “Where does this end? If none of my Republican colleagues raises an issue, does this mean we are ceding all oversight?”

The administration appears to be in a rush to replace democracy with a dictatorship before the whole administration collapses. On Saturday, Elliott Morris of Strength in Numbers reported that 46% of Americans—almost half of them—“strongly disapprove” of the job Trump is doing as president while only 24% “strongly approve, a 22% enthusiasm gap.

That gap seems likely to grow. Tonight the Wall Street Journal published the 2003 birthday letter to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump’s signature whose existence the paper revealed in July. The image in the article by Khadeeja Safdar and Joe Palazzolo was even worse than earlier reports of it: the image drawn over the words is not the outline of a woman, but of a girl. The text reads, in part, “Voice Over: There must be more to life than having everything. Donald: Yes there is, but I won’t tell you what it is.” Those words from “Donald” are outlined with pubescent breasts.

The words continue: “Jeffrey: Nor will I, since I also know what it is.

Donald: We have certain things in common, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey: Yes we do, come to think of it.

Donald: Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?

Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.

Donald: A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday—and may every day be another wonderful secret.”

The signature, “Donald,” mimics human anatomy.

After the Wall Street Journal revealed the existence of the letter in July, Trump sued the reporters, the publisher, and the Journal’s parent company for ten billion dollars, saying the letter was “nonexistent.”

Today’s story also reported on another letter from the book that included a giant check made out for $22,500, mocked up to look like Trump wrote it to Epstein. A handwritten caption below it says: “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells ‘fully depreciated’ [redacted] to Donald Trump for $22,500. Showed early ‘people skills’ too. Even though I handled the deal I didn’t get any of the money or the girl!”

DHS said the ICE effort is called “Operation Midway Blitz"" and blamed so-called sanctuary policies in Chicago and Illinois. The DHS announcement didn’t mention using the National Guard, which President Donald Trump has publicly talked about.

Trump has been talking for weeks about possibly ordering federal authorities to Chicago, an effort he has said is intended to fight crime.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both Democrats, as well as others, have criticized any such move, calling it unnecessary.

""Chicago doesn’t want to see reckless, unconstitutional, militarized immigration enforcement in our city,"" Johnson said Monday on X.

Pritzker said last week that the expected immigration operation was planned to be announced this month, when Mexican Independence Day celebrations are held every year in the city, which has a large population of residents with Mexican origin.

""Let’s be clear: The terror and cruelty is the point, not the safety of anyone living here,"" Pritzker said at a news conference last week.

Trump campaigned on deporting large numbers of people in the country illegally and has sought to use government funding to punish cities with ""sanctuary"" policies, in which local police limit their cooperation with immigration authorities.

Proponents of the policies argue that immigration is a federal matter and that local police can't retain the trust of victims and witnesses to crimes while being perceived as immigration agents.

DHS cited sanctuary policies in its announcement about the Chicago ICE operation.

""This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,"" it said.

It said the operation was named after Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old Illinois woman who, along with a friend, was killed January in a suspected DUI crash in Urbana that was alleged to have been caused by a Guatemalan man in the country illegally.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., objected on the Senate floor Monday to Trump's remarks about Chicago, crime and the National Guard. Trump had threatened deportations Saturday on Truth Social, posting an image of himself as a figure in the film ""Apocalypse Now"" but with Chicago as a backdrop instead of Vietnam. ""Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,"" the post was captioned.

""President Trump attempted to walk back his comments yesterday, but let’s be clear: The president of the United States essentially declared war on an American city, a city I’m honored to represent,"" Durbin said.

Durbin accused Trump of targeting Chicago for ""political theater"" and said Trump ""finds objections to crime in communities that are governed by Democrats but not Republicans.”

Immigration agencies targeted Los Angeles in a crackdown that began in early June, a little more than four months after Trump was sworn in for a second term.

There were protests in Los Angeles over the immigration raids, with some violence and looting of stores downtown. The Trump administration responded by deploying the National Guard and some active-duty Marines despite the opposition of Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Bass and Newsom, both Democrats, called the administration's crackdown and use of troops a political stunt intended to terrorize residents.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250908-chicago-ICE-shield-badge-ac-1025p-7de36a.jpg",N,,2025-09-09 01:56:27.502943

Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles and elsewhere have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.
The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 declined to lift Frimpong's order.","The US Supreme Court again backed President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration approach on Monday, letting agents proceed with Southern California raids targeting people for deportation based on their race or language in a ruling its liberal justices said makes Latinos ""fair game to be seized at any time.""

The court granted a Justice Department request to put on hold a judge's order that had barred agents from stopping or detaining people without ""reasonable suspicion"" that they are in the country illegally, by relying on race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent, among other factors.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the court's decision in harsh terms.

""Trump's hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the grand marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles,"" Newsom said in a statement, alluding to the fact that Trump appointed three of the six conservative justices serving on the nine-member court.

The court's brief and unsigned order, issued without any explanation, lifts the judge's restrictions while a legal challenge brought by a group of Latino people caught up in the raids plays out.

Trump's administration quickly vowed to continue ""roving patrols."" The Republican president returned to office in January promising to escalate deportations, and immigration raids by masked and armed federal agents triggered street protests in Los Angeles that led him to send military troops in June into the largest city in the most-populous US state.

The administration ""has all but declared that all Latinos, US citizens or not, who work low-wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents' satisfaction,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in 2009 became the court's first Hispanic member, wrote in a dissent joined by the court's other two liberals.

""Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,"" Sotomayor added.

Los Angeles-based US District Judge Maame Frimpong found on July 11 that the Trump administration's actions likely violated the US Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The judge's order applied in an area covering much of Southern California.

""This isn't about enforcing immigration laws -- it's about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn't look or sound like Stephen Miller's idea of an American, including US citizens and children, to deliberately harm California's families and small businesses,"" Newsom said, referring to Trump's senior aide.

""Trump's private police force now has a green light to come after your family -- and every person is now a target -- but we will continue fighting these abhorrent attacks on Californians,"" Newsom added.

Miller, the architect of Trump's immigration crackdown, in May demanded that the leaders of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ramp up deportations, setting a goal of 3,000 daily arrests.

Trump-appointed US Attorney General Pam Bondi called Monday's decision a ""massive victory,"" writing on social media that immigration enforcement officers now can ""continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement."" The plaintiffs, including some who are US citizens, filed the proposed class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court in July.

""Individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from,"" the lawsuit stated.

Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California who helps represent the plaintiffs, vowed to continue to fight the administration's ""racist deportation scheme.""

""This decision is a devastating setback for our plaintiffs and communities who, for months, have been subjected to immigration stops because of the color of their skin, occupation, or the language they speak,"" Tajsar said.

Concurring with Monday's decision, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that ""apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion"" but it can be a ""'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors.""

Kavanaugh added, ""If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a US citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go."" Trump's administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court this year to allow it to proceed with policies that lower courts have impeded after casting doubt on their legality.

The court has backed Trump in most of these cases. For instance, it has allowed Trump to deport migrants to countries other than their own without offering a chance to show harms they may face and to revoke temporary legal status previously granted by the government on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Trump's immigration raids in Los Angeles and elsewhere have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.

Trump's decision to send National Guard troops and US Marines into Los Angeles in response to the protests represented an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations. Newsom and local officials contested the deployment as unlawful and unnecessary.

Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order halting stops or arrests based on race, language, presence at a particular location such as a car wash or tow yard, or type of work to establish ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegality. The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 declined to lift Frimpong's order.

""I know that there are a lot of folks that come to understand that while the government has a job to do, there should be some places that people need to come that should be free from government interference and intervention,"" Paul Erickson said.

Erickson leads the Greater Milwaukee Synod, part of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The synod has almost 60,000 members across the state, with five of its churches offering services in Spanish.

Erickson said he sees the most impact at Spanish-speaking congregations, claiming a dramatic drop in attendance at both worship services and social programs.

The president's supporters feel differently about the policy change.

""These safe zones should be safe for American citizens, not safe for people who have broken the law and are here illegally,"" Hilario Deleon said.

Deleon serves as Milwaukee County's GOP chairperson. He's confident deportations will continue, regardless of pushback from religious organizations.

Erickson hopes the lawsuit will prevail, ending what he describes as fear in his community.

“President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem have a clear message: No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens.
Bruce Rauner, Illinois law enforcement cannot cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents unless they have a detainment warrant issued by a judge.
The Trump administration has been previously rebuffed in challenges to the state’s sanctuary policy, with the courts noting that immigration enforcement is the purview of the federal government.
Speakers said there were other ways to improve Chicago than sending in federal agents, including federal spending on health care and education.","President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security announced Monday it is beginning a surge of immigration law enforcement in Chicago, dubbing it “Operation Midway Blitz” and claiming it will target “criminal illegal aliens” who have taken advantage of the city and state’s sanctuary policies.

The announcement comes more than two weeks after the Republican president began to say he was planning to target Chicago over crime, causing Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson to caution residents to prepare for potential immigration sweeps.

“For years, Governor (JB) Pritzker and his fellow sanctuary politicians released Tren de Aragua gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers on Chicago’s streets — putting American lives at risk and making Chicago a magnet for criminals,” said Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary. “President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem have a clear message: No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

Pritzker, the state’s two-term Democratic governor and vociferous critic of the Republican president, took to the social platform X to contend the ICE surge “isn’t about fighting crime.”

“That requires support and coordination — yet we’ve experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,” he wrote. “Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump administration’s focused on scaring Illinoisans.”

Johnson also said the city had “no notice of any enhanced immigration action.”

The Homeland Security statement marks the first official word from the Trump administration about increased immigration enforcement after weeks of Trump vacillating between vows of “going in” to Chicago with the potential deployment of National Guard troops to fight overall crime, to a stepped-up immigration enforcement role by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. ICE has secured an office at Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago to serve as an operations hub for its activities.

There was no word on how long the ICE operation would last, and there was also no mention of whether Trump would deploy the National Guard to play a supporting role.

“We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,” Johnson said in a statement.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth said the ramped-up ICE activity was a waste of federal law enforcement resources, and she warned Trump was looking to “provoke a response to his un-American actions, hoping for images of chaos and violence to validate his lie that Chicago is an apocalyptic city in crisis and justify sending in the military to intimidate Americans.”

Despite the “blitz” announcement, it remained unclear Monday how extensive the actions were in the early going. Local officials and immigrant activists cited only a handful of arrests.

Advocates said they had confirmed ICE presence on the Southwest Side and at least three detentions of “community members in a stretch along Archer Avenue,” said Rey Wences, senior director of deportation defense at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

“We believe this operation signaled the beginning of ICE(‘s) full escalation in Chicago and Illinois,” Wences said, noting it came after “many other raids.”

“This has been happening, and it has been starting to get normalized in many of the places in the state and across the city, but this is not normal,” Wences said.

Although the Trump administration portrayed its actions as targeted toward arresting only immigrants who are criminals, studies have also shown that ICE has arrested thousands of Latinos with no criminal history in random locations across the nation.

Under Illinois’ sanctuary state policies, enacted by Pritzker’s Republican predecessor, one-term Gov. Bruce Rauner, Illinois law enforcement cannot cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents unless they have a detainment warrant issued by a judge. ICE routinely uses an administrative detainment warrant that it issues on its own.

The Trump administration has been previously rebuffed in challenges to the state’s sanctuary policy, with the courts noting that immigration enforcement is the purview of the federal government.

Trump set the stage for the operation with a social media post Saturday morning depicting military helicopters flying over the city’s lakefront skyline using the title “Chipocalypse Now.”

“I love the smell of deportations in the morning … ” Trump posted on his Truth Social account, altering the famous phrase from the 1979 movie “Apocalypse Now,” about the smell of “Napalm.” In the post, Trump was depicted in U.S. Army fatigues and sunglasses and wearing a Stetson U.S. Cavalry hat like the lieutenant colonel portrayed in the movie by actor Robert Duvall.

“Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” Trump wrote, a day after signing an executive order to rename the Department of Defense to its pre-1949 title.

Hours before the DHS announcement, Trump on Monday morning once again urged Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential aspirant, to call the White House for federal help to request National Guard assistance with city crime. The governor has repeatedly vowed he will not make such a request because it is not necessary, adding that Trump is trying to normalize the sight of military on city streets as part of the president’s moves toward authoritarian rule from the White House.

On his Truth Social platform, Trump cited six shooting deaths recorded in the city over the weekend, as well as other murders in recent weeks, as he criticized Pritzker and Johnson for inaction.

Just days after his “Chipocalypse Now” post, which he backed off a day later by saying it wasn’t directed at the city but at criminals, Trump sought to cajole Chicago residents into supporting a federal intervention.

“Governor Pritzker just stated that he doesn’t want Federal Government HELP! WHY??? What is wrong with this guy, and the 5% in Polls Mayor. I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them. Only the Criminals will be hurt!” Trump wrote on Monday morning.

“We can move fast and stop this madness. The City and State have not been able to do the job. People of Illinois should band together and DEMAND PROTECTION. IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!! ACT NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!” he wrote. “Thank you for your attention to this matter. President DJT.”

Later, speaking at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., he told the audience, “We’re waiting for a call from Chicago. We’ll fix Chicago,” as he cited reduced crime in the District of Columbia after he federalized law enforcement there, something he cannot do in the individual states.

“We could do the same thing in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles,” Trump said.

“I don’t know why Chicago isn’t calling us, saying, please give us help when you have, over just a short period of time, 50 murders and hundreds of people shot, and then you have a governor that stands up and says how crime is just fine,” Trump said, before explaining one major political reason for continuing the rhetoric.

“It’s really crazy,” the Republican president said of Democrats, “but we’re bringing back law and order to our country.”

But faith leaders and immigration advocates in Chicago continued to push back against Trump’s narrative that Chicago is crime-ridden and rallied in support of a handful of individuals believed to have been detained by federal agents on Sunday.

Wences described the detentions as “abductions,” and said they were “seemingly random, with agents profiling and approaching them on the street.”

Among those was a street vendor selling flowers on a busy intersection in the Archer Heights neighborhood. He was arrested by three men wearing vests that read “Police Federal Agent.” They were in two vehicles, including a dark Subaru with a Missouri license plate. ICE had not confirmed the arrest as of Monday evening.

Gissele Garcia, 26, pulled over her car as she was driving home from the grocery store when she saw the commotion in the parking lot of a Honda City car dealership on South Archer Avenue and South Pulaski Road. The West Lawn resident approached with her phone up, filming the encounter. She tried getting the street vendor’s name and asked him if he had any family she could call.

Speaking in Spanish, the man said he didn’t know his relatives’ phone numbers.

“It seemed — I don’t know how to put this — like he had given up,” she told the Tribune Sunday.

By Monday morning, around 50 people shouted “faith over fear,” in Daley Plaza in response to the escalating threat. The event was led by leaders of the Inner City Muslim Action Network (IMAN), LIVE FREE Illinois and New Life Centers.

Speakers said there were other ways to improve Chicago than sending in federal agents, including federal spending on health care and education.

“This is not America,” said rally attendee Donald Nye, 68 of Downers Grove. “This is not what my grandson is gonna grow up in. I got a 4-year-old grandson and I’m not gonna allow him to grow up with this. I mean, this is not the way I grew (up).”

Los Angeles’ mayor and leaders from several immigrant rights groups on Monday denounced the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to allow federal immigration agents to racially profile people in Southern California, calling it a blow to civil rights.

“The Supreme Court ... has now given the green light for law enforcement to profile and detain Angelenos based on their race,” Mayor Karen Bass told reporters outside the Home Depot in the Westlake district.

“We will not stand for this type of discrimination and racism.”

The high court granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to lift a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong that barred government agents from engaging in “roving patrols” and detaining people based on their appearance.

The court said federal immigration officers can briefly detain and interrogate people about whether they are in the U.S. legally, relying on a “totality of circumstances” standard for reasonable suspicion.

The justices voted, 6-3, in favor of letting the immigration operations continue as they did in early summer.

Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, called Monday a sad day. He’s one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case.

“Today is a loss for people’s dignity, for people’s rights, for people’s security and safety,” he said.

But the decision to stay Frimpong’s order is not the final word on the matter.

The Supreme Court ruling focused solely on the temporary restraining order. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to rule on a request from immigrant rights groups for a preliminary injunction to bar federal agents from racially profiling people.

A hearing on that matter is scheduled for later this month.

About the lawsuit

Starting in early June, immigration agents in masks and unmarked cars have conducted dozens of sweeps at car washes, day laborer centers, farms and elsewhere as part of President Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations.

The raids have instilled widespread fear in immigrant communities, with some people too afraid to go to work or even leave their homes.

In July, the ACLU of Southern California, Public Counsel and other groups sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security alleging the sweeps violated the U.S. Constitution. They were seeking a halt to the raids.

In the lawsuit, the immigrant rights groups claimed “individuals with brown skin” were being stopped randomly by federal agents in violation of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.

“These are warrantless, lawless and aggressive, often violent actions against a whole people simply because of the color of our skin, the language we speak, where we work, where we live,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, at the Monday news conference.

“No local police officer would be allowed to get away with what these officers are getting away with,” she added.

Armando Gudino, executive director of the L.A. Worker Center Network, said the Supreme Court showed bias in its decision.

“By siding with the Trump administration, this court majority has revealed itself as highly prejudicial and has further empowered authoritarianism in this country,” he said.

What the justices said

In a written opinion, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh offered his reasoning for the lifting of restrictions on immigration agents and the circumstances they face.

According to Kavanaugh, those circumstances include:

That there is an extremely high number and percentage of undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area.

That those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work.

That those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to people without authorization to work.

That many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.

“To be clear,” he continued, “ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered with other salient factors.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

Activists call the decision ‘shameful’

Many of the activists who spoke at the news conference said the decision by the Supreme Court was “shameful” but not surprising.

“We cannot depend on our legal system,” said Flor Melendrez, executive director of the CLEAN Car Wash Worker Center. She said 81 car washes have been raided since early June and 247 workers have been detained.

Melendrez urged people to do more to support undocumented workers.

“It is not enough to do a video and post it on social media,” she said. “It is also important to collaborate and to bring resources to those on the front lines.”

Pablo Alvarado of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network called the decision “repulsive, violent and abhorrent.”

“When you undermine the civil rights of those who are most vulnerable, you undermine the civil rights of everyone else,” he said.

The effort, known as “Operation Midway Blitz,” will target undocumented people both in Chicago and the state of Illinois, according to a press release issued Monday by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE.

A new round of targeted immigration enforcement operations has been expected for weeks, with federal agents — who are staying at the Great Lakes naval base north of the city — likely to focus on making immigration arrests and conducting raids in and around Chicago for more than a month.

Trump has also said he is considering sending the National Guard to the city, though it is unclear if and when that might happen.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the Homeland Security press release said.

Illinois, Cook County and Chicago all have so-called “sanctuary” laws in place that bar law enforcement from assisting or coordinating with federal immigration enforcement operations. Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have stressed that officers do turn over offenders to ICE if they have a criminal warrant.

The operation announcement Monday comes as immigration agents detained three people on the Southwest Side over the weekend, according to an alderperson and local community group. The arrests, and reports of immigration agents on the Southwest Side, signaled the start of the operation to neighbors and immigrant activists, they said Monday.

“This has been happening, but what we’re seeing today is an escalation,” said Rey Wences, senior director of deportation defense for the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Among those arrested Sunday were a “flower vendor known to all of us,” who was detained while working, Ald. Jeylú Gutiérrez (14th) said at a press conference Monday afternoon. Organizers said they’re continuing to receive a large volume of calls and are responding to reports of arrests.

“Others were detained while waiting for the bus or simply walking in the sidewalk,” Gutiérrez said. “These was never about arresting the worst of the worst. It’s been about terrorizing our communities. But we will not be intimidated.”

ICE agents were also seen Monday in the Cook County Courthouse complex, 2600 S. California Ave. An ICE van was parked outside the courthouse to gather b-roll for a Fox News ride-along, a spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed to Block Club.

The Homeland Security press release shared few details about the scope of the immigration enforcement operation aimed at the Chicago area. It did list about a dozen people it said were the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” who had gone free due to “sanctuary” policies from government agencies including the Cook County Jail.

“President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem have a clear message: no city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens. If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in the release.

A Cook County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson said it follows state and local law when it comes to turning individuals over to immigration enforcement.

“The Sheriff’s Office has always honored and will continue to honor criminal arrest warrants signed by a judge that authorize federal immigration authorities to take custody of individuals held at the Cook County Jail,” the statement reads. “State law prohibits us from honoring administrative detainers and other non-enforceable documents.”

The city received no notice of the immigration operation that is now underway, Johnson said in a statement.

“We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,’ the mayor said in the statement. “Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.”

Police Supt. Larry Snelling told reporters last month that his officers would continue to abide by the Welcoming City ordinance, a sanctuary policy prohibiting local law enforcement from aiding federal immigration enforcement operations.

“If we know that it’s only immigration enforcement going on, our officers will not be in those areas assisting in any way when it comes to immigration enforcement,” Snelling said at the Aug. 28 briefing. “So we do not assist, but at the same time, I want to be clear, we also do not engage in a way where we’re obstructing federal agents. We do not interfere with the work that they’re doing, but we will not engage in immigration enforcement.”

Federal agents could target Mexican Independence Day celebrations in mid-September, Pritzker said at a press conference on Tuesday. El Grito, a popular festival celebrating the holiday set for this weekend, was subsequently postponed.

“Know your rights, film things that you see happening in your neighborhoods and your streets and share them with the news media. Authoritarians thrive on your silence. Be loud for America. … I refuse to pretend that any of this is normal,” Pritzker said.

Organizers urged neighbors to record and report ICE arrests, so advocates can denounce if agents make unlawful arrests. Information about resources for undocumented Chicagoans and all neighbors can be found here.

“Chicago will not be terrorized to fear. We stand united, especially here in the southwest side,” state Rep. Aaron Ortiz said at Monday’s press conference on the Southwest Side.

ICE’s plans for Chicago have unfolded in concert with Trump openly discussing sending National Guard troops and federal agents to Chicago to fight what his administration has called a rise in violent crime that has not been borne out in local and federal law enforcement data.

Over the weekend, Trump inflamed his threats of federal deployment to Chicago when he posted to social media an AI-generated image that referenced the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now” and said “Chicago about find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The post coincided with the rebranding of the Defense Department to the Department of War.

The president, however, appeared to walk back those comments on Sunday, calling it “fake news” despite his direct references to war in Chicago in his social media post.

“We’re not going to war, we’re going to clean up our cities. We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend. That’s not war. That’s common sense,” Trump told reporters.

The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for President Donald Trump's administration at the high court.

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The court's 6-3 decision followed a pattern of at least temporarily allowing some of the Republican administration's harshest policies, while leaving room for the possibility of a different outcome after the legal case plays out fully. The net effect, meanwhile, has Trump pushing ahead in many of the areas he considers most critical.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court's emergency docket.

""The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,"" he wrote in a concurrence.

Dissent says constitutional freedoms threatened

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,"" she wrote. ""Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.""

Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges.

The Supreme Court’s decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington as part of Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California, with a hearing set for Sept. 24. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that ICE agents can use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop.

More than 5,000 arrests made

The Department of Homeland Security said last week that authorities had made 5,210 immigration arrests since June 6 and praised the work of its lead commander there, Gregory Bovino, whose “success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.”

The agency promised in an online post to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles” after the high court's decision.

The region has been top priority for the Trump administration, and its hard-line immigration strategy has spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines.

The number of raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store as the administration carries out the president’s goal of mass deportations.

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated the Supreme Court decision as a “massive victory” in a social media post. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” she wrote.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It had covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

‘I was born here in the States’

The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops that do not align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Supreme Court decision will fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities. “The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents and pressed against a metal fence with his arm twisted behind his back as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta said he found Kavanaugh’s rationale for lifting the stay “disturbing.” He pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can’t be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,” Bonta said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom issued the following statement in response to the Supreme Court ruling:

""Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the Grand Marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles. This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws — it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses. Trump's private police force now has a green light to come after your family — and every person is now a target — but we will continue fighting these abhorrent attacks on Californians.""

Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant.

“I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?"" he said in a statement. “That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

Now, the Supreme Court says that's okay?
Trump's administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court this year to allow it to proceed with policies that lower courts have impeded after casting doubt on their legality.
His administration's immigration raids, including in Los Angeles, have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.
Trump sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles in June in response to protests against the federal immigration raids, marking an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations.","The U.S. Supreme Court again backed President Donald Trump's hardline immigration approach on Monday, letting agents proceed with Southern California raids targeting people for deportation based on their race or language in a decision that a dissenting justice said makes Latinos ""fair game to be seized at any time.""

The court granted a Justice Department request to put on hold a judge's order temporarily barring agents from stopping or detaining people without ""reasonable suspicion"" that they are in the country illegally, by relying on race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent, among other factors. The administration quickly vowed to continue ""roving patrols.""

The Supreme Court's three liberal justices publicly dissented, directing pointed criticism at its conservative majority.

The administration ""has all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low-wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents' satisfaction,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote in the dissenting opinion.

""Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,"" Sotomayor added.

Los Angeles-based U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong found on July 11 that the Trump administration's actions likely violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The judge's order applied to her court's jurisdiction covering much of Southern California.

The Supreme Court's order was brief and issued without any explanation, a common way it handles emergency matters, but one that has generated confusion in lower courts and criticism from some of the justices themselves. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.

Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called Monday's decision a ""massive victory,"" writing on social media that immigration enforcement officers now can ""continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement.""

A lawsuit challenging the raids accused the administration of using roving patrols by masked and heavily armed agents who have conducted interrogations and detentions based on racial profiling that resemble ""brazen, midday kidnappings.""

""Individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from,"" the lawsuit stated.

A group of Latino people caught up in the raids, including some who are U.S. citizens, filed the proposed class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court in July.

'RACISM WITH A BADGE'

Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California who helps represent the plaintiffs, vowed to continue to fight the administration's ""racist deportation scheme.""

""This decision is a devastating setback for our plaintiffs and communities who, for months, have been subjected to immigration stops because of the color of their skin, occupation, or the language they speak,"" Tajsar said.

One plaintiff, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, said in a statement that he joined the case because ""what happened to me is happening to others everyday just for being brown, speaking Spanish, or standing on a corner looking for work.""

He said that agents did not explain why they grabbed him, and that they did not have a warrant.

""I was treated like I didn't matter - locked up, cold, hungry and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that's okay? That's not justice. That's racism with a badge,"" he said.

Concurring with Monday's decision, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that ""apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion"" but it can be a ""'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors.""

Kavanaugh added: ""If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.""

Trump's administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court this year to allow it to proceed with policies that lower courts have impeded after casting doubt on their legality.

The court has backed Trump in most of these cases. For instance, it has allowed Trump to deport migrants to countries other than their own without offering a chance to show harms they may face and to revoke temporary legal status previously granted by the government on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.

PROMISES OF DEPORTATIONS

Trump won election last year to a second term as president with promises of record-level deportations. His administration's immigration raids, including in Los Angeles, have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.

Trump sent National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles in June in response to protests against the federal immigration raids, marking an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations.

Local officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, contested the deployment as unlawful and unnecessary.

Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order halting stops or arrests based on race, language, presence at a particular location such as a car wash or tow yard, or type of work to establish ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegality. The judge was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 refused to lift Frimpong's order.

At the time, the Biden Administration was refusing to enforce federal immigration law and failing to secure the southern border, resulting in millions of criminal illegals invading the country.
“I called on the legislature to act because the Biden Administration was refusing to secure the border and enforce the law,” Drummond said.
“Those complements to federal law are no conflict or obstacle to federal immigration law.
Drummond has argued that federal lawbreakers cannot claim legal standing to challenge a state law that mirrors federal immigration statutes.","OKLAHOMA CITY (Sept. 8, 2025) – The Department of Justice (DOJ) and 22 state attorneys general have filed separate briefs with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in support of Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s fight to enforce the immigration enforcement law he first requested in March of 2024.

A preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Bernard Jones currently blocks enforcement of the law. The Biden Administration initially sued over the law, but the Trump Administration dropped the government’s lawsuit. The case is now Padres Unidos de Tulsa v. Drummond.

Drummond called on legislative leaders in March of 2024 to pass a law that would make illegal immigration a state crime, mirroring federal law so Drummond’s agents and law enforcement across Oklahoma could make arrests and prosecute illegal immigrants. At the time, the Biden Administration was refusing to enforce federal immigration law and failing to secure the southern border, resulting in millions of criminal illegals invading the country. Drummond encountered hundreds of these criminals as he cracked down on illegal marijuana grow operations run by Mexican drug cartels and Chinese crime syndicates.

“I called on the legislature to act because the Biden Administration was refusing to secure the border and enforce the law,” Drummond said. “We still suffer the consequences today. We deserve the right to protect ourselves from criminal illegal immigrants when the federal government refuses.”

The response to Drummond’s call to action was House Bill 4156. Drummond’s request was deemed so important that the bill was authored by the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, ensuring its passage. The Governor signed the bill on April 30, 2024.

Drummond has been battling in federal court to enforce the law ever since. Now he is supported by President Trump’s DOJ and 22 of his fellow state attorneys general. In separate briefs filed Friday, the DOJ and state attorneys general ask the court to vacate the injunction blocking House Bill 4156.

“Oklahoma enacted House Bill 4156 into law last year, seeking to do its part to redress the crisis of illegal immigration that was brought upon the United States during the prior administration,” reads the DOJ brief. “House Bill 4156 thus complements existing federal immigration law by punishing those within, or that come within, Oklahoma’s regulatory reach who previously entered or reentered the country in violation of U.S. immigration law.”

The brief filed by Drummond’s fellow state attorneys general was authored by Iowa and notes many states have followed suit in passing their own laws to address illegal immigration within their borders.

“Many States have enacted state crimes of illegal reentry,” reads the Iowa brief. “Those complements to federal law are no conflict or obstacle to federal immigration law. Instead, they help States support federal immigration enforcement goals. Just as many States also criminalize possession of scheduled drugs that the federal government has labeled criminal, so too do States now criminalize a limited set of immigration offenses that the federal government has already labeled criminal.”

Drummond said he is thankful for the support and expects the case to ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.

“I appreciate the strong support of President Trump’s Department of Justice and that of my fellow attorneys general from across the country,” Drummond said. “Every Oklahoman should be proud to know that not only is President Trump securing the border and deporting illegal immigrants, he also is supporting our right to enforce appropriate state laws against illegal immigration. This approach aligns with federal law, and it is crucial in my fight to continue shutting down the massive number of illegal marijuana grows run by Mexican drug cartels and Chinese foreign nationals. I’m hopeful the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals will rule in our favor.”

Drummond filed a comprehensive response opposing the injunction earlier this year after advocacy groups led by Padres Unidos De Tulsa sought to halt the law while their legal challenge proceeds. The plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with their legal challenge despite two of the individuals remaining anonymous because to reveal their identities would ""expos(e) them to federal authorities"" for federal lawbreaking, according to the court.

Drummond has argued that federal lawbreakers cannot claim legal standing to challenge a state law that mirrors federal immigration statutes. He contends that granting relief to the plaintiffs would ""plainly subvert federal criminal law in the name of upholding it.""

Drummond’s legal battle to enforce Oklahoma’s law is playing out at the same time the State of Texas is arguing before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to enforce a similar law. Drummond said in his initial call for action, “The Supreme Court may well be poised to set new precedent allowing state law enforcement to act.” He and other legal experts believe the question of whether states may enforce laws designed to complement federal immigration law is likely to be decided by the High Court.",https://oklahoma.gov/content/dam/ok/en/oag/news-documents/2025/september/september-tiles/09-08-25%20OK%20Immigration%20Law.png,N,,2025-09-08 23:57:11.772791

Now, the supreme court says that’s okay?","Federal agents can resume sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles after the US supreme court lifted an order barring the Donald Trump administration from stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.

The court ruled in favor of Trump’s administration, granting a stay against a restraining order from another judge that found “roving patrols” of immigration agents were conducting indiscriminate arrests in LA. The ruling from the conservative majority is a win for the administration in its ongoing effort to enact mass deportations.

US district judge Maame E Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the constitution. The plaintiffs, who said the administration’s approach amounted to “blatant racial profiling”, included US citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

But the Trump administration argued the order wrongly restricted agents carrying out its widespread crackdown on illegal immigration.

The supreme court’s 6-3 decision comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the national guard. Meanwhile, Chicago is readying itself for an immigration operation expected this week and the possible deployment of the national guard following weeks of threats.

Gavin Newsom, the California governor, condemned the decision, writing that the administration is targeting Latinos and that “Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family.”

The ACLU of southern California called it a “devastating setback”.

“In running to the Supreme Court to request this stay, the government made clear that its enforcement operation in Southern California is driven by race,” Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, said in a statement. “We will continue fighting the administration’s racist deportation scheme to ensure every person living in Southern California—regardless of race or status—is safe.”

The Trump administration celebrated the ruling with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, describing it as a “massive victory”.

“Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” she said.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by the ACLU and immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during a crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

The Trump administration has made California a center of its deportation campaign, sending federal agents near schools and workplaces and Home Depot stores. The large show of federal agents – along with the deployment of the military – has left southern California communities in fear.

In its order granting the stay, the court majority wrote that the government sometimes makes stops to check the immigration status of people who work jobs in landscaping or construction, among others “that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English”.

“Immigration stops based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence have been an important component of US immigration enforcement for decades, across several presidential administrations,” the decision states.

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote: “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor. Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

Department of Homeland Security attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the US, not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the justice department argued that the order wrongly restricted the factors that Ice agents can use when deciding who to stop.

The Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hardline immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the national guard and the marines. The number of immigration raids in the Los Angeles area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store.

The supreme court decision was condemned by LA mayor Karen Bass, who said it “isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country.

“I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous – it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.”

The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion, something that aligns with the constitution and supreme court precedent.

“Numerous US citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.”

The Trump administration said the order is too restrictive, “threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop”.

D John Sauer, the solicitor general, also argued the order can’t stand under the high court’s recent decision restricting universal injunctions, though the plaintiffs disagreed.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It’s covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two US citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a 13 June video being seized by federal agents as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.

Agents arrested Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, a named plaintiff in the case, at a bus stop in June while he waited to be picked up for work.

“When Ice grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why. I was treated like I didn’t matter – locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the supreme court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge,” said Vasquez Perdomo said in a statement following the decision.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2af2d7db9bffea7467c5345dee206e2468d9735d/430_0_3290_2633/master/3290.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=795fcf0f1ad05d3146380ccc77661bc0",N,,2025-09-08 22:56:25.730117

Now, for a legal perspective on those new developments regarding President Trump's immigration agenda, we turn to William Banks, professor emeritus of law at Syracuse University.

Thank you for being with us.

And, as we have reported, the Supreme Court today lifted restrictions on immigration stops in the Los Angeles area, at least while this case plays out in the appeals court. Lower court rulings found evidence that the raids swept up people simply for looking Latino or for speaking Spanish, raising Fourth Amendment concerns.

How should we understand the court's ruling in light of that?

William Banks:

The most important thing to understand about what the Supreme Court has done today is that it's only temporary.

They paused the lower courts while a hearing on the merit can be held. So whether the ICE immigration stops are based on a proven or unproven assertion of focusing on ethnicity or race has to be determined finally after there's been evidence submitted on a record.

So all the Supreme Court did today is that they're allowing the government to go forward with their immigration enforcement methods as they propose them at least while the litigation is pending. This case is by far, far from any means over. There'll be arguments on the merits about the Fourth Amendment, about the due process clause and perhaps even about the First Amendment.

William Banks:

Justice Kavanaugh is the only justice to write a concurring opinion from among those in the majority today. It was 6-3.

And Justice Kavanaugh said that his view was that the potential for ethnicity or race to be a factor in the immigration enforcement was one factor among many. And if it's one factor among many that the government used to detain or stop or question an individual, that's not sufficient cause to enjoin or stop that aspect of the practice.

It's one among many. So, often in policing, members of the law enforcement may utilize various individual characteristics like race or ethnicity or gender or anything, lifestyle, physical appearance, to question briefly someone on the street, so long as it doesn't effectuate an arrest, that person's liberty has not been taken, and the inconvenience of a temporary stop or a temporary detention, said Justice Kavanaugh anyway, should not stand in the way of the government going about its mission.

William Banks:

The president has the authority to send in civilians into the state of Illinois or city of Chicago, those that are working for ICE or some other civilian agency in the U.S. government, but he doesn't likely have the authority to deploy the National Guard there.

The reason for that is a fundamental one in our system, that National Guard forces are in their default posture subject to command of the state governor, not the president of the United States. The president can only utilize the National Guard for a federal operation if the state governor agrees — and, in this case, as you point out, he has not — or if the president thinks that circumstances are truly extraordinary, he can invoke something called the Insurrection Act to federalize the incident altogether.

That would be a very extreme step, one that hasn't been taken in the United States since 1992 and that's been taken only a few times in our collective history.

William Banks:

Local officials, state officials have considerable leverage in this regard. There's a concept that is taught in constitutional law in law schools everywhere that holds that the federal government may not commandeer state resources into service of a federal program.

In other words, President Trump or any president is free to send federal resources to do a federal job, to fulfill a federal mission inside a state, but they can't compel the state to provide assistance, to provide personnel, to provide whatever other resources the federal government might need.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/Immigration2-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 21:58:18.017727

The decision stems from the case of Jonathan Javier Yajure Hurtado, a Venezuelan citizen who entered the United States in 2022. In 2024, he was granted Temporary Protected Status, which expired in April; he was subsequently arrested. At his bond hearing, the immigration judge ruled he did not have the authority to set bond, which meant Hurtado would stay in detention.

The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) agreed with the judge’s ruling. In its September 5 decision, the three-judge panel ruled that “[a]liens who are present in the United States without admission …. must be detained for the duration of their removal proceedings.”

Two of the judges were appointed during Trump’s first presidential term by then-Attorney General William Barr and one was appointed during his second term by Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Previously, people were generally eligible for bond hearings if they had been in the United States for at least two years.

“[J]ust as Immigration Judges have no authority to redetermine the custody of arriving aliens who present themselves at a port of entry, they likewise have no authority to redetermine the custody conditions of an alien who crossed the border unlawfully without inspection, even if that alien has avoided apprehension for more than 2 years,” the board wrote.

According to the board’s website, its “decisions are binding on all DHS officers and Immigration Judges unless modified or overruled by the Attorney General or a federal court.”

“Most BIA decisions are subject to judicial review in the federal courts,” the website states.

The Trump administration applauded the decision.

“Big win for our ICE attorneys securing our ability to detain illegal aliens until they are deported,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted on social media. “The One Big Beautiful Bill includes significant funding for new ICE lawyers.”

Advocates warn that the board’s decision will coerce people to “self-deport” even if they could ultimately win their case and stay in the United States. The Trump administration has waged an aggressive campaign to encourage people, including DACA recipients, to leave the United States. In social media posts and public statements, they have warned immigrants that if they stay, they may be detained in inhumane facilities like Alligator Alcatraz or Louisiana Lockup, a unit at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola.

Dana Leigh Marks, a former immigration judge and former head of the judges’ union, told Politico the board’s ruling was “horrific.”

“No self-respecting lawyer could look themselves in the mirror and take these positions,” she said. “It’s a total cynical move to try to force people to litigate their cases while they’re detained.”

The decision affirms a July 8 memo from the the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), that states, effective immediately, those who entered the country without prior authorization are “ineligible for a custody redetermination hearing (‘bond hearing’) before an immigration judge and may not be released for the duration of their removal proceedings absent a parole by DHS.”

The American Immigration Lawyers Association wrote that the new policy “would be facilitated by the $45 billion in new detention funding Congress enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill, which will enable ICE to double detention capacity to 100,000 beds.”

“If fully implemented, the new ICE policy would apply to millions of people who entered the country without inspection and, as a result, would mandate their detention,” the group continued. “ICE’s new policy is an unlawful attempt to strip noncitizens of their statutory right to a bond hearing and will subject millions of people to mandatory detention and possible fast-track deportation under expedited removal.”

Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network, told Truthout in a statement that the Board’s decision is “yet another example of how Trump is using immigration detention as a testing ground for authoritarianism.”

“Let’s be clear about what this decision means: millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. could be denied due process rights and can be detained indefinitely,” she said. “Detention facilitates deportation, and expanding detention is key to Trump carrying out his cruel, multi-layered, mass detention and deportation agenda.”

However, Shah noted, the “expansion of detention is not a done deal.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-8-ICE-protest-DOJ-building.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 21:57:55.200979

Since we have learned of the Trump Administration's plans to deploy federal agents and active-duty military to Illinois, Gov.","CHICAGO (WLS) -- Immigrant advocates say they have already received a large volume of calls to their hotline about Immigration and Customs Enforcement encounters in the Chicago area in recent days.

Some elected leaders worry that this just the start of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the area.

""It's obvious that operations have begun in Chicago, and it's even more obvious they're going to be targeting our communities here in the Southwest Side again. We're afraid. Our neighbors are afraid,"" said Any Huamani, who is on the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and is a Southwest Side Rapid Response team member.

Video provided to ABC7 shows federal agents wearing badges that say ""ICE"" handcuffing a man near Archer and Pulaski. Neighbors say that man is a flower vendor. Messages left for a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson about the encounter were not immediately returned.

This is just one of the encounters that Ald. Jeylu Gutierrez says took place in the 14th Ward over the weekend.

""We have confirmed in my ward... detained in my ward... there have been three people. One in 50th and Pulaski; he a was a street vendor selling flowers. The other, a couple of blocks down in Archer, was just standing on the sidewalk. The third one was waiting on the bus on 47th and Archer,"" Gutierrez said. ""This was never about arresting the worst of the worst. It's been about terrorizing our community.""

Gutierrez says the wife of the flower vendor has been notified, and the family is figuring out their next steps.

On Monday morning, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights says their teams were deployed to 61st and Kildare on Chicago's Southwest Side after reports of immigration agents in the area.

""What we do know is they attempted arrests, and there has been at least one arrest for today,"" said ICIRR Senior Director of Deportation Defense Rey Wences.

ABC7 has also reached out to DHS about that specific encounter and did not immediately hear back.

Evanston is also preparing for possible ICE raids in the coming days. The mayor there was tipped off by the governor's office and sent out an email blast, letting residents know.

""We're also working with community partners. So for example, this morning, the high school sent an email blast as well to all of their families, knowing that some people might get ours and not theirs, some people might get theirs and not ours,"" said Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss.

The Evanston City Council will vote on a resolution calling for the state to address ICE agents wearing masks on Monday night.

""We believe that it is just fundamentally wrong in a democracy for an agent of the state to use the power of the state without identifying themselves clearly with transparency and accountability,"" Biss said.

The DHS says their operation ""Midway Blitz"" is underway. They say they are targeting violent offenders who are here illegally.

On social media, ICE posted a picture of one of their SUVs with the Chicago skyline behind it, saying they are here to remove the dangerous public safety threats.

""Operation 'Midway Blitz' is not public safety. It's a declaration of war on Mexicans and Latinos in Chicago,"" said state Rep. Aaron Ortiz, who represents the 1st District.

And despite those reported detainments in Chicago, many people are wondering if this past weekend was the calm before the ICE storm.

Immigrant advocates reminded the public to not provoke federal agents and to take video of any encounters from a safe distance.

Religious leaders rally against immigration crackdown in Chicago: 'Faith over fear'

Meanwhile, more than one dozen faith leaders came together on Monday, taking a stand against ICE raids and rallying in support of immigrants in a campaign they are calling Faith Over Fear.

""ICE cannot survive the fire of a forge,"" said Reverend David Black with the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago.

""But what he's done is rallying us together. I've not seen this in a long time. He's fighting with all his weapons of his mouth and weapons of the army. We're fighting for something. It's our DNA, our faith, our faith is essential of who we are. He's not ready for this and he's not more powerful,"" said Fr. Michael Pfleger with St. Sabina Church.

Religious leaders from a diverse group of faith backgrounds stood with one voice on Daley Plaza to decry the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the possibility of a National Guard deployment in Chicago, as the White House border czar says the use of National Guard troops to protect and support immigration enforcement operations is ""on the table.""

""This morning, as I dropped my kids off at school. Like so many of us in Chicago did this morning, we took our kids to school, but today felt different,"" said Rev Sandra Van-Opstal with Lawndale Christian Community Church.

""I've got to tell you, there's a lot of fear. I live in the Pilsen/Little Village area, and it's been quieter these past few days, and so, we suspect that people will be navigating the conditions in our city cautiously,"" said Ray Wences with the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Little Village is all decked out in Mexican colors in advance of this weekend's Independence Day celebration. Many street vendors are selling flags and other items for those gearing up for the festivities.

""God stood on the side of the vulnerable and the oppressed,"" said Mishkan Chicago founder Rabbi Lizzi Heydemann. ""God split the sea for them and said to the world, the way that you treat the least among you, the strangers, the slaves, the servants, the way that you treat them is a test of your society.""

The faith leaders are preparing to support those families who may be impacted by ICE detentions.

""As a way to be able to walk with the families after something has happened, we're going to reactivate a lot of the resource network that we had during the new arrivals mission and be able to partner with churches and other groups to be able to get emergency items out to all of them,"" said New Life Centers CEO Matt DeMateo.

Trump, meanwhile, continues focus on Chicago crime as operation ""Midway Blitz"" ramps up.

""And I don't know why Chicago isn't calling us saying, 'Please give us help,' when you have, over just a short period of time, 50 murders and hundreds of people shot, and then, you have a governor that stands up and says how crime is just fine. It's really crazy,"" Trump said.

In an op-ed piece in the New York Times, Mayor Brandon Johnson addressed a possible National Guard deployment to address crime, saying in part, ""lowering crime rates here does not require an occupation of our city by armed members of the National Guard, as the White House continues to threaten us with.... Sending in the National Guard is the wrong solution to a real problem.""

Gov. JB Pritzker responded to the ICE post about coming after dangerous criminals, saying it is not about fighting crime, and that if it were, his administration would have heard from the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate efforts. The governor says this is about scaring Illinoisans.

The ICIRR Family Support Network was founded to connect immigrant communities with support. They can be reached at 855-435-7693.

A spokesperson for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, issued a statement, saying, ""The Governor's Office has received no formal communication or information from the Trump Administration. Like the public and press, we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show. As Trump has said himself, this is not about seriously fighting crime or reforming immigration - it's about Trump's plan to go to war with America's third-largest city. If he cared about delivering real solutions for Illinois, then we would have heard from him. Unlike Trump's reality show, we don't like keeping people in the dark. Since we have learned of the Trump Administration's plans to deploy federal agents and active-duty military to Illinois, Gov.

The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for President Donald Trump’s administration at the high court.

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that “roving patrols” were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the broad order went too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning.

“To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors,” he wrote in a concurrence with the majority’s brief, unexplained order. He suggested that stops in which force is used could yet face more legal pushback.

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor. Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

Trump’s Republican administration argued the order wrongly restricted agents carrying out its widespread crackdown on illegal immigration.

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

Department of Homeland Security attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that the order wrongly restricted the factors that ICE agents can use when deciding who to stop.

The Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hard-line immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines. The number of immigration raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store.

The plaintiffs argued that her order only prevents federal agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion, something that aligns with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

“Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.”

The Trump administration said the order is too restrictive, “threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer also argued the order can’t stand under the high court’s recent decision restricting universal injunctions, though the plaintiffs disagreed.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents as he yelled, “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-08 19:56:54.990625

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court again backed President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration approach on Monday, letting agents proceed with Southern California raids targeting people for deportation based on their race or language in a ruling its liberal justices said makes Latinos ""fair game to be seized at any time.""

The court granted a Justice Department request to put on hold a judge’s order that had barred agents from stopping or detaining people without ""reasonable suspicion"" that they are in the country illegally, by relying on race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent, among other factors.

California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the court’s decision in harsh terms.

""Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the grand marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles,"" Newsom said in a statement, alluding to the fact that Trump appointed three of the six conservative justices serving on the nine-member court.

The court’s brief and unsigned order, issued without any explanation, lifts the judge’s restrictions while a legal challenge brought by a group of Latino people caught up in the raids plays out.

Trump’s administration quickly vowed to continue ""roving patrols."" The Republican president returned to office in January promising to escalate deportations, and immigration raids by masked and armed federal agents triggered street protests in Los Angeles that led him to send military troops in June into the largest city in the most-populous U.S. state.

The administration ""has all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low-wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who in 2009 became the court’s first Hispanic member, wrote in a dissent joined by the court’s other two liberals.

""Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,"" Sotomayor added.

Los Angeles-based U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong found on July 11 that the Trump administration’s actions likely violated the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The judge’s order applied in an area covering much of Southern California.

""This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws - it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses,"" Newsom said, referring to Trump’s senior aide.

""Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family - and every person is now a target - but we will continue fighting these abhorrent attacks on Californians,"" Newsom added.

Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration crackdown, in May demanded that the leaders of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency ramp up deportations, setting a goal of 3,000 daily arrests.

’JUDICIAL MICROMANAGEMENT’

Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi called Monday’s decision a ""massive victory,"" writing on social media that immigration enforcement officers now can ""continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement.""

The plaintiffs, including some who are U.S. citizens, filed the proposed class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court in July.

""Individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from,"" the lawsuit stated.

Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California who helps represent the plaintiffs, vowed to continue to fight the administration’s ""racist deportation scheme.""

""This decision is a devastating setback for our plaintiffs and communities who, for months, have been subjected to immigration stops because of the color of their skin, occupation, or the language they speak,"" Tajsar said.

Concurring with Monday’s decision, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that ""apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion"" but it can be a ""’relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.""

Kavanaugh added: ""If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.""

Trump’s administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court this year to allow it to proceed with policies that lower courts have impeded after casting doubt on their legality.

The court has backed Trump in most of these cases. For instance, it has allowed Trump to deport migrants to countries other than their own without offering a chance to show harms they may face and to revoke temporary legal status previously granted by the government on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Trump’s immigration raids in Los Angeles and elsewhere have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.

Trump’s decision to send National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles in response to the protests represented an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations. Newsom and local officials contested the deployment as unlawful and unnecessary.

Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order halting stops or arrests based on race, language, presence at a particular location such as a car wash or tow yard, or type of work to establish ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegality. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 1 declined to lift Frimpong’s order.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEL870RK_L.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 23:57:17.322913

""Immigration agents are not conducting 'brief stops for questioning,' as the concurrence would like to believe.
""They’re allowing the [federal immigration agents] to break the law.” Savage reported from Washington and Sharp from Los Angeles.
Times staff writer Ruben Vives in Los Angeles contributed to this report.","The Supreme Court ruled Monday for the Trump administration and agreed U.S. immigration agents may stop and detain anyone they suspect is in the U.S. illegally based on little more than their working at a car wash, speaking Spanish or having brown skin.

In a 6-3 vote, the justices granted an emergency appeal and lifted a Los Angeles judge's order that barred ""roving patrols"" from snatching people off Southern California streets based on how they look, what language they speak, what work they do or where they happen to be.

The decision is a significant victory for President Trump, clearing the way for his oft-promised ""largest Mass Deportation Operation"" in American history.

The court's conservatives issued a brief, unsigned order that freezes the district judge's restraining order indefinitely and frees immigration agents from it. As a practical matter, it gives immigration agents broad authority to stop people who they think may be here illegally.

Although Monday's order is not a final ruling, it strongly signals the Supreme Court will not uphold strict limits on the authority of immigration agents to stop people for questioning.

The Supreme Court has been sharply criticized in recent weeks for handing down orders with no explanation. Perhaps for that reason, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote a 10-page opinion to explain the decision.

He said federal law says ""immigration officers 'may briefly detain' an individual 'for questioning' if they have 'a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being questioned ... is an alien illegally in the United States.'""

He said such stops are reasonable and legal based on the ""totality of the circumstances. Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.""

Those were exactly the factors that the district judge and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said agents may not use as a basis for stopping someone for questioning.

The three liberal justices dissented.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision ""yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket. We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.""

""The Government ... has all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction,"" she wrote.

Sotomayor also disagreed with Kavanaugh's assertions.

""Immigration agents are not conducting 'brief stops for questioning,' as the concurrence would like to believe. They are seizing people using firearms, physical violence, and warehouse detentions,"" she wrote. ""Nor are undocumented immigrants the only ones harmed by the Government’s conduct. United States citizens are also being seized, taken from their jobs, and prevented from working to support themselves and their families.""

In response, Kavanaugh said he agreed agents may not use ""excessive force"" in making stops or arrests. But the judge's order dealt only with the legal grounds for making stops, he said.

Kavanaugh stressed the court has a limited role when it comes to immigration enforcement.

""The Judiciary does not set immigration policy or decide enforcement priorities. It should come as no surprise that some Administrations may be more laissez-faire in enforcing immigration law, and other Administrations more strict,"" he wrote.

He noted the court had ruled for the Biden administration and against Texas, which had sought stricter enforcement against those who crossed the border or had a criminal record.

The case decided Monday began in early June when Trump appointees targeted Los Angeles with aggressive street sweeps that ensnared longtime residents, legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens.

A coalition of civil rights groups and local attorneys challenged the cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens caught up in the chaotic arrests, claiming they had been grabbed without reasonable suspicion — a violation of the 4th Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.

The lead plaintiffs — Pedro Vasquez Perdomo and two other Pasadena residents — were arrested at a bus stop when they were waiting to be picked up for a job.

On July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued a temporary restraining order barring stops based solely on race or ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination.

On July 28, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.

The case remains in its early phases, with hearings set for a preliminary injunction this month. But the Department of Justice argued even a brief limit on mass arrests constituted a ""irreparable injury"" to the government.

A few days later, Trump's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to set aside Frimpong's order. They said agents should be allowed to act on the assumption that Spanish-speaking Latinos who work as day laborers, at car washes or in landscaping and agriculture are likely to lack legal status.

""Reasonable suspicion is a low bar — well below probable cause,"" Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer wrote in his appeal. Agents can consider ""the totality of the circumstances"" when making stops, he said, including that ""illegal presence is widespread in the Central District [of California], where 1 in every 10 people is an illegal alien.""

Both sides said the region's diverse demographics support their view of the law. In an application to join the suit, Los Angeles and 20 other Southern California municipalities argued that ""half the population of the Central District"" now meet the government's criteria for reasonable suspicion.

Roughly 10 million Latinos live in the seven counties covered by the order, and almost as many speak a language other than English at home.

Sauer also questioned whether the plaintiffs who sued had standing because they were unlikely to be arrested again. That argument was the subject of sharp and extended questioning in the 9th Circuit, where a three-judge panel ultimately rejected it.

""Agents have conducted many stops in the Los Angeles area within a matter of weeks, not years, some repeatedly in the same location,"" the panel wrote in its July 28 opinion denying the stay.

One plaintiff was stopped twice in the span of 10 days, evidence of a ""real and immediate threat"" that he or any of the others could be stopped again, the 9th Circuit said.

Days after that decision, heavily armed Border Patrol agents sprang from the back of a Penske movers truck, snatching workers from the parking lot of a Westlake Home Depot in apparent defiance of the courts.

Immigrants rights advocates had urged the justices to not intervene.

""The raids have followed an unconstitutional pattern that officials have vowed to continue,"" they said. Ruling for Trump would authorize ""an extraordinarily expansive dragnet, placing millions of law-abiding people at imminent risk of detention by federal agents.""

The judge's order had applied in an area that included Los Angeles and Orange counties as well as Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.

“Every Latino should be concerned, every immigrant should be concerned, every person should be concerned,” Alfonso Barragan, a 62-year-old U.S. citizen, said Monday on his way into one of the L.A. Home Depots repeatedly hit by the controversial sweeps. ""They’re allowing the [federal immigration agents] to break the law.”

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The court's 6-3 decision followed a pattern of at least temporarily allowing some of the Republican administration's harshest policies, while leaving room for the possibility of a different outcome after the legal case plays out fully. The net effect, meanwhile, has Trump pushing ahead in many of the areas he considers most critical.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court's emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning. ""The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,"" he wrote in a concurrence.

Dissent says constitutional freedoms threatened

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,"" she wrote. ""Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.""

Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges.

The Supreme Court’s decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington as part of Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California, with a hearing set for Sept. 24. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that ICE agents can use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop.

More than 5,000 arrests made

The Department of Homeland Security said last week that authorities had made 5,210 immigration arrests since June 6 and praised the work of its lead commander there, Gregory Bovino, whose “success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.”

The agency promised in an online post to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles” after the high court's decision.

The region has been top priority for the Trump administration, and its hard-line immigration strategy has spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines.

The number of raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store as the administration carries out the president’s goal of mass deportations.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and border czar Tom Homan both separately applauded the ruling. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” Bondi wrote in a social media post.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It had covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

‘I was born here in the States’

The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops that do not align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Supreme Court decision will fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities. “The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents and pressed against a metal fence with his arm twisted behind his back as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

A terrified Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.

Democratic leaders in California condemned the decision. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she has directed city departments to follow rules barring the use of municipal resources on federal immigration enforcement. “This isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles. This is an attack on every person in this city, and in every city in this country,” Bass told reporters.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can’t be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,"" he said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, a vocal Trump opponent, said the order would allow agents wide latitude to make stops “including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses.”

Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant.

“I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?"" he said in a statement. “That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

The Department of Homeland Security issued a news release announcing the operation, which it called Operation Midway Blitz, and said it would target undocumented immigrants who had criminal records.

“No city is a safe haven for criminal illegal aliens,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Local officials and immigrants’ advocates said that Chicagoans were bracing for arrests, but that few had been witnessed as of Monday afternoon. At least three people were arrested on the Southwest Side of Chicago on Sunday, according to the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which closely tracks immigration enforcement activity.

To some degree, local officials said, the actions so far in Chicago looked to have a typical pace of ICE arrests on a given day. In Illinois, ICE has made at least 1,400 immigration arrests since Mr. Trump took office, a much lower rate per capita than in other immigrant-heavy states like New York. More than a thousand of those arrests have been in the Chicago area.

Jeylú B. Gutiérrez, a City Council member, said on Monday that three people in her ward had been detained, including a street vendor who sold flowers. Another person was arrested as he waited for a bus, she said.

Ms. Gutiérrez, after driving her children to school on Monday morning, said that the neighborhood had less traffic than usual, suggesting that people were staying home from work and school.

“They’re targeting hardworking people in the community,” she said.

On a plaza downtown, faith leaders from around the city gathered to show solidarity with immigrant communities and to decry the Trump administration’s announced deployment of ICE agents.

Nearly a dozen churches, synagogues and Islamic organizations began collaborating several weeks ago, when Mr. Trump alluded to plans for more immigration enforcement, said Matt DeMateo, pastor and chief executive of New Life Centers, a church and community center based in a heavily Latino community on the Southwest Side.

The churches are building a network to pool donations and provide assistance to families if raids and arrests take place.

“The message that he was going to war with Chicago,” Mr. DeMateo said of a social media post that Mr. Trump shared over the weekend, “made us feel that there is a literal target on all our backs.”

The president’s post contained an image depicting Mr. Trump with helicopters, billowing flames and the Chicago skyline, and read: “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat, said on Monday that his office had received no formal communication from the Trump administration.

“Like the public and press, we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show,” Matt Hill, a spokesman for Mr. Pritzker, said in a statement.

In Latino neighborhoods around Chicago, anxiety had settled in. On a street corner by a car dealership on the Southwest Side of Chicago, flowers sat in a small vase with a pink notecard taped on it that read “nadie es ilagal,” Spanish for “no one is illegal.”

Celene Morin, 34, who lives in the area, said she had heard about the arrest of the flower vendor on Facebook. She said she did not personally know the vendor, but she would occasionally buy flowers from him.

“He’s such a nice man,” Ms. Morin said. “He doesn’t cause any trouble.”

Ms. Morin said that she had heard of many people in the neighborhood who were afraid to go out amid reports of an immigration crackdown nearby.

“I feel bad for everyone,” Ms. Morin said, adding that she had heard of neighbors who were now afraid to go to the doctor.

Photos have been circulating widely on social media after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen near Brentwood High School, just off of school property.

According to Islip Forward, a group which collects pictures and monitors ICE detention efforts on Long Island, the agents were spotted on the first day of school, Sept. 3.

""We know at this time that there was at least one parent that was detained and arrested after dropping off their 16-year-old child to school at Brentwood,"" Ahman Perez, the founder of Islip Forward, said Sunday.

""We've seen them throughout delis, groceries, laundromats, and this is the first time that we've ever seen them adjacent to a school.""

The following day, Islip Forward was sent another photo of ICE agents hanging out outside Alverta B. Gray Schultz Middle School in Hempstead. The officials were spotted around 7:30 a.m., right around the time school was scheduled to begin. No one appears to have been detained in that instance.

Immigrant leaders say the psychological toll on children is great, with many worried that undocumented children might stop going to school altogether.

""Kids are wondering, is that my parent next? Am I okay when I leave this building at the end of the day?"" Perez said.

The Brentwood superintendent sent a letter to parents saying in part, ""ICE has not been on school district property. At this time, we have not been able to confirm the reason for their presence in the surrounding area.""

A separate communication from the school district's director of safety confirmed those agents did place someone under arrest, though cameras did not show whether that person dropped someone off at school.

CHICAGO — The Trump administration said on Monday that it had launched an immigration enforcement action in Chicago and other parts of Illinois dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” but the scope of the operation was unclear and the state’s Democratic governor said he was in the dark.

In a press release, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the operation was necessary because of city and state “sanctuary” laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, for weeks has signaled that he could send National Guard troops and federal officers to the Democratic stronghold of Chicago to combat crime and illegal immigration.

The immigration operation announced on Monday appeared to resemble more typical Trump-era immigration enforcement operations rather than troop deployments he had authorized in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., over the summer.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have criticized the plans, with Pritzker saying Trump would use troops to manipulate the 2026 midterm elections.

“The Governor’s Office has received no formal communication or information from the Trump Administration,” Pritzker spokesperson Matt Hill said. “Like the public and press, we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show.”

In a post on Truth Social on Monday, Trump cited recent murders and shootings in Chicago and blamed Pritzker for making no requests for assistance from the Trump administration.

“I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them,” Trump wrote. “Only the Criminals will be hurt! We can move fast and stop this madness.”

In a separate post on Saturday, Trump posted a meme based on the 1979 Vietnam War movie “Apocalypse Now” that showed an image of the Chicago skyline with flames and helicopters, reminiscent of the deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village in the film.

In the press release announcing the Chicago operation, the Homeland Security Department released a list of several immigrants in the U.S. illegally who were convicted of crimes and allegedly released by Illinois jails. The crimes included assault, burglary, drug possession, and other offenses, as well as allegations of gang membership.

The Trump administration launched a parallel immigration enforcement operation in Boston in recent days, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official confirmed on Monday.

Four New Jersey cities that have been sued by the administration over their local sanctuary policies have argued that the constitutionality of sanctuary orders was upheld in 2021 by the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in a case brought by Ocean County. But the Trump administration said the judge overseeing the new dispute should instead consider two other immigration-related decisions that found in the federal government’s favor.

“The current crisis of illegal immigration, which was allowed to reach critical levels after Ocean County was decided, requires a re-examination of that ruling,” the administration says in a letter filed with the court last week.

The Trump administration has challenged policies in Hoboken, Jersey City, Newark, and Paterson that limit local officials’ ability to share information with federal immigration authorities, arguing those policies are preempted by federal law. Attorneys for the cities have argued that the administration has no standing to sue because the cities would have to follow the state’s sanctuary policy, called the Immigrant Trust Directive, if they had no local sanctuary policies.

But the administration alleges that those local policies “impose even greater restrictions” than the state’s directive.

“The Newark policy, for example, precludes ‘any contract, agreement, or arrangement to detain immigrants in deportation proceedings, including but not limited to Intergovernmental Service Agreements,’” the administration’s letter reads.

The four cities have asked U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin to review this case speedily for public safety purposes.

Gurbir Grewal, an attorney who represents Hoboken and Newark in this dispute, is a former New Jersey attorney general who crafted the Immigrant Trust Act, which restricts when state and local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.

A federal judge in 2021 ruled the directive was not preempted by federal law because it sought to regulate the behavior of state and local officials, not federal ones, and requires local officials not to aid federal immigration efforts, rather than attempt to frustrate those efforts.

“The United States already brought such a challenge and lost,” Grewal wrote in a filing in the case last month.

The 3rd Circuit decision from 2021 also found that the state directive is not preempted by federal law.

Federal attorneys argued in the newest letter that the cities’ policies discriminate against the federal government because Paterson’s policy does not apply to local law enforcement officials placed on federal task forces and therefore treats U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection differently than other agencies.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:57:12.425406

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the campaign on social media and said it would be used to target immigrants without legal status who have been protected by the “sanctuary policies” of Gov. JB Pritzker, one of Trump’s most prominent political opponents.

But Pritzker said the true goal of the initiative was to invoke fear — not to fight crime.

“Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration’s focused on scaring Illinoisans,” Pritzker said Monday on the social media platform X.

The feds’ campaign came with a splashy and foreboding title: “Operation Midway Blitz.” It’s unclear whether the expected surge in immigration enforcement will come with support from the National Guard, as Trump has threatened.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that four Mexican nationals were arrested on Sunday, although it was unclear whether that accounted for everyone who has been taken into custody.

They were previously arrested on a range of charges, including sexual assault, armed robbery, burglary, domestic battery and drunken driving. At least two of them were arrested on the Southwest Side, the spokesperson said.

Federal immigration authorities were spotted Monday at Cook County’s Leighton Criminal Courthouse, and an ICE vehicle was parked down the street with agents inside. No arrests had been reported, but advocates reported last week that two people were detained at the domestic violence courthouse.

“ICE has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city, which protects them over law-abiding citizens,” the agency spokesperson said.

A man selling flowers near Curie Metropolitan High School was among those arrested Sunday, according to Any Huamani, an organizer with Brighton Park Neighborhood Council who helps monitor ICE activity and supports undocumented immigrants.

“It’s obvious that operations have begun in Chicago,” Huamani said at a news conference Monday. “And it’s even more obvious that they are going to be targeting our communities here in the Southwest Side.

“We’re afraid. Our neighbors are afraid.”

Pritzker, Mayor Brandon Johnson and other Illinois officials have spent weeks bracing for a surge in immigration enforcement and vowing to stand against Trump.

On Monday, Pritzker’s spokesperson Matt Hill said the governor’s office was still in the dark about the ICE campaign.

“Like the public and press, we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show,” Hill said. “As Trump has said himself, this is not about seriously fighting crime or reforming immigration — it’s about Trump’s plan to go to war with America’s third-largest city.”

Over the weekend, Trump stoked fears that he was planning to target Chicago with military force when he posted an image that referenced the film “Apocalypse Now” on his social media platform, Truth.

“Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of War,” Trump said in the post Saturday that included an image of the president in a military uniform, helicopters flying over the city’s skyline and the words “Chipocalypse Now.”

By Sunday, Trump stepped back from what Pritzker, Johnson and others saw as a threat of military intervention.

“We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend,” Trump told reporters. “That’s not war, that’s common sense.”

Trump’s administration is using a naval base in the northern suburbs to use as a command post for the immigration enforcement operation. On Monday, a source said a large contingent of federal agents had been sent there, potentially all 230 agents that were expected to arrive at Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago.

Meantime, Trump has continued to take aim at Chicago, highlighting the number of shootings and killings over the weekend. Six people were killed and 12 more wounded in shootings between Friday evening and Monday morning, Chicago police reported.

“I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them,” Trump wrote on his social media platform. “Only the Criminals will be hurt! We can move fast and stop this madness. The City and State have not been able to do the job.”

Despite Trump’s claims, crime has fallen significantly in recent years in Chicago. A WBEZ analysis earlier this month found that this summer saw the fewest killings since 1965.

Blistering reaction from Illinois Democrats

Trump’s onslaught of threats and attacks has kept both residents and lawmakers on guard.

Johnson said his administration was “concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.”

“ICE sent a 4-year-old boy with stage 4 kidney cancer to Honduras, even though the child was an American citizen,” Johnson said in a written statement. “There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since

Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents.”

Speaking on the Senate floor on Monday, Sen. Dick Durbin denounced Trump’s latest deportation campaign, calling it a cruel way to sow fear into immigration communities instead of addressing crime.

“If this President and this Administration want to join in fighting crime, on a cooperative, bipartisan basis, [then] count me in. But political theater, visions of Chicago being blown up by a ‘Department of War,’ I want no part of it,” Durbin said. “...The President is using fear to deflect and drive a wedge among us. Unfortunately, he seems to be succeeding to some extent, but the people of Chicago won’t take kindly to a bully and a wannabe dictator.”

In Evanston, the city was warning residents of possible immigration raids as soon as Monday after being tipped off by state officials.

The northern suburb passed sanctuary city protections years ago, but officials are still trying to ensure that federal agents identify themselves. The city recently turned off its license plate reader cameras after a state audit found suburban police departments had been sharing data with federal immigration authorities, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss said.

“We all just need to step up and keep each other safe,” Biss said. “The city is going to do everything we can, and we ask everyone to keep their eyes open to share credible information and not misinformation, because that can be dangerous as well.”

Although border czar Tom Homan warned that Chicago would be ground zero for mass deportations during Trump’s second term, data shows the administration hasn’t yet realized that goal.

Just about 1% of more than 130,000 ICE arrests between February and late July happened in Illinois, according to ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project through a public records request and analyzed by WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times.

Most of the people arrested have been from either Mexico, 36%, or Venezuela, 19%.

The number of immigration arrests had begun increasing earlier this summer. Monthly arrests of immigrants in Illinois more than doubled — from 152 in February to 343 in June, the data shows.

Huamani said advocates knew of at least three people who were arrested on the Southwest Side on Sunday. Her organization has been in contact with two of their families, including the loved ones of the flower vendor who was detained.

Huamani said she confronted DHS agents who were parked in West Lawn on Monday, but they wouldn’t tell her what they were doing in the area. She urged residents to brush up on their rights when interacting with federal agents, and said her organization would be canvassing neighborhoods to share information.

She also called on neighbors to support each other.

“If you know a neighbor that may be vulnerable at this moment and you’re able to provide that ride, or able to do that grocery shopping for them please do, be that support system because only we can take care of each other,” she said.

A handful of demonstrators gathered Monday afternoon outside of an ICE processing facility in Broadview, where arrestees are taken.

Karen Byrne, 60, said she lives nearby and has been showing up to monitor what’s happening as tensions have grown.

On Sunday, she said she saw a young boy who looked about 11 being escorted from an unmarked white van into the facility, along with other people who were apparently being processed.

“If it can happen to people they’re going after,” Byrne said. “It’ll happen to everyone.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b59a9d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x3124+0+262/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fbc%2F3cecac4a6dc53ae541e5ddcbdca1%2Fap19191594813557.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 21:58:00.220534

In May, federal immigration officials said they arrested nearly 1,500 people as part of a month-long crackdown called ""Operation Patriot,"" WBUR reported.","The Department of Homeland Security announced it's launching an immigration enforcement operation in Illinois in the latest escalation of federal action on U.S. cities and states led by Democrats.

The agency said in a post on X that the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" is in honor of Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old woman it says was killed in January in a drunk-driving hit-and-run accident involving a man who is an undocumented immigrant in Illinois.

Officials identified him as Julio Cucul-Bol. NPR has not confirmed details about the incident. The DHS post featured an interview with the parents of the victim, Joe and Michelle Abraham, who said the incident took place in Urbana, Ill.

DHS says the ICE operation targets ""criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois"" because they knew Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's sanctuary policies would protect them.

This latest announcement about Illinois follows a summer in which the Trump administration has targeted Democratic-led cities for increased immigration enforcement and National Guard deployments.

It also follows an earlier announcement from DHS that said it was launching a new immigration enforcement effort in Massachusetts, according to reporting from NPR member station WBUR in Boston.

Meanwhile, National Guard troops — some of them armed — are still patrolling the streets of Washington, D.C., ostensibly to address the administration's concerns about crime. This is despite the fact that the city is experiencing a 30-year low in crime, according to the U.S. Justice Department from earlier this year. And earlier Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with President Trump, allowing immigration raids in Los Angeles to continue. This allows immigration agents to conduct ""roving patrols"" and profile people based on their appearance in Los Angeles and Southern California.

Chicago intervention

The announcement that Illinois will be the target of increased immigration enforcement comes after a confusing weekend during which Trump escalated threats toward Chicago and then walked them back.

Throughout the weekend, Trump maintained that the National Guard would be sent to the city and to other major U.S. cities, all led by Democrats, to fight crime and to step up immigration arrests and deportations.

Like in Washington, D.C., where Trump sent National Guard troops last month, data shows that violent crime has gone down in Chicago in recent years.

Trump posted on social media that Chicago was about to find out why the Department of Defense is called the ""Department of War."" (Last week, the president signed an executive order renaming the department, but it would take an act of Congress to make that official.)

In response to Trump's post, Pritzker this weekend wrote on X that Trump was ""threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal.""

But then Trump later told reporters on Sunday as he left the White House, ""We're not going to war. We're going to clean up our cities. We're going to clean them up so they don't kill five people every weekend. That's not war, that's common sense.""

As Trump's back and forth continued, residents in Chicago expressed deep concern about what this threatened federal action would look like. It appears, for now, this federal presence will take the shape of an increase in ICE agents on the streets. As of Monday afternoon, there has been no indication there's been an uptick in immigration enforcement.

Boston faces enforcement surge

Over the weekend, DHS confirmed to WBUR that it is launching a second immigration enforcement surge throughout Massachusetts, but didn't specify how long there would be increased ICE activity.

This enforcement effort may be heavily focused on the city of Boston, according to WBUR which reported that the DHS specifically called out Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, claiming the city's sanctuary laws ""attract and harbor criminals.""

In May, federal immigration officials said they arrested nearly 1,500 people as part of a month-long crackdown called ""Operation Patriot,"" WBUR reported. DHS refers to this new surge as ""Patriot 2.0.""

This kind of federal intervention in major U.S. cities and states is not likely to stop any time soon, as Trump has also threatened to send troops to Baltimore and New Orleans in recent days.

""These abductions were seemingly random, with agents profiling and approaching them on the street,"" said Rey Wences, senior director of deportation defense at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ""Chicago is fighting back. We will keep each other safe.""

Local organizers said federal agents were spotted Monday in the West Lawn neighborhood in the shadow of Midway International Airport.

West Lawn resident Eddie Guillen was canvassing the area after the sightings and an alleged ICE arrest, handing out ""know your rights"" materials to neighbors, many of whom he said were too afraid to open their doors.

""Just disgusted. You know, it's one of those things where we have to do better and look after the community,"" he said.

Responding to the new operation, Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city has not received any official notice from the Trump administration about its immigration crackdown.

""We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,"" Johnson said in a statement.

President Trump mentioned the mayor and Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday, saying he's still waiting on a call from the governor, asking Mr. Trump to send in troops to help fight crime, a call Pritzker has said he would not make.

""They're not stupid people. Must be an ideology that's just buried in their head and you can't do a damn thing about it,"" Trump said.

Mr Trump sent National Guard troops and US Marines into Los Angeles in June in response to protests against the federal immigration raids, marking an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations.","The US Supreme Court has again backed President Donald Trump's hardline immigration approach, letting agents proceed with southern California raids targeting people for deportation based on their race or language in a decision that a dissenting justice said made Latinos ""fair game to be seized at any time"".

The court granted a Justice Department request to put on hold a judge's order temporarily barring agents from stopping or detaining people without ""reasonable suspicion"" that they are in the country illegally by relying on race or ethnicity, or if they speak Spanish or English with an accent, among other factors.

The administration quickly vowed to continue ""roving patrols"".

The Supreme Court's three liberal justices publicly dissented, directing pointed criticism at its conservative majority.

The administration ""has all but declared that all Latinos, US citizens or not, who work low-wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents' satisfaction,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the dissenting opinion.

Los Angeles-based US District Judge Maame Frimpong found on July 11 that the Trump administration's actions likely violated the US constitution's fourth amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The judge's order applied to her court's jurisdiction covering much of southern California.

The Supreme Court's order was brief and issued without any explanation, a common way it handles emergency matters, but one that has generated confusion in lower courts and criticism from some of the justices themselves.

The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.

Trump-appointed US Attorney-General Pam Bondi called Monday's decision a ""massive victory"", writing on social media that immigration enforcement officers now can ""continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement"".

A lawsuit challenging the raids accused the administration of using roving patrols by masked and heavily armed agents who have conducted interrogations and detentions based on racial profiling that resemble ""brazen, midday kidnappings"".

""Individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force, and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from,"" the lawsuit stated.

A group of Latino people caught up in the raids, including some who are US citizens, filed the proposed class action lawsuit in Los Angeles federal court in July.

'Racism with a badge'

Mohammad Tajsar, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of southern California who helps represent the plaintiffs, vowed to continue to fight the administration's ""racist deportation scheme"".

""This decision is a devastating setback for our plaintiffs and communities who, for months, have been subjected to immigration stops because of the colour of their skin, occupation, or the language they speak,"" Mr Tajsar said.

One plaintiff, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, said in a statement that he joined the case because ""what happened to me is happening to others everyday just for being brown, speaking Spanish, or standing on a corner looking for work"".

He said agents did not explain why they grabbed him, and that they did not have a warrant.

Concurring with Monday's decision, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that ""apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion"" but it can be a ""'relevant factor' when considered along with other salient factors"".

""If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a US citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go,"" Justice Kavanaugh added.

Mr Trump's administration has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court this year to allow it to proceed with policies that lower courts have impeded after casting doubt on their legality.

The court has backed Mr Trump in most of these cases. For instance, it has allowed Mr Trump to deport migrants to countries other than their own without offering a chance to show harms they may face and to revoke temporary legal status previously granted by the government on humanitarian grounds to hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Promises of deportations

Mr Trump won the election last year to a second term as president with promises of record-level deportations.

His administration's immigration raids, including in Los Angeles, have prompted panic in immigrant communities as well as protests, and have drawn lawsuits over aggressive tactics.

Mr Trump sent National Guard troops and US Marines into Los Angeles in June in response to protests against the federal immigration raids, marking an extraordinary use of military force within the United States to support civilian police operations.

Local officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, contested the deployment as unlawful and unnecessary.

Justice Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order halting stops or arrests based on race, language, presence at a particular location such as a car wash or tow yard, or type of work to establish ""reasonable suspicion"" of illegality.

The judge was appointed by former US president Joe Biden, a Democrat.

The governor and mayor have discussed the importance of people knowing their rights. Sunday night in Hermosa, there was an event predicated around that.

As President Trump's administration plans to ramp up DHS operations locally, many non-profit organizations are trying to find ways to help.

""We have a lot of artists and activists in the community that wanted to do something so for us it's only natural,"" said Omar Torres-Cortright, executive director of SRBCC. ""The community here is concerned and we need more of these gatherings of people coming together.""

The volunteer collective of local arts presenters and advocates hosted an event in Hermosa, showcasing native music and dance performances, while drumming up funds for legal expenses from ICE detentions and prosecutions. They've already raised more than $46,000

""We're trying to show the whole breath of what positive people want to do and really support people who are most directly affected right now,"" Marguerite Horberg said.

The event also offered education for residents on how to handle potential ICE raids as they stress the importance of knowing their rights.

""We are not just putting together a show we have know your rights information we have lawyers in the house that can give information to people,"" Torres-Cortright. ""It's all about having a common goal and doing great work.""

A little further north of that event, the Tenants Union FIBC held their own fundraiser with the same goal in mind. They hosted a block party near Broadway Avenue, selling plates of homemade food to raise money for family members recently detained by ICE.

""We know it's a really tough time and we're trying to have something ready in case more of the family members have trouble,"" Maya Azul said.

So the effort continues locally as many wait to see exactly how DHS operations will unfold in coming days. People across the city have also been handing out flyers to make sure everyone understands what to do if federal agents come to their neighborhood.

It was a day of celebration in Aurora on Sunday, albeit a muted one. Following a six-year hiatus, Aurora's Mexican Independence Day Parade went forward - without the turnout organizers would have liked - in a city where four out of 10 people identify as Hispanic or Latino.

The music, the colors and the vibrancy that makes up Mexican culture was on full display in downtown Aurora. The city welcomed back the traditional Fiestas Patrias celebrations for the first time since before the pandemic.

""I came here when I was eight years old,"" spectator Gabriela Donatlan-Williams said. ""And I'm American and Mexican, but I'm very proud of our Mexico.""

And yet for all its folklore, it was a parade which at times appeared to have more people participating in it, than watching it.

""It was disheartening, seeing how many people have just been afraid to show up today,"" spectator Alexa Pennell said.

Taking place under the specter of an anticipated large-scale immigration enforcement operation starting this week, organizers admitted people have been staying home, not just Sunday, but during Saturday's festival as well, where the turnout was estimated to be a quarter of what they usually get.

Aurora's new mayor, John Laesch, admitted it's been challenging to straddle the line between encouraging people to celebrate, while also wanting to keep the community safe.

""I think the people that came out and participated had a good time. And that was the main thing,"" Laesch said. 'Having this event is one way of saying we want people to celebrate and continue to be part of a culture and history that is now a fabric of Aurora. But as far as offering people false hope, false sense of security we're just not going to do that.""

For those who did choose to attend, the parade was an affirmation.

""As much as we're Latino, we're American,"" spectator Jeremiah Pennell said. We belong here and you know, we won't be put in a corner, we won't be made to be afraid.""

The question now is, with Chicago's traditionally massive Little Village Celebration coming up in a week, will that same fear translate into reduced crowds?",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17766578_090725-wls-horng-ice-preps-5p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-08 17:57:46.869690

In a post on the social media platform X, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said “Operation Midway Blitz” would target immigrants without legal status who have sought refuge in Illinois and Chicago.

Gov. JB Pritzker, Mayor Brandon Johnson and other Illinois officials have been bracing for a surge in immigration enforcement and vowing to stand against Trump. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has been granted permission to use a naval base in the northern suburbs as a command post for the operation, with hundreds of federal agents expected to arrive.

DHS said the blitz was being led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and will honor Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old woman who was killed in a hit-and-run crash earlier this year in downstate Urbana, roughly 140 miles southwest of Chicago.

Julio Cucul-Bol, an immigrant without legal status from Guatemala, has been charged with reckless homicide, drunken driving and leaving the scene of a crash.

“The ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” DHS said in the announcement.

Blistering reaction from Illinois Democrats

In a social media post on X, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker dismissed the administration’s actions Monday as a scare tactic that has nothing to do with any effort to tackle crime.

“Once again, this isn’t about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination — yet we’ve experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks,” Pritzker said. “Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration’s focused on scaring Illinoisians.”

Pritzker’s spokesperson Matt Hill stressed that the White House had yet to notify the governor’s office about the ICE operation.

“Like the public and press, we are learning of their operations through their social media as they attempt to produce a reality television show. As Trump has said himself, this is not about seriously fighting crime or reforming immigration – it’s about Trump’s plan to go to war with America’s third-largest city,” Hill said.

“Unlike Trump’s reality show, we don’t like keeping people in the dark,” Hill continued. “Since we have learned of the Trump Administration’s plans to deploy federal agents and active-duty military to Illinois, Gov. Pritzker has shared information with the public, and the Governor’s Office has remained in regular contact with leaders and partners at the City of Chicago, Cook County, the Illinois congressional delegation, state legislature, and mayors and representatives from the collar counties.”

Like the governor’s office, City Hall was in the dark about DHS’s campaign.

“We have received no notice of any enhanced immigration action by the Trump administration,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement released Monday.

“We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,” Johnson said. “ICE sent a 4-year-old boy with stage 4 kidney cancer to Honduras, even though the child was an American citizen. There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents.”

Sen. Dick Durbin harshly criticized “Operation Midway Blitz” as a “campaign to arrest hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions.

“These actions don’t make us safer. They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction, the Illinois Democrat said in a prepared statement. “While the President exhibits disdain for immigrants, Chicago embraces them as family who help make our economy thrive and our city strong.”

Evanston braces for ICE agents

In Evanston, officials were warning residents of impending immigration enforcement as soon as Monday.

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss told the Sun-Times that state officials had tipped off local governments about impending raids this week.

While the city passed sanctuary city protections years ago, it’s still working on finding avenues to ensure agents identify themselves. Evanston also turned off its license plate reader cameras after a state audit found suburban police departments had been sharing data from the cameras with federal immigration authorities, according to Biss.

“We all just need to step up and keep each other safe,” Biss said. “The city is going to do everything we can, and we ask everyone to keep their eyes open to share credible information and not misinformation, because that can be dangerous as well.”

Biss said the city had only been alerted to one false alarm as of 11:30 a.m., but urged people to remain vigilant and share verified information so as not to spread unnecessary fear. The city encouraged residents to report ICE sightings to 855-435-7693 or icirr.org.

“We take this potentiality seriously and urge community members to be aware and report sightings of federal agents,” a statement from the city of Evanston said. “It is important to know your rights in any interaction with federal agents. … During this time of uncertainty and fear, it is critical to maintain a strong sense of community, as well as provide accurate information.”

A handful of demonstrators gathered Monday afternoon outside of an ICE processing facility in west suburban Broadview, where protesters had tried to obstruct agents as they came and went on Friday.

Karen Byrne was among four demonstrators standing outside Monday as a stream of people showed up for immigration appointments. Shortly before 3 p.m., a sedan transported two young women into the facility.

Byrne, 60, said she lives nearby and has been showing up to the processing center to monitor what’s happening as tensions have grown. On Sunday, she said she saw a young boy who looked about 11 being escorted from an unmarked white van into the facility, along with other people who were apparently being processed.

“If it can happen to people they’re going after,” Byrne said. “It’ll happen to everyone.”

Trump lashes out again at Chicago

Trump took aim at Chicago again earlier Monday, highlighting the number of shootings and killings over the weekend after walking back his threat to target the city with his newly renamed Department of War.

Six people were killed and 12 more wounded across Chicago in shootings between Friday evening and Monday morning, according to a Chicago Sun-Times analysis.

“I want to help the people of Chicago, not hurt them,” Trump posted Monday on Truth Social, his social media platform. “Only the Criminals will be hurt! We can move fast and stop this madness. The City and State have not been able to do the job.”

In his post, Trump also called out Pritzker, a possible Democratic candidate for president in 2028, who has opposed Trump’s threats to increase immigration enforcement in Chicago and possibly to send in federalized National Guard troops from other states, as Trump has done in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

Trump wrote that Pritzker has said he doesn’t want federal assistance, though the governor and other Illinois officials have said they would welcome more federal agents if they were sent to target guns and crime.

“People of Illinois should band together and DEMAND PROTECTION,” Trump wrote. “IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!! ACT NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!”

Trump’s latest broadside came after he stoked fears over the weekend that he was declaring war on Chicago with another social media post, this one with a reference to the was film “Apocalypse Now.”

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of War,” Trump said in the post Saturday that included an image of the president in a military uniform, helicopters flying over the city’s skyline and the words “Chipocalypse Now.”

On Sunday, though, Trump stepped back from what Pritzker, Johnson and others saw as a threat of military intervention.

“We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend,” Trump said. “That’s not war, that’s common sense.”

Trump has focused on Chicago in recent weeks as his administration has prepared to ramp up immigration enforcement and potentially send National Guard troops. On Sunday, Ald. Jeylú Gutiérrez (14th) said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested three people in her Southwest Side ward, which includes parts of Archer Heights, Gage Park and Chicago Lawn.

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security landed a major legal victory Monday morning when the Supreme Court issued a stay in the case of Perdomo v. Noem. The ruling allows DHS to continue carrying out immigration operations in the Los Angeles area.

“This is a win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members, and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor.”

The court ruled 6-3 in favor of the Trump Administration. With its decision, the court stayed a ruling by federal judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong in July blocking DHS from conducting immigration sweeps in Southern California.

To the mainstream media’s chagrin, there are no “indiscriminate stops” being made. The Supreme Court simply applied longstanding precedent regarding what qualifies as “reasonable suspicion” under the Fourth Amendment. What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S. DHS enforces federal immigration law without fear, favor, or prejudice.

In his opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s discussed the federal government’s duty to enforce immigration laws on the books and the fact that the Judicial Branch does NOT make those laws:

“The fact remains that, under the laws passed by Congress and the President, [illegal aliens] are acting illegally by remaining in the United States – at least unless Congress and the President choose some other legislative approach to legalize some or all of those individuals now illegally present in the country. And by illegally immigrating into and remaining in the country, they are not only violating the immigration laws, but also jumping in front of those noncitizens who follow the rules and wait in line to immigrate into the United States through the legal immigration process.”",https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/24_0206_opa_og-image-dhs.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 16:57:07.847714

Many of the demolitions are being carried out by robots that place explosives inside homes. Israel has killed 32 Palestinians so far today. Officials say another 83 were killed over a 24-hour period ending on Sunday. Residents of Gaza City say there is no safe place to go.

Ibtasim Muqdad: “In regard to displacement, we were displaced before to the south. There were also martyrs there and bombardment. Wherever we went, there were bombardments, from one area to another, from Rafah to Khan Younis, from Khan Younis to Deir al-Balah. There were bombardments everywhere. We later came here. It is all the same. All displacement is for nothing. It is enough.”

Save the Children reports that Israel has killed more than 20,000 Palestinian children over the past 23 months — this means at least one Palestinian child has been killed every hour on average by Israeli forces. The group said, “If the international community does not step up, an entire generation of children in Gaza will be lost.”

Meanwhile, another six Palestinians have died from “famine and malnutrition,” bringing the total to almost 400, including 140 children, who have starved to death.

In Israel, an attack on a bus stop in occupied East Jerusalem has left six people dead and as many as 15 injured. At least one of the victims was a rabbi. Israeli authorities say they believe the attack was carried out by two Palestinians from the West Bank. Police said the attackers were both shot dead.

In other news from Israel, the country’s Supreme Court has ruled the government has failed to provide adequate food for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The court ruled Israel must provide prisoners “a basic level of existence.” The ruling came in response to a petition filed by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Israeli rights group Gisha.

In London, police arrested nearly 900 people Saturday at a protest against the U.K. government banning the group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. It is now illegal for anyone in Britain to show support for Palestine Action. Protests against the ban have been mounting for weeks.

Tamara Abood: “Ordinary people who have never been on protests in their lives are, you know, reckoning with their conscience. They’re thinking, 'I cannot keep sitting, day in, day out, and on my sofa watching this abject horror and do nothing.' And so, the extraordinary thing is, you know, the images, the most powerful images we’re seeing, are of, you know, disabled, middle-aged, elderly white people being carted off by the police for the crime of saying, 'Stop killing children.'”

In other protest news, organizers say over 110,000 people took to the streets of Brussels on Sunday in a major pro-Palestine rally that came days after the Belgian government announced it would soon recognize a Palestinian state and impose sanctions on Israel.

On Saturday, President Trump threatened to send National Guard troops and ICE agents to Chicago, writing on social media, “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR” — a reference to his order to change the name of the Department of Defense. Trump accompanied the message with an AI-generated image depicting himself as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore from the Vietnam War film “Apocalypse Now,” in front of the Chicago skyline with helicopters, flames and the phrase “Chipocalypse Now.” He also wrote, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning”–a reference to one of the most famous lines in the film: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”

In response, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called the president a “wannabe dictator.” By Sunday, President Trump walked back his comments, telling reporters, “We’re not going to war. We’re going to clean up our cities.” Meanwhile, thousands of Chicagoans took to the streets on Saturday to protest Trump’s plans to send ICE agents and federal troops to the city.

David Álvarez: “National Guard and sending ICE agents here to our community is a direct threat to not only us, but our community. It is us. It is our neighbors and our friends. It affects everyone. Businesses have been dropping. Restaurants have been dropping. Everything has — people have been scared.”

Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching new immigration raids in the Boston area. This comes after Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has repeatedly criticized Trump’s attacks on Boston and other sanctuary cities.

In Washington, D.C., thousands marched in the largest demonstration yet there against President Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and the federal takeover of the district’s police force. The “We Are All D.C.” march was organized by a coalition of groups which include Free DC and the American Civil Liberties Union. The Trump administration is set to extend the deployment of National Guard troops in D.C. to December. Meanwhile, officials have dismantled part of a peace vigil outside the White House that had been running for more than four decades, under Trump’s orders to clear homeless encampments. Authorities reportedly mislabeled the vigil as a shelter.

Meanwhile, here in New York on Sunday, Trump was loudly booed by the crowd as he attended the U.S. Open men’s final. The United States Tennis Association had sent a memo to broadcasters, asking them to censor the crowd’s reaction to Trump.

South Korea announced that it is sending a charter plane to the U.S. to bring back more than 300 of its citizens who were rounded up and detained by ICE at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. ICE officials arrested nearly 500 people, most of them South Korean nationals, on Thursday at the Hyundai-LG battery plant. Footage of the raid showed workers shackled in handcuffs and ankle chains and loaded onto buses. ICE officials have called it the largest enforcement operation in the agency’s history. South Korea’s foreign minister is expected to arrive in Washington today to discuss the release of the workers. The ICE raid comes as South Korea recently agreed to invest $350 billion in the U.S. in exchange for lower tariffs.

On Sunday, Russia launched the largest drone assault against Ukraine since 2022, attacking the main government building in Kyiv for the first time. At least four people were killed in Russian strikes all over the country, including a mother and her baby. Ukraine also launched airstrikes against Russia, killing three people. Speaking to reporters, President Trump said he was ready to impose a second round of sanctions against Russia, but gave no additional details.

The Trump administration has ordered the deployment of 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico as the U.S. threatens to carry out more strikes in Latin America under the guise of the war on drugs. Last week, the U.S. bombed a boat, killing 11 people, off the coast of Venezuela. The Marines and Navy have also been carrying out military exercises in Puerto Rico, including amphibious landing exercises.

This comes as CNN is reporting that Trump is considering carrying out strikes against drug cartels inside Venezuela. On Friday, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro warned the U.S. against taking any more military action.

President Nicolás Maduro: “The government of the United States should abandon its plan of violent regime change in Venezuela and in all of Latin America and the Caribbean, and respect sovereignty, the right to peace, to independence.”

Over the weekend, Vice President JD Vance dismissed accusations that the recent attack on the Venezuelan boat may have been a war crime if civilians were on board. Vance wrote on X, “I don’t give a shit what you call it.” Republican Senator Rand Paul criticized Vance’s comment, saying, “What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial.”

The New York Times has revealed that U.S. Navy SEALs took part in a failed top-secret mission to install eavesdropping technology in North Korea in 2019. The mission was aborted when the SEALs were spotted by a boat near the North Korean coast. The SEALs opened fire on the boat, killing everyone on board — believed to be two or three North Korean civilians who were diving for shellfish. The Trump administration never notified key members of Congress about the top-secret mission.

The acclaimed psychiatrist and author Robert Jay Lifton has died at the age of 99. He was the author of more than 20 books about the effects of nuclear war, terrorism and genocide. In 1967, Robert Jay Lifton won a National Book Award for his work, “Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima.” In 1986, he published the seminal book, “The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide.” He appeared on Democracy Now! several times, including in 2017, when he talked about Donald Trump.

Robert Jay Lifton: “Well, I wrote a letter, together with Judith Herman, to The New York Times, in which we raised two issues. One was his relation to reality, which is, I would say, solipsistic and untenable and very dangerous to everyone.”

Amy Goodman: “What do you mean, 'solipsistic'?”

Robert Jay Lifton: “Solipsistic, from within the self. In other words, he only sees the world from within his sense of self. He can’t have empathy for others. He can’t really think into the future the consequences of his actions, because he’s totally preoccupied with the immediate event and how he can deal with it or manipulate it as emerging through the perception on the part of his sense of self.”

If an administrative stay is in place, he suggested, it would “preserve the status quo” and “avoid the kind of disruption that reinstated officers have caused in previous cases.” Slaughter opposed the request for an administrative stay.","Chief Justice John Roberts on Monday cleared the way for President Donald Trump to fire, at least for now, a Democratic appointee to the Federal Trade Commission. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., had ordered Trump to reinstate Rebecca Slaughter, who was originally nominated in 2018 by Trump to serve a seven-year term and then nominated to serve a second term by then-President Joe Biden. But Roberts granted the government’s request for an administrative stay – a temporary pause to give the justices time to consider the Trump administration’s plea to block the order by U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan while litigation continues in the lower courts.

As is common with administrative stays, Roberts did not provide any explanation for his order. But the order suggests that a majority of the justices may be skeptical of the continued vitality of the Supreme Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, upholding a federal law that only allows FTC commissioners to be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

The dispute began in March 2025, when both Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, who was also nominated by Biden, were notified, in an email on Trump’s behalf, that they had been removed from the FTC because their “continued service on the FTC is inconsistent with my Administration’s priorities.” The email did not indicate that they had been fired for any of the reasons that would give Trump cause to do so under federal law.

Slaughter and Bedoya went to federal court in Washington, D.C., where they argued that their removals violated federal law. In June, Bedoya formally resigned from the FTC, citing financial reasons: He was no longer receiving a salary from the government, but he could not obtain another job while serving on the commission. AliKhan later dismissed Bedoya’s claims as moot – that is, no longer a live controversy.

On July 17, AliKhan ordered the Trump administration to reinstate Slaughter, finding that “the law on the removal of FTC Commissioners is clear.” AliKhan acknowledged that the Supreme Court in May had allowed the government to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, pausing two lower-court rulings that had backed the board members. But “any suggestion that Humphrey’s Executor may not extend to other agencies cannot be read as an invitation to sidestep its application to the FTC,” AliKhan emphasized. “Even if the Supreme Court eventually chooses to overrule Humphrey’s Executor, it would be an act of judicial hubris for this court to do so prematurely,” she stated.

A divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit turned down the Trump administration’s request to pause AliKhan’s order while it appealed, as well as its plea to fast-track its appeal. Judges Patricia Millett and Nina Pillard wrote that the Trump administration “has no likelihood of success on appeal” – an important factor in deciding whether to grant temporary relief – “given controlling and directly on point Supreme Court precedent”: the court’s decision in Humphrey’s Executor. “And recent developments on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket,” they said, “do not permit this court to do the Supreme Court’s job of reconsidering that precedent.”

Judge Neomi Rao would have put AliKhan’s ruling on hold while the government appealed. She acknowledged the similarities between Slaughter’s case and Humphrey’s Executor, but she contended that the FTC “unquestionably exercises significant executive power, and the other equities favor the government. These grounds were sufficient to support the Supreme Court’s judgment that a stay was warranted” in the case of the NLRB and MSPB members fired by the president, and the same should be true here, Rao concluded.

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court on Sept. 4, asking the justices to intervene and temporarily pause AliKhan’s order. Sauer argued that Slaughter’s case was “indistinguishable” from the NLRB and MSPB cases in which the court had paused district court rulings, clearing the way for the Trump administration to fire the board members. In Slaughter’s case, Sauer insisted, the D.C. Circuit majority had “applied an overly expansive reading of Humphrey’s Executor” that the Supreme Court has since “repudiated.”

Sauer also asked the justices to grant an administrative stay. Except for a few days, he argued, “the status quo for the last five and a half months” has had Slaughter out of office. If an administrative stay is in place, he suggested, it would “preserve the status quo” and “avoid the kind of disruption that reinstated officers have caused in previous cases.”

Slaughter opposed the request for an administrative stay. She emphasized that such relief would be inappropriate when “the court below simply ‘follow[ed] the case which directly controls’” – Humphrey’s Executor – “as it was required to do.” She added that because she is the “sole Democratic member on a Commission with a three-Republican majority,” reinstating her would not “result in any meaningful regulatory action opposed by the Commission majority.”

Three days after Slaughter filed her opposition to an administrative stay, Roberts granted the government’s request. He also instructed Slaughter to file her opposition to the government’s application for a stay by 4 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 15.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apex-building-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 16:57:42.157264

Weapons of war deployed against international gangs suspected of drug trafficking. Military bases and resources redirected to mass immigration enforcement operations.

President Donald Trump is swiftly implementing his vision of the military as an all-powerful tool for his policy goals. It’s ground that presidents have hardly ever crossed outside of times of war, and experts say it’s remaking the role of the most powerful military in the world and its relationship with the American public.

Yet as Trump has dramatically stepped up his use of military force, fellow Republicans in Congress — where authorization for such actions is supposed to originate — have done little but cheer him on. That’s giving the president significant leeway as he raises plans to send troops next to Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans.

“If I were one of those mayors, I’d be glad to have the help,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, speaking from a Capitol building where National Guard troops were patrolling the surrounding city. “I think the big city Democrats are really making a mistake. I think they’re being tone deaf.”

Lawmakers from Louisiana — a red state that surrounds politically blue New Orleans — said it was a great idea for National Guard troops to go there next.

“New Orleans, like most Democrat-run cities, has a high crime rate, so it would be helpful,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told The Associated Press.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., agreed: “We need all the help we can get. I’m delighted to bring in the National Guard.”

Republicans have in recent years found political success focusing on the issue of crime. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities, according to recent polling from the The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats.

However, statistics show overall crime is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.

How Trump’s use of the National Guard is unique

In the past, the use of National Guard troops on American soil was reserved for extraordinary circumstances such as natural disasters or when local officials became overwhelmed by civil unrest or disorder. Rarely have presidents used the troops for law enforcement purposes.

Notable examples include the 1894 Pullman strike in Chicago, during the Civil Rights era to enforce desegregation in the South, and in 1992 during deadly rioting after police officers brutally beat motorist Rodney King and were acquitted on state charges.

WATCH: U.S. military strikes on suspected drug smugglers spark legal and diplomatic concerns

Experts say that Trump’s crime mission stands out because he’s not responding to a particular crisis. Instead, Trump is using the military to implement his domestic policies, whether that means using military aircraft for deportation flights, beefing up military at the U.S.-Mexico border or ordering National Guard troops to be ready for law enforcement duties.

“All of these things indicate an administration that is making a broad, concerted effort to insert the military into civilian law enforcement in a way and on a scale that has no precedent in American history,” said Joseph Nunn, an attorney at the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program.

Trump says he has the “right” to send National Guard troops to the cities, even over the objections of state governors.

“I’m the president of the United States. If I think our country is in danger — and it is in danger in these cities — I can do it,” he said this past week.

A historic test

Congress under its constitutional duties has laid out laws that govern when and how the National Guard can be deployed domestically. But as Trump has pushed the limits of those laws, the Republican-controlled Congress has stood by. Instead, it’s been left to the courts to put any guardrails on Trump’s maximalist approach to the presidency.

A federal judge ruled last week that the Trump administration “willfully” broke the Posse Comitatus Act, a nearly 150-year-old federal law that limits the U.S. military’s role in domestic law enforcement, when he sent National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area in early June after days of protests over immigration raids. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco noted Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated they intend to deploy National Guard troops to other cities across the country, raising concerns they’re “creating a national police force with the President as its chief.”

That sort of use of the National Guard was just what the writers of the Constitution were trying to guard against, said Andrew Wiest, co-founder of the Center for the Study of the National Guard at the University of Southern Mississippi.

The young nation had just endured a war of independence that was sparked by a British military acting as a police force on the colony, and its early leaders were reticent to give the president too much control over the military. Since then, presidents have increasingly exercised more power over the troops that started as state-based militias.

“This is another one of those pendulum moments where the Guard will become more federal or maybe it will swing back in the other direction,” Wiest said. “But since the founding of the Republic, it’s been swinging towards the federal side.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/09/2025-09-04T200620Z_2141168803_RC27LGASYB5N_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CRIME-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 17:57:08.127786

John Sauer in the government’s Supreme Court stay application, “were in progress” but blocked by Illston’s earlier preliminary injunction.","Since taking office in January, one of President Donald Trump’s priorities has been restructuring the federal workforce, including by significantly reducing the number of federal employees. In three separate challenges to the Trump administration’s reductions in force, the Supreme Court – on its emergency docket – has blocked rulings by federal judges that required the government to reinstate removed employees or barred it from carrying out firings.

After the Supreme Court issued its rulings, the three cases returned to the lower courts, where litigation continues. In at least two of the cases, although the proceedings were still in a preliminary stage, the government carried out its reductions in force after the Supreme Court’s orders.

OPM v. AFGE

In Office of Personnel Management v. American Federation of Government Employees, the Supreme Court agreed to block an order by a federal judge in San Francisco that required the government to reinstate more than 16,000 newly hired employees fired from six agencies (the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, the Interior, and the Treasury).

The lawsuit was filed in February by a group of challengers that included nonprofits, government-employee unions, and local governments. They contended that the “radical transformation” of the federal workforce that Trump seeks to implement through these reductions in force exceeds his powers under the Constitution. Moreover, they contended, the Office of Personnel Management did not have the power to order other agencies to carry out large-scale reductions in force.

Senior U.S. District Judge William Alsup agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction in mid-March that directed the agencies to immediately bring back the 16,000 probationary employees who were fired – that is, employees who have been newly hired for a job, normally within the past year.

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court on March 24, asking the justices to put Alsup’s order on hold. The court granted that request on April 8. It explained that the nonprofits in the case did not have a legal right to sue (known as standing) to challenge the firings, and noted that Alsup had concluded that he likely did not have the power to hear the claims by the government-employee unions.

On April 18, Alsup ruled that the government-employee unions do have a legal right to sue to seek temporary relief. He issued a second preliminary injunction that barred OPM from directing other federal agencies to fire any federal employees or groups of employees, prohibited agencies from using the form letter that OPM had provided for them to use in firing people, and required agencies to provide employees who had been fired using a form letter created by OPM with a letter stating that they had not been fired because of their performance.

Alsup explained that “[t]here is much less need now for an order reinstating probationary employees than there was in March — when the district court did order reinstatement.” This is particularly true, he noted, because OPM had “re-circulated a revised version of the January 20 memo, which” made clear that agencies, rather than OPM, “have ultimate decision-making authority over, and have responsibility for, such personnel actions.” “So, if any reinstated employees are now terminated (yet again),” Alsup concluded, “it will be because the agency has made the decision to do so, not because OPM directed it.”

The Trump administration appealed Alsup’s second preliminary injunction to the court of appeals, which on Aug. 19 heard oral arguments on both preliminary injunctions.

Trump v. AFGE

In Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees, the court temporarily paused an order by a federal judge in San Francisco that barred the Trump administration from implementing an executive order calling for mass reductions in the federal workforce at 22 agencies.

Senior U.S. District Judge Susan Illston had issued a preliminary injunction on May 22 that prohibited the government from going forward with any reductions in force and required it to provide the challengers – a group of unions, nonprofits, and local governments – with documents related to the RIFs. Eight days later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit denied an emergency request from the Trump administration to stay Illston’s order.

But on July 8, the Supreme Court put Illston’s order on hold, with only Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting. In her view, Illston’s order was simply a “temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo” that was nevertheless “no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion in which she emphasized that the court had not weighed in on whether any specific RIF plan violates the law. Instead, she stressed, Illston could “consider those questions in the first instance.”

On July 14, the Trump administration told Illston that the Supreme Court’s July 8 order “effectively ends this case,” and that it planned to file a motion to dismiss (which it did one week later). “The plain import of the Supreme Court’s decision,” the government wrote, “is that Plaintiffs must await specific RIFs from particular agencies and then bring challenges to those RIFs (if they can establish jurisdiction and identify a viable cause of action).”

In an order on July 18, Illston rejected the government’s suggestion that the case was over in light of the Supreme Court’s order. Illston required the government to provide the challengers with agency RIF and reorganization plans, but allowed it to do so confidentially, and she instructed the Trump administration to file a list of the 40 RIFs at 17 agencies that, according to U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer in the government’s Supreme Court stay application, “were in progress” but blocked by Illston’s earlier preliminary injunction.

The government went to the 9th Circuit, which on July 23 granted an emergency motion for an immediate administrative stay – that is, a temporary pause to give the court time to act – of Illston’s July 18 order. At an Aug. 21 hearing on the government’s request, an attorney representing the Trump administration told the three-judge panel that he believed “that some RIF notices have been sent out” in the wake of the Supreme Court’s order but said that he did not “know the number.”

Illston has scheduled a hearing on the government’s motion to dismiss for Sept. 12.

McMahon v. New York

In McMahon v. New York, the Supreme Court granted the government’s request to temporarily pause an order by a Boston judge that required the Department of Education to reinstate nearly 1,400 employees who had been fired as part of the department’s efforts to reduce the size of its workforce.

The dispute began in March, when the department announced its plans to fire 1,378 employees. Two separate lawsuits – one filed by a group of 19 states led by New York, the other filed by a group of public school districts and teachers’ unions – ensued, challenging both the reduction in force and broader plans by Secretary Linda McMahon to dismantle the department.

U.S. District Judge Myong Joun on May 22 issued a preliminary injunction that instructed the Department of Education to reinstate employees who were terminated as part of the reduction in force and barred it from implementing executive orders on the dismantling or restructuring of the department. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit turned down the Trump administration’s request to freeze Joun’s preliminary injunction while it appealed.

The Trump administration went next to the Supreme Court, asking the justices on June 6 to intervene. Just over a month later, the court granted that request.

Sotomayor penned a 19-page dissent that was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Jackson. She wrote that although presidents do not have the power to eliminate a government department created by Congress to carry out duties prescribed by law, Trump “has made clear that he” impermissibly “intends to close the Department without Congress’s involvement.”

After the Supreme Court’s July 14 order putting Joun’s preliminary injunction on hold, litigation continued in the lower courts, where the 1st Circuit had already set a briefing schedule for the Trump administration’s appeal of the preliminary injunction. On Aug. 14, lawyers for some of the challengers filed a letter to inform the court of appeals that they had asked Joun, and he had agreed, to issue an order indicating that he would lift the preliminary injunction if the case were returned to the district court. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s July 14 order, the challengers explained, “the Department of Education put into effect the RIFs that had been enjoined,” so “that the injunction therefore could no longer have the intended effect of preserving the status quo at the Department pending the conclusion of the litigation.” The challengers also asked the court of appeals to freeze the briefing on the government’s appeal of the preliminary injunction, but there has not yet been any action on that request.

Meanwhile, back in the district court, Joun entered an order in late August setting a schedule for litigation on the merits of the challengers’ claims – which contests both the RIFs and the dismantling of the Department of Education – to move forward into the fall.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Trumpimmunity-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 18:57:15.763150

Nearly 40 Senate Democrats, including Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), signed a letter last week calling out the Trump administration’s targeting of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients in its move to increase deportation.

The DACA program, implemented more than a decade ago, allows for some immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to work and live in the country without fearing deportation. DACA recipients are “not considered to be unlawfully present” in the country while their DACA status is in effect, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

In a press release Friday, Heinrich and Luján’s offices condemned a recent statement from Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in which they said she contradicted public DHS guidance.

“Illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) are not automatically protected from deportation,” McLaughlin said, according to the press release.

The letter, addressed to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, urges her to correct McLaughlin’s statement.

The letter cites DHS guidance indicating that “an individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.”

In June, Heinrich and Luján were part of a group of 41 Senate Democrats who urged the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to resume processing new DACA applications.

In July, Heinrich introduced the Project DREAMer Confidentiality Act to protect DACA recipients’ private information from being used against them.

Homeland Security officials on Monday said they intend to target “criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois” in a new immigration operation after an Illinois woman was killed in a drunk driving crash allegedly involving an undocumented immigrant early this year.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced what they are dubbing as Operation Midway Blitz, which the department says will “honor” Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was killed in a January car crash.

Julio Cucul Bol, whom authorities said entered into the country with false documents, has been charged in connection with Abraham’s death.

Abraham’s death was also cited in June by Republican lawmakers during an appearance by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a U.S. House Oversight Committee hearing.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a social media post.

The operation comes as local officials and communities continue to brace for a possible deployment of National Guard troops or other armed military personnel in Chicago after U.S. Military officials granted immigration enforcement agents access to the Naval Station Great Lakes, located about 35 miles north of the city.

Mayor Brandon Johnson on Monday said his office has not received any word from federal authorities about any “enhanced immigration action.”

“We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE’s track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,” Johnson said in a statement Monday.

Johnson pointed to the case of a a 4-year-old American citizen with kidney cancer who was swept up in an ICE operation and sent to Honduras and said there have been more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office.

“Because of these incidents and more,” he said, “we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.”

U.S. Sen Dick Durbin called the planned operation “a waste of money” he believes will “stoke fear and represent another failed attempt at a distraction.”

“To the hardworking immigrant families who are now scared to send your children to school, go to the hospital, or report crimes to the police: we stand with you,” the Illinois Democrat said in a statement. “Please know that a majority of Americans do not support these anti-immigrant actions by the Trump Administration. While the President exhibits disdain for immigrants, Chicago embraces them as family who help make our economy thrive and our city strong.”

President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he plans to send troops into Chicago as part of his promise to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”

While those deployments have not yet been carried out, at least five people were reportedly detained by immigration officials on Chicago’s Southwest Side over the weekend, according to Ald. Jeylú Gutiérrez (14th Ward) who said it appeared that “reports indicate that these operations are still ongoing.”

“This is an attack on our hardworking people and our community as a whole, not just those who are undocumented” she said.

On Monday, Trump said in a social media post that he wants to “help the people of Chicago, not hurt them,” after six people were killed in separate shootings across the city over the weekend.

“Only the Criminals will be hurt!” he said. “We can move fast and stop this madness. The City and State have not been able to do the job. People of Illinois should band together and DEMAND PROTECTION. IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!! ACT NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!”

Trump over the weekend also amplified his deployment promises by posting a parody image from the Vietnam War film “Apocalypse Now” featuring a ball of flames as helicopters zoom over the nation’s third-largest city.

“I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” Trump wrote on his social media site. “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

Pritzker responded to the post, calling Trump a “wannabe dictator.”

Trump later downplayed the language in the post, saying Sunday that his administration is “not going to war,” while adding he instead plans to “clean up our cities.”

Trump’s Immigration Czar Tom Homan on Sunday also said on CNN that the president intends to take action “in most sanctuary cities” sometime this week, claiming “That’s where the problem is.”

Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance prohibits local police officers from cooperating with federal immigration agents unless they are presented with a valid criminal warrant, while the Illinois TRUST Act similarly prohibits local law enforcement statewide from participating in immigration enforcement.

The Trump administration has repeatedly used rhetoric tying violent crime in Chicago to the issue of illegal immigration.

During the first eight months of the year, homicides are down 31%, as compared with the same period a year ago, reaching the lowest level since 2014, according to Chicago Police Department data. In addition, the number of people shot has dropped 36% so far this year, according to CPD data.

Studies have shown immigrants have consistently been incarcerated at lower rates than U.S.-born citizens.

Suburban Actions

The city of Evanston on Monday said it received word late Sunday about the “likelihood that federal immigration agents will be present in our community in the coming days,” with city officials saying they “take this potentiality seriously.”

“In Evanston, we welcome our immigrant and refugee neighbors and protect each other,” the city said in a statement. “The City has not requested the presence of federal immigration officers targeting our community members, and we will do all we can to safeguard our community and keep Evanston families together.”

The city said all Evanston Police Department officers will wear uniforms or vests clearly marked with “Evanston Police” to allow for quick identification, clarity and public trust, and called on residents to report any sighting of ICE agents to the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

“During this time of uncertainty and fear, it is critical to maintain a strong sense of community, as well as provide accurate information,” the city said in its statement. “The City stands alongside the community during these challenging times and will share well-sourced information from credible sources.”

Unlike say, the Colorado Constitution’s thorough description of water rights, the Arizona Constitution merely states a negative, namely that common law riparian rights do not hold in Arizona.","One of the younger states and the last contiguous state to join the Union, Arizona has a relatively short constitutional history. It continues to use the constitution that went into effect with its statehood in 1912. But it is also one that, over time, has been modified to address changing preferences in executive power, labor relations, and abortion.

In contrast to the moderately conservative constitution developed almost concurrently in New Mexico, Arizona’s founding document was regarded by some at the time as dangerously progressive. William Howard Taft, for example, vetoed statehood on grounds the constitution enabled permitting the recall of judges, which Taft feared would lead to the destruction of judicial independence and even constitutional enforcement altogether.

A Populist Constitution from a Progressive Era

The drafters of the Arizona Constitution, influenced by the state’s origins in the Progressive era and reflecting the ideology of progressive states’ rights that sought to wield police powers on behalf of labor free from federal intervention, included many pro-labor provisions. These are found mostly in Article XVIII, appropriately titled Labor. Similarly, Article XV establishes a Corporation Commission as an independent agency to deal with regulations related to public service corporations, and information collection for corporations more broadly.

This does not mean that the state’s founders were fundamentally hostile to capital: Michael Cunniff, a primary constitutional mover, was himself a mine owner who disavowed socialism and had an ambivalent relationship to labor unions, even as he, along with the state’s first governor, George Hunt, was one of the two primary leaders of the state’s progressives. Instead, the charter of the Copper State is better thought of as hostile to “concentrations of power” and big institutions in general, preeminent Arizona Constitution scholar John Leshy has suggested.

Some point to Arizona’s right-to-work amendment (passed in 1946 with the help of a pre-Senate Barry Goldwater) as marking the moment Arizona’s political orientation shifted from progressive to conservative. But there is a way to understand that as consistent with, rather than a repudiation of, Arizona’s founding ideas: Big business was the dominant factor in the state’s economy and politics in the 1910s, but reforms including the Wagner Act of 1935 empowered labor unions such that skepticism of concentrated power could plausibly be directed leftward in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Similarly, the immigration skepticism that features in several provisions suggests a similar continuity even as the political valence has changed. In other words, one might think of the Arizona constitutional tradition as more fundamentally populist than progressive, especially as the latter has shifted in meaning.

The recall provision in Article VIII was, at least when applied to judges, the most provocative of the structures incorporated from other reforms of the era. Like other western states, Arizona also included an initiative and referendum, both of which are in use today. Voters have pared back initiatives in recent decades, however. In 2004, they enacted a requirement that future initiatives identify funding sources, and in 2022 they imposed a supermajority ratification requirement for any ballot measure that would increase taxes. The latter creates something of a parallel with a 1992 amendment requiring a supermajority of legislators to approve tax increases.

Article XXI makes the Arizona Constitution extremely easy to amend: either sufficient signatures or bare majorities of both houses to propose, and a mere majority of voters to ratify. Even so, it has been amended far less frequently than, say, neighboring California, with its similarly flexible process. In 2024, for example, Arizona voters rejected six legislatively referred constitutional amendments and one citizen-initiated amendment, accepting only a provision establishing a state constitutional right to abortion.

One feature that has been occasionally amended is the state’s plural executive, which again reflects concern with concentrations of power. A plural executive is one where multiple officials — a governor, an attorney general, and so on — are independently elected and so do not all come from the same party. In Arizona, the secretary of state has, until recently, succeeded a governor who dies or leaves office during their term, raising the possibility of the successor having a different party affiliation. This possibility led Arizonans in 2022 to approve a moderate exception to the plural executive: a lieutenant governor running on a joint ticket with the governor, which will go into effect in 2026.

Declaration of Rights

The discussion in the 1910 convention explicitly recognized that, in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the incorporation of the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights through the 14th Amendment, Arizona’s Declaration of Rights would be the primary check on state government. But the convention participants did not start from scratch.

The initiative, referendum, and recall was largely borrowed from and heavily associated with Oregon. But that was not the only area in which the Pacific states influenced Arizona’s drafters. The Declaration of Rights was originally taken from Washington state, though it has since been modified. It has less of its own political theory than other state constitutions, with those sections all widely found in other texts.

Section I, for example, on the importance of fundamental rights in a republican government, was drawn from Washington’s document, but uses language dating back to Virginia’s Declaration of Rights. Section II, a statement of Lockean social contract theory, and Section III, declaring the U.S. Constitution the supreme law, come from Washington as well.

Beyond that, the list of rights is similar to those of the U.S. Constitution, and state courts have often, but not always, treated analogous sections as duplicative of federal protections. A prominent recent example: A concurrence by Justice Clint Bolick to a major 2019 free speech case, Brush and Nib v. Phoenix, proposed using the state’s own speech text — that “Every person may freely speak, write, and publish on all subjects” — to deal with the tension between public accommodations law and the free speech rights of businesses creating expressive goods and services. However, the majority of the Arizona Supreme Court instead chose to rely on the First Amendment in reaching a result and reasoning akin to what the U.S. Supreme Court later adopted in 303 Creative v. Elenis in 2023.

Other rights in the Arizona Constitution use much more explicit language and thus are less ambiguous than analogous federal texts. As with some roughly 35 states, the Arizona Constitution has a robust, explicitly individual right to keep and bear arms. Reflecting the labor tensions at the state’s foundation, however, that provision holds that the right cannot be construed to authorize “individuals or corporations to organize, maintain, or employ an armed body of men.” In other words, it does not provide a right for a mining company to hire armed strikebreakers, for example.

Like other western states that were required as a price of statehood to include so-called Baby Blaine provisions that prohibit direct government aid to religiously affiliated schools, Arizona is more restrictive of state funding toward religious institutions than federal law. Two related provisions explicitly limit such expenditure, though, as in other states, their enforceability is in doubt since the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Carson v. Makin, which held that states could not, consistent with the free exercise clause of the U.S. Constitution, add conditions excluding religious participants from generally available tuition benefits.

Significant changes to the Declaration of Rights since statehood include a lengthy victim’s Bill of Rights provision and successive constraints on bail, as well as limits on affirmative action that went beyond the then-existent federal doctrine. In response to Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s HealthOrganization ending federal protection for abortion, and the Arizona Supreme Court’s decision that Dobbs reinstated the territorial prohibition on abortion, Arizona voters approved an amendment to the Declaration of Rights, codifying a right to abortion in 2024.

As one might expect from a state whose politics have long been roiled by large waves of immigration, the Arizona Constitution includes several provisions on that topic. Two sections of the Arizona Declaration of Rights limit bail and punitive damage claims by undocumented immigrants. Another establishes English as the official language of state government. The first version of this, passed in 1988, was invalidated by the Arizona Supreme Court in 1998’s Ruiz v. Hull, in part on federal free speech grounds, leading to an updated version in 2006.

Blending both the nativist streak and protection of organized labor, the original constitution limited the employment of non-citizens in public labor. A federal district court decision striking this down on equal protection grounds was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973, though later rulings have, some believe, restored the legality. A parallel statutory provision, the so-called 80–20 law that limited private workforces to no more than 20 percent immigrant labor and was an early instance of an initiated statute under the state constitution’s direct democracy, was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in a major 1915 case, Truax v. Raich, a case whose complicated reasoning invoked federal preemption over immigration, equal protection, and substantive due process.

Despite the strong tradition of states’ rights in Arizona’s political culture, embodied at the founding by progressives Cunniff and Hunt and in the mid-20th century by conservatives Goldwater, William Rehnquist, and Sandra Day O’Connor, Arizona strikingly does not have a 10th Amendment analogue explicitly reserving the police powers to the states. (In this, it is unlike other Mountain West states. The constitutions of Colorado, Montana, and New Mexico all feature such a provision in their declaration or bill of rights.) Despite being structural rather than a right per se, the Declaration of Rights does constitutionalize the anti-commandeering principle that Arizona cannot be forced to assist federal actions the state believes to be unconstitutional.

One right that does not appear in the declaration, even though it’s of critical importance in the West, is water rights. Unlike say, the Colorado Constitution’s thorough description of water rights, the Arizona Constitution merely states a negative, namely that common law riparian rights do not hold in Arizona. Efforts to elaborate water rights foundered at the convention, leading the drafters to compromise simply on what the right would not be.

Conversations with Federal Constitutionalism

Two Arizona trial court cases — with opinions by future Arizona Supreme Court justices Fred Struckmeyer and Charles Bernstein — in 1953 and 1954 were effectively Arizona’s own Brown v. Board of Education, coming down just before the landmark federal case and based on the state constitution. In Phillips v. Phoenix Union High School and Heard v. Davis, the judges cited the Arizona Constitution to strike down the state’s legislative regime allowing but not mandating local districts to implement segregation. Both judges, whose opinions were reviewed by the Brown Court, rooted their decisions primarily in issues of delegation to local governments and to the legislature’s obligation to provide a system of common schools — in other words, structural features of the Arizona Constitution.

Arizona has been one of the leading states in innovating school choice policies, and those policies, which have been imitated elsewhere, have been shaped by the Arizona Constitution and state court rulings. Article IX, Section 10 reiterates and extends the logic of the Baby Blaine amendments, joining it with concerns about private favoritism, by more broadly insisting that, “No tax shall be laid or appropriation of public money made in aid of any church, or private or sectarian school, or any public service corporation.” This helps explain why the state has utilized individual educational savings accounts and designated income tax credits rather than vouchers, after the latter was declared unconstitutional by the Arizona Supreme Court in 2009’s Cain v. Horne, with the former having been upheld in 1999 in Kotterman v. Killian.

Perhaps the best known recent decision of the Arizona Supreme Court — certainly the most widely covered — was Planned Parenthood v. Hazelrigg in 2024. While not strictly a constitutional case, the decision was in the shadow of Article XXII, Section 2, which explicitly maintains territorial laws until revoked by the state legislature. In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court concluded that the state’s territorial proscription of abortion, which dated from 1864 and had been suspended under Roe v. Wade, went back into effect after Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. (The Hazelrigg case largely focused on statutory treatment of later abortion laws, which the court found had been intended to supplement rather than displace the original law, and thus, per the Constitution, territorial law held).

The backlash to this decision led to an almost immediate repeal of the territorial statute by the legislature and, soon after, a citizen initiative adding an explicit right to abortion in a new section of the Declaration of Rights in 2024. Progressive activists angry with the court’s ruling attempted to use the state’s judicial retention elections to vote out the justices who had re-activated the territorial abortion ban. Meanwhile, conservatives in the Arizona legislature proposed an amendment to do away with retention elections except in limited circumstances. The amendment would have instituted a judicial selection method much closer to the federal process — and, proponents argued, would have strengthened judicial independence by insulating judges from the opinions of voters. Voters rejected that amendment in 2024.

That back-and-forth — implicating multiple parts of the Arizona Constitution, from its initiatives to its judicial selection to its amendment procedure — demonstrates the continued vitality of the constitution to the state’s governance. And as a state that has shaped, perhaps disproportionately, national politics in the 20th and 21st centuries such as by helping to revive a discourse of federalism and, more recently, launching school choice policies, the influence of the Arizona Constitution is not confined to the Copper State.",https://statecourtreport.org/sites/default/files/styles/1050x525/public/2023-08/2023_06_SCR_Issues_Checks_Balances_Resize.jpg?itok=YqkZkygX,N,,2025-09-08 18:56:56.810019

This could mean a return to numerous arrests at workplaces such as home improvement stores, car washes, manufacturing businesses and other locations.

So what are your rights in the wake of the high court decision?

The court ruling in itself does not change basic due process for those arrested by immigration officials.

At issue is a July decision by a federal judge in L.A. U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, said she found a sufficient amount of evidence that agents were using race, language, a person’s vocation or the location they were at, such as a car wash, Home Depot, swap meet or row of street vendors, to form “reasonable suspicion” — the legal standard needed to detain someone. Frimpong said the reliance on those factors, either alone or in combination, does not meet the requirements of the 4th Amendment.

The American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed a lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

The plaintiffs argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn’t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful, warrantless arrests.

In a 6-3 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday granted an emergency appeal and lifted the judge’s order that barred “roving patrols” from snatching people off Southern California streets based on how they look, what language they speak, what work they do or where they happen to be.

It’s unclear what happens next. Immigration raids slowed in L.A. after the ruling but did not stop completely.

The basics

If you’re home alone or with family members and you hear a knock at the door, check the window, security camera or peephole so you can identify whether ICE agents are outside.

When you find yourself in this situation, the first step is to keep your door closed and locked, advised advocacy groups and legal experts.

You must open your door and allow agents inside your home if they present a valid search warrant.

Advocates say agents must identify themselves and show you the warrant by putting it against the window or slipping it under your door.

You have the right to remain silent.

For example, if you’re asked about your immigration status, where you were born or how you entered the United States, you may refuse to answer or remain silent, according to the National Immigration Justice Center.

You can simply say, “I want to remain silent” or “I am exercising my right to remain silent.”

Experts advise that you are not required to sign documents or provide personal information.

If you are detained or taken into custody, you have the right to reach out to an attorney and receive a phone call from an attorney.

You can prove you have a lawyer by giving the officer your signed Form G-28, a federal document that details your lawyer’s information and your consent to their legal representation.

What if I am detained?

If you are detained or taken into custody, you have the right to reach out to an attorney and receive a phone call from an attorney.

You can prove you have a lawyer by giving the officer your signed Form G-28, a federal document that details your lawyer’s information and your consent to their legal representation.

Don’t have a lawyer? You can ask the ICE official for a list of pro-bono lawyers.

You can also ask to contact the consulate which may be able to assist you in locating a lawyer.

Get familiar with the rules of the detention center you’ve been placed in. You can do so by asking for a copy of the Detainee Handbook to understand the detention center’s rules, your rights and how you can communicate with loved ones.

The book is available in 19 languages, including English, Spanish, Arabic, Bengali, French, Haitian Creole, Hindi, K’iche’ (Quiché)/Kxlantzij, Mam, Portuguese, Pulaar, Punjabi, Q’eqchi’ (Kekchí), Romanian, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese and Wolof.

Full guide: What to do if detained by ICE?

What if a loved one is detained?

If your loved one was detained by immigration enforcement agents, reach out to immigrant advocacy groups that can provide referrals, information, resources (such as food and financial assistance) and, in some cases, direct support.

A network of local rapid response hotlines has been established to document immigration enforcement activity and help connect those affected to legal services and other types of support, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice.

After or before you’ve made the call for help, gather these important documents that pertain to the detained family member:

Birth certificate

Medical records

Past visa applications

Receipt and approval notices for any immigration applications the person has previously submitted

You’ll also need to gather the following personal information that will be used either by you or your legal representation to locate your detained loved one:

A-Number, also known as “alien registration number,” which is assigned by the Department of Homeland Security to noncitizens who apply to live and work in the U.S. The seven- to nine-digit number can be found on a green card, work permit or other immigration document.

Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.""","The Department of Homeland Security said it was moving forward with ramped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago this week in an effort dubbed Operation Midway Blitz.

""This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American Streets,"" the department said in a statement Monday. The department said the mission would be carried out ""in honor of Katie Abraham,"" who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run crash that happened in Urbana, about 130 miles south of Chicago, earlier this year.

Spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the operation ""will target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago.""

The department did not specify how long the operation is expected to last, but a spokesperson with ICE said, in a statement: ""ICE has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city. ... We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners from across Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.""

In a post on X, Gov. JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of failing to communicate or coordinate their immigration enforcement effort with state and local leaders.

""Once again, this isn't about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination — yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks. Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians,"" he wrote.

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the city has not received any official notice from the Trump administration about its immigration crackdown.

""We are concerned about potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents. Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.""

The mayor urged anyone concerned about the immigration crackdown in Chicago to visit a ""know your rights"" resource hub on the city's website, at Chicago.gov/KYR.

The announcement of the immigration operation in Chicago comes after President Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, invoked imagery from the movie ""Apocalypse Now"" and wrote, ""'I love the smell of deportations in the morning ...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.""

Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the Trump administration of ramping up its campaign ""to arrest hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions.""

""These actions don't make us safer. They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction,"" Durbin said in a statement.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he's targeted for expanded federal enforcement, including Los Angeles and Washington. The move marks the latest flashpoint in a broader national struggle over how far the federal government can push local authorities to cooperate with its immigration agenda.

The Court did not formally explain its decision. It overruled two lower courts which had imposed a temporary restraining order after concluding that ICE had likely violated the Fourth Amendment by targeting suspects based primarily on race or ethnicity and language.

In a concurring statement agreeing with the decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh explained that he believed the government had a “fair prospect of success on the merits” in the litigation and should not be hindered in using the strategy for now.

“Apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” Kavanaugh wrote. “Under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a relevant factor.”

He also questioned whether the advocacy groups and individual plaintiffs challenging the government policy had sufficient standing to bring the legal challenge to begin with.

The Court’s three liberal justices dissented.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision a “grave misuse” of the Court’s emergency docket, rather than let the case continue to play out in lower courts.

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,” she wrote.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said on X the ruling is a “win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.”

“DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor,” she posted.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers have said he intends to ask the Supreme Court to review the jury’s $5 million verdict and liability finding.
They were in the lingerie department when Mr. Trump forced Ms. Carroll into a dressing room and shoved her against a wall, Ms. Carroll said.","A federal appeals court on Monday upheld an $83.3 million jury award against President Trump for defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll in 2019, after she accused him of a decades-old rape in a Manhattan department store — an attack for which he was separately found liable for sexual abuse.

The court also rejected Mr. Trump’s argument that the Supreme Court’s decision last year affording presidential immunity for official acts barred a finding of liability in Ms. Carroll’s lawsuit.

The unsigned ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan was unanimous.

The president had assailed Ms. Carroll after she accused him of the assault, saying her claim was “totally false” and that she was trying to sell a book. He continued his verbal attacks on her on social media, at news conferences and even during the trial, in which Ms. Carroll’s lawyers had urged the jury to impose a large award in order to stop him.

A large portion of the verdict — $65 million — consisted of punitive damages after the jury found Mr. Trump had acted with malice.

In its ruling on Monday, the appeals court said the record in the case supported the finding by the trial judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, that “the degree of reprehensibility of Mr. Trump’s conduct was remarkably high, perhaps unprecedented.”

The court noted that Mr. Trump “never wavered or relented in his public attacks” on Ms. Carroll, that he had issued statements castigating her “as a politically and financially motivated liar, insinuating that she was too unattractive for him to have sexually assaulted her and threatening that she would ‘pay dearly’ for speaking out.”

The court said Ms. Carroll was subjected to public harassment as a result of Mr. Trump’s statements, including death threats and threats of physical injury. Mr. Trump’s attacks continued throughout the lengthy litigation, the court said, and “became more extreme and frequent.”

The court cited one statement, two days into the trial, in which Mr. Trump “proclaimed that he would continue to defame Carroll ‘a thousand times.’”

The appeals court said “the jury was entitled to find that Trump would not stop defaming Carroll unless he was subjected to a substantial financial penalty.”

In December, a different three-judge panel of the Second Circuit unanimously upheld a separate civil verdict Ms. Carroll won against Mr. Trump in 2023. In that case, a jury awarded her $5 million in damages after finding him liable for sexually abusing Ms. Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s and defaming her in statements he made in 2022, after he was out of office.

Mr. Trump’s lawyers have said he intends to ask the Supreme Court to review the jury’s $5 million verdict and liability finding.

On Monday, Aaron Harison, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team, said in a statement that the American people stand with Mr. Trump and demand “an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system.”

Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said that “we look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done.”

Ms. Carroll has not yet received any damages that the juries in the two trials have said Mr. Trump owes her.

Ms. Carroll testified in Manhattan federal court in 2023 that she ran into Mr. Trump at Bergdorf’s in the mid-1990s, where he asked her for help buying a present for a female friend. They were in the lingerie department when Mr. Trump forced Ms. Carroll into a dressing room and shoved her against a wall, Ms. Carroll said. He then pulled down her tights and inserted his finger and then his penis into her vagina, she testified.

Although Ms. Carroll had accused Mr. Trump of rape, the jury in May 2023 found that he had sexually abused her but did not find that he had raped her.

In Mr. Trump’s appeal of the $83.3 million defamation verdict, his lawyers cited the July 2024 Supreme Court decision, arguing that “presidential immunity forecloses any liability here and requires the complete dismissal of all claims.”

Judge Kaplan had ruled that Mr. Trump waived any immunity argument when he did not raise it early in the litigation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/29/multimedia/00met-carroll-appeal-hwfv/00met-carroll-appeal-hwfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 16:57:46.448772

The Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue carrying out immigration raids in California after advocacy groups argued that federal authorities were stopping suspected illegal immigrants without a valid reason.

The high court's 6-3 decision, issued along ideological lines, is temporary while the case proceeds in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

It came after a federal judge in July blocked Immigration and Customs Enforcement from conducting raids in Los Angeles County, finding the plaintiffs likely would succeed in their argument that the raids violated the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit upheld that order, leading the Trump administration to turn to the Supreme Court.

APPEALS COURT DENIES TRUMP ADMIN'S REQUEST TO LIFT LIMITS ON LOS ANGELES IMMIGRATION RAIDS

The Supreme Court's order is a major victory for the Trump administration as it enacts an aggressive deportation agenda across the country. California, one of four major southern border states, saw high-profile protests and riots crop up over the summer in response to ICE's raids and the National Guard, which Trump deployed to Los Angeles in June at the objection of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

The immigrant rights groups and labor unions who sued alleged that ICE was stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion. ICE authorities unconstitutionally showed up at farms and car washes and targeted people based on their race and language, the plaintiffs alleged.

TRUMP SAYS NATIONWIDE IMMIGRATION RAIDS ON THE WAY, RIOTERS TO FACE 'GREATER FORCE' THAN LA

The Supreme Court's majority did not include an explanation, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, offered a concurring opinion in which he said that the reasonable suspicion requirement was not a high bar and that ICE could have very well met that bar. A combination of factors, including race, could provide authorities with reasonable suspicion to stop a person and inquire about their immigration status, Kavanaugh said.

""To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors,"" Kavanaugh wrote.

The Department of Homeland Security celebrated the emergency decision on Monday in a statement, saying it would not allow Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, to protect illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds.

""A win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law,"" a DHS spokesperson said. ""DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor.""

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement ICE would now be able to continue ""roving patrols"" without ""judicial micromanagement.""

TRUMP ADMIN ENDS DEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO LOS ANGELES

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Obama appointee, filed a dissent, saying the emergency order greenlighting the raids was ""troubling"" because the majority gave no explanation for the move, which she said was ""unconscionably irreconcilable"" with the Constitution.

""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,"" Sotomayor wrote.

Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.

The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during hisadministration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor. Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

Department of Homeland Security attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that the order wrongly restricted the factors that ICE agents can use when deciding who to stop.

The Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hard-line immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines. The number of immigration raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store.

The plaintiffs argued that her order only prevents federal agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion, something that aligns with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

“Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.”

The Trump administration said the order is too restrictive, “threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer also argued the order can’t stand under the high court’s recent decision restricting universal injunctions, though the plaintiffs disagreed.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. Its covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents as he yelled, “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

In a post on social platform X, DHS said the operation was in honor of Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old woman from one of Chicago’s northwest suburbs who was killed in a hit-and-run crash in January by 29-year-old Julio Cucul-Bol, a citizen of Guatemala in the U.S. illegally, according to NewsNation affiliate WGN.

According to the Urbana Police Department, Cucul-Bol has been charged with leaving the scene of a crash resulting in death, aggravated driving under the influence resulting in death, and reckless homicide. He has also been charged on the federal level by the Justice Department with possession of a false permanent resident card, possession of a false social security card, false use of passport, and making a false statement on a bank application.

“This ICE operation will target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” DHS said.

The upcoming operation comes as the Trump administration has made promises to ramp up an immigration crackdown in Chicago, as well as the possibility of sending in the National Guard. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have previously pushed back on the idea.

The unsigned order is a victory for President Donald Trump’s dramatic immigration raids, which frequently have been conducted by armed, masked agents in camouflage at farms, Home Depot parking lots and car washes, sweeping up people who appear to be Latino and or at places that offer low-wage jobs that may not require proof of eligibility to work in the U.S.

The order will allow the Department of Homeland Security to once again step up its sweeps in the Los Angeles area, and also throws into question a ruling by a federal judge in Fresno banning similar activity in the Central Valley.

The court’s six conservative justices voted to overturn the July 11 temporary restraining order against the practice issued by Los Angeles U.S. District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong. The practice will now be allowed to continue as the case plays out in Frimpong’s court.

The ruling prompted a sharp rebuke from liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who said she would not stand idly by as constitutional protections against arbitrary arrests were lost.

While the six judges in the majority did not explain their ruling on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a concurring opinion in which he said that it was reasonable to believe that illegal immigrants could be found at car washes, day laborer sites and other locations targeted by immigration officials. Los Angeles, he said, has a significant population of people who are in the country illegally, and many speak Spanish and “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture and construction.”

He also supported the use of ethnicity as a factor in deciding whom to arrest.

“To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” he wrote. “Under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Moreover, he said, the harm done to the government’s efforts to enforce immigration law was less than the harm done to individuals who might be “briefly detained” before showing the agents that they are legally in the country.

The court’s three liberal justices disagreed strongly in a dissent written by Sotomayor.

She wrote that the court majority’s ruling was an “extraordinary step” to take in opposition to a court decision that ruled the government’s actions were unconstitutional under the 4th Amendment’s prohibition of illegal search and seizure.

“We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish and appears to work a low-wage job,” she wrote.

“Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,” Sotomayor wrote.

The judge’s order had applied to a seven-county region in Southern California — Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo — where nearly 10 million Latinos live and close to that number speak a language other than English at home, according to court filings.

Clearly, if the grand jury refuses to do so, and the government then “simply impanel[s] new grand juries” until it finds one sufficiently pliable, this represents a violation of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee.","Recently, the Department of Justice has been striking out in a surprising field: grand juries. In D.C., the government has tried—and failed—on at least six separate occasions to secure grand jury felony indictments. First, a grand jury rejected (three times) a proposed indictment of a protester for alleged assault of a federal officer. Next, a grand jury refused an indictment of the D.C. “sandwich thrower” for a felony assault on an officer. Separately, a grand jury balked at indicting a woman accused of posting threats to President Trump online; and finally, a grand jury declined to indict a man who described himself to police as drunk and intellectually disabled, and who allegedly threatened harm to President Trump while in custody. These rejections follow failed efforts by federal prosecutors in California to secure indictments related to immigration protests in Los Angeles.

In our experiences as a prosecutor and a public defender, this is unprecedented. Grand juries are used to determine if there is sufficient probable cause to formally charge a person with a crime; as such, the bar for returning an indictment is low. Indeed, it is nearly unheard of for a grand jury to fail even once to return an indictment (known as a “no true bill”), much less on three separate occasions. These actions upend the contemporary view of grand juries held by both prosecutors and defense attorneys, and raise the interesting possibility that—after a long period of being used primarily as an investigative tool by the government—the grand jury is returning to its roots as a “bulwark” against government overreach.

News reports indicate that, in response to these no true bills, high-ranking Justice Department officials have instructed prosecutors to “simply impanel new grand juries” if indictments are refused. Not only do such instructions directly contravene the Justice Manual, continuing to re-present charges until some grand jury panel eventually agrees to return an indictment also nullifies the intent behind the Fifth Amendment’s requirement of grand juries. What’s more, the Trump administration’s stated desire to use federal law enforcement officials for street-level crimes, combined with a maximalist approach to charging that appears to conflict with long-established Justice Department policy, means that the U.S. is likely to see more such no true bills in the future. This could have important implications—not only for prosecutions of protesters but also for targets of the administration’s avowed campaign of political retribution.

1 in 10,000: The Striking Nature of the Grand Juries’ Actions

The no true bills on both coasts represent a striking and relatively novel action by the grand jury. In our experience, it is extraordinarily rare for a grand jury to reject an indictment. Both sides in criminal cases generally treat the grand jury as part of an evidence-gathering process that can make a difference at trial rather than an independent decision-maker. Contemporary prosecutors tend to view grand juries primarily as an investigative tool, which allows the government to obtain evidence via subpoena and compel testimony from witnesses to build its case. For the defense, grand jury proceedings can yield prior witness statements helpful in implementing trial strategy and cross-examining witnesses, and, in rare instances, they can be a basis for dismissal or limiting the prosecution’s case to the theory approved by the grand jury. But once a federal prosecutor has decided to pursue an indictment, there is usually little suspense surrounding the outcome of the government’s presentation to the grand jury.

There are multiple reasons modern federal grand juries indict essentially every case presented to them. First, grand juries have a much lower standard of proof; unlike a trial (or “petit”) jury, which must find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence presented to grand juries must only meet the much lower probable cause standard. Second, unlike trial juries—which must be unanimous—grand juries can indict by a simple majority vote. Third, grand juries can hear evidence trial juries cannot, including hearsay. Finally, unlike trials, which are public and adversarial, grand jury presentations are secret and one-sided: The defendant cannot cross-examine witnesses. In fact, by law no one may be present except the government during the presentation of information to the grand jury.

While there isn’t available data on how many no true bills occurred in 2024, there is data available for 2010. In that year, only 11 of 162,000 proposed federal indictments were refused by grand juries. We have no reason to believe that the annual number of no true bills has increased markedly since that time; indeed, in our experiences as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, it was unheard of for a federal grand jury to fail to return an indictment. This precedent informs the conventional wisdom that a grand jury can “indict a ham sandwich” (in this case, the sandwich thrower appears to have used salami).

Overcharging and the Gatekeeping Role of the Grand Jury

Although the grand jury’s modern function has been largely investigative, this wasn’t always the case. Like the civil and criminal trial juries, the grand jury played an important role in founding-era grievances against the British monarchy. In 1734, the Crown failed to obtain a grand jury indictment of John Peter Zenger for publishing an editorial critical of the governor; the attempt to prosecute by information (a “highly unpopular” procedural maneuver) resulted in an acquittal. Similarly, grand jurors refused to indict leaders of the Stamp Act protests in 1765, and rejected efforts to indict the editors of the Boston Gazette in 1765. The grand jury was seen as “one of the ancient immunities and privileges of English liberty.” In light of the important role the grand jury had played in policing government overreach, the addition to the Fifth Amendment of the right to indictment by a grand jury in felony cases was “intended by the Anti-Federalists to be a check on federal authority.”

The same adherence to founding-era intentions is evident in the Supreme Court’s recent decisions bolstering the role of criminal and civil juries as a safeguard against government overreach. These decisions suggest that the institution of the grand jury as a bulwark against unjust criminal prosecution is due for revival if grand jurors continue to be faced with over-charged prosecutions of government critics or protesters. Grand juries, like civil and criminal trial juries, give ordinary citizens the opportunity to be heard before the government can take momentous actions against individuals, which is why de Tocqueville labeled the jury a political institution—a conclusion with which modern scholars concur.

Judge Learned Hand referred to the grand jury as “the voice of the community accusing its members, and the only protection from such accusation is in the conscience of that tribunal.” And the Supreme Court stated in 1960 that “[t]he very purpose of the requirement that a man be indicted by grand jury is to limit his jeopardy to offenses charged by a group of his fellow citizens acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge.” Even in cases concerned primarily with the grand jury’s investigative powers, the Court invoked its “historic role as a protective bulwark standing solidly between the ordinary citizen and an overzealous prosecutor” as a reason not to impose too many procedural burdens.

Thus, like civil and criminal trial juries, by constitutional design the grand jury interposes the citizenry between coercive executive power and the people. The framers would not have bothered to insist on constitutionalizing a rubber stamp. It may be that the willingness of grand jurors of the past to indict pretty much whomever was presented to them was at least in part a reflection of confidence the grand juries had in the fairness and independence of federal prosecutors—something that sadly is not the case today, as the administration has openly declared and publicly embraced using the Department of Justice to target its enemies.

It is therefore no coincidence that grand juries’ refusal to indict in our modern time echoes the refusal of 18th century grand juries to indict defendants: In both instances, there is a public perception that the government is engaging in overreach, using the power of prosecution to target its enemies rather than to fairly and justly carry out the law. If such prosecution continues, one can expect—and hope—that grand juries will continue to exercise their long-standing duty as a bulwark against government overreach. Below, we review the publicly known information about each of the failed indictments.

Striking Out in the Grand Jury: Case Studies

United States v. Sydney Reid

On July 23, the Justice Department filed a complaint charging Syndey Reid with violating 18 U.S.C. § 111(a). That section criminalizes any action which “forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with” a federal law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of their official duties. When the charged acts involve “physical contact,” the charges carry a potential maximum sentence of eight years.

According to the complaint, on July 22 the government arrested two alleged gang members. The two individuals were “released through the common intake entrance that is open to the public” to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. The FBI (presumably acting in support of ICE), took custody of the first individual. According to the complaint, Reid then walked up to the officers and began to record them. Federal officers told Reid to back up; an officer could allegedly “smell alcohol coming off Reid’s breath.” According to the filing, Reid then “inserted” herself between the second suspect and the agents. The critical part of the complaint states:

As REID was trying to get behind Officer Lang and impede the transfer of the second suspect by inserting herself between the second suspect and the agents, Officer Lang pushed REID against the wall and told her to stop. REID continued to struggle and fight with Officer Lang. Agent Bates came to Officer Lang’s assistance in trying to control REID. REID was flailing her arms and kicking and had to be pinned against a cement wall. ... During the struggle, REID forcefully pushed Agent Bates’s hand against the cement wall. This caused lacerations on the back side of Agent Bates’s left hand.

Reid was arrested the next day and released on conditions.

On Aug. 20, Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey held a preliminary hearing, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5.1 when an indictment has not yet been returned (such hearings are rare, as an indictment is almost always returned within the required time period). At that hearing, Judge Harvey found that there was probable cause to find a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 111(a). Harvey ordered the government to provide an update by Aug. 25, the date on which it was required to file an indictment pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act (30 days after Reid’s initial arrest).

On Aug. 25, the government filed a notice “alerting the Court and counsel that an Indictment has not been returned in this case. As was previously disclosed by the Court to defense counsel, a third grand jury returned a no true bill.” Instead, the government proceeded to charge the case as a misdemeanor via an “information,” which does not require a grand jury.

United States v. Sean Dunn

On Aug. 10, Sean Dunn—then a Justice Department employee—threw a sandwich at federal officials who were conducting immigration enforcement on 14th Street in Washington, D.C. Dunn fled from police, and upon being apprehended, told the officers, “I did it. I threw a sandwich.” On Aug. 13, Dunn was charged by criminal complaint for the same violation as Reid, 18 U.S.C. 111(a)(1)—assault on a federal officer. On Aug. 14, Dunn was arrested; in a troubling and highly unusual move, the White House released footage of the arrest with an audio overlay in a movie trailer-like format. On Aug. 27, the press reported that a grand jury had rejected the government’s proposed felony indictment of Dunn. As with Reid, the government subsequently charged Dunn with a misdemeanor.

United States v. Edward Dana & United States v. Natalia Jones

In these two separate cases, the defendants made statements alleged to be violations of 18 U.S.C. § 871, which criminalizes threats against the president. In Dana’s case, he was taken into police custody on Aug. 17, after allegedly pulling a light fixture off the exterior wall of a restaurant. According to the government, while in custody Dana allegedly “described himself as a ‘person with intellectual disabilities,’” and told law enforcement that he was drunk. En route to the police station, Dana allegedly stated: “I’m not going to tolerate fascism. You see, I was adopted [inaudible] to protect the Constitution by any means necessary. And that means killing you, officer, killing the President, killing anyone who stands in the way of our Constitution.” The grand jury subsequently declined to charge Dana with a federal felony for his statements to police.

As for the Jones case, from Aug. 6 to Aug. 15, she allegedly posted on Facebook that the president should be removed and “arrested” as a “terrorist.” On Aug. 15, the Secret Service interviewed Jones. According to the filing, she told the interviewing agents (among other things) that “if she had the opportunity, she would take the President’s life and would kill him at ‘the compound’ if she had to.” She was arrested on Aug. 16, and the grand jury subsequently refused to indict her.

Justice Department Policy and the Fifth Amendment Prohibit “Simply Impanel[ing] New Grand Juries”

In response to the repeated failures to secure indictments, reports indicate that Associate Deputy Attorney General Aakash Singh told prosecutors “that if sitting grand jurors rejected their efforts to bring serious charges, they should simply impanel new grand juries.” That instruction violates Justice Department policy and the Fifth Amendment.

Justice Manual 9-11.120 provides that:

Once a grand jury returns a no-bill or otherwise acts on the merits in declining to return an indictment, the same matter (i.e., the same transaction or event and the same putative defendant) should not be presented to another grand jury or resubmitted to the same grand jury without first securing the approval of the responsible United States Attorney.

Presumably, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, who has instructed her office to charge to the maximum extent possible (as we discuss further below), gave approval to resubmit the Reid indictment twice after it was rejected. But Justice Manual 9-11.120 is not the final word on the matter. While the U.S. attorney has discretion in making this decision, there are factors that should enter into her consideration. In particular, Section 9-27.220 of the Justice Manual instructs that an “attorney for the government should commence or recommend federal prosecution if he/she believes that the person’s conduct constitutes a federal offense, and that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.” Since a grand jury operates on a much lower probable cause standard than a trial jury, a grand jury requires only a majority to vote to indict (not unanimity), and a grand jury can hear evidence not admissible at trial (including hearsay), the failure of a grand jury to return an indictment—especially on multiple occasions—indicates that the petit jury is highly unlikely to convict at trial.

Read together, these two sections of the Justice Manual strongly counsel against merely “impanel[ing] new grand juries” since there is every reason to believe that the government will fail to prove its case to a unanimous jury at trial if it cannot persuade a grand jury majority three times in a row. It is presumably this argument that led U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, just outside the grand jury room, to shout at his assistant U.S. attorneys, “Fuck the Justice Manual,” when they failed to return an indictment and were discussing next steps.

As for the Fifth Amendment: It provides that in order to stand trial for a nonmilitary felony, a grand jury must return an indictment. Clearly, if the grand jury refuses to do so, and the government then “simply impanel[s] new grand juries” until it finds one sufficiently pliable, this represents a violation of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee. Allowing the government to keep shopping for a favorable grand jury panel until it finds one would nullify the point of independent citizen review, and render the protection a nullity. Similarly, 28 U.S.C. § 1861 recognizes that grand juries (like petit juries) must be “chosen at random from a fair cross section of the community”—not cherry-picked (or reshuffled) to return indictments.

***

In our view as a former federal prosecutor and a former public defender, the publicly available evidence suggests that these were weak cases that should not have been charged as federal felonies. These are not the types of prosecutions that would have been initiated under previous administrations—nor should they have been. Indeed, the Justice Manual itself instructs prosecutors not to bring federal cases unless there is a “substantial federal interest,” which includes assessing the “nature and circumstances of the offense” and the “consequences” of a felony conviction.

Even if elements of the Department of Justice have decided to “fuck the Justice Manual”—and by extension, the underlying legal and ethical principles that document embodies—it appears that grand juries have a say in the matter. Just as the framers of the Fifth Amendment intended, the grand jury is now asserting its role in policing government overreach.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-08 14:58:10.468264

The backstory:

Abraham, 20, was visiting friends at the University of Illinois in January when the car she and four of her friends were traveling in was suddenly hit.

""They were at a stoplight and there was someone who was driving drunk who hit them from behind at full force. And following the accident, he fled on foot,"" said Katie's father, Joe Abraham.

Katie died at the scene, and her friend, Chloe Polzin, 21, of Deerfield, died the following day.

U.S. Marshals arrested Julio Cucul Bol, a Guatemalan national using an alias, on a bus in Texas headed for the Mexican border just days after the crash.

What they're saying:

""As President Trump continues to wrongly hyper-fixate on deploying the military to Chicago, his Administration is now ramping up its campaign to arrest hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions,"" Sen. Dick Durbin said in a statement. ""These actions don’t make us safer. They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction.""

Chicago's sanctuary city status

Big picture view:

Over the course of the Trump administration’s immigration surges, Chicago officials repeatedly reaffirmed the city’s so-called sanctuary policies that have been place for four decades.

Chicago’s policies bar local law enforcement from asking about or detaining someone for their immigration status or from supporting ICE, including by securing perimeters for raids, transporting detainees or sharing information about undocumented immigrants.

Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order last week declaring city police would not collaborate with federal immigration agents. It also requires Chicago officers to wear uniforms and not wear masks to ""clearly distinguish them from federal agents.""

""We will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,"" Johnson said before signing the order.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/ice-agent-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-08 14:57:49.769766

Rob Bonta says the state will sue the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department and its sheriff, Robert Luna, for what the state official called a “humanitarian crisis” inside of the county jails.

Inmates are housed in unsafe, dirty facilities infested with roaches and rats, Bonta said in a news conference Monday, and lack basic access to clean water and edible food. “More alarming, people are dying,” he said.

There have been over 205 in-custody deaths in four years, Bonta said, with 40% caused by suicide, homicides and overdoses. He called for comprehensive reform, but said the county forced his hand by refusing to comply.

“I’d prefer collaboration over litigation, but the county has left us with no choice, so litigation it is,” he said.

L.A. County, which houses the largest jail system in the country, has long been criticized for poor conditions. As it has expanded to hold around 13,000 people on any given day, decades — perhaps a century — of mistreatment and overcrowding has been documented.

The system lost a federal lawsuit in 1978 after decades of dirty, mold-ridden and overcrowded jails prompted inmates to fight back through the courts, and frequently faces suits alleging it fails to provide proper food, water and shelter.

The state’s lawsuit comes amid a struggle to close and replace Men’s Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles, from which inspectors regularly document poor conditions: mold, mildew, insufficient food and water and, more recently, a report last year that said jailers were too busy watching an “explicit video” to notice a noose hung inside a cell.

The difficulty in closing the jail stems from its tendency to be overbooked, officials have said. But in-custody deaths this year are on track to set a record — 36 have been reported, about one a week, according to the county’s website.

Savage, Sonja Sharp, www.latimes.com, david-g-savage, sonja-sharp",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-09-08/supreme-court-immigration-stops-los-angeles,"The court’s conservatives issued a brief, unsigned order that freezes the district judge’s restraining order indefinitely and frees immigration agents from it.
As a practical matter, it gives immigration agents broad authority to stop people who they think may be here illegally.
“Immigration agents are not conducting ‘brief stops for questioning,’ as the concurrence would like to believe.
Beginning in early June, Trump’s appointees targeted Los Angeles with aggressive street sweeps that ensnared longtime residents, legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens.
In an application to join the suit, Los Angeles and 20 other Southern California municipalities argued that “half the population of the Central District” now meet the government’s criteria for reasonable suspicion.","The Supreme Court ruled Monday for the Trump administration and agreed U.S. immigration agents may stop and detain anyone they suspect is in the U.S. illegally based on little more than working at a car wash, speaking Spanish or having brown skin.

In a 6-3 vote, the justices granted an emergency appeal and lifted a Los Angeles judge’s order that barred “roving patrols” from snatching people off Southern California streets based on how they look, what language they speak, what work they do or where they happen to be.

While today’s order is not a final ruling, it strongly signals the Supreme Court will not uphold strict limits on the authority of immigration agents to stop people for questioning.

The court’s conservatives issued a brief, unsigned order that freezes the district judge’s restraining order indefinitely and frees immigration agents from it. As a practical matter, it gives immigration agents broad authority to stop people who they think may be here illegally.

The Supreme Court has been sharply criticized in recent weeks for handing down orders with no explanation. Perhaps for that reason, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote a 10-page opinion to explain the decision.

He said federal law says “immigration officers ‘may briefly detain’ an individual ‘for questioning’ if they have ‘a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being questioned ... is an alien illegally in the United States.’”

He said such stops are reasonable and legal based on the “totality of the circumstances. Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.”

Those were exactly the factors that the district judge and the 9th Circuit Court said agents may not use as a basis for stopping someone for questioning.

The three liberal justices dissented.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket. We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

“The Government ... has all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction,” Sotomayor wrote.

Sotomayor also disagreed with Kavanaugh’s assertions.

“Immigration agents are not conducting ‘brief stops for questioning,’ as the concurrence would like to believe. They are seizing people using firearms, physical violence, and warehouse detentions,” she wrote. “Nor are undocumented immigrants the only ones harmed by the Government’s conduct. United States citizens are also being seized, taken from their jobs, and prevented from working to support themselves and their families.”

The decision is a significant victory for President Trump, clearing the way for his oft-promised “largest Mass Deportation Operation” in American history.

Beginning in early June, Trump’s appointees targeted Los Angeles with aggressive street sweeps that ensnared longtime residents, legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens.

A coalition of civil rights groups and local attorneys challenged the cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens caught up in the chaotic arrests, claiming they’d been grabbed without reasonable suspicion — a violation of the 4th Amendment’s ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.

On July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued a temporary restraining order barring stops based solely on race or ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination.

On July 28, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.

The case remains in its early phases, with hearings set for a preliminary injunction this month. But the Department of Justice argued even a brief limit on mass arrests constituted a “irreparable injury” to the government.

A few days later, Trump’s lawyers asked the Supreme Court to set aside Frimpong’s order. They said agents should be allowed to act on the assumption that Spanish-speaking Latinos who work as day laborers, at car washes or in landscaping and agriculture are likely to lack legal status.

“Reasonable suspicion is a low bar — well below probable cause,” Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer wrote in his appeal. Agents can consider “the totality of the circumstances” when making stops, he said, including that “illegal presence is widespread in the Central District [of California], where 1 in every 10 people is an illegal alien.”

Both sides said the region’s diverse demographics support their view of the law. In an application to join the suit, Los Angeles and 20 other Southern California municipalities argued that “half the population of the Central District” now meet the government’s criteria for reasonable suspicion.

Roughly 10 million Latinos live in the seven counties covered by the order, and almost as many speak a language other than English at home.

Sauer also questioned whether the plaintiffs who sued had standing because they were not likely to be arrested again. That argument was the subject of sharp and extended questioning in the 9th Circuit, where a three-judge panel ultimately rejected it.

“Agents have conducted many stops in the Los Angeles area within a matter of weeks, not years, some repeatedly in the same location,” the panel wrote in its July 28 opinion denying the stay.

One plaintiff was stopped twice in the span of 10 days, evidence of a “real and immediate threat,” that he or any of the others could be stopped again, the 9th Circuit said.

Days after that decision, heavily armed Border Patrol agents sprang from the back of a Penske moving truck, snatching workers from the parking lot of a Westlake Home Depot in apparent defiance of the courts.

Immigrants rights advocates had urged the justices not to intervene.

“The raids have followed an unconstitutional pattern that officials have vowed to continue,” they said. Ruling for Trump would authorize “an extraordinarily expansive dragnet, placing millions of law-abiding people at imminent risk of detention by federal agents.”

The judge’s order had applied in an area that included Los Angeles and Orange counties as well as Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e3b6c15/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2Fb3%2Fb99010df4e1a8d56d5ef27efc473%2F1518336-me-border-patrol-dtla-ces-00151.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 14:57:39.687573

Since returning to the White House, Trump has cancelled billions of dollars in foreign aid that he says does not align with his objectives.
Trump, a Republican, has largely dismantled USAID, the main foreign aid agency, because he said its spending was wasteful.
The Trump administration has already said it plans to spend another $6.5bn in funds appropriated for foreign aid, following lawsuits from aid groups.
This is not the first time the tussle over foreign aid funding has ended up at the Supreme Court.","US President Donald Trump's administration has asked the Supreme Court to let it withhold more than $4bn (£3bn) in foreign aid.

The administration is seeking an emergency order as it tries to claw back funds for foreign assistance programmes that have already been allocated by Congress.

A lower court last week said the Trump administration had a statutory obligation to spend the money, and an appeals court declined last Friday to freeze that ruling.

The president attempted to use a rarely used legislative tool to withdraw the funds. Since returning to the White House, Trump has cancelled billions of dollars in foreign aid that he says does not align with his objectives.

Solicitor General D John Sauer said in Monday's filing that the lower court's injunction ""raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers"".

""The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,"" Sauer wrote.

The Supreme Court could rule at any time.

Last week, Judge Amir Ali ruled the US government had to spend the allocated money unless Congress voted to approve the Trump administration's request.

On 28 August, Trump notified the House of Representatives that the administration would not spend billions in foreign aid allocated by Congress earlier this year.

Those funds include some $3bn for the US Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as money for the state department, international peacekeeping and for democracy-promotion in other countries.

Trump, a Republican, has largely dismantled USAID, the main foreign aid agency, because he said its spending was wasteful.

To revoke the foreign aid money, he said he was using a so-called pocket recission through the Impoundment Control Act, which gives a US president the power to request the cancellation of funds approved by Congress.

Such notice so late in the fiscal year means the money may go unspent because Congress does not have enough time to act on the request.

A group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects filed a legal challenge to the move.

It is reported to be the first time in nearly half a century that the president has moved to unilaterally claw back funding in this way.

The Trump administration has already said it plans to spend another $6.5bn in funds appropriated for foreign aid, following lawsuits from aid groups.

This is not the first time the tussle over foreign aid funding has ended up at the Supreme Court.

In March, the justices rejected a bid from the president to keep $2bn in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward. It was a 5-4 ruling.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/53f0/live/ae6f28f0-8cc2-11f0-b6ff-bfdd1f9c1014.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:58:13.254852

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done ""immeasurable"" harm.","Washington — The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for President Trump's administration to resume sweeping immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area as part of the president's campaign to carry out mass deportations of people in the U.S. unlawfully.

The high court agreed to freeze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in Southern California without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. unlawfully. That order barred officials from relying solely on certain factors like a person's race or occupation as the basis for a detentive stop.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit largely rejected the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's order. The Justice Department then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the injunction issued by the district court hampered the ability of immigration authorities to enforce the nation's immigration laws in Los Angeles and put them at risk of violating its order during routine investigative stops.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

""That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,"" Sotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote of the majority's move. ""We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.""

The Department of Homeland Security praised the court's move, calling it a ""win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.""

""DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor,"" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, referring to the mayor of Los Angeles.

In a statement of her own, Bass said the ruling ""will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect — not persecute — our people.""

""I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn't just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country,"" the mayor said. ""Today's ruling is not only dangerous — it's un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.""

The legal challenge

The greater Los Angeles area, located within the Central District of California, is home to nearly 20 million people. The Trump administration estimates that 2 million of its residents are in the country illegally and has said that the region is a ""top enforcement priority.""

In June, federal immigration agencies began undertaking efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which Mr. Trump called the ""largest mass deportation operation … in history."" After protests broke out in response to enforcement operations at workplaces in the region, the Trump administration deployed members of the California National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles in June to protect federal property and immigration agents.

The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after three men who are in the U.S. illegally were arrested and filed a lawsuit seeking release from detention. The men, who live in Pasadena, were working as day laborers and were arrested in mid-June as part of a targeted enforcement action at a donut shop, according to court papers. They have since been released on bond.

The migrants, later joined by two U.S. citizens and four organizations, challenged the Trump administration's immigration raids, alleging that officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights when conducting patrols and other enforcement operations. One of the plaintiffs, Brian Gavidia, was confronted by armed agents while working at a tow yard and repeatedly told officers he was a U.S. citizen as they tried to detain him.

The plaintiffs claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were targeting certain businesses and conducting ""indiscriminate immigration operations.""

Last month, a federal district court agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that blocked federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion that the person they are stopping is in the U.S. illegally. The order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong specified that agents could not rely solely on four factors as grounds for detaining people: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; being at a specific location like a bus stop, agricultural site or day laborer pick-up site; and the type of work a person does.

In her decision, Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, wrote there was a ""mountain of evidence"" that ""roving patrols"" were indiscriminately stopping and detaining people without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

But in the request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, called Frimpong's injunction a ""straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.""

""The injunction wrongly brands countless lawful stops as unconstitutional, thereby hampering a basic law-enforcement tool, while turning every single stop in the District into a potential contempt trap,"" he wrote in a filing. ""No agent can confidently enforce the law and engage in routine stops when the district court may later refuse to credit that the stop reflected additional, permissible factors and instead treat virtually any stop as contemptuous misconduct.""

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done ""immeasurable"" harm.

""Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty. Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility. And all have had to endure the prospect of unavoidable future intrusions based on broad demographic factors like the color of their skin,"" they told the Supreme Court in a filing.

The lawyers warned that, if allowed, the Trump administration's practices could ensnare millions of people in Southern California who are U.S. citizens or legally in the country in an ""immigration dragnet.""

""The government's extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution,"" they said.

The U.S. Congress is back in Washington, D.C., this week after its annual August recess. As they return, Republican senators are exploring options to tinker with U.S. Senate procedures to allow them to more quickly advance President Donald Trump’s nominees. Indeed, we are still awaiting Senate-confirmed positions at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Wage and Hour Division (WHD), and Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA), among others.

But chief among our legislators’ priorities in the coming weeks will be funding the federal government beyond its current September 30, 2025, deadline (an evergreen issue both on Capitol Hill and, consequently, here at the Buzz). In addition to the challenging politics of such an endeavor, Congress is scheduled to be out the week beginning September 22, giving lawmakers only twelve legislative days to work. In light of all this, a continuing resolution to extend current funding until a later date is the most likely solution to avoid a shutdown.

Regulatory Agenda Released. After an inadvertent leak a few weeks ago, on September 4, 2025, the Trump administration released the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. The agenda provides a roadmap of federal agency rulemaking activities for the next six months. Below are some key labor/employment-related items.

OSHA (DOL)

Heat Injury and Illness Prevention. The agenda lists no new updates regarding a potential final rule or new proposal, though an accompanying press release from OSHA states that the agency “is continuing to examine how to establish standards specifically related to heat-related injury and illness prevention.”

WHD (DOL)

Independent Contractor (IC). According to the agenda, “The Department intends to rescind the 2024 IC rule and is considering how it will proceed with respect to independent contractor classification under the FLSA employee or under the FLSA.” DOL is no longer enforcing the 2024 IC rule. A proposal is expected in September.

Joint Employer. The first Trump administration issued a rule regarding joint employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) that was rescinded by the Biden administration in July 2021. Now, “The Department is considering a notice of proposed rulemaking to adopt regulations that would guide WHD’s enforcement of FLSA joint employer liability, and help promote greater uniformity among court decisions nationwide.” A proposal is slated for December 2025.

Overtime? According to a press release, “The department will determine whether certain salaried employees are exempt from FLSA minimum wage and overtime requirements.” However, that entry is listed in the “Long-Term Actions” section of the agenda, meaning that the department does not expect any action on the issue within the next twelve months.

Immigration

Practical Training. Later this month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to issue a proposed rule to “amend existing regulations to address fraud and national security concerns, protect U.S. workers from being displaced by foreign nationals, and enhance the Student and Exchange Visitor Program’s capacity to oversee the program.” As we’ve discussed in the Buzz, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow is on record as stating that he’d like to “remove the ability for employment authorizations for F-1 students beyond the time that they are in school.”

Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program. In December 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) “will propose to reform the H-1B program by revising eligibility for cap exemptions, providing greater scrutiny for employers that have violated program requirements, and increasing oversight over third-party placements, among other provisions.”

Biometrics. USCIS will propose to collect biometric information from individuals “throughout the entirety of the immigration lifecycle,” including in both enforcement proceedings and the adjudication of any immigration application, petition, or benefit. This proposal is scheduled for October 2025.

Weighted Selection Process for H-1B Petitions. USCIS will amend the current H-1B lottery process to “favor beneficiaries whose proffered wages correspond to higher Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics wage levels.” The proposal will not affect the recently implemented beneficiary-specific selection procedure.

Neither the EEOC nor the NLRB included submissions in the agenda.

Treasury Issues ‘No Tax on Tips’ Guidance. While President Trump’s “no tax on tips” promise was enacted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, there has been a lot of uncertainty regarding who may qualify for relief under the provision. Pursuant to the act, workers may deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their income per year through 2028 when such tips are “received by an individual in an occupation which customarily and regularly received tips on or before December 31, 2024, as provided by the Secretary.” (Emphasis added.) This week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a preliminary list of occupations that will qualify for the deduction, noting that formal regulations are still to come, but that such regulations “will be substantially the same as this preliminary list.” The list includes occupations in various hospitality positions (including casino workers), dancers, musicians and singers, porters and bellhops, hairdressers, golf caddies, home service providers (e.g., plumbers), and “digital content creators.” Michael K. Mahoney, Stephen Kenney, and Zachary V. Zagger have the details.

House Spending Bill Reveals Republican Employment Policy Priorities. Speaking of funding the federal government, this week, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations’ Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee voted to advance its fiscal year (FY) 2026 bill. The measure would provide funding for agencies such as DOL and the NLRB during the government’s 2026 fiscal year, which runs from October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2025. The bill includes the following labor and employment–related policy provisions:

Elimination of funding for the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14173.

Elimination of funding for the Bureau of International Labor Affairs and the Women’s Bureau.

A cut of $25 million from WHD and $50 million from OSHA.

A prohibition on the use of funds to implement the current Biden-era independent contractor rule, which—as we noted above—the current WHD has already stated it will no longer enforce.

A continuation of a long-standing prohibition against the NLRB’s use of funds to implement electronic voting for union elections.

Of course, given the government funding issues noted above, these provisions will have multiple hurdles to overcome if they are to be enacted into law.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14838_2817.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 13:57:46.518809

This increase is again being met with pushback from city and state leaders.

Dubbed “Patriot 2.0”, DHS officials told CNN their plan is to “target the worst criminal illegal aliens living in Massachusetts”.

The first round came in May, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

In a statement, officials blamed Boston Mayor Michelle Wu for so-called sanctuary city policies.

ICE claimed that “Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities.”

Governor Maura Healey said the ICE actions are not about public safety.

“We’ve seen construction workers, nannies, landscapers, health care aides – these are the people that are being taken in huge numbers,” Healey said. “It is not the kind of effort Trump said it was about.”

Wu said no Boston police or local resources will be used for civil immigration enforcement, writing: “For months, ICE has refused to provide any information about their activities in Boston and refuses to issue warrants, while we hear reports of ICE agents taking parents as they are dropping their kids off at school. That does not make our community safer.”

In a statement, Wu said: “For months, the Trump DOJ, DHS, and ICE have been spreading blatant lies and threatening to “bring hell” to cities like Boston who refuse to bow down to their authoritarian agenda, so this unconstitutional attack is not a surprise. This country was born facing down bullies, with Bostonians leading the way. Today Boston is the safest major city in the country because we have worked to build trust in the community, so that everyone feels safe seeking help or reporting a crime. We will not be bullied or intimidated into abandoning the efforts that make Boston a safe home for everyone.”

White House officials told CNN the operation will happen at the same time as he push in Chicago, signaling efforts to crack down on sanctuary cities.

Massachusetts congressman Jake Auchincloss said any federal operation should be done in conjunction with local authorities.

“Bay Staters don’t want criminals walking on our streets,” he said. “Rapists, thieves, murderers absolutely should be incarcerated, deported. They also don’t want thuggery on their streets. Government agents masked, pulling up in unmarked vans, tackling people, surrounding people. And so, if this administration wants to support law enforcement in Massachusetts and in Boston, they had better work with the governor and with the mayor.”

The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that “roving patrols"" were conducting indiscriminate arrests in LA. The order had barred agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

Trump's Republican administration argued the order wrongly restricted agents carrying out its widespread crackdown on illegal immigration.

U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong's ruling in place.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Trump's use of National Guard during Los Angeles immigration protests is illegal, judge rules

The Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.

The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.

In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor. Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.""

Department of Homeland Security attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued that the order wrongly restricted the factors that ICE agents can use when deciding who to stop.

The Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hard-line immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guard and the Marines. The number of immigration raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store.

The plaintiffs argued that her order only prevents federal agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion, something that aligns with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.

“Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.”

The Trump administration said the order is too restrictive, “threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer also argued the order can’t stand under the high court’s recent decision restricting universal injunctions, though the plaintiffs disagreed.

The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. Its covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.

Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents as he yelled, “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”

Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd5d1bc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2F29%2F27672c1340489c46d3609944aeea%2Fap25251572828765.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 15:57:22.339475

Around 9 a.m. on Sept. 4, agents with Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided Nutrition Bar Confectioners, a company that produces nutrition and protein bars, on State Route 34 in Cato.

Employees told CNY Central that and put them into groups of citizens and non-citizens. ICE confirmed with CNY Central that their detainment was a court-authorized action, but would not release additional details.

Cayuga County Deputies were present at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners. At the time, Sheriff Brian Schenck said his deputies assisted ICE agents with security and traffic control.

Governor Hochul says another raid occurred in the Town of Volney

On the evening of Sept. 4, Governor Kathy Hochul released a statement on her X and Instagram accounts that she was appalled by the ICE raids in Central New York. She wrote, ""I am outraged by this morning's ICE raids in Cato and Fulton, where more than 40 adults were seized, including parents of at least a dozen children at risk of returning to an empty house.""

On Sept. 5, the Oswego County Sheriff's Office would later refute the governor's claim that any ICE raid occurred in Volney, specifying Hochul, who said ""Fulton,"" speaking generally.

The sheriff's office said it received numerous messages about it at Teti Bakery in Volney. However, the sheriff's office said, ""to the best of our knowledge, these claims are fictitious.""

CNY Central tried to contact the bakery about the alleged raid on Sept. 5, but a supervisor at the facility would not speak about the matter.

CNY Central is working to confirm whether the number of people detained is 60 or 40.

Cayuga County Sheriff speaks on involvement in Cato raid

Sheriff Schenck released additional details on Sept. 5 about his agency's participation in the raid at Nutrition Bar Confectioners.

Shenck said children from two families in Cayuga County were impacted by ICE's operation. He said his agency and ICE ""were assigned"" to work with the Cayuga County Department of Social Services to ensure that those children were receiving support from caretakers approved by their parents or guardians.

Shenck also revealed that his agency has received money from Border Patrol due to Cayuga County's closeness to the Canadian border. He still maintained that his officer was limited to security and traffic control.

Fulton City School District students impacted by the raid

Fulton City School District Superintendent Doug Lawrence that students within the district had one or both parents taken away by federal agents in the raid at Nutrition Bar Confectioners.

Superintendent Lawrence said one detained parent called the district to inform them that the raid was underway. According to Lawrence, most of the impacted children were elementary school-aged students. He said many of them did not attend school on Sept. 5, but noted that the district was working with the Oswego County Department of Social Services.

The community response

appeared before the Oswego County Border Patrol Station in Oswego, demanding answers about the people who were detained in Cato on the evening of Sept. 5.

They held signs that read, ""Owego against kidnapping,"" ""We are better than this,"" ""Protect our immigrant neighbors,"" ""No human is illegal,"" ""ICE melts under resistance,"" and many others.

Officials and immigration advocates said that at the time, around 20 women were being held inside the station and could be moved to Texas that evening. CNY Central is seeking to verify where the detainees are.

By Monday morning, September 8, a tent encampment formed outside the Border Patrol Station. Those protesters are believed to be associated with the advocacy group, ""Indivisible,"" according to social media posts. The national activism group with local chapters seeks community-led justice.

Fulton Mayor Rice responds to the raid

Fulton Mayor James Rice released a statement on Monday calling the raid at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners a .

""I hope all elected officials in New York State and beyond will join me in condemning the unjustified actions taken by the federal government against the residents of our community,"" said Rice. ""This is not a Republican versus Democrat issue.""

Rice did not mention anything regarding Hochul alleging a raid at Teti Bakery in Volney. However, he did confirm that deputies with the Oswego County Sheriff's Office were offering assistance to the Cayuga County Sheriff's Office with traffic control and security to the benefit of federal agents in Cato.

What's next?

CNY Central is seeking to confirm the whereabouts and the specific number of those detained as of Monday. CNY Central has been scouring federal documents to find if any of those detained have been formally charged.

The Office of the Representative Claudia Tenney (R, NY-24) did not immediately respond to comment. Inquiries were also made to schools in the area regarding whether students from those districts were impacted by the federal operation.

U.S. Attorney John A. Sarcone III will hold a news conference on Tuesday morning regarding the raid. A news release from his office said Sarcone it set to discuss arrests and criminal charges arising from the federal operation and to ""warn employers across the Northern District of New York that they risk criminal investigation if they are employing non-citizens who are not authorized to work in the United States.""

In the process of transporting the migrants, the activists were detained in their cars by border guard officers.
Initially, four of them were charged with organising illegal border crossings, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to eight years.
Prosecutors argued that, although the activists were working voluntarily without pay, their actions provided material or personal benefit to the migrants they were helping, thereby justifying the charges.
“Protecting a person in danger of [harm] from a pushback [therefore] cannot be illegal,” he argued, quoted by broadcaster TVN.","A group of five activists have been found not guilty of enabling the illegal presence in Poland of Middle Eastern migrants whom they provided humanitarian aid to after they had irregularly crossed the border. Prosecutors had been seeking prison sentences for their actions.

Today’s ruling was welcomed “as a great victory for justice” by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR), which said “it shows that, contrary to politicians’ narratives, humanitarian aid is and will remain legal”.

The accused had, in March 2022, provided assistance to a group of Iraqis and one Egyptian who were among the tens of thousands of migrants – mainly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa – who have tried to cross into Poland since 2021 with the encouragement and assistance of the Belarusian authorities.

The five activists, who had been involved in providing humanitarian aid to migrants crossing the border, gave the group – who included a family with seven children – food, clothing and shelter after they had crossed into Poland, then helped transport them further into the country, reports news website OKO.press.

In the process of transporting the migrants, the activists were detained in their cars by border guard officers. Initially, four of them were charged with organising illegal border crossings, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to eight years.

However, after a two-year investigation, those charges were downgraded to enabling or facilitating the illegal stay of another person in Poland in order to gain material or personal benefit, which is punishable by up to five years in prison. The fifth member of their group was also presented with the same charge.

Prosecutors argued that, although the activists were working voluntarily without pay, their actions provided material or personal benefit to the migrants they were helping, thereby justifying the charges. They called for the accused to be given 16-month prison sentences.

Prosecutor Magdalena Rutyna argued in court that the defendants’ goal was to enable the migrants to reach western Europe, reports Polskie Radio. She said that they operated in an organised structure, knowing the true purpose of the migrants’ journey.

The accused rejected the charges and pleaded not guilty. Their lawyer, Radosław Baszuk, argued that the relevant law should be interpreted to mean that it is unlawful for the person helping an illegal migrant to obtain material or personal benefit, not for the person receiving assistance to do so.

“Are we willing, as a society, to consider it illegal to provide people in need with food, drink, dry clothes, or to provide shelter?” asked Baszuk, quoted by OKO.press. He noted that, in fact, it is a crime to fail to provide assistance to someone whose life or health is endangered.

Baszuk also pointed to the fact that Polish court rulings have found the border guard’s policy of pushing asylum seekers back over the border into Belarus to be unlawful. “Protecting a person in danger of [harm] from a pushback [therefore] cannot be illegal,” he argued, quoted by broadcaster TVN.

The court case against the group began in January this year, and today the district court in the city of Hajnówka found the quintet not guilty, although the ruling can still be appealed.

In his justification, judge Adam Rodakowski agreed with the defence’s argument that the relevant law should only apply if the person helping someone illegally stay in Poland benefits themselves.

“Personal benefit cannot be for the foreigner, for the person crossing the border; the benefit must be for the person helping,” he added, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP).

Today’s ruling was welcomed by left-wing MP Daria Gosek-Popiołek, a member of Poland’s ruling coalition, who called it a “just verdict, serving as a counterbalance to the unjust and inhumane conduct of the Polish state”.

However, Dariusz Matecki, an MP from the national-conservative opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, claimed that the court’s decision was a further example of how “in Poland, judges only defend FOREIGNERS” and “consent to actions aimed against the country’s security”.

Paul Erickson of the Milwaukee synod said the Trump administration’s directive caused “significant harm” because of increased ICE activity and “fear that ICE could enter worship spaces.” This prompted the synod to join the lawsuit.
The directive not only allows ICE to operate at churches but also other “sensitive areas” such as schools, hospitals and courthouses.","A Milwaukee Lutheran church has joined a national lawsuit against the Trump administration’s directive to allow immigration raids at houses of worship.

In late January, Trump ended a Biden-era policy that prohibited Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in or near sensitive areas, including houses of worship. Multiple lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security soon followed, including one filed July 25 by the New England Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It alleges the directive violates churchgoers’ First Amendment rights.

The Greater Milwaukee Synod is made up of 115 congregations. Five of the ministries offer Spanish worship services.

The Rev. Paul Erickson of the Milwaukee synod said the Trump administration’s directive caused “significant harm” because of increased ICE activity and “fear that ICE could enter worship spaces.” This prompted the synod to join the lawsuit.

“It’s simply had a chilling impact on the ability of our congregations to do the ministry that they’ve been called to do,” Erickson said.

Church services are not the only activities affected by potential ICE operations. Erickson said food pantry attendance has plummeted because many are afraid to stand outside the churches for prolonged periods. The synod has even made baptisms, typically part of regular church services, into private events.

In the original statement announcing the directive, a DHS spokesperson said it was necessary to end the “invasion of the US southern border” and “empower law enforcement to protect Americans.”

The U.S. Department of Justice declined WPR’s request for comment on the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that soon after the directives passed, ICE operations across the country began in and around places of worship. In June, five agents in plain clothes and bullet-proof vests with police badges detained a Spanish-speaking man at a Los Angeles church parking lot. The pastor of the church said one of the agents pointed a rifle at her when she attempted to approach their vehicle.

The directive not only allows ICE to operate at churches but also other “sensitive areas” such as schools, hospitals and courthouses.

“There are lots of ways in which — while we recognize that ICE needs to do their job — there need to be some places where that cannot happen,” Erickson said.

In April, police arrested a Milwaukee County judge accused of helping a man evade ICE agents. She now faces federal criminal charges.

Multiple faith-based groups across the country including Quaker and Baptist congregations are also plaintiffs in the suit. Erickson believes it is essential that churches protect their congregants.

“We find that it’s simply important to stand up and to stand together, especially for those folks who are feeling threatened and vulnerable,” he said. “And if the church doesn’t stand up for those who are feeling threatened and vulnerable, then I’m not sure why we have churches.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-04-at-1.50.35-PM-scaled.png,N,,2025-09-08 13:01:07.243959

In the near term it allows what critics say are roving patrols of masked agents routinely violating the Fourth Amendment and what supporters say is a vigorous but lawful effort to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.

The lower courts had placed significant restrictions on President Trump’s efforts to ramp up immigrant arrests to achieve his pledge of mass deportations. Aggressive enforcement operations in Los Angeles — including encounters captured on video that appeared to be roundups of random Hispanic people by armed agents — have become a flashpoint, setting off protests and clashes in the area.

Civil rights groups and several individuals filed suit, accusing the administration of unconstitutional sweeps in which thousands of people had been arrested in what they described in the suit as “indiscriminate immigration operations” that had swept up thousands of day laborers, carwash workers, farmworkers, caregivers and others.

“Individuals with brown skin are approached or pulled aside by unidentified federal agents, suddenly and with a show of force,” the complaint said, “and made to answer questions about who they are and where they are from,” violating the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures.

One plaintiff, Jason Brian Gavidia, a U.S. citizen born in East Los Angeles, was stopped by a masked agent while he was working on his car outside a tow yard. The encounter was captured on video.

The agent asked whether Mr. Gavidia was American, and he said he was.

The agent then asked what hospital Mr. Gavidia had been born in, and he said he did not know. According to the lawsuit, the agent and a colleague proceeded to slam Mr. Gavidia against a metal gate, twist his arm and seize his phone.

“Fearing for his life, Gavidia offered to show the agents his ID,” the lawsuit said. “The agents took the ID, and about 20 minutes later, returned Gavidia’s phone and set him free. They never returned his ID.”

In response to what she called a “mountain of evidence” of agents “indiscriminately rounding up numerous individuals without reasonable suspicion,” Judge Maame E. Frimpong, of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, ordered agents not to rely on several factors, alone or in combination, in deciding whom to stop and question in her judicial district, which includes Los Angeles and surrounding areas.

The factors were race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or accented English; presence at a particular location, such as a day-laborer or agricultural site; or performing a particular type of work.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit refused to pause the order issued by Judge Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The administration then appealed to the Supreme Court. In an emergency application, D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, wrote that Judge Frimpong’s order had unlawfully hamstrung immigration enforcement in the nation’s most populous judicial district, one he said “harbors some two million illegal aliens out of its total population of nearly 20 million people, making it by far the largest destination for illegal aliens.”

Mr. Sauer added that federal agents used judgment and discretion.

“Needless to say,” Mr. Sauer wrote, “no one thinks that speaking Spanish or working in construction always creates reasonable suspicion. Nor does anyone suggest those are the only factors federal agents ever consider. But in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States, above and beyond the 1-in-10 base line odds in the district.”

The challengers drew a different conclusion from the area’s demographics, one they said “explains the damning record in this case.” The odds, they wrote, suggest that “the government’s roving patrols have routinely stopped U.S. citizens — including some plaintiffs — without an individualized assessment of reasonable suspicion.”

On Sunday, when asked whether he was “threatening to go to war with Chicago,” Mr. Trump called it “fake news,” and chastised the reporter when she asked why he would use the Department of Defense.

“We’re not going to war, we’re going to clean up our cities,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend. That’s not war. That’s common sense.”

The post was an alarming escalation in Mr. Trump’s quest to continue deploying the military on U.S. soil in the name of cracking down on crime and illegal immigration. For weeks, Mr. Trump has attacked Chicago and other cities led by Democrats that he has assailed as “hellholes” because of crime, and floated sending federal agents and National Guard troops to cities throughout the country. Mr. Trump deployed the military to Washington, D.C., in August and Los Angeles in June.

His post on Saturday drew a fierce rebuke from Democrats, including Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who in his own social media post blasted Mr. Trump as a “wannabe dictator.”

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Mr. Pritzker wrote. “This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Tom Homan, the White House border czar, said that the words in the post were “taken out of context,” when asked whether the president planned to go to war in Chicago.

The post, he said, was intended to convey that the administration is “going to war with the criminal cartels; we’re going to war with illegal aliens, public safety threats,” and cited previous operations in the city that nabbed violent criminals in the country illegally.

Mr. Homan said federal action in Chicago, including the deployment of the National Guard, could come as soon as this week, but he declined to say how many National Guard troops would be sent.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/08/multimedia/08trump-news-promo-1030am-gpzb-copy/08trump-news-header-1030am-gpzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:00:44.978737

Trump pushed the justices to restore these raids, arguing the widespread illegal presence of migrants in areas like Los Angeles called for such considerations.
That kind of regime — anathema to constitutional tradition — is precisely what the government has installed in the Central District,” the five Southern California residents and three advocacy groups who challenged the raids wrote.
The order chilled immigration enforcement, the administration said, by threatening officers with contempt for doing their job.
“Immigration agents are not conducting ‘brief stops for questioning,’ as the concurrence would like to believe,” Sotomayor wrote.","WASHINGTON (CN) — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can resume sweeping California raids, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday, granting President Donald Trump’s request to continue targeting Latinos, Spanish speakers and certain workers for suspected illegal status.

The unexplained order appeared to fall along ideological lines, with justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.

Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, described the ruling as “unconscionably irreconcilable with our nation’s constitutional guarantees.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote in an opinion joined by her liberal colleagues. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

Sotomayor railed against her colleagues’ refusal to explain their ruling, saying lower courts needed guidance moving forward.

“Neither the district court nor the parties will know whether the majority believed the key issue was standing, the merits, or the scope of relief, any one of which could have been the basis for the majority’s order,” she said.

A federal judge halted the administration’s “roving” raids in July, finding that agents likely used racial profiling to arrest immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally and unlawfully detained them without access to an attorney.

Trump pushed the justices to restore these raids, arguing the widespread illegal presence of migrants in areas like Los Angeles called for such considerations.

“Needless to say, no one thinks that speaking Spanish or working in construction always creates reasonable suspicion,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote in Trump’s petition. “Nor does anyone suggest those are the only factors federal agents ever consider. But in many situations, such factors — alone or in combination — can heighten the likelihood that someone is unlawfully present in the United States.”

The administration claims California’s Central District harbors 2 million migrants without legal status, giving agents a 1 in 10 chance of arresting a potential deportee among the region’s 20 million residents.

ICE ramped up patrols to meet the administration’s goal of a minimum of 3,000 immigration-enforcement arrests every day. Patrols in California began rounding up people at places like Home Depot and 7-Eleven, based on stereotypes about migrants without legal status.

Officers typically target these individuals based on particularized evidence that the person may be in the country illegally. However, the Trump administration claimed that broadly applicable group characteristics, like speaking Spanish, being Latino or working in certain fields, amounted to adequate suspicion for arrest.

Immigrant advocates said the sweeping patrols had swept up U.S. citizens and warned the justices against endorsing blatant racial profiling.

“Such a theory … would justify an extraordinarily expansive dragnet, placing millions of law-abiding people at imminent risk of detention by federal agents. That kind of regime — anathema to constitutional tradition — is precisely what the government has installed in the Central District,” the five Southern California residents and three advocacy groups who challenged the raids wrote.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong issued an emergency order blocking indiscriminate raids in July. The Joe Biden appointee found that there was a mountain of evidence supporting the plaintiffs’ claims.

The Ninth Circuit upheld the temporary restraining order, finding agents were subjecting Angelenos to detentive stops based on group profiling, not individualized suspicion.

Trump said the plaintiffs’ past injuries did not justify a restraining order barring agents from using factors such as accents or place of employment to target all immigrants without legal status in California. The administration asked the Supreme Court to narrow the order to only the named plaintiffs.

The order chilled immigration enforcement, the administration said, by threatening officers with contempt for doing their job.

“Uncertainty over how the court might later view an agent’s reliance on a mix of factors will ‘likely cause hesitation and delay in the field, which in turn increases the risk of assaults on officers, escalations during volatile encounters, and injuries to both officers and the public, particularly in the already high-risk and unpredictable environment of Los Angeles,’” Sauer wrote.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, claimed that common sense dictated that such factors could constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the country. Kavanaugh said that immigrants who are in the country legally would be quickly released if they got swept up in such stops.

“If the person is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter,” Kavanaugh wrote in a solo concurrence. “Only if the person is illegally in the United States may the stop lead to further immigration proceedings.”

Sotomayor balked at Kavanaugh’s characterization of the government’s raids.

“Immigration agents are not conducting ‘brief stops for questioning,’ as the concurrence would like to believe,” Sotomayor wrote. “They are seizing people using firearms, physical violence, and warehouse detentions. Nor are undocumented immigrants the only ones harmed by the government’s conduct. United States citizens are also being seized, taken from their jobs, and prevented from working to support themselves and their families.”

Sotomayor said facts on the ground demonstrated that immigrants in the country legally were not freed as Kavanaugh described.

“The concurrence improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely,” Sotomayor said. “The Constitution does not permit the creation of such a second-class citizenship status.”

Trump’s immigration crackdown sparked mass protests in Los Angeles in the opening months of his second term. The president federalized California’s National Guard to quell the protests, against the wishes of Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

Over 5,000 National Guard members and Marines were deployed to the city in June. Nearly three months later, only 250 guard members remain in Los Angeles to protect federal agents and buildings.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/08/ice-agents-manhattan-federal-building.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-09-08 13:01:24.525926

In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

Still, in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case, in March, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, both nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s power of the purse.

Flower vendor detained

According to the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR), a man who residents say is a local flower vendor was taken into custody Sunday near the intersection of 50th Street and Pulaski Avenue in Archer Heights.

Surveillance video from a nearby restaurant shows the man being detained by multiple individuals wearing bulletproof vests labelled “police” and “federal agent.”

U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia of Illinois’ 4th District told WGN-TV it appeared the agents grabbed the vendor off the street and did not show a warrant.

“He’s been a vendor here for quite some time,” Celena Morin said. “You see him consistently, especially on the weekends. (He’s) a very sweet gentleman, never causing problems with anyone, very respectful.”

Activists say at least two other detentions occurred in the area, including one at 47th Street and Archer Avenue. Video shows a man being marched to a vehicle by armed officers, and activists reported ICE activity as far south as 79th Street and Pulaski Road.

“We helped build this city through our labor and work,” Corina Pedraza with ICIRR said. “People may be afraid, but also they’re determined to say, ‘This is our home, this is where we belong. We won’t tolerate our people getting kidnapped.'”

Garcia condemned the ICE detainments.

“This is the type of racial, ethnic profiling that is going on, and they are pursuing people who are humble, who may not speak English and aren’t a threat to anyone,” he said. “They didn’t have a court order to pick up someone who sells flowers on a street corner and has been doing it for years.”

Raids expected

ICE raids were expected in Chicago over the weekend, and Sunday’s detainments came just a day after thousands of protestors rallied against Trump’s plans to send federal troops to Chicago for expanded immigration enforcement.

“This is not going after the worst of the worst, as Trump or Secretary (of Homeland Security Kristi) Noem have tried to justify,” Garcia said. “This is racial profiling, it’s discriminatory, it’s wrong, and is a potential threat to the civil rights of everyone in this country.”

Sunday’s detainments also came a day after the Mexican Independence Day Parade in Pilsen, during which a network of volunteers lined the parade route on the lookout for ICE. Parade attendance was down because of those concerns.

4 hours ago

Henry ZeffmanChief political correspondent

Looking at Sir Keir Starmer's cabinet reshuffle it appears that he came to believe that he had all the right ministers at the cabinet table - just sitting in the wrong chairs.

The most significant change is the appointment of Shabana Mahmood as home secretary, which is intended as a clear signal that dealing with illegal immigration and asylum is one of the government's biggest priorities.

That was the former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's view too, but there was a sense among some - not all - at the top of government that she was moving too slowly to meet public opinion.

There was particular frustration at Reform UK's ability to drive the narrative on the issue over the summer even when the government had achievements to herald, including its ""one in one out"" agreement with France.

Mahmood has a reputation among Labour MPs as (relatively-speaking, in Labour terms) a hardliner on immigration.

""She's really right-wing on this stuff,"" one Labour figure who knows her well said.

From this person it was a compliment; from others in the Labour movement who are anxious about losing votes to the Greens and others on the left, it would not be.

In practical terms, though, what different policies will Mahmood pursue? That's not so clear.

At the weekend John Healey, the defence secretary, said the government was looking at expanding the use of military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels.

That was in the works before the reshuffle. It may be that Mahmood seeks to accelerate the timetable for closing hotels.

Sir Keir has said that he wants to close them all before the next general election though he alluded in an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live last week to bringing that deadline forward.

Then there is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), from which both Reform UK and increasingly the Conservatives say the UK must withdraw to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.

Cooper was looking at ways to change UK law to make clearer to judges here the way in which the government believes the convention should be interpreted.

Mahmood may want to go further but it is hard to see how that would be possible given Lord Hermer, who remains in post as attorney general, not to mention the prime minister himself, are both ardently opposed to withdrawal.

We may not need to wait long to find out what Mahmood's new direction will be. Only a week after taking office as justice secretary last year, she announced plans to release thousands of prisoners earlier than planned to avoid what she called ""total collapse"" of the prison system.

Her handling of prison overcrowding, especially her willingness to grasp the nettle so early on, has been frequently compared favourably by Labour MPs to other cabinet ministers who were seen as taking too long to work out how they wanted to deal with their portfolios.

One ally of Mahmood told the BBC: ""She knows that time is of the essence. She didn't take long to take big decisions at the Ministry of Justice, and she doesn't tend to hang about.""

One of the biggest changes might come in rhetoric and communication style.

Cooper was shadow home secretary for seven years in two stints and also spent five years as chairwoman of the home affairs select committee. Some in Labour pushing for a harder line on immigration occasionally complained that her deep knowledge of the issues involved made her public comments too nuanced to embody public dissatisfaction.

Mahmood is likely to go another way.

That was definitely the sense from her first brief interview in the role on Monday, in which she repeatedly vowed to do ""whatever it takes"" to tackle illegal immigration, suggested she could withdraw visas from countries that do not ""play ball"" on migrant returns and embraced the potential introduction of ID cards - all in clear, plain language.

Mahmood, 44, has been an MP for 15 years representing a constituency in Birmingham, but it is only in the past two years that she has moved into front-line, high-profile roles.

After spending her first five years in Parliament in a range of junior shadow ministerial portfolios, she co-chaired Cooper's unsuccessful leadership campaign in 2015. She then refused to serve under Jeremy Corbyn, instead dedicating her time during his leadership to fighting those on Labour's left-wing from a position on Labour's national executive committee, to which she was elected by Labour MPs.

In 2021, at the lowest ebb of Sir Keir's leadership, she was brought into the shadow cabinet to take charge of Labour's election campaign infrastructure. Even in that job, though, she was pushing her party to get over what she called its ""queasiness"" about talking tough on immigration.

In an interview with the Times in 2023, she said: ""In the commentariat, among very politically engaged people, there's a sort of assumption about who is motivated by immigration as an electoral issue.

""My constituency experience is that, actually, that's not got very much to do with race. I represent a very diverse constituency that's 70% non-white, and immigration comes up as an issue that my voters who are black or Asian and from other ethnic minorities want to talk about.""

That is an argument you can be sure she will be making as home secretary in the coming weeks.

Whether she can address those concerns will determine not just her political fortunes but those of this government and prime minister too.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e5ea/live/381cfda0-8ca2-11f0-a721-a79c3c3eadc7.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:01:17.322916

As a result, many dairy farms and other year-round agricultural businesses continue to rely heavily on undocumented workers to keep their operations running.","New York's small farms are beginning to feel the strain of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, with experts warning that an industry heavily reliant on undocumented workers needs an urgent solution from Congress.

While much of the focus when it comes to immigrants in the Empire State has been the New York City metro area, the state itself is home to as many as 67,000 farmworkers across 30,000 farms mostly upstate and on Long Island.

""We are the most important part of the country, because no one can live without food,"" said one Mexican man who has worked in New York for 12 years, speaking to Newsweek on condition of anonymity. ""So we can live without a car, without electricity, without many things. But we can't live without food.""

A Multi-Billion Dollar Industry At Risk

The human impact of ongoing ICE raids is evident to those working on the ground. Another farm worker in New York, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, told Newsweek that ""cows are going to die"" if the administration's deportations continue across the state.

""It's a risk every day to go to work. It's a risk to go to the grocery store. It's a risk to drive your kids to school. It's a risk to drive your child to their doctor's appointment,"" the worker told Newsweek.

The person said that the farming industry in New York won't be able to function without immigrant workers.

""It doesn't make sense on either a human level or on a business level. The food industry relies mostly on undocumented people,"" the worker said.

New York is the country's top producer of yogurt, and number two producer of apples, but U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are potentially putting an $8 billion farming industry at-risk, experts believe.

Margaret Gray, an associate professor of political science at Adelphi University, told Newsweek that New York state has a diversity of farming sectors and immigrant workers supporting them.

""Dairy workers are year-round workers, apple pickers might only be in the state for eight or 12 weeks,"" Gray said. ""So, a lot of the apple pickers are on H-2A guest worker visas and so they're not going to be targeted by ICE, but the dairy industry is not eligible for these visas at this time because to be eligible, you cannot have year-round work.""

Year-round operations, such as dairy farms, are largely ineligible for H-2A visas. Dairy farming requires consistent labor throughout the year to care for animals and maintain production, and the H-2A program is designed only for temporary or seasonal work during workforce shortages.

As a result, many dairy farms and other year-round agricultural businesses continue to rely heavily on undocumented workers to keep their operations running.

Gray said that communities like those in Suffolk County, on Long Island, where large immigrant communities have formed around the farming and agricultural industries, are among those most at risk when many residents and workers do not hold legal status.

""Even the detention of one worker right now can cause chaos. I have talked to people who are literally afraid to leave the house,"" Gray said. ""They're afraid to go grocery shopping, they won't go to parent-teacher meetings, and some of them aren't even sending their children to school out of fear.""

A declining workforce, especially in sectors such as agriculture, could trigger supply shortages and higher labor costs, which may ultimately increase consumer prices.

Undocumented New Yorkers made a substantial economic contribution, paying $3.1 billion in state and local taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The Migration Policy Institute estimates that approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants live in New York.

""As business owners and employers in agriculture, we are very dependent on migrant workers,"" Dennis Rak, who owns Double A Vineyards in West New York, told Newsweek. ""These are jobs that we'd offer to any person, they are not bad-paying jobs, they're $20 an hour or more, but no one wants to do any sort of manual labor anymore. So it's critical for agriculture to have access to a source of labor that will do this.""

Will Trump Find a Solution?

Armando Elenes, Secretary-Treasurer for the United Farm Workers of America, told Newsweek that UFW has seen higher engagement from farm workers who want to know their rights should ICE show up.

In May, 14 workers at Lynn-Ette & Sons Farms, in Orleans County, were detained during an ICE raid. Then, in mid-August, agents showed up again to arrest seven more.

""The workers that have not been detained, it's the fear of them being next or them being targeted, and the workers who were detained, they have their roots here,"" Elenes said. ""They've been here for years, and they have families here, they have friends here, and to be uprooted and basically sent back, whether it be to Guatemala or to Mexico, it's a traumatic experience.""

President Donald Trump said in July at the Iowa State Fairgrounds that his administration was working on legislation to allow undocumented workers in sectors such as agriculture and hospitality to remain in the country, a compromise that many in MAGA said amounted to ""amnesty.""

""We're working on legislation right now where – farmers, look, they know better. They work with them for years. You had cases where...people have worked for a farm, on a farm for 14, 15 years and they get thrown out pretty viciously and we can't do it. We gotta work with the farmers, and people that have hotels and leisure properties too,"" Trump said, although no official program or policy update has been announced.

The administration has urged those in the U.S. without legal status to self-deport, offering them $1,000 to do so, or face tougher penalties, such as ICE detention. For the Mexican worker Newsweek spoke to, leaving is not an option.

""I think that the people who are taking self-deportation are people who have just arrived and since they haven't had a permanent job, they don't have a life, like they don't have stability anymore,"" he said. ""So that's not an option, I think, for most of the people who are here, because, I mean, $1,000 you earn in a week.""

Newsweek asked the USDA what the administration was doing about the issue, with a spokesperson repeating that Trump was ""putting America First"", including streamlining H-2A and H-2B visas.

""Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,"" the spokesperson said.

Rak said he had little faith that the Trump administration was making any serious efforts on immigration reform which would help business owners like him.

""It doesn't matter who is in the White House, or who's in charge of Congress, none of them has been able to work together to come up with a solution that would solve this problem,"" Rak said. ""If the problem was solved with a workable immigration policy, we wouldn't need to have the enforcement things that are going on now.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2716223/new-york-immigrant-farm-workers.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:01:08.692494

The average stay in Krome’s hold rooms is the longest of any ICE hold room during the second Trump administration.

Grainy cellphone video, filmed by a detainee in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in recent months, offers a rare public view of the harsh conditions inside a hold room in Miami – a temporary space where immigrants wait to be transferred to longer-term housing or deported.

ICE’s policies for decades have required the agency to keep migrants in cramped hold rooms like this for no longer than 12 hours.

Yet inside the Krome detention center in Miami, the average hold room stay has been more than three days. Some detainees say they have been left pleading for more food and water. One man who spent more than three days in a hold room later died in ICE custody. Even an internal ICE audit earlier this year found detainees were held for too long in the hold rooms and weren’t given pillows or blankets, and that staff didn’t follow procedure on providing meals.

“It was terrible,” said Mopvens Louisdor, an ICE detainee who has had two stints in a Krome hold room. “It’s hot, the AC was broken … they were sleeping on the cement floor, and … getting sick.”

Across the country, in fact, ICE has routinely broken its longstanding rules as it ratchets up President Donald Trump’s promised mass deportations, a CNN analysis of data from the agency found.

Over the first six months of Trump’s term, 18% of detainees placed into ICE hold rooms were kept there longer than 12 hours – up from only about 4% in 2024, the data shows. At several facilities, detainees have been kept in hold rooms for two or three days on average, with some detainees staying in the rooms a week or longer.

In late June, as evidence was piling up that the agency’s 12-hour policy was frequently being violated and lawmakers pushed for a fix, ICE instead modified its rules. The agency issued a memo allowing detainees to be kept in some hold rooms for a maximum of 72 hours excluding “exceptional circumstances,” court documents show, as a “result of increased enforcement efforts” under Trump.

That new 72-hour standard applies only to hold rooms inside ICE field offices, administrative spaces where immigrants have check-ins and interviews – but not in detention centers like Krome, which are built to keep large numbers of detainees in custody. Inside Krome, hold rooms are significantly less equipped for long stays than the main detention areas, which have beds, showers and other infrastructure. The average stay in Krome’s hold rooms is the longest of any ICE hold room during the second Trump administration.

Most of the data CNN reviewed covered detentions during the first five months of the Trump administration, before the rule change.

CNN spoke to current ICE detainees as well as attorneys who have visited ICE detention facilities, all of whom described overcrowded conditions and long stays in some hold rooms.

Katie Blankenship, an immigration attorney in Miami, said the Krome detention center has been so crowded over the last few months that she’s seen nine men jammed into attorney-client meeting rooms converted to makeshift holding cells, with just a cardboard box on the ground for bedding.

“It’s the most miserable situation you can imagine,” Blankenship said, describing long stays in Krome’s hold rooms as “perpetual purgatory without basic human necessities.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said ICE operates hold rooms in “strict accordance” with its detention standards, and disputed that there are substandard conditions at any of its facilities.

“All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, showers, blankets, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and attorneys,” the spokesperson said. “The truth is most ICE facilities have higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority.”

‘Not hospitable places’

For tens of thousands of migrants swept up in the Trump administration’s dragnet – most of whom do not have a criminal record – hold rooms are one stop on the journey through a sprawling immigrant detention system.

ICE’s network includes more than 160 facilities classified as hold rooms, according to the agency data published by the Deportation Data Project, a research group associated with the University of California, Berkeley law school that obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.

Most hold rooms are located in ICE field offices around the country, while a handful are part of larger detention centers.

Since at least 2000 – before ICE was even a distinct government agency – there’s been a standard to limit detainees’ time in hold rooms to 12 hours. When ICE most recently revised its National Detention Standards in February 2025, the rule remained on the books.

Dora B. Schriro, the founding director of the ICE Office of Detention Policy and Planning during the Obama administration, said the rule was an important protection for detainees.

“These are not hospitable places,” Schriro said.

But those time limits were exceeded after Trump took office in January, the data shows, as the new administration swiftly stepped up detentions of immigrants around the country, and issued orders limiting releases, leading to a surge in detention center populations.

Conditions in hold rooms, and how long people are kept there, vary widely around the country. At some smaller facilities, hold rooms are only built to hold a handful of people at a time, and detainees are regularly moved through them within an hour or two, the agency’s data shows.

But in other centers, detainees spend hours or days on average in hold rooms as they wait for ICE agents to move them to longer-term living quarters, transfer them to other facilities or deport them.

At Krome, 62% of detentions in hold rooms have lasted longer than the 12-hour maximum during the Trump administration.

According to a ICE compliance inspection report from April, the facility received a waiver allowing it to stop recording hold room placements in mid-February, and the data shows a steep drop in hold room stays at the same time, so the more recent data is likely incomplete. But the overall Krome population spiked in June, and detainees, lawyers and advocates familiar with the center say that the overcrowding depicted in the data continues to be a major concern.

Meanwhile, at hold rooms in a Baltimore federal building – which had received an exemption allowing holds up to 60 hours in February – 92% of detentions have been longer than 12 hours. The average stay is 53 hours at the hold rooms in Baltimore, and 32 hours at hold rooms in a federal building in New York City.

Of the 267 detention facilities that have been used both in 2024 and during Trump’s term and have had at least 10 people in them at some point, 81% have reached a higher occupancy since Trump took office than they ever had in 2024, according to the data. Roughly half reached new peak occupancies either in June or July.

More than 600 people were kept in Krome hold rooms simultaneously in mid-February. ICE’s New York office had 191 people in hold rooms in early July, while the Baltimore hold rooms reached a maximum of 114 people in mid-June.

With the Trump administration ignoring the agency’s longstanding practice on hold rooms, “it’s highly likely you’re going to have an increase in deaths in detention and serious medical conditions,” Schriro said.

Cellphone videos taken inside hold rooms at the Krome detention center and a New York City federal building show alarming conditions.

A Manhattan video, which was released to journalists by an immigrant rights group in July, showed about two dozen men packed into a room appearing to have nothing to sleep on but thermal emergency blankets.

A class action lawsuit filed last month claimed that people were detained there “often for a week or more … without medication, an opportunity to bathe, brush their teeth or change their clothes,” and described conditions that were “crowded, squalid and punitive.” A federal judge ordered ICE to improve conditions at Manhattan hold rooms last month by reducing the number of detainees and making sure they have sleeping mats and could contact their attorneys.

Other videos from Krome, which were posted on social media, show men sleeping on the floor and curled up in chairs without blankets. A man recording one video asks for help in Spanish, saying detainees need more food and water.

The DHS spokesperson said the Trump administration is increasing detention space, noting that the budget bill passed by Congress and signed by the president this summer will allow the agency to “maintain an average daily population of 100,000 illegal aliens and 80,000 new ICE beds.”

‘Overwhelming, overcrowded’

Immigrant advocates say the conditions are particularly bad at Krome, a former Cold War missile base on the edge of Miami’s urban sprawl, which was converted into an immigrant detention center in the 1980s.

Among those detained at Krome earlier this year was Maksym Chernyak, a 44-year-old Ukrainian man who died while in custody.

Chernyak, who came to the US last August, was arrested in January and charged with battery with bodily harm over what his common-law wife Oksana Tarasiuk told CNN was a misunderstanding exacerbated by a language barrier with police officers. The ICE data shows that Chernyak was detained by ICE immediately after his release from jail, and spent more than three and a half days in a Krome hold room before being moved to the main detention center.

Chernyak told Tarasiuk he was one of about 30 people packed into a hold room, and that he had to sleep on the concrete floor in the cold and didn’t have an opportunity to shower, she said. She said he started feeling sick while he was in the hold room.

Chernyak repeatedly requested medical attention, according to Tarasiuk and the family’s lawyers, who said he was “largely ignored.” Nurses at the facility examined Chernyak twice over the next week and recorded that his blood pressure was rising but took no action to address it, the family’s attorney said.

Then, early in the morning of February 18, Chernyak began having seizures and vomiting in his bunk bed. His “bunkmates immediately called for help but witnesses report that neither guards nor medical staff appeared for twenty to thirty minutes,” his lawyers wrote in an administrative complaint against ICE.

Chernyak was unresponsive when medical staff arrived at around 2:32 a.m., according to ICE medical records obtained by his lawyers. But the staff initially believed he was “intoxicated,” and didn’t call for emergency help for about 45 minutes, until he had another round of seizures in a medical bay, the records show.

By the time Chernyak was admitted to a Miami hospital, he was completely unresponsive, and he was pronounced dead two days later. Chernyak’s toxicology reports later showed he hadn’t been intoxicated, according to his family’s attorney.

Blankenship, the Florida lawyer who is representing Chernyak’s family in a claim against ICE, said she thought the facility’s overcrowding led to him getting delayed medical attention for his high blood pressure.

“This is something that is treatable, it’s not something that has to kill you,” Blankenship said. “There’s no question that Maksym would be alive today if he hadn’t found himself in ICE custody.”

The DHS spokesperson disputed that Chernyak’s death was linked to improper medical care or overcrowding at Krome, and said nurses “rushed to assist” Chernyak when they learned of his medical emergency.

“All in-custody deaths are tragic, taken seriously, and are thoroughly investigated by law enforcement,” the spokesperson said.

Tarasiuk said it had been hard for her to go on without her husband. “Everyone tells us that time heals, but it doesn’t heal,” she said. “The joy of life is gone, gone.”

Chernyak is one of at least 12 people who have died in ICE custody so far this year — including three at Krome — up from seven over the first eight months of 2024, according to agency statistics.

The April compliance report noted numerous deficiencies in Krome’s hold rooms, including overcrowding and detainees kept past the 12-hour time limit. It found that all of the 57 detainees interviewed at Krome complained about excessive hold room times. The facility had no recording of whether staff had offered a meal to any detainee who’d been in a hold room for more than six hours, the inspection report noted.

Louisdor, the immigrant who has spent two stints in Krome’s hold room, told CNN in an interview from the detention center that it was difficult to get medical help in hold rooms.

Louisdor, who came to the US as a child from Haiti and was convicted of aggravated battery as a minor, said he spent several hours in a Krome hold room earlier this year, alongside other men who told him they had been kept in the room for days.

“The body odor is very bad. They weren’t allowing them to shower,” Louisdor said. “It was just overwhelming, overcrowded.”

Immigration attorney Amelia Dagen said conditions were similar at the Baltimore hold rooms.

“There’s no bedding, there’s no sheets, there are no blankets, except for the little foil aluminum blankets,” Dagen said. “Quantities of food were really small … access to water has been very limited.”

Some advocates said they thought the hostile conditions at ICE facilities have encouraged detainees not to fight efforts to deport them.

“They’re voluntarily taking deportation orders because they want to get out of the detention facility,” said Rachel Girod, another immigration attorney who has represented migrants detained by ICE.

On Thursday, ICE raided a 3,000-acre “megasite” owned by a joint venture of the Korean automaker Hyundai and LG Energy, which is currently under construction near the port of Savannah, Georgia.

The plant had a notoriously bad safety record, with two workers, including one Korean, killed in preventable accidents in just two months this spring. The raid has raised major questions about working conditions and who should be held accountable for Hyundai’s alleged violation of labor laws.

The military-style operation saw hundreds of federal law enforcement cars and Humvees surround the auto plant site, where the Korean automaker had invested over $9 billion.

Over 450 workers were detained by ICE in the largest raid of Trump’s second term. Over 300 of those detained were Korean. Interestingly, both Hyundai and LG have stated that they did not directly employ any of the workers arrested at their facilities. They were all employed by subcontractors.

More from Mike Elk

The ICE raid came as a shock, as South Korea’s left-leaning President Lee Jae Myung, who had visited the White House the week before, had touted Korean investment in facilities like Hyundai’s megasite in Georgia.

The reaction across Korea to the raid was outrage. South Korea’s largest newspaper, the right-wing Chosun Ilbo, led with the headline, “After Investing in ‘Trump MAGA,’ What Came Back Was the Arrest of 300 Koreans.”

President Lee pledged to do everything he can to ensure the 300 arrested Korean workers would be free. The South Korean government has offered to provide legal support for all those affected by the raid.

As our story went to publication, The Wall Street Journal announced that a tentative deal was in place to send the over 300 Korean workers home to Korea. However, the 175 other detained workers, predominantly Latino construction workers employed by Hyundai and its suppliers, will remain in federal ICE detention in Georgia.

“Hyundai personifies the Korean economy,” says Tim Shorrock, a veteran labor reporter and union organizer, who partially grew up in South Korea and has spent more than 45 years covering solidarity between American and Korean unions. “It’s by far the best known Korean corporation—this would be like Korea raiding GM in Korea and arresting U.S. execs and workers. Imagine the outcry from the U.S. if that happened.”

Workplace Deaths and Human Trafficking at Hyundai and Its Subcontractors

ICE is claiming that Hyundai broke federal labor laws by forcing Korean workers to work in dangerous conditions, resulting in the death of at least one migrant Korean worker.

According to the Korean news service Donga, a majority of the workers arrested were working in the United States on ESTA visas. ETSA allows foreign workers who are performing instruction or teaching workshops to work in the United States.

Under the terms of ESTA, foreign workers are not allowed to perform manual labor. However, most of the 300 Korean workers arrested at the plant were performing dangerous, hard manual labor.

“We welcome all companies who want to invest in the U.S., and if they need to bring workers in for building or other projects, that’s fine—but they need to do it the legal way,” Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent in Charge Steven N. Schrank said in a statement on Saturday.

“This was not a[n] immigration operation where agents went into the premises, rounded up folks and put them on buses. This has been a multi-month criminal investigation,” added Schrank.

On March 24th, Sunbok You, a 67-year-old construction worker, was killed when a forklift dragged him, and his body was severed in half, according to local station WTOC, which obtained footage of his death scene.

On May 21st, 27-year-old Allen Kowalski, an employee of a subcontractor, was killed when a load fell off a forklift, according to local station WSAV.

The two deaths led to high-profile investigations in outlets such as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Georgia Public Media, and The Current. Following the deaths, federal investigators, including OSHA, began scrutinizing the plant more closely.

“Based on what's happened, there is a culture change that needs to occur on the project, and it doesn’t appear that it’s occurring,” a top Clinton-era OSHA official, James Stanley, the president of FDR Safety Solutions, told the Atlanta-Journal Constitution in July. The reporting focused on the Korean employers’ wide use of subcontractors that employed migrant workers.

Shortly after the raid, ICE announced it was opening an investigation into human trafficking at the megasite.

During previous Democratic administrations, workplace safety officials in federal courts routinely argued that “human trafficking” existed when an immigrant worker’s legal status was tied to an employer that was asking them to violate labor laws. Due to workers’ dependence on their employer for their immigration status and in violation of labor laws, workplace safety advocates have argued that such practices constitute “human trafficking.”

Shorrock says that he doesn’t necessarily trust the Trump Administration’s spin on the raid, but does say there is reason for concern if workers on ESTA visas were illegally forced into dangerous construction work.

“That’s a situation of exploitation,” says Shorrock, who says that unions in both Korea and the United States should be paying close attention to the working conditions at Hyundai’s plant.

Hyundai, the largest automaker in Korea, is notorious for using subcontractors to avoid workplace laws.

“These big companies like Hyundai rely on subcontractors for so much of what they do. The Korean economy is structured in such a way that subcontractors are common and, until recently, did not have the same rights as full-time workers at the parent company like Hyundai,” says Shorrock. “It’s really helped divide Korea’s workforce, and bust unions.”

Hyundai has faced various legal accusations in the past of forcing migrant workers to do dangerous work outside the scope of their visas.

In August, a federal judge issued a ruling allowing a lawsuit to proceed against Hyundai subsidiary Glovis Georgia and subcontractor GFA Alabama, brought by Mexican engineers.

The engineers claim they were brought into the country through the US Trade NAFTA (TN) visa program, which allows them to do professional work. However, when they arrived, they were assigned to non-professional roles, performing strenuous work on the assembly line and in the warehouse. The migrant workers were also paid $11 an hour, while colleagues made $17-18 an hour for the same work.

Hyundai has also faced scrutiny for its use of child labor. In 2022, Reuters won a George Polk Award when they exposed that four separate Hyundai supplier plants in Alabama were using underage immigrant children to do dangerous factory work.

Additionally, in 2024, the Department of Labor sued Hyundai and one of its subcontracted staffing agencies after a 13-year-old girl was found to be working 50-60 hours a week at the plant instead of attending middle school.

Hyundai has publicly claimed that it did not violate any labor laws at its facility. They have pledged to open a thorough investigation into subcontractors.

“We take our responsibility as a corporate citizen seriously, and incidents like this remind us of the importance of robust oversight throughout our entire supply chain and contractor network,” Hyundai said in a statement.

Following previous workplace deaths, Hyundai has dismissed subcontractors, yet the problems persist within the company.

The use of subcontractors that broke labor laws will likely shield Hyundai from any real legal consequences. Labor activists say that the federal government’s action penalizing migrant Korean workers for being forced to work in unsafe situations is the wrong approach.

Korean and American Unions Fight Back Against Hyundai

“When multiple workers have died during the construction of this very plant, the only federal action that could possibly be justified is to strengthen enforcement of occupational safety and health protections and other labor rights—a far cry from ICE raids,” said Georgia AFL-CIO President Yvonne Brooks in a statement sent to Payday Report.

Immigrants’ rights groups are rallying to defend the over 450 detained workers, including the 300 Korean workers.

“Our communities know the workers targeted are everyday people, who are trying to feed their families, build stronger communities, and work towards a better future,” said a coalition of two dozen Southern immigrant groups in a statement. “Hundreds of people abducted in the raids are now at the Folkston ICE Processing Center (FIPC) located in Charlton County. FIPC has a well-documented history of inhumane conditions and violations found by federal inspectors.”

Groups like Migrant Equity Southeast have pledged to help support and provide food and housing for the families affected by losing a family member.

“Right now, dozens of immigrant families across Coastal & South Georgia are facing uncertainty, fear, and urgent needs,” said the group in a Facebook post calling on community members for donations, support, and legal service assistance for those affected by the raid. “Together, we can ensure our community knows they are not alone.”

Shorrock, who runs the newsletter Empire Blues, which focuses heavily on Korea, says that media attention and investigations about what the workers were doing in Georgia will likely grow as the story dominates headlines back in South Korea.

“The anger is coming not only from the left in Korea and the government, but also going to come from the Conservative parties too,” says Shorrock. “This is seen as an attack on Korean workers and companies. It’s a national issue in Korea.”

The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which has helped organize a series of roving strikes at Hyundai over subcontractor abuse in Korea over the past few years, has also denounced it.

After a 20-year battle, the union federation helped pass the Labor Union Act in August, which has extended union rights to Korean workers employed by subcontractors.

The Korean Federation of Trade Unions firmly denounced Trump for punishing immigrant workers employed by Hyundai and its subcontractors.

“To embrace us when investment is needed, then scapegoat us when convenient, is nothing short of gangster behavior,” said the union federation.

The UAW, which is seeking to unionize Hyundai in the South, released a statement condemning “Hyundai’s disgraceful record on worker safety … the militarized federal crackdown on these workers further hurts safety at Hyundai. Workers are not the problem. Exploitative corporations are.”

Shorrock says that now is a key moment for the labor movement globally to fight against these abuses. “I think American and Korean unions should be standing in solidarity against this kind of raid,” says Shorrock. “Trump is carrying out political warfare in these attacks on immigrants, and it affects all workers, Korean, Latino, everybody, and they should be standing up for workers in general. They get caught up in these kind of draconian ICE operations.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23475/download/Payday%20Report%20090825.png?cb=c0cd0b794d8671b8b12534fb38d51c94&w=1024,N,,2025-09-08 13:01:12.224592

Appeals court upholds defamation lawsuit, ordering Trump to pay more than $80m

A federal appeals court in New York has upheld the defamation lawsuit filed by writer E Jean Carroll, and the $83.3m award, after Trump denied her claim that he raped her.

The panel of judges also rejected the administration’s argument that the president is protected by the supreme court’s immunity ruling last year.

As the president praised the lack of crime in DC while delivering remarks at the Museum of the Bible today, he repeated his desire to send federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to “straighten” Chicago out.

“You try and reason with people, like in Chicago, with the governor there, you try and reason with them, and it’s like you’re talking to a wall,” Trump said. It’s part of his frequent refrain that Illinois governor JB Pritzker is reckless for not “asking” for the president’s help. Earlier on Truth Social, Trump insisted that he wants to “help the people of Chicago, not hurt them.”

In his post he continued to deride Chicago’s Democratic leaders, including mayor Brandon Johnson:

""The City and State have not been able to do the job. People of Illinois should band together and DEMAND PROTECTION. IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE!!! ACT NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!

Supreme court upholds Trump decision to fire Federal Trade Commission member

The supreme court has allowed Donald Trump to fire a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It’s the latest decision in a spate of high-profile firings of Senate-confirmed officials in recent months.

Chief justice John Roberts issued the ruling, which blocks a lower court’s ruling for the president to reinstate Rebecca Slaughter while the case plays out. A federal district court judge said last week that the administration had violated a federal law which prevents FTC members from removal without cause.

Trump moved to fire both Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya from the FTC earlier this year. Both are the only Democratic appointees of the five-member board.

Trump is now touting that DC is a “safe zone”, since the surge of federal law enforcement and takeover of the DC police. He adds that the “beautification” project for the DC will continue.

He goes on to say that DC mayor Muriel Bowser has been compliant with the administration’s efforts. “It wasn’t her ideology, but now maybe it is,” Trump says.

Trump previews order to 'protect' right to prayer in public schools

Trump is now speaking at the Museum of the Bible in DC. He just announced that the Department of Education will be issuing “new guidance protecting the right to prayer in our public schools.”

A short while ago the president brought up a 12-year-old California student who addressed the Religious Liberty Commission. He told a story about how he was “forced” to read My Shadow is Pink – a story book that explores how a young boy explores different parts of his identity that aren’t considered traditionally masculine.

“I knew this was not right, but I was afraid of getting in trouble. After my family spoke up, school treated us badly, and kids started bullying me and my brother because of our faith, and the school did nothing to stop it. It hurt a lot, but I kept trusting God,” she student said today, standing next to Trump.

The president went on to undermine trans rights. “Can you imagine men playing in women’s sports?” Trump said. “Democrats don’t want to give it up.”

Trump administration asks supreme court to allow foreign aid clawback to continue

The Trump administration filed an emergency request to the supreme court on Monday to block a lower court’s ruling, which stopped the administration from withholding billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated foreign aid.

An appeals court ordered the administration to spend the money, upholding the federal judge’s ruling last week, which ultimately prompted the request to the supreme court.

Last month, Trump announced that he did not intend to spend almost $5bn in foreign aid, using a rare tool known as the “pocket rescission”. This involves submitting a request to congress so close to the end of the fiscal year, that it effectively runs out the clock for the 45 days needed for lawmakers to review the request.

For many Americans, the new Covid vaccine guidelines from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), spearheaded by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and his highly controversial Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, have added another layer of stress to an increasingly inaccessible healthcare system.

The agency authorized Covid vaccines for people 65 and older, who are known to be more at risk from serious illnesses from Covid infections, but younger people will only be eligible if they have an underlying medical condition that makes them particularly vulnerable.

For Madison Heckle, a 33-year-old attorney in the final stretch of wedding planning, the stakes feel personal. She has struggled with frequent illness ever since first contracting Covid in 2021.

“Ever since then, I just catch everything,” she said. Though she expressed her frustrations with a weakened immune system, she had her doubts that she would qualify for vaccine coverage under the new guidelines.

Her immediate worry is simple: not being bedridden on the day she says “I do”. “Weddings are expensive, and I don’t want to be sick that day if I can prevent it, and so I just want to get the vaccine,” she said. “I’ve gotten my booster every year.”

Yet the new rules have complicated what was once routine. Instead of stopping by CVS, as she has in past years, Heckle found herself on the phone with her insurer, navigating coverage questions and learning she’d need to go to a different pharmacy.

“I just am really hoping that I don’t have to risk being sick on my wedding day,” she said.

The president has also spent a fair amount of time on Truth Social today, most recently touting the impact of the surge of federal law enforcement in DC, and the takeover of the Metropolitan police department (MPD).

“Washington, D.C. IS A SAFE ZONE IN JUST A MATTER OF WEEKS. Thank you, President Trump. Who’s Next???,” Trump said, possibly alluding to his frequent threats to send federal agents and national guard troops to Chicago.

Meanwhile, attorney general Pam Bondi said today that since more federal law enforcement began assisting MPD, there have been more than 2,100 arrests in the capital in the last month, and 214 illegal firearms seized.

Trump says US is ready for second phase of Russian sanctions

Speaking to reporters on Sunday, the president said that he was ready for the second phase of sanctions against Russia. He didn’t elaborate on when those sanctions would take effect, or how severe they would be.

He later said that “no one has been tougher on President Putin” but went on to say that he’s not “thrilled” with the Moscow leader.

“Look, we’re going to get it done. The Russia, Ukraine situation. We’re going to get it done,” Trump added.

Trump trade adviser demands justice department to vindicate him from subpoena conviction

Hugo Lowell

Intent on vindication after spending four months in prison last year, Peter Navarro asked a federal appeals court on Sunday night to force Donald Trump’s justice department to explain why it would not defend his 2022 conviction for defying a January 6 committee subpoena.

The request to the US court of appeals for the DC circuit is fraught for the department as it would have to confront the appearance that it quietly dropped the case in order to shield Navarro after he was tapped as a senior adviser to the president.

Navarro’s 13-page filing also has the potential to set precedent for years to come over complicated immunity and separation of powers questions concerning the ability of White House advisers to defy congressional subpoenas without facing prosecution.

“The department’s abrupt withdrawal now deprives the court of transparency about the department’s current view concerning the landmark constitutional issues presented, undermines the fairness of the process, and burdens the defense with uncertainty,” the filing said.

Navarro was subpoenaed in 2022 by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot for his involvement in a plan to delay Congress’s certification of the 2020 election results to change the outcome, including to recruit state lawmakers to join the effort.

US states that protect unions’ collective bargaining rights have experienced an increase in new union members, while states with anti-union “right to work” laws are responsible for declines in union members, a new report reveals.

The report on the state of unions by the Illinois Economic Policy Institute and the Project for Middle Class Renewal at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found significant discrepancies between the 26 states in the US with “right to work” laws compared with the 24 states and Washington DC that protect collective bargaining rights.

The right-to-work states, concentrated in the south and central US, have a union density of 5.1%, compared with 14.2% for states with collective bargaining rights, concentrated on the coasts and in the north.

Workers in right-to-work states earn about 7% less in wages, accounting for local differences in the cost of living. According to the AFL-CIO, the US’s largest labor federation, states with right-to-work laws received 36% higher discrimination charges from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on average.

Right-to-work laws allow workers represented by unions to stop paying dues for the services and benefits they receive through union representation, depleting resources from labor unions. Public sector workers in all 50 states have also had their collective bargaining rights stripped through the imposition of right-to-work laws by the US supreme court’s 2018 decision Janus v AFSCME.

Florida plan to drop school vaccine mandates won’t take effect for 90 days

Florida’s plan to drop school vaccine mandates likely won’t take effect for 90 days and would include only chickenpox and a few other illnesses unless lawmakers decide to extend it to other diseases, like polio and measles, the health department said on Sunday.

The department responded to a request for details, four days after Florida’s surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, said the state would become the first to make vaccinations voluntary and let families decide whether to inoculate their children.

It’s a retreat from decades of public policy and research that has shown vaccines to be safe and the most effective way to stop the spread of communicable diseases, especially among children. Despite that evidence, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, has expressed deep skepticism about vaccines.

Florida’s plan would lift mandates on school vaccines for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza and pneumococcal diseases, such as meningitis, the health department said.

“The department initiated the rule change on September 3 2025, and anticipates the rule change will not be effective for approximately 90 days,” the state told the Associated Press in an email. The public school year in Florida started in August.

The former US congressman John Burton, a salty-tongued and unabashedly liberal San Francisco Democrat who stood up for the working class and nurtured countless political careers, including that of Nancy Pelosi, died Sunday. He was 92.

Burton died in San Francisco of natural causes, his family said in a statement.

Tributes poured in from California’s top politicians, who recalled Burton as a fierce and tireless advocate for laborers, foster children and the environment. Over the years, Burton mentored Pelosi, former US senator Barbara Boxer, current US senator Alex Padilla and countless other California officials.

“There was no greater champion for the poor, the bullied, the disabled, and forgotten Californians than John Burton. He was a towering figure – a legendary force whose decades of service shaped our state and our politics for the better,” said Governor Gavin Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, in a statement.

Another former San Francisco mayor, Willie Brown, said that death had managed to separate him from a dear friend who was by his side for decades – as college students where they first met, as fellow newbies in the state Assembly and as influential members of California’s Democratic political machine.

“John Burton may have been the best person with whom I served as a member of the legislature,” said Brown.

Trump issues ‘last warning’ to Hamas to accept Gaza ceasefire deal

Donald Trump on Sunday issued what he called his “last warning” to Hamas, urging the Palestinian militant group to accept a deal to release hostages from Gaza.

“The Israelis have accepted my Terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning, there will not be another one!”

Hamas said in a later statement that it received some ideas from the US side through mediators to reach a ceasefire deal in Gaza.

The group said it was discussing with mediators ways to develop those ideas, without giving specifics.

Hamas also reiterated its readiness for negotiations to release all hostages in exchange for a “clear announcement of an end to the war” and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.

The Republican senator who heads the homeland security committee has criticized JD Vance for “despicable” comments apparently in support of extrajudicial military killings.

“Killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military,” the vice-president said in an X post on Saturday, in defense of Tuesday’s US military strike against a Venezuelan boat in the Caribbean Sea, which killed 11 people the administration alleged were drug traffickers.

Vance added: “Democrats: let’s send your kids to die in Russia. Republicans: actually let’s protect our people from the scum of the earth.”

Donald Trump has vowed additional military action against purported traffickers, who are not military targets, after the boat strike, saying “there’s more where that came from”.

The controversial attack inflamed already-high tensions between the US and Venezuela. In August Trump dispatched war ships and marines to the Caribbean, which his supporters say is in aid of efforts to oust Venezuelan’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. On Friday, reports revealed that Trump was sending 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to support US military action against drug traffickers.

US treasury secretary denies Trump tariffs are tax on Americans

Maya Yang

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has refused to acknowledge that the sweeping trade tariffs imposed by Donald Trump around the world are taxes on Americans.

In a new interview on Sunday with NBC host Kristen Welker, Bessent, a former billionaire hedge fund manager, dismissed concerns from major American companies including John Deere, Nike and Black and Decker who have all said that Trump’s tariffs policy will cost them billions of dollars annually.

Addressing Welker, Bessent said: “You’re taking these from earnings calls, and on earnings calls, they have to give the draconian scenario. There aren’t companies coming out and saying, ‘Oh, because of the tariffs, we’re doing this.’”

He went on to add: “If things are so bad, why was the GDP 3.3%? Why is the stock market at a new high? Because, you know, with President Trump, we care both about big companies and small companies.”

As concerns continue to grow over American companies trying to pass on the cost of US tariffs on to everyday Americans, Welker asked: “Do you acknowledge that these tariffs are a tax on American consumers?” To which Bessent replied: “No, I don’t.”

300 South Koreans detained at Hyundai plant in US to be released, says Seoul

Victoria Bekiempis

South Korea announced on Sunday that the roughly 300 of its nationals detained during an immigration raid in Georgia would be released and flown home, as the sudden detention of workers appeared to strain the longstanding diplomatic and economic relationship between the two nations.

Nearly 500 workers, among them at least 300 South Koreans and at least 23 Mexicans, were arrested at the Hyundai-LG battery plant in the city of Ellabell on Thursday.

US authorities released footage of the raid, which showed detained workers, restrained in handcuffs and ankle chains, loaded on to buses. The raid marked the largest single site sweep carried out under Donald Trump’s nationwide anti-immigration campaign.

“As a result of the swift and united response … negotiations for the release of the detained workers have been concluded,” Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff to South Korea’s president Lee Jae Myung, told reporters.

“Only administrative procedures remain. Once these are completed, a chartered flight will depart to bring our citizens home,” he said.

LG executive Kim Ki-soo flew to Georgia in an apparent effort to slow the fallout. “The immediate priority now is the swift release of both our LG Energy Solution employees and those of our partner firms,” Ki-soo reportedly said before boarding a plane.

Trump tells foreign companies to ‘respect’ immigration law after Hyundai Ice raid

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next couple of hours.

We start with news that Donald Trump has told foreign companies that they must hire and train American workers and respect immigration laws, after a raid at a Hyundai Motor manufacturing facility in Georgia saw about 300 South Koreans detained.

Nearly 500 workers in total were detained in the raid on Thursday, with US authorities releasing footage showing them restrained in handcuffs and ankle chains, loaded on to buses.

The raid marked the largest single site sweep carried out under Trump’s nationwide anti-immigration campaign and appeared to strain the longstanding diplomatic and economic relationship between the US and South Korea.

“I am hereby calling on all Foreign Companies investing in the United States to please respect our Nation’s Immigration Laws,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday, adding “Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people … What we ask in return is that you hire and train American Workers.”

Trump made the post shortly after telling reporters he would look at what happened but that the incident had not harmed his relationship with South Korea.

Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor advised staff who were about to go on business trips next week to the US to delay them unless considered indispensable, a South Korean newspaper reported on Monday.

And in other developments:

US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has refused to acknowledge that the sweeping trade tariffs imposed by Donald Trump around the world are taxes on Americans.

President Trump on Sunday suggested a Gaza deal could come soon to secure the release of all the hostages held by Hamas, after earlier issuing what he called his “last warning” to the Palestinian militant group. Trump, speaking to reporters after landing in the Washington area on Sunday evening following a brief trip to New York, said he had been discussing the issue on the plane.

Trump was booed and cheered at the US Open during the national anthem before Sunday’s men’s final. Prior to the match, US Open broadcasters were asked not to show any negative crowd reactions to the president at the event.

Nine attorneys – who have represented approximately 50 Jeffrey Epstein survivors – have told the Guardian they have not been recently contacted by the justice department, despite the president’s promises to get to the bottom of the deceased financier’s crimes.

As Chicago braced for an immigration enforcement crackdown and a possible national guard deployment, churches across the city have urged congregants to carry identification, stay connected to family and protest.

Trump said on Sunday that individual European leaders would visit the United States on Monday or Tuesday to discuss how to resolve the Russian-Ukraine war. Speaking to reporters, Trump also said he would speak to Russian president Vladimir Putin soon.

Many of the demolitions are being carried out by robots that place explosives inside homes. Israel has killed 32 Palestinians so far today. Officials say another 83 were killed over a 24-hour period ending on Sunday. Residents of Gaza City say there is no safe place to go.

Ibtasim Muqdad: “In regard to displacement, we were displaced before to the south. There were also martyrs there and bombardment. Wherever we went, there were bombardments, from one area to another, from Rafah to Khan Younis, from Khan Younis to Deir al-Balah. There were bombardments everywhere. We later came here. It is all the same. All displacement is for nothing. It is enough.”

Save the Children reports that Israel has killed more than 20,000 Palestinian children over the past 23 months — this means at least one Palestinian child has been killed every hour on average by Israeli forces. The group said, “If the international community does not step up, an entire generation of children in Gaza will be lost.”

Meanwhile, another six Palestinians have died from “famine and malnutrition,” bringing the total to almost 400, including 140 children, who have starved to death.

In Israel, an attack on a bus stop in occupied East Jerusalem has left six people dead and as many as 15 injured. At least one of the victims was a rabbi. Israeli authorities say they believe the attack was carried out by two Palestinians from the West Bank. Police said the attackers were both shot dead.

In other news from Israel, the country’s Supreme Court has ruled the government has failed to provide adequate food for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The court ruled Israel must provide prisoners “a basic level of existence.” The ruling came in response to a petition filed by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Israeli rights group Gisha.

In London, police arrested nearly 900 people Saturday at a protest against the U.K. government banning the group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. It is now illegal for anyone in Britain to show support for Palestine Action. Protests against the ban have been mounting for weeks.

Tamara Abood: “Ordinary people who have never been on protests in their lives are, you know, reckoning with their conscience. They’re thinking, 'I cannot keep sitting, day in, day out, and on my sofa watching this abject horror and do nothing.' And so, the extraordinary thing is, you know, the images, the most powerful images we’re seeing, are of, you know, disabled, middle-aged, elderly white people being carted off by the police for the crime of saying, 'Stop killing children.'”

In other protest news, organizers say over 110,000 people took to the streets of Brussels on Sunday in a major pro-Palestine rally that came days after the Belgian government announced it would soon recognize a Palestinian state and impose sanctions on Israel.

In Tunisia, thousands of people gathered Sunday to welcome boats carrying about 350 activists who are sailing to Gaza in an attempt to break the siege. Passengers on the flotilla include Nelson Mandela’s grandson, the South African MP Mandla Mandela.

Mandla Mandela: “Coming all the way from South Africa to participate in this is really a joy to once again be able to set sail and go and break the blockade in Gaza and end the siege, which has been going on for the past 18 years. And we hope that it will be received as such, because we are a peaceful people. We pose no threat. We are carrying humanitarian aid for our brothers and sisters.”

On Saturday, President Trump threatened to send National Guard troops and ICE agents to Chicago, writing on social media, “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR” — a reference to his order to change the name of the Department of Defense. He also wrote, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning.” Trump accompanied the message with an AI-generated image depicting himself as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore from the Vietnam War film “Apocalypse Now,” in front of the Chicago skyline with helicopters, flames and the phrase “Chipocalypse Now.”

In response, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker called the president a “wannabe dictator.” By Sunday, President Trump walked back his comments, telling reporters, “We’re not going to war. We’re going to clean up our cities.” Meanwhile, thousands of Chicagoans took to the streets on Saturday to protest Trump’s plans to send ICE agents and federal troops to the city.

David Álvarez: “National Guard and sending ICE agents here to our community is a direct threat to not only us, but our community. It is us. It is our neighbors and our friends. It affects everyone. Businesses have been dropping. Restaurants have been dropping. Everything has — people have been scared.”

Over the weekend, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was launching new immigration raids in the Boston area. This comes after Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has repeatedly criticized Trump’s attacks on Boston and other sanctuary cities.

In Washington, D.C., thousands marched in the largest demonstration yet there against President Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and the federal takeover of the district’s police force. The “We Are All D.C.” march was organized by a coalition of groups which include Free DC and the American Civil Liberties Union. The Trump administration is set to extend the deployment of National Guard troops in D.C. to December. Meanwhile, officials have dismantled part of a peace vigil outside the White House that had been running for more than four decades, under Trump’s orders to clear homeless encampments. Authorities reportedly mislabeled the vigil as a shelter.

Meanwhile, here in New York on Sunday, Trump was loudly booed by the crowd as he attended the U.S. Open men’s final. The United States Tennis Association had sent a memo to broadcasters, asking them to censor the crowd’s reaction to Trump.

South Korea announced that it is sending a charter plane to the U.S. to bring back more than 300 of its citizens who were rounded up and detained by ICE at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. ICE officials arrested nearly 500 people, most of them South Korean nationals, on Thursday at the Hyundai-LG battery plant. Footage of the raid showed workers shackled in handcuffs and ankle chains and loaded onto buses. ICE officials have called it the largest enforcement operation in the agency’s history. South Korea’s foreign minister is expected to arrive in Washington today to discuss the release of the workers. The ICE raid comes as South Korea recently agreed to invest $350 billion in the U.S. in exchange for lower tariffs.

On Friday, a federal immigration board at the Justice Department ruled that undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. are not eligible to be released on bond. According to the ruling, immigrants could be detained “for the duration of their proceedings,” which could take years. Lawyers say the ruling would mean that millions of immigrants could be subject to mandatory detention, including longtime residents. One former immigration judge, Dana Leigh Marks, told Politico, “It’s a total cynical move to try to force people to litigate their cases while they’re detained.”

On Sunday, Russia launched the largest drone assault against Ukraine since 2022, attacking the main government building in Kyiv for the first time. At least four people were killed in Russian strikes all over the country, including a mother and her baby. Ukraine also launched airstrikes against Russia, killing three people. Speaking to reporters, President Trump said he was ready to impose a second round of sanctions against Russia, but gave no additional details.

The New York Times has revealed that U.S. Navy SEALs took part in a failed top-secret mission to install eavesdropping technology in North Korea in 2019. The mission was aborted when the SEALs were spotted by a boat near the North Korean coast. The SEALs opened fire on the boat, killing everyone on board — believed to be two or three North Korean civilians who were diving for shellfish. The Trump administration never notified key members of Congress about the top-secret mission.

Senator Bernie Sanders brought his Fighting Oligarchy tour to Brooklyn College in New York on Saturday, where he campaigned with New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Sanders praised Mamdani’s vision for New York.

Sen. Bernie Sanders: “And what Zohran’s campaign is about is an understanding that today we are living in an unprecedented moment in the modern history of our country, and we have got to fight back in an unprecedented way.”

The Sanders-Mamdani rally comes as President Donald Trump is attempting to push New York Mayor Eric Adams to drop out of the mayor race in an attempt to help boost Andrew Cuomo. The Trump administration has reportedly considered making Adams the ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

In 1967, Robert Jay Lifton won a National Book Award for his work, “Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima.” In 1986, he published the seminal book, “The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide.” He appeared on Democracy Now! several times, including in 2017, when he talked about Donald Trump.

Robert Jay Lifton: “Well, I wrote a letter, together with Judith Herman, to The New York Times, in which we raised two issues. One was his relation to reality, which is, I would say, solipsistic and untenable and very dangerous to everyone.”

Amy Goodman: “What do you mean, 'solipsistic'?”

Robert Jay Lifton: “Solipsistic, from within the self. In other words, he only sees the world from within his sense of self. He can’t have empathy for others. He can’t really think into the future the consequences of his actions, because he’s totally preoccupied with the immediate event and how he can deal with it or manipulate it as emerging through the perception on the part of his sense of self.”

The sprawling manufacturing site The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.
Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.","Hundreds of federal agents descended on a sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in Georgia and detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals.

This is the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site state officials have long called Georgia’s largest economic development project.

The detainment of South Korean nationals also sets it apart, as they are rarely caught up in immigration enforcement compared to other nationalities.

Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist. Others had plastic ties around their wrists as they boarded a Georgia inmate-transfer bus.

Here are some things to know about the raid and the people impacted:

The workers detained

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.

Some of them worked for the battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution that is slated to open next year, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site, according to Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations.

He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

But an immigration attorney representing two of the detained workers said his clients arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.

Attorney Charles Kuck said one of his clients has been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks, while the other has been in the country for about 45 days, adding that they had been planning to return home soon.

The detainees also included a lawful permanent resident who was kept in custody for having a prior record involving firearm and drug offenses, since committing a crime of “moral turpitude” can put their status in jeopardy, Lindsay Williams, a public affairs officer for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Saturday.

Williams denied reports that U.S. citizens had been detained at the site since “once citizens have identified themselves, we have no authority.”

Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday that none of its employees had been detained as far as it knew and that it is reviewing its practices to make sure suppliers and subcontractors follow U.S. employment laws. LG told The Associated Press that it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens and is sending diplomats to the site.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None of them have been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said, but the investigation is ongoing.

Family members and friends of the detainees were having a hard time locating them or figuring out how to get in touch with them, James Woo, communications director for the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said Saturday in an email.

Woo added that many of the families were in South Korea because many of the detainees were in the United States only for business purposes.

Raid is the result of a monthslong investigation

The raid was the result of a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site, Schrank said.

In a search warrant and related affidavits, agents sought everything from employment records for current and former workers and timecards to video and photos of workers.

Court records filed this week indicated that prosecutors do not know who hired what it called “hundreds of illegal aliens.” The identity of the “actual company or contractor hiring the illegal aliens is currently unknown,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote in a Thursday court filing.

The sprawling manufacturing site

The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.

Hyundai Motor Group started manufacturing EVs at the $7.6 billion plant a year ago. Today, the site employs about 1,200 people in a largely rural area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Savannah.

Agents specifically honed in on an adjacent plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county’s Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.

Raid was the ‘largest single site enforcement operation’

From farms and construction sites to restaurants and auto repair shops, there have been a wide array of workplace raids undertaken in this administration. But most have been smaller, including a raid the same day as the Georgia one in which federal officers took away dozens of workers from a snack-bar manufacturer in Cato, New York.

Other recent high-profile raids have included one in July targeting a legal marijuana farm northwest of Los Angeles. More than 360 people were arrested in one of the largest raids since Trump took office in January. Another one took place at an Omaha. Nebraska, meat production plant and involved dozens of workers being taken away.

Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The majority of the people detained are Koreans. During the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2024, only 46 Koreans were deported during out of more than 270,000 removals for all nationalities, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Community members and advocates have mixed reactions

Kemp and other Georgia Republican officials, who had courted Hyundai and celebrated the EV plant’s opening, issued statements Friday saying all employers in the state were expected to follow the law.

The nonprofit legal advocacy organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta described the raid in a joint statement as “unacceptable.”

“Our communities know the workers targeted at Hyundai are everyday people who are trying to feed their families, build stronger communities, and work toward a better future,” the statement said.

Sammie Rentz opened the Viet Huong Supermarket less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Hyundai site six months ago and said he worries business may not bounce back after falling off sharply since the raid.

“I’m concerned. Koreans are very proud people, and I bet they’re not appreciating what just happened. I’m worried about them cutting and running, or starting an exit strategy,” he said.

Ellabell resident Tanya Cox, who lives less than a mile from the Hyundai site, said she had no ill feelings toward Korean nationals or other immigrant workers at the site. But few neighbors were employed there, and she felt like more construction jobs at the battery plant should have gone to local residents.

“I don’t see how it’s brought a lot of jobs to our community or nearby communities,” Cox said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigration_Raid_Hyundai_Plant_52767_e7cb16-e1757255041120.jpg?w=1024&h=577,N,,2025-09-08 12:03:46.599371

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has launched an operation in Massachusetts, with the capital Boston at the center of the crackdown, according to a report by the New York Times.

The initiative, called Operation Patriot 2.0, began over the weekend and is expected to run for several weeks, the report said, citing officials familiar with the plan. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the effort is aimed at arresting “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens living in the state.”

In a statement Saturday, DHS issued a stark warning: “If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will hunt you down, arrest you, deport you, and you will never return.”

The operation comes just days before the Trump administration is expected to begin a similar crackdown in Chicago and as immigration arrests rise in the nation’s capital, Washington, DC.

A US official who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the effort publicly, told the Times that the agency has prepared plans for an even broader surge of enforcement in the coming weeks.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has drawn criticism from the administration for her support of the city’s sanctuary policies. DHS directly called her out in its statement, accusing her of putting “public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens.”

The Justice Department also filed a lawsuit this past week challenging Boston’s sanctuary city ordinance, known as the Boston Trust Act.

“The City of Boston and its mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement, according to the Times.

On Thursday, the Justice Department also filed a lawsuit against Boston, Wu and the local police department seeking to negate the city’s Trust Act, a 2014 city law limiting local cooperation with federal immigration actions. In a release following the lawsuit, Attorney General Pam Bondi called Boston “among the worst sanctuary offenders in America.”

Wu reiterated Sunday that, “as ordered in the Boston Trust Act, no Boston police or local resources will be co-opted into federal immigration enforcement and their mass deportation agenda.”

The mayor spoke out against ICE actions in the region Sunday.

He had been detained at the Central Arizona Correctional Complex, in the town of Florence, and was pronounced dead by a doctor at the Mountain Vista Medical Center, near Phoenix, on the morning of Aug. 31, according to ICE. The agency said his cause of death was unknown and remained under investigation.

Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, 32, was a citizen of Mexico who had been arrested by Flagstaff police on Aug. 2 and charged with possession and use of drug paraphernalia, which is a felony. Immigration enforcement agents said they took Vargas into custody in Phoenix before transferring him to the detention center in Florence.

Vargas had been arrested at least twice before by Flagstaff police, according to ICE. The agency said he was convicted by the Flagstaff Municipal Court of driving under the influence in 2018 and 2024, with the latter conviction resulting in a sentence of 10 days in confinement.

ICE said its agents notified the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Inspector General, and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility of Vargas' death, which is required by agency policies. They also notified the Mexican Embassy.

""The Trump administration has relied more heavily on unilateral actions than any previous administration, pushing policies through executive orders without legislative backing,"" Diao said.

""Moreover, the inherent instability of executive orders, which can be easily revoked by a successor or halted by courts, further reduces policy continuity and predictability,"" he said.","The Trump administration is facing a barrage of judicial pushback against its policies, highlighting a growing conflict between the US executive and judicial branches, which could undermine the credibility of the federal government, experts said.

This clash was on full display last week, as US courts ruled against the administration on three high-profile cases, including the freezing of Harvard's research funding, the deployment of military to Los Angeles, and the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has pushed numerous highly contentious policies, including strict immigration controls and extensive use of executive power to reshape the federal government. These moves have sparked a wave of litigation, with 337 active cases challenging the administration's actions as of Aug 28, according to data from Lawfare, a US nonprofit multimedia publication.

Diao Daming, a professor of US studies at Renmin University of China's School of International Relations, said, ""It's rare in US history to see such a large number of lawsuits targeting a newly elected president's major policies, and to see so many rulings go against the administration.""

He attributed this trend to the tension between the administration's unilateral approach to pushing a controversial agenda and the intensifying partisan polarization within the country.

""The Trump administration has relied more heavily on unilateral actions than any previous administration, pushing policies through executive orders without legislative backing,"" Diao said. ""Besides the unilateral approach, the policies the administration is trying to push are also quite contentious in nature, which has led to an unprecedented number of legal challenges.""

An article published by the Harvard Kennedy School on June 4 noted that Trump signed 147 executive orders in his first 100 days — a record high — while enacting only five laws, a record low.

Wei Zongyou, a professor at the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, said this reliance on executive power is itself a symptom of a deeper legislative dysfunction.

""Congressional gridlock, fueled by partisan divisions, makes it difficult to pass major legislation. This has forced the president to rely more heavily on executive orders to implement his policies,"" he said.

According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March, eight out of ten US adults say that when it comes to important issues facing the country, Republican and Democratic voters not only disagree on plans and policies, but also cannot agree on basic facts.

Experts warned that escalating partisan polarization and social division have transformed the judicial arena into a key battleground in the ongoing partisan struggle.

Diao observed the increasing politicization of the US judiciary. ""While judges are not explicitly labeled as Republican or Democratic, the fact that judges are nominated by presidents with partisan affiliations inevitably leads to them being more aligned with the ideologies of the presidents who appointed them.""

Wei said the paralysis of Congress has led both sides to increasingly rely on the judiciary to advance or obstruct policy changes, turning the courts into ""substitute legislative bodies"".

Politicization of courts

""As both parties realize that controlling the power of judicial interpretation is as important as winning elections, the politicization of the courts is only set to escalate,"" he said.

The ongoing conflict between the executive and judicial branches, fueled by partisan strife, is eroding public trust in the government and significantly increasing the uncertainty surrounding policy implementation, experts said.

Diao said, ""The Trump administration followed its own legal team's reading of the US Constitution. But the judiciary has its own interpretation, resulting in divergent interpretations of the Constitution and the powers it grants to different branches among different political forces.""

""This divergence is clearly aimed at furthering one's own interests, a manifestation of fragmentation of power within a partisan context."" This situation, he argued, leads to fundamental legal principles, including the Constitution, being sacrificed to extreme partisanship, reducing government credibility.

Wei echoed this sentiment, saying that frequent legal challenges and judicial injunctions against newly issued executive orders and policies foster a perception of governmental paralysis.

""Regardless of the legal validity of these rulings, the constant policy reversals confuse and disappoint citizens, undermining the government's credibility.""

""Moreover, the inherent instability of executive orders, which can be easily revoked by a successor or halted by courts, further reduces policy continuity and predictability,"" he said.

According to a report released on Aug 12 by the Washington-based nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, only one in three US citizens trusts the federal institutions.

The Greater Milwaukee Synod is made up of 115 congregations.
Paul Erickson of the Milwaukee synod said the Trump administration’s directive caused “significant harm” because of increased ICE activity and “fear that ICE could enter worship spaces.” This prompted the synod to join the lawsuit.
The directive not only allows ICE to operate at churches but also other “sensitive areas” such as schools, hospitals and courthouses.
“And if the church doesn’t stand up for those who are feeling threatened and vulnerable, then I’m not sure why we have churches.”","A Milwaukee Lutheran church has joined a national lawsuit against the Trump administration‘s directive to allow immigration raids at houses of worship.

In late January, Trump ended a Biden-era policy that prohibited Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in or near sensitive areas, including houses of worship. Multiple lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security soon followed, including one filed July 25 by the New England Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. It alleges the directive violates churchgoers’ First Amendment rights.

The Greater Milwaukee Synod is made up of 115 congregations. Five of the ministries offer Spanish worship services.

The Rev. Paul Erickson of the Milwaukee synod said the Trump administration’s directive caused “significant harm” because of increased ICE activity and “fear that ICE could enter worship spaces.” This prompted the synod to join the lawsuit.

“It’s simply had a chilling impact on the ability of our congregations to do the ministry that they’ve been called to do,” Erickson said.

Church services are not the only activities affected by potential ICE operations. Erickson said food pantry attendance has plummeted because many are afraid to stand outside the churches for prolonged periods. The synod has even made baptisms, typically part of regular church services, into private events.

In the original statement announcing the directive, a DHS spokesperson said it was necessary to end the “invasion of the US southern border” and “empower law enforcement to protect Americans.”

The U.S. Department of Justice declined WPR’s request for comment on the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that soon after the directives passed, ICE operations across the country began in and around places of worship. In June, five agents in plain clothes and bullet-proof vests with police badges detained a Spanish-speaking man at a Los Angeles church parking lot. The pastor of the church said one of the agents pointed a rifle at her when she attempted to approach their vehicle.

The directive not only allows ICE to operate at churches but also other “sensitive areas” such as schools, hospitals and courthouses.

“There are lots of ways in which — while we recognize that ICE needs to do their job — there need to be some places where that cannot happen,” Erickson said.

In April, police arrested a Milwaukee County judge accused of helping a man evade ICE agents. She now faces federal criminal charges.

Multiple faith-based groups across the country including Quaker and Baptist congregations are also plaintiffs in the suit. Erickson believes it is essential that churches protect their congregants.

Arab American Institute

Nothing good will come of the chaos that has already been created by the Trump administration. In just a few months, it’s taken a wrecking-ball to institutions, agencies, and programs.

The administration has taken dramatic steps to: gut the federal work force; withhold billions of dollars in research grants intended to address health and a range of other scientific concerns; eliminate foreign aid programs and the entities that deliver them; dismantle governmental health institutions; slash programs that provide health care and food to the poor and disabled; wreak havoc in international trade relations by imposing, then withdrawing, then reimposing tariffs based on whim or personal vendetta; and create fear and panic in cities across the country with the dramatic expansion of immigration enforcement that has included the hiring thousands of unvetted individuals, many of whom have an ideological bent and are eager to get a gun and badge to carry out their agenda. And this is only a partial list of the Trump administration’s destruction.

A case can easily be made that reform was needed in many of these areas. It must be acknowledged that waste or redundancy is somewhat inevitable in programs or agencies that have been in existence for decades or more. And there can be hesitancy to terminate programs that have either outlived their usefulness or never had their intended impact. But needed reforms are always best done with a scalpel, not a sledgehammer.

By using the latter approach, the administration has not only done significant damage to government, but has also eroded the public’s trust. The wholesale gutting of staff, cutting of research grants, elimination of programs, and exaggerated claims made in denigrating these programs cannot easily be remedied by the next administration. Expertise has been lost, unmet needs will only multiply, and some elected officials will be hesitant to reestablish or provide funding for programs that this administration has convinced a sizable number of voters are wasteful.

Look at what has been lost. By attempting to discredit the effectiveness of vaccines and shaking the public’s confidence in their importance, we may now see the resurgence of childhood diseases that had largely been eradicated. In eliminating programs that provide food benefits to the poor, not only will they suffer, but America’s farmers who were also often direct beneficiaries of these efforts will be hurt. Tariffs will make imported goods more expensive for American consumers and contribute to an erosion of trust in the US as a reliable trading partner. The resulting loss of US standing in many regions of the world has already led to governments to increasingly look to China. Losses are evident too in setbacks in scientific research, the ability to predict weather conditions and patterns, and the damage done to efforts to meet climate change goals.

When this nightmare ends we will be left with a mess of rubble and a monumental task of rebuilding.

While’s Trump’s disruptive and destructive impact has been mainly felt domestically, it calls to mind the approach President George W. Bush used in the Middle East. In the aftermath of the nightmare of the 9/11 terror attacks, the Bush administration lost control of its policymaking to a collection of neo-conservative ideologues both inside and outside of the administration. Convinced that reforming or tweaking the problems that existed in the Middle East would never get to the root of the problems, they chose to apply the wrecking ball to the region. They were going to blow it up and then rebuild “the new Middle East.”

The Bush policy was based on ideology, not reality. They were going to remove Saddam, install a government that met US criteria and, as they so poetically put it, “serve as a beacon of democracy that would light the entire Middle East.” When it became clear that none of this worked, they latched onto the term “constructive chaos” to explain the “logic” behind their Middle East foreign policy. It was an effort to convince us that the mess they had created was intentional and necessary and that the growing violence and instability that followed were merely the “birth pangs” of the “new Middle East” they were helping to usher into existence. But there was no “logic,” and nothing “constructive” about the “chaos.” The spawn of the “birth pangs” were ISIS, an emboldened Iran, and weakened Arab “Republics” that destabilized the region.

We are now almost eight months into the “constructive chaos” engineered by this administration. The damage they have done is enormous and will take a generation or more to rebuild. At this point, the Trump crowd hasn’t felt the need to fashion a clever explanation for what they’ve done. In part that’s because the impact of the damage is just beginning to be felt and much of Trump’s base are still under his sway and continue to believe that the mess they see isn’t real or will easily be fixed in short order.

But as was the case in the Bush years, reality will ultimately rear its head; questions will be asked and fingers will be pointed. Then the process of rebuilding can begin. It will take time to reconstruct what has been destroyed and to regain the trust that has been lost. But it can be done.

DAN, GOOD MORNING TO YOU. LET’S START WITH JURY SELECTION FOR JUDGE HANNAH DUGAN’S TRIAL. IT’S SET FOR TWO DAYS AHEAD OF THE DECEMBER 15TH TRIAL START. THE DEFENSE WANTS TO ASK ABOUT JURORS POLITICAL VIEWS AND MEDIA HABITS WHILE THE GOVERNMENT IS OBJECTING THAT WHAT CHALLENGES COME WITH ASKING SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS, AND HOW COULD IT AFFECT THE FAIRNESS OF THE JURY? SURE. GOOD MORNING. MALLORY. YEAH. SO IN FEDERAL COURT AND REMEMBER FEDERAL COURT, WE DON’T HAVE A LOT OF TRIALS, I THINK, IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN, THERE’S USUALLY HALF A DOZEN TRIALS, MAYBE TEN TRIALS A YEAR. AND SO THE PRACTITIONERS AREN’T ALL THAT PRACTICED. AND YOU ADD TO THIS THAT IN FEDERAL COURT, THE JUDGE REALLY MAINTAINS AND REGULATES VOIR DIRE. THAT’S THE QUESTIONING OF THE JURY VERY STRONGLY, TO THE POINT WHERE THE JUDGE IS ACTUALLY THE ONE WHO ASKS THE JURY PANEL QUESTIONS DIRECTLY. THE LAWYERS DON’T GET UP AND QUESTION THE JURY PANEL LIKE THEY DO IN STATE COURT. SO IT’S A VERY COURT REGULATED MECHANISM. WHAT THEY DO IN FEDERAL COURT IS SEND A QUESTIONNAIRE. THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IT’S A WORKSHEET TO EVERYONE WHO MIGHT BE A JUROR ON THIS PANEL. AND THEY FILL IT OUT. AND THERE’S SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CASE, YOUR BACKGROUND, YOUR EMPLOYMENT, THAT TYPE OF THING, AND THE PARTIES GET THAT BEFORE THE PANELS COME TO COURT. AND THEY’RE ABLE TO ANALYZE THAT, MAKE THEIR NOTES AND WHATNOT. SO THE FIGHT HERE IS THAT HANNAH DUGAN’S LAWYERS WANT TO HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IMMIGRATION POLITICS IN PARTICULAR. THEY WANT TO LEARN THESE POTENTIAL JURORS VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HELP THEM SELECT OR DESELECT JURORS IN A BETTER WAY. THE GOVERNMENT, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO HAVE THIS TRIAL BASED ON THE BLACK LETTER LAW OF THE FACTS THAT HAPPENED AT THE MILWAUKEE COUNTY COURTHOUSE. AND THE DEFENSE WANTS TO HAVE KIND OF A BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHY WERE THESE, YOU KNOW, IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS EVEN THERE IN THE COURTHOUSE. SO THEY BOTH HAVE THEIR VIEW OF THIS CASE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE GETTING MORE SPECIFIC INTO IMMIGRATION POLICIES WILL CERTAINLY HELP THE DEFENSE. TRY TO SELECT OR DESELECT JURORS THAT ARE MORE FAVORABLE TO THEIR VIEW OF THE CASE. AT LEAST THAT’S WHAT THEY’RE THINKING. AND JUDGE ABLEMAN, THE FEDERAL COURT JUDGE IN THIS CASE, HE GETS THE ULTIMATE SAY ON WHAT’S IN THAT QUESTIONNAIRE. SO WE’RE GOING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE DECIDES. HE MAY DO THAT IN WRITING. HE MAY BRING THE PARTIES BACK TO COURT AND TELL THEM THEN, YEAH, A FEW MORE MONTHS UNTIL THAT TRIAL KICKS OFF. WE’LL CONTINUE TO TRACK IT. JURY SELECTION BEGINS TODAY FOR RYAN RUTH, ACCUSED OF TRYING TO ASSASSINATE PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. HE’S CHOSEN TO REPRESENT HIMSELF IN HIS HIGH-STAKES TRIAL DESPITE THE JUDGE’S WARNINGS. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF SELF-REPRESENTATION, AND HOW MIGHT THAT IMPACT HIS DEFENSE IN SUCH A HIGH PROFILE CASE? SO JUST LIKE YOU HAVE THE ABSOLUTE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN A CRIMINAL CASE, TO HAVE A LAWYER AID YOU, YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO REPRESENT YOURSELF IN COURT. OF COURSE, THERE’S THE OLD SAYING THAT THE MAN WHO REPRESENTS HIMSELF HAS A FOOL FOR A CLIENT, AND THERE’S A REASON FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, THE JURY NOT ONLY GETS TO HEAR FROM YOU, BUT THEY’RE JUDGING YOU AS A SELF REPRESENTING INDIVIDUAL IN COURT. EVERYTHING YOU SAY, EVERY QUESTION TO THE TO THE JUDGE, EVERY DISPUTE YOU HAVE WITH THE PROSECUTION, THEY ARE JUDGING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE, YOU KNOW, WEARING THE HAT OF AS A DEFENDANT AND THE ATTORNEY IN COURT, ATTORNEY IN QUOTES THERE. WE SAW THIS LOCALLY WITH THE DARRELL BROOKS CASE. HE REPRESENTED HIMSELF. IT WENT VERY POORLY. I’VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR WHERE PEOPLE HAVE REPRESENTED THEMSELVES IN COURT. IT ALWAYS GOES POORLY. THERE’S SO MANY RULES. DECORUM OF THE COURTROOM. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES HAVE SOME TYPE OF DELUSION OF HOW IT’S GOING TO GO. THEY’RE GOING TO HAVE THIS BIG DAY, A DRAMATIC CONFRONTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN COURT. THAT’S GENERALLY NOT HOW IT IT GOES. AND SO IT’S IT’S DICEY FOR THE COURT AS WELL AND FOR THE PROSECUTION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS CHAOS ELEMENT IN COURT AND THEY HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE AN EYE TOWARDS PROTECTING OTHERS PERSON’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO A TRIAL, EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE TRYING TO UNWIND IT THEMSELVES. AND SO IT CREATES JUST A REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED. AND GENERALLY IT’S NOT ABOUT THE MERITS. AND AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY POLITICAL CASE. THIS PERSON HAD A POLITICAL MOTIVE FOR WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE MAY BE WANTING TO USE THIS TRIAL NOT SO MUCH TO DEFEND HIS INNOCENCE, BUT TO FURTHER HIS POLITICAL SENTIMENTS. YEAH, ANOTHER INTERESTING TWIST IN A VERY HIGH PROFILE CASE. DAN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR

In its effort to rest its defense of the Citizenship Order on domicile, DOJ never addresses these difficulties.
That purported ground of distinction with respect to Wong Kim Ark doesn’t wash, however.
Is that child a citizen of the United States, born to the jurisdiction thereof, by the mere accident of his birth?
Bayard’s conclusion contradicted an earlier view of Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark at 689-690.","This is the third in a series of four pieces concerning the ongoing challenges to the legality of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order No. 14160 (the “Citizenship Order”), which declares that two categories of persons born in the United States to foreign nationals are not birthright citizens.

The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the federal citizenship statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1401, both guarantee that all persons born in the United States are citizens of the United States if they were also born “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” All parties in the various suits agree that the validity the Citizenship Order turns on the proper application of the constitutional and statutory phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”

In the second post in this series, Marty analyzed the Department of Justice’s primary, and superficially most plausible, argument, which asserts that the plaintiffs’ and lower courts’ understanding of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” cannot be right because it doesn’t account for at least two of the well-established exceptions for categories of persons (children of diplomats and members of Indian tribes) who are not U.S. citizens despite their birth in the United States. In that post, Marty explained why the reading adopted by the Supreme Court in Elk v. Wilkins (1884) and United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), which turns on whether the federal government has subjected the newborn child to its “complete” regulatory jurisdiction, does, in fact, comport with and explain the established exceptions to the birthright citizenship rule.

This article addresses two other aspects of DOJ’s defense of the Citizenship Order.

In Part I, we explain why the alternative reading DOJ has offered for “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” which depends on whether the person was “domiciled” in the United States at the moment of birth, cannot be reconciled with the rationale of the Supreme Court’s governing opinion in Wong Kim Ark.

In Part II, we highlight an important, and widely overlooked, characteristic of DOJ’s briefs, namely, that DOJ’s “domicile” argument is almost entirely devoted to defending the Citizenship Order’s denial of citizenship to the second (and less numerous) category of persons identified in Section 1 of that Order—i.e., persons whose fathers are not citizens or legal permanent residents (LPRs) and who were born in the United States to mothers who were lawfully but temporarily present in the country (for example, on a work or student visa). As we’ll discuss, DOJ offers virtually nothing in support of the Order’s declaration that the first, and much larger, category of persons—those whose fathers are not citizens or LPRs and who were born in the U.S. to mothers who, on the date of birth, were not legally authorized to be in the country—are not birthright citizens.

The final piece in this series will address plaintiffs’ (and certain amici’s) statutory argument, which is independently sufficient to demonstrate the unlawfulness of the Citizenship Order. That article will explain that DOJ’s argument about the relevant enactments is based upon an unconvincing account of how the political branches understood the Court’s decision in Wong Kim Ark and the scope of application of the Citizenship Clause when they enacted and then reenacted the birthright citizenship provision in 1940 and 1952.

I. DOJ’s Domicile Argument

DOJ’s briefs in support of the Citizenship Order consistently begin with a “negative” argument that the plaintiffs’ (and district courts’) reading of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” can’t be correct in light of certain of the established, agreed-upon exceptions to citizenship for persons born in the United States. In the previous article, Marty explained why the Supreme Court’s reading of the clause, which the plaintiffs embrace, actually can be reconciled with, and explain, all three of the established exceptions.

Even if DOJ’s critique of the plaintiffs’ reading had greater force, however, that wouldn’t be enough to defend the Citizenship Order because DOJ would still need to offer a plausible alternative understanding of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” that somehow excludes the two categories of U.S.-born persons described in the Order. Yet thus far it has been unable to do so.

DOJ’s proffered alternatives have evolved over the course of the litigation. In its initial briefs in the district courts, DOJ argued that a person born in the United States is “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States only if he or she is both bound to comply with U.S. law and also is not subject to the jurisdiction of, and has no allegiance to, any foreign nation. In an earlier Just Security article on the birthright citizenship cases, Marty explained why the Supreme Court’s binding precedent in Wong Kim Ark forecloses that reading, given that Wong Kim Ark and his parents themselves had at least some allegiance to China.

DOJ wisely no longer relies upon that argument. Its most recent appellate briefs, however, do include an echo of that previous argument: In various places, DOJ asserts that a newborn is only “subject to jurisdiction” of the United States if the child’s “primary allegiance” is to the United States. (See, for example, its opening brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support v. Trump at 12.) In another Just Security article, John explained that DOJ’s reliance on the concept of “primary allegiance” draws no support from Wong Kim Ark or the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment and appears to have been made up for the purposes of this litigation.

There are other problems with this “primary allegiance” argument, too. For example, DOJ never explains what it means to have “primary” allegiance to a nation other than the United States. What’s more, and as we explain in Part II, below, to the extent DOJ is referring to a person’s obligations when U.S. law conflicts with the law of the parents’ home country, a “primary allegiance” test wouldn’t serve as a defense of the Citizenship Order because in such a hypothetical case of clashing laws, the person (and their parents) would be required to comply with U.S. law as long as they are present in the United States.

Unsurprisingly, then, in its recent briefs and oral arguments DOJ has placed greater emphasis on yet another argument—namely, that a person born in the United States is not then “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” unless that person was domiciled in the United States at the time of her birth.

Before explaining why this argument, too, does not work, it’s helpful to pause and consider what it might mean for a child to be “domiciled” in the United States. In the Nineteenth Century, domicile was predominantly used in the common law as a measure to determine certain choice-of-law questions, such as which state’s inheritance law would govern a particular dispute. And it was well-established that the domicile of a newborn child was that of his or her parents. See, e.g., Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, Foreign and Domestic ch. III, § 46; Lamar v. Micou, 112 U.S. 452, 470 (1884).

Determining the parents’ domicile, however, was often no easy task. Perhaps the most well-accepted definition of domicile was the one expressed by Justice Joseph Story in his Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws, Foreign and Domestic. (Story edited three versions of the Commentaries before his death. The quotations here are from the third edition, published in 1846.). Story wrote (id. § 43) that “that place is properly the domicil of a person, in which his habitation is fixed, without any present intention of removing therefrom.” See also Albert Venn Dicey, Conflict of Laws 730 (1896) (noting that Story’s definition “may be considered to approach more nearly than any other to an approved or authorized description of ‘domicile’”); id. at 735 (“all the best definitions agree in making the elements of domicil ‘residence’ and ‘animus manendi’”); Mitchell v. United States, 88 U.S. 350, 352 (1875) (“Domicile has been thus defined: ‘A residence at a particular place accompanied with positive or presumptive proof of an intention to remain there for an unlimited time.’”) (quoting Guyer v. O’Daniel, 1 Binney 349, 352 (note) (Philadelphia Orphan’s Court, 1806)).

Although this two-part test, or something similar to it, was widely accepted for use in deciding choice-of-law questions, that did not mean that it was simple to determine whether the test was satisfied in any particular case. To the contrary, as Story acknowledged (ch. III, § 45), “[i]t is sometimes a matter of no small difficulty to decide, in what place a person has his domicil” because of the uncertainty of both conditions. A person’s “residence is often of a very equivocal nature; and his intention as to that residence is often still more obscure.” As to the latter condition, Dicey reported, just before Wong Kim Ark, the common view of English judges that an individual’s intent to remain indefinitely in a place of habitation was often “of a very indefinite character, and as to the existence of which the Courts often have to decide without possessing the data for a reasonable decision” (p.732). Because of such uncertainties, courts had developed an elaborate array of presumptions, and rules of thumb, to assess domicile. Story himself identified no fewer than seventeen “of the more important rules, which have been generally adopted, as guides in the cases” bearing on the two basic preconditions for domicile (ch. III, § 46; see id. §§ 46-47 (describing them)).

Absent any specific evidence to the contrary, it seems difficult to imagine that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the Court in Wong Kim Ark, intended to ground birthright citizenship on a condition that was developed for such different purposes and that is often, in application, so complex, uncertain, and context-dependent. In its effort to rest its defense of the Citizenship Order on domicile, DOJ never addresses these difficulties. Nor does DOJ contend with its argument’s most conspicuous problem—namely, that the text of the Citizenship Clause doesn’t refer to a newborn’s “domicile.” If the framers intended to make U.S. domicile a precondition of birthright citizenship, they could have said so expressly, instead of requiring that birthright citizens be born subject to U.S. “jurisdiction.” What’s more, in most or all other legal contexts, a sovereign’s “jurisdiction” over a person does not turn on whether the person is domiciled (as opposed to merely present) in the sovereign’s territory. Texas, for instance, generally has jurisdiction to govern the conduct of persons while they are passing through the state, and to sanction such visitors for violating Texas law while they are present, even if they aren’t domiciled there.[1]

DOJ nonetheless insists that being “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States depends upon whether a newborn was a “domiciliary” of the United States on the date of birth. It’s not difficult to see why DOJ is doing so—namely, in order to offer some basis for defending the Citizenship Order in light of its obvious legal infirmities. Moreover, by relying on domicile in this way, DOJ might appear to be aligning itself with the Supreme Court’s decision in Wong Kim Ark. As DOJ emphasizes, Justice Gray’s opinion for the Court noted three times—in the opening paragraph (p.652), in describing “the question presented by the record” (p.653), and in the closing paragraph stating the Court’s holding (p.705)—that Wong Kim Ark’s parents “enjoy[ed] a permanent domicil and residence … at San Francisco.” (Because the law treats a newborn as domiciled where her parents are, Wong Kim Ark himself was also a domiciliary of California when he was born.). According to DOJ, because of these references to Wong Kim Ark’s parents’ domicile in California, including in the passages announcing its holding, the Court’s decision in Wong Kim Ark is not controlling on the question of whether the Fourteenth Amendment confers citizenship upon one born in the United States to parents who aren’t domiciled here—a question the Court didn’t need to reach in Wong Kim Ark itself.

That purported ground of distinction with respect to Wong Kim Ark doesn’t wash, however. In making this and other domicile-based arguments, DOJ is disregarding the ratio decidendi of Wong Kim Ark—the “fundamental rule of citizenship” (p. 693) that the Court used to decide the case—in favor of the Court’s application of that broad principle to a particular fact pattern. The whole point of Justice Gray’s long and detailed analysis of the history and tradition of natural born citizenship in the United States and its counterparts in English and European law (pp. 655-675) was to extract this fundamental rule, which the Court also held—correctly—the framers had codified in the Citizenship Clause (pp. 675-676). It would be exceedingly odd to read Justice Gray’s opinion as suggesting that domicile is necessary for birthright citizenship, or even as reserving that question, given the nature of that opinion. As Chief Judge David Barron remarked during the recent oral argument in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Gray’s opinion was anything but a slapdash affair; on the contrary, he “decide[d] to spend every waking hour … going through the entire history of everything, and lays it out paragraph-by-paragraph, case-after-case.” If Gray thought domicile might be determinative, surely he would have said so directly somewhere in that extensive discussion. Yet nothing like that appears anywhere in the many pages of Gray’s opinion.

Moreover, DOJ hasn’t pointed to any compelling evidence outside the four corners of Wong Kim Ark as a basis for insisting upon U.S. domicile as a precondition of being “subject to” U.S. “jurisdiction” at birth. DOJ’s case for such a requirement relies almost entirely on the fact that some within “the legal community” in the years between 1868 and 1898—including one state court and several commentators—concluded that the Citizenship Clause does not encompass children born of parents temporarily visiting the United States. See Brief for Appellants in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 26-29.[2] DOJ doesn’t explain, however, how those actors could have validly concluded that such visitors were not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, given that the visitors plainly were subject to U.S. law and entitled to protection from the United States while present here. Indeed, in an 1872 decision involving who is subject to prosecution for treason, the Supreme Court explained that “‘[t]he rights of sovereignty … extend to all persons and things not privileged that are within the territory. They extend to all strangers therein, not only to those who are domiciled therein, having taken up their abode with the intention of permanent residence, but also to those whose residence is transitory. All strangers are under the protection of the sovereign while they are within his territories, and owe a temporary allegiance in return for that protection.’” Carlisle v. United States, 83 Wall. 147, 154 (1872) (quoting Wildman’s Institute on International Law) (emphasis added).

During the recent oral argument in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, counsel for the Government focused less on the opening and closing passages in Wong Kim Ark than on this passage from page 693 of the opinion:

The [Fourteenth] Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States. Every citizen or subject of another country, while domiciled here, is within the allegiance and the protection, and consequently subject to the jurisdiction, of the United States.

Standing alone, and stripped of their context, these two sentences might be read to suggest that domicile is required in order for a newborn to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. A closer reading of Wong Kim Ark, however—including Gray’s articulation of the “fundamental rule of citizenship” in the sentence immediately preceding those two—reveals that this is hardly the case. Gray referred to “domicile” in the sentences quoted above in order to explain that the Amendment “includes” as citizens those in Wong Kim Ark’s circumstances, rather than to establish domicile as a necessary precondition. Indeed, although Wong Kim Ark itself did not involve a nondomiciled newborn, the Court was hardly agnostic on the question of whether a nondomiciliary born in the United States is “subject to” U.S. “jurisdiction.” In fact, the Court in Wong Kim Ark effectively rejected the view that domicile is a necessary condition of birthright citizenship—and (as we explain below), did so even in the very paragraph on which DOJ relies. DOJ’s contrary view depends upon a serious misreading of the Court’s opinion.

Several passages of the Court’s opinion, and the understandings of the two dissenting Justices, are of particular relevance in this respect:

DOJ may be right (see its reply brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at pp.14-15) that the decision in Lynch didn’t reflect a “universal” view when it was written in 1844. The important point for present purposes, however, is that the Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark plainly agreed with Lynch’s view of what the common law prescribed. Indeed, the Court noted that “[t]he same doctrine was repeatedly affirmed in the [federal] executive departments” in the years after Lynch, including in an 1862 opinion by Attorney General Edward Bates. See Citizenship of Children Born in the United States of Alien Parents, 10 Op. A.G. 328 (1862). In that opinion, Bates wrote that “I am quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United States of alien parents, who have never been naturalized, are native-born citizens of the United States, and, of course, do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship.” Id. at 328.

Significantly, Attorney General Bates didn’t suggest any exception for the children of temporary visitors. To the contrary, although Bates noted that he “might sustain this opinion by a reference to the well settled principle of the common law of England on this subject; to the writings of many of the earlier and later commentators on our Constitution and laws; to the familiar practice and usage of the country in the exercise of the ordinary rights and duties of citizenship; to the liberal policy of our Government in extending and recognizing these rights, and enforcing these duties; and, lastly, to the dicta and decisions of many of our national and State judicial tribunals,” he reasoned that no such elaboration was necessary because “all this has been well done by Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford, in the case of Lynch vs. Clarke,” and thus Bates simply “refer[red] to his opinion [in Lynch] for a full and clear statement of the principle, and of the reasons and authorities in its support.” Id. at 328-29.

Justice Gray favorably cited both Lynch and the Bates opinion in Wong Kim Ark. See also In re Look Tin Sing, 21 F. 905, 909-10 (C.D. Cal. 1884) (Field, J., for a three-judge court) (likewise approving of the analysis in Lynch).

Thus, in the very paragraph on which DOJ principally relies, Justice Gray made clear that the fundamental rule codified in the Fourteenth Amendment established the natural-born citizenship of a child born in the United States to a temporary visitor “independently of any domiciliation.” (See also pages 31-32 of the recent opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, emphasizing Gray’s quotation from the Thrasher’s Case report.)

e. Finally, it’s important to recognize that the two dissenting Justices in Wong Kim Ark understood the Court to have decided that domicile was not a prerequisite for Fourteenth Amendment birthright citizenship. In his dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Harlan, Chief Justice Fuller objected to the Court’s embrace of the common law rule in large part because “[t]he English common law rule recognized no exception in the instance of birth during the mere temporary or accidental sojourn of the parents” (p.718; emphasis added). (Earlier, on page 706, Fuller invoked the passage from Lord Cockburn that Gray had quoted, in which Cockburn explained that under the British common law doctrine a person born in a nation’s dominions is a citizen even if his parents were merely “temporarily sojourning in the country.”) “As allegiance sprang from the place of birth regardless of parentage and supervened at the moment of birth,” explained Fuller (p.718), “the inquiry whether the parents were permanently or only temporarily within the realm was wholly immaterial. And it is settled in England that the question of domicil is entirely distinct from that of allegiance. The one relates to the civil, and the other to the political status.”

In support of this distinction between “civil” and “political” status—and the understanding that domicile was germane only to the former, and thus was “wholly immaterial” to the question of allegiance on which birthright citizenship depended—Fuller cited Udny v. Udny, which, as we noted earlier, Justice Gray likewise employed in the majority opinion (pp. 656-657). Udny involved a dispute about inheritance, which raised a choice-of-law question concerning “whether the domicil of the father was in England or in Scotland, he being in either alternative a British subject.” In Udny, however, Lord Chancellor Hatherley explained that “‘[t]he question of naturalization and of allegiance is distinct from that of domicil.’” And, as Justice Gray noted, Lord Westbury stressed the same distinction: “‘The law of England, and of almost all civilized countries, ascribes to each individual at his birth two distinct legal states or conditions: one, by virtue of which he becomes the subject of some particular country, binding him by the tie of natural allegiance, and which may be called his political status; another, by virtue of which he has ascribed to him the character of a citizen of some particular country, and as such is possessed of certain municipal rights, and subject to certain obligations, which latter character is the civil status or condition of the individual, and may be quite different from his political status.’” On civil status questions such as determining a person’s “majority or minority, his marriage, succession, testacy or intestacy,” then, international law sometimes relied upon domicile as a choice-of-law criterion. Yet Lord Westbury “distinctly recognized that a man’s political status, his country, patria, and his ‘nationality, that is, natural allegiance,’ ‘may depend on different laws in different countries,’” and Westbury “had no thought of impeaching the established rule that all persons born under, British dominion are natural-born subjects.”

The Udny case, then, confirmed that the political status that the Wong Kim Ark majority held is the touchstone for birthright citizenship is quite different from the “civil status” that was sometimes used to make choice-of-law determinations on questions of inheritance and the like. (Writing two years before the decision in Wong Kim Ark, Dicey cited Udny for the proposition that “[t]he attempt … to identify change of domicil with change of allegiance has now been pronounced on the highest authority a failure.” Conflict of Laws at 734.) Chief Justice Fuller understood this distinction—and he didn’t agree with the Court’s decision to tether birthright citizenship to political status.[3]

Finally, it is noteworthy that less than six weeks after the Court issued its opinion in Wong Kim Ark, on May 7, 1898, Justice Harlan—who joined Fuller’s dissent—explained to his students at the Columbian College of Law (which later became the George Washington School of Law) that he and the Chief Justice were “wrong” (i.e., outvoted) on the question of whether a child born to a temporary visitor to the United States thereby became a U.S. citizen. The hypothetical he offered to illustrate the disagreement between the Court majority and the two dissenters on this issue was especially illuminating:

Suppose an English father and mother went down to Hot Springs to get rid of the gout, or rheumatism, and while he is there, there is a child born. Now, he goes back to England. Is that child a citizen of the United States, born to the jurisdiction thereof, by the mere accident of his birth?

DOJ insists that the Court left that question open in Wong Kim Ark. But Justice Harlan, and Chief Justice Fuller, realized all too well that it had not. Far from reserving that question for another day, the Supreme Court in Wong Kim Ark rejected DOJ’s argument in the current cases that one must be domiciled in the United States at birth in order to be “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” (Indeed, as the forthcoming final post in this series will demonstrate, both political branches have long understood Wong Kim Ark to have resolved that question, and Congress codified the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” condition on the assumption that it describes such newborns. Unsurprisingly, then, we are not aware of any post-Wong Kim Ark cases—and DOJ hasn’t cited any—in which the Executive Branch has denied the citizenship of someone born in the United States on the ground that his or her parents were not domiciled here.)

II. DOJ’s Failure to Defend the Citizenship Order’s Exclusion of Persons Born in the United States to Unauthorized Immigrants

Section 1 of the Trump Citizenship Order declares that two categories of persons born to foreign nationals in the United States are not citizens under the Fourteenth Amendment or 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). Both categories in the Order cover cases where the child’s father wasn’t a citizen or LPR at the time of the person’s birth. The distinction in the two categories is with respect to the child’s mother. The first category covers children born to women who were “unlawfully present” in the United States on the person’s date of birth—by which the Order means that the mother entered the country unlawfully or remained in the country after the terms of a visa or other authorization expired. The second category is children born while the mother was lawfully in the United States on a temporary basis, such as on a student, work, or tourist visa.

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about DOJ’s briefs is that they barely make any effort to argue that the first, primary category of persons covered by the Citizenship Order—those children described in Section 1 of the Order whose mothers are unauthorized immigrants —are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. DOJ’s proffered “domicile” precondition, discussed in Part I above, has obvious relevance to the second, “lawful visitors” category. Those children would often not be domiciled in the United States under the traditional tests because their parents lack an intent to remain in the country indefinitely. By contrast, the vast majority of new parents who are unauthorized immigrants were domiciled in the United States on the date of the child’s birth according to the most familiar test for domicile in other legal contexts (such as in resolving the sorts of choice-of-law questions discussed by Story and Dicey) because they resided in the United States “without any present intention” to leave the U.S. for habitation in another country (Story ch. 3, § 43). Therefore, their children (whose domicile, at birth, is that of their parents) would be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States even on a sound application of DOJ’s own domicile-dependent theory.

DOJ devotes only a single sentence of its opening appellate briefs to the question of why its domicile argument is relevant to the “unauthorized immigrant” category of the Citizenship Order. (Its reply briefs are completely silent on it.) Unauthorized immigrants, according to DOJ, “have no lawful basis to establish a residence in the United States, much less to assert an intent to remain indefinitely in defiance of immigration laws.” See, e.g., Brief for Appellants in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at 30-31. DOJ cites almost nothing in support of this assertion, however, and it’s not clear what DOJ means by its claim that such persons “have no lawful basis to establish” a U.S. residence. Although federal law makes it unlawful for a foreign national to enter the country without authorization, see 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a) (making it a misdemeanor for an alien to enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers), or to overstay the terms of a visa, there is no federal statute that prohibits such persons from, for example, maintaining a residence in this country, or that preempts state law of domicile with respect to such persons. The Supreme Court therefore has already recognized that “illegal entry into the country would not, under traditional criteria, bar a person from obtaining domicile within a State.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 227 n.22 (1982).[4]

On top of the other problems we have identified, therefore, DOJ’s domicile argument doesn’t offer any plausible basis for defending the first, larger category of U.S.-born persons described in the Citizenship Order.

Wholly apart from the Government’s “domicile” theory, DOJ’s opening briefs also contain the statement (see, e.g., New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support opening brief at 23) that because “[a] child born to parents here unlawfully … owes primary allegiance to his parents’ home country,” that child is not “subject to the jurisdiction of the United States within the meaning of the Citizenship Clause.” As we explained above, however, this “primary allegiance” assertion isn’t really an argument as such—it’s an ipse dixit, which DOJ seems to have invented for the occasion. As far as we’re aware, there’s nothing in any law (and DOJ doesn’t cite anything) suggesting, let alone holding, that being “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States depends upon whether one’s “primary allegiance” is to this country.

Nor, in any event, does DOJ offer any reason to conclude that a child born in the United States to an unauthorized immigrant has “primary” allegiance to her parents’ home country, whatever that might mean.[5] DOJ therefore hasn’t provided any plausible argument to support the conclusion that the principal category of persons described in Section 1 of the Citizenship Order—those children whose parents are unauthorized immigrants—are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.

As the final post in this series will explain, however, it’s not even necessary to resolve that constitutional question, because such persons certainly are citizens pursuant to a federal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a).

– – – – – – – – – – –

[1] To be sure, if a person is domiciled in a particular jurisdiction, she might have a few greater rights or privileges than if she were merely visiting. But even if some such discrete rights and privileges attached to U.S. domicile as a matter of federal law (which is by no means obvious), it would hardly follow that a nondomiciled newborn isn’t subject to U.S. jurisdiction, or not entitled to a basic measure of “protection” from the U.S. government, when she is born in the United States itself. That is simply a non sequitur.

[2] DOJ further argues (id. at 28-29) that this was the Executive Branch’s view during that period, too, pointing to two passport denials written by successive Secretaries of State in 1885. To be sure, the Executive Branch did eventually come around to that view—after all, it argued in the Supreme Court that Wong Kim Ark himself was not a citizen. The two Secretary of State letters from 1885, however, are of little probative value. The first, written by Secretary of State Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, did not mention the Fourteenth Amendment at all—it was simply a gloss on the birthright citizenship statute at the time—and it turned not on domicile but on the fact that the person in question was born to a father who was a German subject (just as Wong Kim Ark’s parents were subjects of the Chinese Emperor, see 169 U.S. at 652, 653, 694, 705). 2 A Digest of the International Law of the United States § 183, at 397-399 (Francis Wharton ed., 2d. ed. 1887). In the second letter, Secretary of State Thomas Bayard focused mostly on whether the individual in question was entitled to a passport under international law. At the end of the letter, Bayard did give cursory treatment to the Fourteenth Amendment, but his reasoning there was that the applicant was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States because he was “subject to a foreign power.” Id. at 400. Bayard’s conclusion contradicted an earlier view of Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, quoted by Justice Gray in Wong Kim Ark at 689-690.

[3] Somewhat inexplicably, in its reply briefs DOJ emphasizes that domicile was used as a choice-of-law criterion in the sorts of “civil status” determinations discussed in Udny. (See, e.g., the reply brief in New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support at pp. 8-9.) As Udny explained however—and, more to the point, as Justices Gray and Fuller each explained in Wong Kim Ark—the question of domicile did not bear upon the “political status” question of allegiance, and thus of citizenship, of one born within the realm. DOJ relies heavily on an obscure 1927 treatise entitled American Citizenship as Distinguished from Alien Status, written by Frederick Cleveland. The author himself, however, recognized the same distinction. In Chapter III of his treatise, he elaborated upon how, “[i]n English and American law, domicil is the criterion of civil as distinguished from political status” (p.34; emphasis added), and explained (id.) that in the modern state “political” allegiance to the nation “became the test of national character, and domicil remained the test of rights in civil relations only.” Thus, in the very next chapter, where Cleveland examined the meaning of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” for purposes of birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment, he made no reference to domicile. Instead, he wrote—consistent with Wong Kim Ark—that the Citizenship Clause made “all persons born in the United States citizens, except the Indians” (p.54).

[4] In support of this statement, the Court in Plyler cited page 340 of Clement Bouvé’s 1912 Treatise on the Laws Governing the Exclusion and Expulsion of Aliens in the United States, where he wrote that “[a]n alien who, … entering in violation of the Immigration acts, … takes up his residence here with intent to remain has done all that is necessary for the acquisition of a domicile.” As far as we know, state courts generally agree that a person’s unlawful entry or unlawful failure to comply with the terms of a visa does not preclude domiciliary status for purposes of state law. See, e.g., Munoz-Hoyos v. de Cortez, 207 P.3d 951, 953 (Colo. App. 2009); Garcia v. Angulo, 644 A.2d 498, 507–10 (Md. 1994) (Chasanow & Bell, JJ., concurring) (collecting cases). In light of Plyler, moreover, it’s doubtful that any other position would be tenable.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2205530422-1-scaled-e1742425138675.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 12:04:12.966189

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

President Trump is considering options for carrying out strikes against Venezuelan drug cartels, potentially by striking targets inside the country as part of a wider strategy to weaken President Nicolás Maduro, CNN reports, citing multiple sources. The United States’ strike on an alleged drug trafficking boat last week is also just the beginning of a larger effort to combat drug smuggling and potentially dislodge Maduro from power, the sources add. Zachary Cohen, Kylie Atwood, Kristen Holmes, and Alayna Treene report.

Several staffers, trade groups, law firms, and U.S. government agencies last July received emails from a person impersonating the House Committee on the Chinese Communist Party Chair, Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI), sources say. The emails were part of a cyber espionage campaign linked to China, deployed ahead of the Trump administration’s trade talks with Beijing, the sources add. It is unknown whether the campaign had successfully breached any of the targets. Beijing has disputed the hacking allegations. Joel Schectman reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Trump on Friday signed an executive order creating a “state sponsor of wrongful detention” designation, intended to “strengthen efforts to protect U.S. nationals from wrongful detention abroad.” State Secretary Marco Rubio said that actors designated under the new mechanism “may face severe penalties including economic sanctions, visa restrictions, foreign assistance restrictions, and travel restrictions for U.S. passport holders.” Jennifer Hansler reports for CNN.

Trump on Friday threatened to impose new tariffs on the EU after the European Commission announced it is imposing a €2.95 billion penalty on Google for violating anti-monopoly laws in the advertising technology market. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that discontent with the EU-U.S. trade framework is spreading among European politicians and industry leaders due to the Trump administration’s decision to expand its 50% metals tariffs to cover hundreds of additional products that contain steel and aluminum. Anthony Adragna reports for POLITICO; Bertrand Benoit and Kim Mackrael report.

The Treasury Department “would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs” it collected under the new tariffs regime if the Supreme Court finds that Trump had no power to impose them, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said yesterday, adding that such a scenario “would be terrible.” Alexandra Marquez reports for NBC News.

The United States will host next year’s Group of 20 summit at the Trump National Doral golf club, Trump announced on Friday, claiming that “everybody wants it there.” The plan is likely to raise “glaring ethical concerns that led him to drop a similar idea to host an economic summit at the property during his first term.” Erica L. Green and Chris Cameron report for the New York Times.

The Trump administration is considering New York City Mayor Eric Adams for an ambassadorship to Saudi Arabia in order to end his long-shot re-election campaign, according to sources. Dana Rubinstein, William K. Rashbaum, Nicholas Fandos, and Maggie Haberman report for the New York Times.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russia struck a major government building in Kyiv for the first time yesterday, as it launched its largest aerial assault of the Ukraine war to date. The attack also struck several residential buildings. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that across Ukraine, the attack killed four people and injured 44 others, adding that the strikes “are a deliberate crime and an attempt to prolong the war.” Svitlana Vlasova, Victoria Butenko, Todd Symons, Nadeen Ebrahim, and Laura Sharman report for CNN; Sarah Rainsford, Rachel Hagan, and Jaroslav Lukiv report for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

After Russia’s strike on one of Ukraine’s main government buildings, Trump yesterday said he was “not happy with the whole situation” and that he was prepared to move to the “second phase” of sanctions against Moscow. He did not elaborate further. Separately, the U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, said that Moscow appears to be escalating the war and that the weekend attack “was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.” Jonathan Josephs and Rachel Hagan report for BBC News; Samantha Waldenberg reports for CNN.

The United States is prepared to partner with European countries to impose sanctions on purchasers of Russian oil in a bid to “collapse” the Russian economy and bring Putin to the negotiating table, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said yesterday. Alexandra Marquez reports for NBC News.

By hosting the Russian leader in Alaska, Trump “gave Putin what he wanted,” Zelenskyy told ABC News in an interview aired yesterday. The Ukrainian president suggested that Putin “wants very much to meet with the president of the United States, to show everybody video and images that he is there” and that “it’s a pity” that he achieved this goal. Nicholas Kerr and Julia Cherner report.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israel is failing to provide adequate food to Palestinian prisoners and must take steps to make their nutrition levels compatible with “a basic level of existence,” the Israeli Supreme Court ruled yesterday. In response to the ruling, Israel’s Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said that he would continue to enforce the “minimum conditions required by law” on “imprisoned terrorists.” Wyre Davies and Tabby Wilson report for BBC News.

The Israeli military on Friday and Saturday destroyed two high-rise blocks in Gaza City, according to social media footage and a video posted by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz. The IDF claimed one of the towers was being used by Hamas, without offering evidence. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Rushdi Abualouf and Wyre Davies report for BBC News.

The topic of Israel’s annexation of the occupied West Bank has been abruptly removed from the official agenda of a high-level consultation among Netanyahu and several senior ministers last week, following the United Arab Emirates’ warning that such a move would be a “red line” and “foreclose on the idea of regional integration,” sources say. Gerry Shih and Lior Soroka report for the Washington Post.

Israel’s plan to force Gazans to flee to the territory’s north ahead of Israel’s offensive on Gaza City is raising tensions between Egypt and Israel, with Cairo concerned that Israel will try to push Palestinians into its territory, the New York Times reports. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Saturday described Israel’s actions as aiming “to push the residents out of their land,” stating that it would be “absurd to call this voluntary migration.” Aaron Boxerman reports.

There is a “narrow window” until the end of September to prevent famine from spreading further in Gaza, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, said yesterday. Alexander Cornwell, Nidal Al-Mughrabi, and Michelle Nichols report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

A Gaza deal could come “very soon,” Trump asserted yesterday, telling reporters that “we’re working on a solution that may be very good” and “you’ll be hearing about it pretty soon.” Earlier in the day, Trump claimed that “the Israelis” have accepted “his terms” and “it is time for Hamas to accept as well.” Jeff Mason and Maayan Lubell report for Reuters.

The U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, last week sent a new ceasefire and hostage deal to Hamas through an Israeli peace activist, sources tell Axios. Barak Ravid reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba yesterday announced he is resigning, a day before an expected party vote on whether to hold an internal leadership vote that could have forced him out. Rachel Hagan reports for BBC News.

The French National Assembly is expected to hold a vote of confidence on the centrist Prime Minister François Bayrou’s unpopular austerity budget proposal later today. Bayrou’s budget is not expected to pass, with both the far-right National Rally party and a group of left and far-left parties stating they would oppose it. Roger Cohen, Liz Alderman, and Aurelien Breeden report for the New York Times.

Jihadist Boko Haram militants killed more than 60 people in a Friday night attack on a military base and a village in Nigeria’s north-eastern Borno State, according to local officials. Ruth Comerford reports for BBC News.

Two attackers killed at least six people and injured 15 in a shooting attack in Jerusalem early today, according to Israel’s emergency response service. The Israeli police said that a security officer and a civilian at the scene “neutralized” the attackers. The identity of the attackers was not made public at the time of writing. Dana Karni and Oren Liebermann report for CNN.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The South Korean government yesterday announced it had agreed with the United States to send a charter plane and retrieve hundreds of workers detained in an ICE raid on a construction site of a Hyundai-LG EV battery plant in Georgia.

Religious and advocacy groups have successfully set up immigration court watch programs in other cities, including Chicago Courtwatch and the Human Rights Defender Project in Minnesota.
Court watch programs also reach beyond immigration court across the United States.","As federal prosecutors push harder for swift deportations and accounts of immigration officers arresting people at court hearings circulate, a Memphis-based legal nonprofit and clergy members are working together to ensure these events don’t go unwitnessed.

Advocates for Immigrant Rights (AIR) is in the early stages of building what the law firm hopes will become a robust immigration court watch program run with clergy volunteers, Executive Director Casey Bryant said.

The firm provides affordable legal help and support services to immigrants, serving people in Tennessee, North Mississippi, Arkansas and sometimes Kentucky — all areas handled by the Memphis immigration court. There are 126,623 pending immigration cases in the Memphis court as of July 31, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a University of Syracuse organization that gathers federal data.

This spring, immigration attorneys began to take note of a new legal tactic across the country. When immigrants who have been released at the border show up for their assigned court dates, prosecutors are pushing for their cases to be dismissed, leaving them without the protection of the court process. When they leave, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are waiting to arrest them and sometimes quickly deport them in a process called expedited removal, Bryant said.

A Department of Homeland Security notice issued in January walked back Biden-era limits on expedited removal in an effort to “apply expedited removal to the fullest extent authorized by Congress.” In July, advocates filed a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice on behalf of 12 immigrants from several countries who were arrested after their first court hearing and face expedited removal orders.

Tennessee faith leaders criticize ICE anti-immigrant action, “harassment” of Nashville mayor

“Secretary (Kristi) Noem is reversing Biden’s catch-and-release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets,” the Department of Homeland Security wrote in a May statement to CBS News regarding the administration’s shift in policy.

Bryant said the tactic “blindsided” court advocates. Most immigrants do not have legal representation, meaning “a ton of people were just getting whisked away from immigration courts with no witness except for the staff of the court,” Bryant said.

That’s where Catholic priest Juan Antonio “Tony” Romo comes in. Members of his majority-Hispanic congregation at his Memphis church have been arrested and deported, and the church community is afraid, he said. Romo saw a news story about a bishop in San Diego who attended immigration court hearings and felt compelled to act.

Romo and Monsignor Valentine Handwerker — a retired Memphis priest who spent nearly 50 years in ministry and remains concerned with social justice issues — reached out to ask Bryant to attend hearings with them and explain what they were seeing.

Inside immigration court

Romo recalled an immigration immersion trip he made with other clergy members and nuns in southern Arizona a few years ago. They traced immigrants’ paths through the desert and attended a court hearing. Romo said immigrants were led in wearing jail uniforms and chains, with no representation.

“The judge would just say, boom … you are deported, boom, you are deported,” he said. “It was a pretty disgusting experience of the way the people were mistreated.”

Romo said he cares about social issues — issues “faced by the people of God beyond the spiritual.”

“I’m a missionary,” he said. “I don’t call myself an immigrant, but in some ways, I am. I came to the U.S., not in the way of making a better life, but in a way to minister, to serve the people of God. But to the (Trump) administration and for most people, I’m an immigrant.”

Romo was born in Mexico and moved to the United States after completing two years of law school to join the Society of the Divine Word, a Catholic clerical congregation. He completed his undergraduate and masters degrees in Iowa and Illinois, and spent two years training as a missionary in Portugal. Romo has lived in California, Florida and Washington, D.C., according to the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, where he has served as pastor since 2012.

In the Memphis immigration court, Romo’s experience was different. None of the immigrants he saw had legal representation, he said, but translators were available and Romo described one judge as calm and caring.

“As we engaged in conversation with (the judge), he told us about people who are already frightened when they come to court,” Romo said. “And he said, ‘Why make it worse?’”

Romo did not see any arrests or ICE presence during his first two visits.

“Everyone got another day in court,” he said. “Their judges asked them for more documents and to edit their application for asylum.”

When Romo first walked into the building, he saw three people there to appear in court. He introduced himself and Handwerker as priests who “decided to just come and be present for people” and asked if they would like the priests to attend their hearings.

“The smiles on their faces — it was like, yes, Father, please,” he said.

Later, they thanked the priests as they left.

“That told us how people feel when they see their priest is standing up with them,” Romo said. “Just being there. Even if you cannot do anything, even if you cannot say anything, just being there means a lot to them.”

Bryant envisions a program where there is always someone in each courtroom bearing witness to the court proceedings and decisions made.

“It’s also about people seeing friendly faces” in a “process that is so dehumanizing,” Bryant said.

Next steps

The next steps to build a formal court watch program include recruiting more court watchers and obtaining buy-in from the court’s administration, Bryant said.

AIR partners with multiple organizations, including Catholic Charities of East and West Tennessee, and Bryant said the nonprofit is also working with the Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope, a group that has connections with clergy from different denominations.

Ultimately, AIR will develop training for volunteers to familiarize them with court decorum and protocol.

Getting the court to recognize the program is the next key step, Bryant said. While immigration court hearings are generally open to the public for observation, Bryant said the court’s formal blessing would “ensure volunteer observers could get into the courts without hassle.” It could also help with scheduling volunteers if the program gets advance notice on which judges have hearings on which days.

Bryant said the Memphis court directed AIR to contact court administration on the national level. Bryant is awaiting their response.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which administers the immigration court system, doesn’t have a formal pathway to set up a court watch system, but it does offer a Model Hearing Program that explains the court’s procedures and offers opportunities to observe live model hearings with a review of relevant law.

Religious and advocacy groups have successfully set up immigration court watch programs in other cities, including Chicago Courtwatch and the Human Rights Defender Project in Minnesota. Depending on the program, volunteers are sometimes asked to collect data and observations on court proceedings.

Court watch programs also reach beyond immigration court across the United States. The programs “ensure scrutiny and evaluation,” according to the American Bar Association (ABA). “They serve to highlight the realities of our legal system by recording data, uncovering stories, identifying trends, and highlighting problems” that can potentially drive reform, ABA states.

In the meantime, Romo has told his parishioners that he will do his best to attend immigration hearings for anyone who wants him to be there.

Bryant said court watching is also an opportunity for people to see the system in action, and perhaps challenge misconceptions.

“I really think that bringing people to court, even if it’s just one time, will open their eyes to the way that people are being treated in this country, and it will change their mind,” Bryant said. “If they think one way, I think they’re going to see it’s something totally different.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/gavel.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 06:56:30.407987

I was surprised to find that fewer than half of the aliens ICE arrested in the interior under the last administration had convictions or pending criminal charges, while roughly two-thirds of the aliens (1) arrested by ICE and currently detained by the agency; and (2) detained and removed by ICE under Trump II have criminal histories. Facts don’t lie, but sometimes you need help to understand what they are saying.

“ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics”

As an aid to pundits, reporters, and the public at large, ICE publishes a dashboard, “ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics”, that details the agency’s arrests, detentions, expulsions, and removals.

Those statistics only begin, however, in October 2020 (the month before that year’s presidential election) and end in December 2024 (the month after the last presidential election). In other words, it essentially only covers the last administration.

ICE Arrests under the Biden Administration

According to that dashboard, between February 2021 (the first full month of the Biden administration) and December 2024 (the last full month), ICE arrested just over a half-million (500,842) aliens in the United States, in what are known as “interior arrests”.

Those weren’t migrants who came illegally who were apprehended by Border Patrol or stopped at the ports of entry by CBP officers — those were aliens already here arrested by ICE.

Of those half-million-plus aliens, just over 181,000 were convicted criminals (36.2 percent), a little more than 64,000 had pending criminal charges (12.8 percent), and the other roughly 51 percent — 255,585 aliens — were “other immigration violators”, aliens with final orders of removal or pending immigration charges.

ICE Detentions Under the Biden Administration

By contrast, ICE detained just over 1.107 million aliens under the last administration, through the end of December.

That seems like a fairly large number until you consider that Border Patrol alone apprehended more than 1.53 million aliens at the Southwest border (alone) in FY 2024 (alone), the vast majority of whom ICE is mandated by law to detain.

Of those 1.107 million ICE detentions, just 283,472 involved aliens who weren’t initially arrested by CBP at the borders and ports, but rather were the product of interior arrests.

Some 177,344 of those ICE detentions after interior arrests involved convicted criminals (62.6 percent) and just fewer than 58,200 of them had pending criminal charges (20.5 percent). The rest, nearly 48,000 in total, were “other immigration violators” (16.9 percent, more than half detained in New York City).

In other words, while just over half of the aliens ICE arrested in the interior between February 2021 and December 2024 had no criminal records (aside from illegal entry or reentry), very few of them were subsequently detained — which raises the question of why ICE bothered to arrest them.

ICE Removals Under Biden

Which leads me to the third major metric on that dashboard, ICE removals from the United States.

In that 47-month period, ICE removed almost 588,500 aliens from the United States, but only 147,533 of those aliens were “interior removals” — deportations of aliens living in the United States.

The remainder — nearly 441,000 aliens in total — were aliens first encountered by CBP at the borders and the ports and handed over to ICE for removal, a longstanding scheme to pump up removals my colleague Jessica Vaughan has referred to as “cooking the books”.

Of those interior removals, just fewer than 115,600 had criminal convictions (78.4 percent), 23,111 had pending charges (15.7 percent), and the rest, just 8,825 in total, were removed on immigration grounds alone.

Contrast those figures with court-ordered removals under Biden.

According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), in FY 2024 immigration judges ordered nearly 310,000 alien respondents removed from the United States, on top of more than 231,000 removal orders in FY 2023 (DOJ’s FY 2022 statistics are unavailable). Most never were forced to leave.

Better yet, compare them with the 1.44 million aliens on ICE’s non-detained docket as of late November who had final removal orders and yet remained in the United States. Do the math and see that ICE under Biden removed just a fraction of the aliens it could and should have.

Politicians love to throw around the term “due process” in the immigration context, but that process is little more than kabuki theater if after aliens receive the process they’re due in immigration court, they aren’t removed from the country — but that’s what happened under the last administration.

ICE Detentions and Removals in FY 2025

As noted, the period covered by that ICE dashboard ends in December 2024, but other ICE statistics can fill in some of the gaps.

An ICE Detention Management web page links to a series of Excel spreadsheets, “Detention Statistics”, which cover the agency’s detentions and removals in the current fiscal year.

As of late August, ICE was detaining 61,226 aliens, 76 percent of whom were ICE arrestees (again, interior arrests) and 24 percent of whom came to the agency through CBP encounters.

Of the 46,595 aliens currently in ICE detention who were the product of interior arrests, 16,619 have criminal convictions (35.7 percent), 14,212 have pending criminal charges (30.5 percent), and 15,764 are “other immigration violators” (33.8 percent).

Roughly two-thirds of the aliens arrested by ICE and currently detained have criminal histories, and a similar percentage of the aliens the agency has deported from its custody under Trump II, do too.

In other words, nearly two-thirds of the aliens first arrested by ICE and detained by that agency had a criminal history. Even though it may be comparing tangerines and oranges, that’s a larger percentage than the less than half of ICE interior arrests under Biden involving aliens with criminal histories.

That spreadsheet also shows that in FY 2025, 191,393 aliens were released from ICE detention for removal, and that just less than 141,000 of those aliens were removed after February 2025, the first full month of the Trump administration.

Keep in mind that those statistics are not broken down by initial arresting agency. But given that the number of illegal border-crossers has plummeted since Trump’s return, it’s safe to assume that most of those removals came after ICE interior arrests.

That’s particularly likely given that, of those Trump-era ICE removals of aliens from its custody, 41.4 percent (58,430) had criminal convictions, 25 percent had pending criminal charges (35,299), and 33.5 percent (47,195) were “other immigration violators”.

Again, roughly two-thirds of the aliens removed by ICE after ICE detention under Trump II had criminal histories.

Those aren’t all the aliens removed under Trump, either, as others received removal orders while in criminal proceedings and were simply transported out for removal.

During a recent trip to south Texas, I saw some of those deportations in action, when I came upon a group of aliens just released from criminal custody being dropped off by ICE at the Del Rio port of entry to walk across the bridge to Ciudad Acuña, Mexico.

Fortunately, my Spanish is not very good, because some of them were neither happy to see me nor to have to leave.

“Trump Admin Says 70% of ICE Detainees Do Not Have Criminal Convictions”

Which brings me to an August 29, 2025, Newsweek article headlined, “Trump Admin Says 70% of ICE Detainees Do Not Have Criminal Convictions”.

That article relied on the same Detention Management web page I cited above, as is clear from the second paragraph: “The latest detention management stats from ICE showed a record 61,226 people were being held in ICE facilities across the country as of August 29.”

Of course, to get to the 70 percent figure in the headline, you must add illegal entrants first encountered by CBP — not arrested by ICE in the interior — into the ICE detention total.

Respectfully, it’s not ICE’s fault that more criminals aren’t coming here illegally (not that anyone, save a select few, wants that), or that Congress requires the agency to detain those migrants regardless of whether they are criminals or not.

That article does include the following caveat: “As of Friday, out of the 61,226 detainees, 18,205 were convicted criminals, 15,593 had pending criminal charges, and 27,428 were being held on other immigration violations, reflecting normal trends for ICE detention.” (Emphasis added.)

That, of course, raises the question of how the author defines “normal trends for ICE detention”, but in that vein, I’d argue that the Biden administration was the outlier in not detaining more “other immigration violators” ICE had already arrested than the Trump administration was for keeping them in custody.

And I should know, having been an INS prosecutor under President Clinton and an immigration judge in a detained court under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations.

“Immigrants Residing in the Country ... Legally, with Valid Documentation ... Detained”

But I digress. Note the aforementioned caveat appeared in the eighth paragraph of that article, whereas this is from paragraph five, under the subheading “Why It Matters”:

Immigrants residing in the country illegally and legally, with valid documentation such as green cards and visas, as well as those with criminal histories, have been detained. Many with past convictions, even from decades ago, have found themselves in ICE custody despite spending years without facing serious immigration problems.

That sounds unkind unless you click on the link for the “valid documentation” part, which sends you to a separate May 21 Newsweek article, “Green Card Holder Detained by ICE at Immigration Appointment, Wife Says”.

It tells the story of a Danish national arrested by ICE when he went to a naturalization appointment, over what his wife described as “a paperwork miscommunication from 2015”.

The next paragraph, however, explains that according to DHS, the “green card holder” in question was ordered deported in April 2019. With all due respect, if that’s a “paperwork miscommunication”, I handed out thousands of them in my eight years on the bench.

The link for “many with past convictions”, on the other hand, takes you to an August Newsweek article about “a refugee who arrived from Vietnam over 40 years ago and obtained a lawful permanent resident status, or green card, soon after”. He was recently detained at an ICE call-in.

Had his story ended there, he’d have been fine, except that he was convicted of robbery eight years after he came here and thereafter “violated probation after a subsequent burglary charge”.

Granted, his criminal history ended in the past, but there’s no statute of limitations on either removal orders or on the criminal convictions that render aliens removable. Congress could always add such limitations to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), but ICE is bound by the law now.

The Laken Riley Act

And if anything, ICE is even more bound by the law today. Let me explain.

The reason why ICE agents and officers failed to arrest, detain, and remove more aliens — criminals and “other immigration violators” alike — over the past four years is because the Biden administration, and then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to be specific, wouldn’t let them.

In September 2021, Mayorkas issued “guidelines” that tightly restricted such ICE “enforcement actions” by requiring the agency to consider various “aggravating” and “mitigating” factors before it could even investigate facially removable aliens, including criminals.

The problem is: (1) those factors don’t appear in the INA; but (2) the INA does require ICE to arrest and detain most of those criminals. Nonetheless, when Texas and other states sued the administration to force it to comply with the statutory detention mandates, Biden’s DOJ fought all the way to the Supreme Court to keep the Mayorkas guidelines in place.

“Successfully fought”, I might add, as the High Court concluded the states lacked standing.

To reassert its authority over immigration enforcement and protect states from criminals, the first bill Congress passed in its latest session was S.5, the “Laken Riley Act”, named after a Georgia student slain by an illegal migrant released under Biden.

That law grants state attorneys general standing in federal court to challenge DHS non-detention decisions, including when ICE fails to detain aliens subject to detention on criminal grounds and CBP releases aliens at the borders and ports on “parole”.

The act actually goes one step further by also requiring ICE to also arrest and detain aliens with pending criminal charges for “burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, or assault of a law enforcement officer offense, or any crime that results in death or serious bodily injury to another person”.

“Egregious Crimes”

One last point raised in the latest Newsweek article is that there’s no way to tell whether the criminal aliens ICE is arresting and detaining have been charged with or convicted of so-called “egregious crimes”.

Respectfully (once more), whether a crime is “egregious” or not is wholly subjective (ask any victim), but also irrelevant.

Congress decides what crimes subject aliens to mandatory detention and removal, but drunk driving (which isn’t a removable offense) is likely a more serious danger to the community than tax evasion (which is, and an aggravated felony when you cheat the government out of more than $10,000).

Statistics don’t lie, but they often need analysis. Here’s the key takeaway: Roughly two-thirds of the aliens arrested by ICE and currently detained have criminal histories, and a similar percentage of the aliens the agency has deported from its custody under Trump II, do too.

Vasquez noted the agricultural industry, especially in the U.S. West, “has involved immigrant labor for many, many decades,” and he warned of the potential consequences on the U.S. economy of proceeding with mass deportations.

“As we see these mass deportation rates, which are very draconian, and we know that the housekeepers and the restaurant workers and the construction workers who may not be here with the right documentation. Well, let’s give them the right documentation,” he said.

“Let’s vet them. Let’s put them through a process which allows our economy to have the global competitiveness that we need, and at the same time, make sure that we have our border in order, which we can do,” he continued.

Defence Secretary John Healey made the admission this morning as he confirmed that the Government was “looking” at how they could narrow the interpretation of the convention, particularly in regards to the article protecting the right to a family life.

The article has been used to justify several controversial decisions in recent months that have allowed asylum seekers to remain in the UK. Healey was speaking after a monumental day in Westminster on Friday, which saw the departure of Angela Rayner, followed by the removal of Yvette Cooper as Home Secretary in favour of Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood. Asked about the Government’s approach to the ECHR, the Defence Secretary told Sky News: “We are looking at how we can tighten the interpretation and the application of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly in areas like the right to family life and family joining.”

The removal of Cooper could be the catalyst for a change in approach to the migrant crisis, as record numbers of people continue to make their way across the English Channel and protests continue outside hotels housing asylum seekers.

An anonymous source told the Sunday Times that Ms Mahmood’s approach to the ECHR was that “nothing is off the table”, and that she would likely want reform of the convention.

The source went on to claim that Mahmood, who took the decision to release prisoners early into her tenure as Justice Secretary to prevent prisons from overflowing, will take a radical approach to the issue and the ECHR.

They added that she would “start with the unthinkable and work backwards”.

One such measure could include the use of disused military sites to house asylum seekers instead of hotels, a practise that costs the taxpayer £5.77 million per day on average.

When asked about plans to turn disused military sites into asylum processing centres, Healey told Sky News: “I have been putting military planners into their Border Command and into their planning for the future.

“We are looking at the potential use of military and non-military use sites for temporary accommodation for the people who come across on these small boats that may not have a right to be here or need to be processed rapidly before we can decide whether or not they should stay or whether or not we deport them, like we have done in record numbers over the last year.”",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/1200x630/6411303.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:59.089158

Ald. Jeylú Gutiérrez (14th) confirmed to the Sun-Times that three people were arrested Sunday in her ward, which includes parts of Archer Heights, Gage Park and Chicago Lawn.

One of the arrests was caught on video, which shows federal agents holding a flower vendor’s hands behind his back. Another video appears to show ICE agents speaking with the vendor.

“It’s really difficult,” Gutiérrez said. “I’m an immigrant myself, I’m a mom. To think about how those people are not coming back home to their family tonight just breaks my heart.”

Gutiérrez warned her constituents that ICE isn’t only after people in the U.S. without permission.

“I just want it to be clear that this is an attack on our hardworking people and our community as a whole,” she said. “It’s not just those who are undocumented, it’s racial profiling.”

On Sunday, President Donald Trump walked back his war threat on Chicago, NPR reported. “We’re not going to war. We’re going to clean up our cities,” Trump told reporters on Sunday as he left the White House, according to NPR. “We’re going to clean them up so they don’t kill five people every weekend.

Federal agents, including at least some from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, are stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes, the Sun-Times reported. Last week, they were practicing crowd control tactics and prepping for patrols in unmarked vehicles. Over the weekend, Chicago residents and officials alike braced for the National Guard and ICE to descend upon the city en masse.

Homan confirms action in sanctuary cities

Sunday’s arrests came after yet another Trump administration official said Chicagoans should “expect action” this week as the feds get ready to conduct what could be a large-scale anti-immigration effort.

In an appearance on CNN Sunday, border czar Tom Homan was asked by Jake Tapper whether “we should expect action in Chicago this week?”

“Absolutely, you can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country,” Homan said. “We got to send additional resources to the problem areas, which are sanctuary cities.”

Homan, however, offered few specifics as to when or where the activity would take place, or whether it would involve National Guard troops as the administration has stated.

Call to action on West Side

Later Sunday, a group of elected officials and community organizers joined a chorus pushing back against Trump’s plans, and especially troops.

In a news conference at the office of Ald. Emma Mitts (37th) in Austin, U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (D-Chicago) stopped short of rejecting any federal assistance. He said the city wanted federal help, but not in the form of immigration enforcement or the National Guard.

Instead, Davis called for the restoration of federal funding for programs like violence interrupters that are credited with Chicago’s 60-year-low summer homicide count and declining crime rates.

“We need all the help we can get from the federal government, but we don’t need another level of law enforcement to pretend they’re going to solve some problem related to violence and crime,” Davis said. “Our authorities are doing well.“

He also warned fellow Chicagoans against ignoring what is happening because they aren’t directly affected.

“The immigration issue doesn’t only relate to people from South and Central America,” Davis said. “So don’t be fooled and don’t think you’re just talking about someone else.”

Tonya Woods, executive director of the West Side Justice Center, said her group has joined with more than 44 community organizations working together to educate people on their rights and keep watch against ICE.

Woods urged people to know their rights and “your resources and your risk” when interacting with law enforcement of any kind.

“This doesn’t mean there might not be misconduct or untoward behavior, because we know we’ve often been the subject of that kind of behavior,” Woods said. “But if more of us know what our rights are and invoke those rights, we can keep us safe.”

Homan made an appearance Sunday on CNN in an interview with Jake Tapper, who probed the White House Border Czar over the president’s threats of a military incursion in Chicago. Tapper asked if Chicago can “expect action” from Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents this week.

“Absolutely,” Homan said. “You can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country. President Trump’s prioritized sanctuary cities because they knowingly release illegal alien public safety threats to the streets everyday. That’s where the problem is.”

The border czar did not clarify when troops could be sent to Chicago or elsewhere and didn’t specify what the federal government’s action plan entailed. The National Guard could be deployed to assist Immigration Enforcement, but Homan did not specify to what capacity National Guard troops could assist ICE agents aside from explaining that the National Guard cannot make arrests.

When asked about how many National Guard troops could be sent into the city, Homan said that it was “law enforcement sensitive information.”

Trump inflamed his threats of federal deployment to Chicago on Saturday, when he posted to social media an AI-generated image that referenced the 1979 film “Apocalypse Now” and said “Chicago about find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The post coincided with the rebranding of the Defense Department to the Department of War, undertaken without legislative approval.

Homan said that the president’s message wasn’t declaring war on Chicago itself, but declaring war on illegal drug operations and undocumented immigrants within the city that are supposedly abetted by city and state leadership.

“I think his words are being taken out of context,” the Border Czar said. “When I say we’re going to war, we’re going to war with the criminal cartels, we’re going to war with illegal aliens – public safety threats – that rape children, that rape citizens, that commit armed robberies, distribute narcotics and kill Americans. We’re at war with the criminal cartels, and Governor Pritzker protects criminal, illegal alien public safety threats everyday in that state along with Mayor Johnson.”

Trump was asked by reporters at the White House Sunday about the reference to declaring war on Chicago, to which he said “we’re not going to war.”

“We’re going to clean up our cities,” Trump said. “That’s not war. That’s common sense.”

“Look, I’ll say this, I’m a former prosecutor. I’m a former attorney general. I’ve said many, many times, including to the Trump administration, that I support, as attorney general and now as governor, everything we can do on public safety,” Healey said on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.”

“But what we have seen from ICE and from the administration really isn’t about public safety, it’s about political theater. It’s about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate,” she added.

In a statement to The Hill, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said that “ICE launched ‘Patriot 2.0’ to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens living in the state of Massachusetts, following the success of Operation Patriot in May.”

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens,” the spokesperson added, referencing Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who is a Democrat.

“ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,” the spokesperson said.

In the first few months of President Trump’s second term, the president and his administration have cracked down heavily on immigration.

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem last month said the U.S. had 1.6 million fewer undocumented immigrants since the beginning of the Trump administration, a claim that came from information from a restrictionist immigration group that said their estimate may be overstated.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/healeymaura_massachusetts_010523_AP.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-08 00:57:10.874026

ICE raids Hyundai plant, detained 475 workers

During this ICE raid, a total of 475 workers were detained from the Georgia-based plant, of which, 300 were from South Korea.

Following the raid, the US and Seoul were locked in a series negotiations for the release of the 300 workers. South Korean foreign minister Cho Hyun is to leave for the US on Monday for talks related to the workers’ releases.

The 300 workers had been detained for either entering the US illegally or for overstaying their visas. As per Yonhap news agency, South Korea plans to send a charted plan to bring home the 300 detained workers.

WHAT ARE SOME POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES THAT THE COMPANY COULD FACE, OR IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN SPEAK TO? I DON’T WANT TO SPECULATE ON ULTIMATE. THIS IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION. NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED. SO THAT MEANS THAT NO WRONGDOING IS BEING ACCUSED AT THIS TIME. YES, MA’AM. I HAD A QUESTION. WAS ANYONE INJURED DURING THE PROCESS? DID ANYONE DIE DURING THE PROCESS OF THIS RAID? THERE WERE NO THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL USES OF FORCE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED OTHER THAN ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS OVERHEATING A LITTLE BIT AND WAS TREATED ON SCENE. AND ONE AGENT SUFFERED A MINOR LACERATION WHILE CONDUCTING IT, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT INJURIES. OKAY.

THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR. SO CAN WE SAY JANUARY? I DON’T HAVE THE EXACT START DATE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

As the report warns, such misreporting can foster public misunderstanding of human rights and erode confidence in the judiciary, even placing judges at personal risk.
In many instances, media coverage continued to report human rights claims even after tribunals had rejected them, creating the impression that the ECHR was blocking deportations and undermining immigration control.
Home Office data up to June 2021 showed that just 0.73% of foreign national offenders successfully appealed deportation solely on human rights grounds.
The Bonavero Institute further highlighted that judgments against the UK in the European Court of Human Rights are very infrequent.","A significant new report published last week by the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights at the University of Oxford's Faculty of Law has found widespread misrepresentations in UK media coverage of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its role in immigration control.

You can download the 36-page report here. It was authored by Victoria Adelmant and Professor Başak Çalı of the Bonavero Institute, and Professor Alice Donald of Middlesex University.

The academic study, which systematically reviewed 379 media reports between January and June 2025, revealed that over 75% of articles mentioning the ECHR focused on immigration, with particular attention to deportation cases involving foreign national offenders. Much of the coverage of the ECHR and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) was found to be inaccurate or incomplete, presenting a misleading picture of human rights law being used to thwart the Government's attempts to control immigration.

The authors stated: ""We found that, when subjected to rigorous analysis, fact-checking, and scrutiny of claims made about legal frameworks and cases, many news reports and opinion pieces about immigration and the ECHR or the ECtHR were misleading and based on misconceptions, often mischaracterising UK immigration law, the UK's appeals system, and the role played by the ECHR and ECtHR.""

As the report warns, such misreporting can foster public misunderstanding of human rights and erode confidence in the judiciary, even placing judges at personal risk. Lady Chief Justice Carr has warned that ""unfair or sensational negative reporting creates real, everyday risks to the safety and lives of judges and their families."" The Bonavero Institute notes that misleading portrayals of the ECHR's role in tribunal cases are contributing to increased calls for the UK to leave the Convention, despite judges making decisions according to rules and exceptions set by Parliament.

One widely reported case cited as an example is the claim that an Albanian man avoided deportation under Article 8 of the Convention (the right to private and family life) because his child disliked foreign chicken nuggets. As the report clarifies, this was not the reason for the First-tier Tribunal's original decision, and importantly, the Upper Tribunal had already overturned the ruling by the time it was widely reported in the media. Researchers found that this case was one of many in which news articles reported on First-tier Tribunal decisions that had already been overturned on appeal, without clarifying that the original ruling no longer stood at the time of publication.

Media outlets have also misrepresented the arguments made by appellants or their lawyers in deportation cases, presenting them as if they were the basis of the Tribunal's decision. While appellants are entitled to submit any arguments they believe may support their case, not all are accepted as legally valid. In many instances, media coverage continued to report human rights claims even after tribunals had rejected them, creating the impression that the ECHR was blocking deportations and undermining immigration control.

The report further highlights a pattern of misleading media coverage in immigration tribunal cases, in which specific details are presented as decisive when they were not central to the decision. One high-profile example involved a Palestinian man who, having become a British citizen, sought to bring his brother, sister-in-law, and their children from Gaza to the UK in January 2024. The family applied using the Ukraine Family Scheme form because no other form applied and Home Office guidance advises using the closest-matching route. Their initial application was rejected, and their appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was unsuccessful. In January 2025, however, the Upper Tribunal allowed the appeal, finding that the rejection violated Article 8 of the ECHR. The Upper Tribunal concluded that the family faced extreme risks in Gaza, including indiscriminate violence and political persecution, which constituted ""very compelling or exceptional circumstances"" outweighing public interest.

Despite this, media reports frequently misrepresented the case as if the decision allowed settlement under the Ukraine Family Scheme. Lady Chief Justice Carr later condemned such reporting, noting that ""it is dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law. The judgment is the only accurate source of information."" The Bonavero Institute notes that this is not an isolated occurrence, as minor or irrelevant details from tribunal cases - such as the 'chicken nuggets' example or the 'pet cat' case cited by Theresa May in 2011 - have repeatedly been misreported as decisive, shaping public perception in ways that do not reflect the legal reasoning applied

The Bonavero Institute stresses that deportations can generally only be prevented under the ECHR on two limited circumstances: if an individual faces a real risk of torture, inhuman treatment, or death abroad (Articles 2 and 3), or if removal would cause ""unduly harsh"" consequences for family life (Article 8), and even then only within the framework set by UK parliamentary law.

Statistical evidence suggests that successful appeals are rare. Home Office data up to June 2021 showed that just 0.73% of foreign national offenders successfully appealed deportation solely on human rights grounds. Overall, around 3.5% of human rights-based appeals were allowed, with those based only on family life making up about 2.5%. The Bonavero Institute further highlighted that judgments against the UK in the European Court of Human Rights are very infrequent. Since 1980, only 13 cases have found that a UK deportation or extradition would violate the Convention, with just four concerning family life. In the past 45 years, the Court has ruled against the UK's immigration rules only three times, in cases involving discrimination.

The report notes that this picture is obscured by the lack of clear and accessible government data on human rights-based appeals. Misreporting of tribunal cases is exacerbated by the absence of comprehensive statistics, which undermines informed public debate. To address this, the report recommends that the Home Office systematically collect and publish figures on the outcomes of appeals to the First-tier and Upper Tribunals, supporting evidence-based policy-making and strengthening public confidence in the immigration system.

Professor Alice Donald commented: ""Our findings show that much of the public discussion about the ECHR and immigration is not grounded in accurate reporting. For a debate of such importance, it is essential that arguments are based on evidence and a correct understanding of the law. Without this, public trust in the rule of law is placed at risk.""",https://i.imgur.com/VGsLuOb.png,N,,2025-09-07 18:56:22.520444

Maura Healey lashed out against the Trump administration in an appearance on MSNBC on Sunday, saying expanded ICE activity in Massachusetts and other states ""insane,"" and ""not right.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting a follow-up to a surge in May called Operation Patriot 2.0, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is a part of, told NBC10 Boston on Saturday. The May operation, Operation Patriot, resulted in nearly 1,500 people being arrested, officials said at the time.

In her MSNBC appearance, Healey said she hasn't heard from the White House about this latest ICE surge in her state.

""I'm a former prosecutor, a former attorney general. I've said many, many times, including to Trump, that I support as attorney general, and now as governor, everything we can do on public safety,"" she said. ""But what we have seen from ICE and the administration isn't about public safety, it's about political theater, about a political power grab and an attempt to intimidate.""

""We've seen construction workers, nannies, landscapers, healthcare aids -- these are the people being taken in huge numbers, taken away from their families. It is not the kind of effort Donald Trump has said it was about.""

""But again, this is about show, it's a show of force, it's political theater. The same reason you see the National Guard on streets in cities in America. It's just not right. It's not helpful to public safety. It undermines the efforts of local law enforcement and it's taking guardspeople with really important missions away from those missions, all to be part of some political theater... It's just not right what's happening across America right now.""

Healey also criticized Trump's social media post on Saturday, where the president signaled Chicago deportations with a parody meme referencing the 1979 film ""Apocalypse Now"" on Truth Social, saying ""I love the smell of deportations in the morning...Chicago about to find out why its called the Department of WAR.""

""The post that the president put out last night bragging about some Chicago apocalypse, it's just insane. It's not normal. It's not right,"" Healey said. ""It is wrong and if you care about public safety you work with local officials, you work with state officials, you support and fund local law enforcement. That's really what you need to do.""

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu issued a new statement Sunday addressing ICE, and saying the city could take legal action if it finds federal law enforcement isn't following local, state or federal laws:

As ordered in the Boston Trust Act, no Boston police or local resources will be co-opted into federal immigration enforcement and their mass deportation agenda. For months, ICE has refused to provide any information about their activities in Boston and refuses to issue warrants, while we hear reports of ICE agents taking parents as they are dropping their kids off at school. That does not make our community safer. We expect that federal law enforcement will abide by the constitution and laws of this City, Commonwealth, and country, and we are prepared to take legal action at any evidence to the contrary.

The mayor has reiterated that its policies on immigrants -- limiting local officials' cooperation with deportation enforcement -- have made it among the country's safest cities, including in her response to a federal lawsuit filed this week over Boston's ""sanctuary"" law, the Boston Trust Act.

Wu previously released a statement to NBC10 Boston on Saturday night addressing the latest operation in the area, saying, ""For months, the Trump DOJ, DHS, and ICE have been spreading blatant lies and threatening to 'bring hell' to cities like Boston who refuse to bow down to their authoritarian agenda, so this unconstitutional attack is not a surprise.""

""This country was born facing down bullies, with Bostonians leading the way,"" Wu continued. ""Today Boston is the safest major city in the country because we have worked to build trust in the community, so that everyone feels safe seeking help or reporting a crime. We will not be bullied or intimidated into abandoning the efforts that make Boston a safe home for everyone.”

It wasn't immediately clear how many federal agents were taking part in Operation Patriot 2.0, or what Massachusetts communities the operation was being conducted in. The New York Times, citing sources, reported that the operation was expected to last several weeks; the DHS spokesperson's statement didn't address how long Patriot 2.0 would take.

“Is congressional oversight dead?” Mr. Warner asked afterward, wondering aloud how independent intelligence assessments would be made if lawmakers could not have access to the agencies.","The Pentagon barred the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee from making an oversight visit to a military spy agency.

Armed forces off the coast of Venezuela began a military campaign against alleged members of a drug cartel without any authorization from Congress, and without notifying key members.

The White House informed Congress it planned to use a rare maneuver to skirt a vote and cancel nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funding that lawmakers had already approved, the latest escalation of its campaign to undercut the legislative branch’s spending powers.

And just a month after senators had confirmed her, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, ousted the director of the Centers for Disease Control. He also put forward changes that would effectively restrict access to Covid-19 vaccines, after pledging to senators during his own confirmation hearings that he would not make it more difficult.

The Trump administration continues to erode the power of Congress, trampling on its constitutional prerogatives in ways large and small. Through it all, Republicans in charge have mostly shrugged — and in some cases, outright applauded — as their powers, once jealously guarded, diminish in ways that will be difficult to reverse.

In recent weeks, G.O.P. leaders have looked on passively as the president has fired a litany of agency leaders whom senators worked for weeks to confirm, from the C.D.C. to the Internal Revenue Service to the Federal Reserve.

And they have shown little appetite for challenging the administration, even as a few have expressed occasional displeasure about the consequences of their decisions earlier this year to swallow their reservations about some of his nominees and confirm them.

“We cannot cede power,” Mr. Welch added. “There are consequences.”

For nearly a century, Democratic and Republican presidents alike have sought to amass more power, particularly to conduct foreign policy and military operations, and with a few exceptions, succeeded in chipping away at congressional influence. What is different now is the degree of disdain Mr. Trump has shown for Congress — and the willingness of G.O.P. leaders to defer to him even when it means undercutting their coequal branch of government.

“That is the big story here — not that a president is trying to push the bounds of their authority, because our system was designed with that in mind,” Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a member of the House Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, said in an interview. “The true story is that Republicans in Congress have capitulated and are not pushing back to assert authority.”

Republicans largely reject the idea that they have ceded congressional powers of oversight and spending to the White House. They argue that Mr. Trump is wielding his executive authority appropriately to bring a vast federal bureaucracy to heel, and pointed to the testy hearing featuring Mr. Kennedy as proof that they are willing to scrutinize the administration’s actions.

But so far, their most tangible response has come in the form of mild protests from a few Republicans.

Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican and an orthopedic surgeon, raised eyebrows when he told Mr. Kennedy at last week’s hearing that he had “grown deeply concerned” about his handling of vaccines, after reminding the secretary that he had “promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines” during his confirmation hearings.

But Republicans have yet to announce any oversight hearings on the matter.

They also have not scheduled any action to block the Trump administration from its latest move to unilaterally claw back money that has already been appropriated just weeks before the end of the fiscal year.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, called the proposal a “clear violation of the law,” and has been working with top Senate Democrats to add new safeguards to next year’s spending bills that would ensure the Trump administration allocates federal dollars as lawmakers intend.

“Congress alone bears the constitutional responsibility for funding our government,” Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said this week. “And any effort to claw back resources outside of the appropriations process undermines that responsibility.”

But party leaders appear unlikely to intercede to reject the effort.

Republicans also have been remarkably quiet as the Trump administration seeks to circumvent oversight on issues of national security and intelligence, traditionally an area where Congress’s role has been seen as sacrosanct.

While it has been generations since Congress used its formal power to declare war, it did authorize both the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan, albeit with broad laws that would end up allowing presidents of both parties to exercise military might in ways lawmakers might not have anticipated.

The campaign against Venezuelan drug cartels announced last week by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and national security adviser, is not covered by any congressional authorization. While the Trump administration did not offer any legal justification, experts said that in the absence of any act of Congress, the military action could only be justified under a legal theory that the president has broad authority to use the military as he sees fit.

“There’s absolutely no question the president doesn’t have the power to take airstrikes on boats outside U.S. waters with no authorization of war,” Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said. “This president believes he’s above the law. He doesn’t believe the law applies to him. He doesn’t believe the Constitution applies to him, and if we act like that’s normal, then we just encourage the continued illegal constitutional behavior.”

The failure to inform Congress about its attack on a Venezuelan boat this week, lawmakers said, was part of a pattern by the Trump administration of ignoring requirements to inform lawmakers and withholding information about national security matters that other presidents would have shared.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the first Trump administration had failed to notify Congress of a risky military incursion into North Korea to plant a listening device in 2019. Only under the Biden administration were key members of Congress told of the secret mission that led to the death of several North Koreans but did not achieve its goal.

“There is just no situation in which an intelligence operation, a special operation, of this magnitude, whether it is successful or not successful, should be conducted without Congress knowing about it,” said Mr. Crow, who requested a briefing on the operation after the Times story was published. “North Korea is a dangerous and volatile regime. The idea that you are going to just send in a military operation to a country like that without involving the United States Congress is beyond absurd.”

Members of Congress have complained the withholding of information has continued, and grown worse, during Mr. Trump’s second term. Lawmakers who sit on the congressional intelligence committees have been alarmed that the Trump administration is withholding classified assessments of the state of Iran’s nuclear program that would have been shared with them in the past.

Given that American spy agencies operate in secret, denying the public knowledge of either their covert operations or their analytic assessments of U.S. adversaries, congressional oversight is effectively the only way to hold intelligence agencies accountable.

But this week, the Pentagon announced it would block a visit by Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency after Laura Loomer, a right-wing influencer who holds no official role in the Trump administration, criticized the planned visit.

Defense officials said they would only allow bipartisan visits to military intelligence facilities, a requirement members of Congress said had never been in place before. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the intelligence panel, lodged no public protest.

The curbs on congressional oversight come during an unusual purge of seasoned intelligence officers, from the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the top analyst at the N.G.A., which Mr. Warner was blocked from visiting.

“Is congressional oversight dead?” Mr. Warner asked afterward, wondering aloud how independent intelligence assessments would be made if lawmakers could not have access to the agencies.

“Where does this end?” Mr. Warner went on. “If none of my Republican colleagues raises an issue, does this mean we are ceding all oversight?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/05/multimedia/00dc-power-tlvb/00dc-power-tlvb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 19:56:26.041301

Austrian authorities have already submitted a formal response, but the court says more clarifications are required before a final ruling.

Background of the Case

The extension follows the court’s earlier intervention in August, when it imposed a temporary halt under an urgent “interim measure.” That step was influenced by a recent case in which another Syrian deportee disappeared upon arrival in Syria. In that instance, the man — later convicted of terrorist affiliations — was eventually deported despite UN objections, prompting criticism of Austria’s policies.

In the current case, Die Presse reports, the individual is a Syrian refugee convicted in Austria of multiple crimes, including theft, burglary, and concealing official documents. He has also repeatedly evaded Austrian authorities. His parents and siblings live in Syria, but he insists he fled in 2022 to escape the war and threats to his life.

Austria’s Position

Austria’s Federal Office for Immigration and Asylum maintains that the man could “safely travel” back to his home area, citing assurances from Syrian authorities that returnees would be monitored and protected. Officials argue that his region is not experiencing armed conflict, security incidents are relatively limited, and many Syrians have already returned.

The Interior Ministry stressed that the ECHR’s halt is part of normal procedure, noting the court often issues interim measures based only on the applicant’s claims. It said Austria remains committed to deportations while monitoring conditions in Syria, in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.

Human Rights Concerns

The deportation issue has raised alarm among rights groups. Austria recently carried out its first forced return of a Syrian in nearly 15 years — a man convicted of financing ISIS — despite objections from the European Court of Justice and NGOs, which denounced the move as a breach of international protection standards.

The UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances has pressed Vienna to seek official confirmation from Damascus about deportees’ fate, including their location, detention conditions, and guarantees of safety. Austria has so far resisted such requests, fueling concerns about accountability.

Legal and Humanitarian Questions

The man’s lawyer, Roxandra Steico, warned that his case illustrates the core problem: “No one can say what will happen after deportation to Syria because the situation there is not safe or stable, and it is still changing.” She added that neither his family nor his defense team has managed to reach him since proceedings began.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed.","President Donald Trump has promised to remove millions of people from the United States in the largest deportation program in American history. But his immigration agenda is facing various tests in the U.S. courts.

For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court.

Some of the president's policies affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny:

Alien Enemies Act

The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to remove people it accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing it's an invading force.

The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S. history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.

More than 250 of the men who were deported by the U.S. to El Salvador were returned to Venezuela earlier this summer in a complex deal brokered between the three countries. But litigation over the matter has continued.

In Tuesday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, said the ruling reined in ""the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

But Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the president has the authority “to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists.”

“We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said.

Birthright citizenship

President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The amendment's Citizenship Clause says all people born or naturalized in the U.S., and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. The Trump administration asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

States that have sued over the order — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that it ignores the plain wording of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in late July that Trump's order is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision in New Hampshire that blocked the order's enforcement nationwide.

Third-country deportations

The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan.

Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won’t take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people's due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations.

In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands.

Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel.

Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back.

California immigration stops

Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens.

The practice prompted a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in the region. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.”

A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s temporary order.

The Trump administration filed an emergency petition in early August that asks the Supreme Court to halt the lower court’s ruling, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing that it puts a “straitjacket” on federal agents.

Temporary Protected Status

The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe.

The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole.

Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. The status can be repeatedly renewed.

More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there’s war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

To qualify, they had to fly to the U.S. at their own expense and have a financial sponsor. For most people, the designation lasts for two years.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed. As a result, it’s possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. In August, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal.

On the East Coast, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge’s order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Fast-track deportations

The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years.

It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first.

Before Trump's second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

The change has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration's expansion , suggesting that it's trampling on people's due process rights.

In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole.

Cobb said the case’s “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-09-07 18:56:32.376558

United States Immigration agents detained about 475 people, including more than 300 Koreans, at an under-construction battery facility 30 miles northwest of Savannah on Sept. 4. Federal officials said the workers violated an array of immigration laws, including some who illegally crossed the U.S. border and others in the country on tourist visas that do not allow them to work.

South Korea’s Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hun-sik said in televised remarks on Sept. 7 that negotiations with the U.S. had concluded, and the workers would fly home after completing additional administrative procedures. The workers will fly to South Korea on a chartered plane, Hun-sik said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The raid on the HL-GA Battery Company plant was the largest single-site workplace enforcement operation in Department of Homeland Security history, officials said. Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement showed shackled workers being escorted onto buses.

Federal officials said during a Sept. 5 news conference the operation was primarily focused on criminal violations of employment laws, not on immigration action.

In the days after the raid, South Korea’s president vowed to bring the workers home and warned that the rights of the country’s citizens “must not be unduly violated.""

Democratic members of Congress from Georgia and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus said they were “deeply alarmed” in a Sept. 6 statement.

“Instead of targeting violent criminals, the Trump administration is going after immigrants at work and in communities of color to meet its mass deportation quotas,” wrote the group of 20 lawmakers.

During a Sept. 7 appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" White House border czar Tom Homan said the Trump administration plans to conduct more raids like the one at the Georgia plant.

South Korean officials said they will seek to improve the visa system for workers traveling to the United States to prevent future incidents.

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Calderon continued to falsely claim she was taken by masked men and held in custody with others.","SOUTH LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A South Los Angeles woman who claimed she was kidnapped by ICE agents pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges.

Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon, 41, is charged with conspiracy and making false statements to federal officers, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

During her arraignment Friday, a trial date of October 21 was set.

An attorney representing Calderon's family held a press conference June 30 to announce the woman had been kidnapped five days earlier at a Jack in the Box restaurant parking lot in downtown Los Angeles and brought to San Ysidro, where she was presented to an ICE staffer and handed voluntary self-deportation paperwork.

The attorney said Calderon had refused to sign the paperwork and demanded to speak to a judge and a lawyer.

In response, the lawyer said, ""she was punished'' by federal agents and sent to a warehouse in an undisclosed location where she was abused.

Prosecutors said the press conference garnered media attention and stoked fear in the community. Meanwhile, Calderon's daughter set up a GoFundMe page, requesting $4,500 and stating that Calderon ""was taken by masked men in an unmarked vehicle ... when she was on her way to work.''

According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, the entire story was false and designed to generate sympathy and solicit donations.

In July, the Department of Homeland Security released a statement saying the story was created to malign the administration's immigration enforcement efforts.

""Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon was never arrested or kidnapped by ICE or bounty hunters -- this criminal illegal alien scammed innocent Americans for money and diverted limited DHS resources from removing the worst of the

worst from Los Angeles communities,'' DHS said. ""Politicians and activist media peddled these smears that were designed to demonize law enforcement and evade accountability. Calderon will now face justice and the media and politicians who swallowed and pushed this garbage should be embarrassed.''

Attorneys for Calderon's family who discussed the case at the press conference did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On July 3, when Calderon was still purportedly missing, federal agents ""grew concerned'' after confirming that Calderon was not in immigration custody, federal prosecutors said, and Homeland Security Investigations personnel began searching for Calderon over the July 4 holiday weekend.

On July 5, agents tracked Calderon down in a shopping plaza parking lot in Bakersfield. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Calderon continued to falsely claim she was taken by masked men and held in custody with others.

Prosecutors said video surveillance -- including images of Calderon leaving the Jack in the Box parking lot and getting into a nearby sedan -- as well as telephone records, bolster suspicions that Calderon fabricated the entire story.

""Calderon and her family knew that law enforcement was searching for her and feared for her safety, but Calderon and her family did not come forward,'' according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Instead, Calderon created what law enforcement alleges were fabricated photos of her ""rescue,'' made to look as if she was abused while in federal immigration custody and planned to hold a press conference on July 6 to increase donations to the GoFundMe page and to obtain other benefits, prosecutors said.

If convicted of both charges, Calderon would face up to 10 years in federal prison, prosecutors noted.

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,'” Trump wrote on his social media site. “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The president offered no details beyond the label “Chipocalypse Now,” a play on the title of Francis Ford Coppola’s dystopian 1979 film set in the Vietnam war, in which a character says, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”.

The post from Trump follows his repeated threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he has targeted for expanded federal enforcement. His administration is set to step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, as it did in Los Angeles, and deploy National Guard troops.

Democratic Governor of Illinois JB Pritzker, where Chicago is located, voiced outrage at Trump’s post and said the state “won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator”.

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal,” he wrote in a post on X.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also denounced Trump’s threat as “beneath the honor of our nation”.

“The reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution. We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump,” Johnson wrote on X.

Protests in Chicago, DC

In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump has deployed them since last month in Washington, DC, as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the country’s capital. He has also suggested that Baltimore and New Orleans could get the same treatment and, on Friday, even mentioned federal authorities possibly heading for Portland, Oregon, to “wipe ’em out”, meaning the protesters.

The US president on Friday also signed an order changing the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, saying it sends “a message of victory” to the world.

The troop and federal agent deployments have prompted legal challenges and protests, with critics calling them an authoritarian show of force.

On Saturday, more than a thousand protesters marched through the streets of downtown Chicago, with signs bearing slogans like “I.C.E. out of Illinois, I.C.E. out of everywhere”, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

Speakers offered the crowd instructions on what to do if encountering ICE agents. They also drew comparisons between the proposed ICE crackdown on Chicago and Israel’s presence in Gaza.

“We are inspired by the steadfastness of Palestinians in Gaza, and it is why we refuse to cower to Trump and his threats,” Nazek Sankari, co-chair of the US Palestinian Community Network, said to the crowd as many waved Palestinian flags and donned keffiyehs.

Viviana Barajas, leader with the community organisation Palenque LSNA, promised that Chicagoans would “stand up” as Los Angeles had if Trump deployed the National Guard in their city.

“If he thinks these frivolous theatrics to undermine our sovereignty will shut out the passion we have for protecting our people, this is Chicago, and he is sorely mistaken,” Barajas said. “We have been studying LA and DC, and they have stood up for their cities.”

In the US capital, protesters at the “We Are All DC” march, who also included supporters of Palestinian statehood, marched behind a bright red banner reading, “END THE D.C. OCCUPATION”, in English and Spanish.

They chanted slogans denouncing Trump and carried posters, some of which read, “Trump must go now,” “Free DC”, and “Resist Tyranny”.

Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro, reporting from Washington, DC, said the protesters were “furious” of Trump’s order, and were calling him “a fascist and an authoritarian”.

She noted that Trump had deployed the 2,000 troops last month to fight what he called a surge in violent crime, but that such offences in the US capital last year had hit “a 30-year low”.

Mark Fitzpatrick, a former US diplomat who has been a DC resident for about a decade, told The Associated Press news agency on Saturday that he was worried about the “authoritarian nature” in which the administration is treating DC.

“Federal agents, national guards patrolling our streets, that’s really an affront to the democracy of our city,” he said, adding that it is worse for DC residents due to their lack of federal representation. “We don’t have our own senators or members of the House of Representatives, so we’re at the mercy of a dictator like this, a wanna-be dictator.”

Among the protesters on Saturday was Jun Lee, a printmaker artist, who showed up with a “Free DC” sign that she made on a woodcut block.

She said she came to the protest because she was “saddened and heartbroken” about the impact of the federal intervention on her city.

“This is my home, and I never, ever thought all the stuff that I watched in a history documentary that I’m actually living in person, and this is why this is important for everyone. This is our home; we need to fight, we need to resist,” she said.

Trump has suggested that he has nearly limitless powers when it comes to deploying the National Guard. At times he has even touched on questions about his being a dictator.

“Most people are saying, ‘If you call him a dictator, if he stops crime, he can be whatever he wants’. I am not a dictator, by the way,” Trump said last month.

He added, “Not that I don’t have – I would – the right to do anything I want to do.”

“I’m the president of the United States,” Trump said. “If I think our country is in danger – and it is in danger in these cities – I can do it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25250006275774-1757209909.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-07 11:57:51.561509

Costumed performers and children with baskets of treats paraded through the community, drawing cheers from families lining the sidewalks.

But the joy of the annual celebration came with an undercurrent of unease this year. Bright orange whistles swung from the necks of parade-goers and dancers, each one ready to cut through the music should federal immigration agents appear.

The caution reflects fears across the city that Chicago could be the next target of President Donald Trump’s intense immigration crackdown. Independence Day festivities in the Windy City this year were quieter, some even postponed, under the weight of the looming threats.

But in Pilsen, the neighborhood gathered anyway, choosing joy over fear.

“It’s always a good moment to celebrate our culture, our customs,” Araceli Lucio, a parade-goer and longtime resident, told CNN. “I think now more than ever is when we need to demonstrate that we are united and we are a community.”

Celebrations thwarted

The Mexican holiday usually draws hundreds of thousands of attendees to more than a week of celebrations across Chicago that began Saturday. But in response to the anticipated ramp-up of immigration enforcement, streets are quieter as events have been muted.

In Wauconda, a village in northwest Chicago, the annual Latino Heritage Festival was canceled due to “the recent weather situation and immigration concerns in our area,” the Wauconda Police Department said in a Friday social media post.

Fiesta Patrias, one of the largest Mexican Independence Day events, has been postponed for the first time in its 30-year history to November 1 from September 14. The festival is celebrated every year in Waukegan, a suburb along Lake Michigan just north of the Great Lakes naval base, the facility Gov. JB Pritzker said Trump is set to use as a command center for incoming immigration agents.

“I know that the vendors perhaps are upset, but it is what it is – for the safety of the people,” said Margaret Carrasco, president of Fiesta Patrias.

El Grito Chicago, a two-day festival in downtown’s Grant Park, also decided to postpone citing concerns for the “safety of our community.”

“We’re saddened about the loss of an opportunity to uplift a vision of dignity, strength, and belonging at a time when it’s sorely needed,” event organizers said in a statement.

Pilsen parade-goers acknowledged the fear and hesitation in these pockets of the city’s Latino communities, backing organizers’ decisions to put a hold on their events.

“We’re with them, we support them, we understand what they’re feeling,” Claudia Villagrana, who celebrated Saturday in Pilsen, told CNN.

Illinois Reps. Mike Quigley and Jesús “Chuy” García were also seen walking in Saturday’s parade in Pilsen, as state officials have been heeding warnings of the impending immigration enforcement in Chicago.

A city bracing for impact

Officials in Chicago have been monitoring days of warnings the city could be the next target of Trump’s expanding enforcement efforts across the country.

The president and his aides have repeatedly slammed Chicago over policies limiting cooperation between local authorities and federal immigration enforcement. Chicago grappled with an influx of migrants during the Biden administration following surges along the US southern border and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s decision to transport migrants to Democratic-led cities.

Chicago was also among the first cities targeted in immigration enforcement operations when Trump took office in January.

Now, the anticipated operations in Chicago are expected to be on a larger scale, using personnel from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and possibly other agencies, CNN previously reported.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an order last weekend aimed at resisting the crackdown, laying out plans for the city amid “escalating threats from the federal government.”

The order “affirms” Chicago police will not “collaborate with federal agents on joint law enforcement patrols, arrest operations, or other law enforcement duties including civil immigration enforcement.”

But residents are still bracing for impact.

Communities are preparing for ICE presence by handing out flyers reminding families they have the right to remain silent, don’t have to consent to be searched and don’t have to share their birthplace or citizenship status, among other rights.

Sylvelia Pittman, a teacher at Nash Elementary on Chicago’s West Side, said she heard children in her classroom talking about potential ICE arrests on Friday.

Before leaving for the weekend, Pittman said, students said goodbye to each other, saying “I hope to see you next week.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2234051559-20250907014938180.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-07 12:56:51.955032

“Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” the president said in a social media post, referring to the department he claimed to rename Friday.

Trump accompanied his post with an AI-generated image of himself in a Civil War-era military hat, evoking the film “Apocalypse Now.”

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,’” Trump added in another allusion to the movie.

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) wrote in response to Trump’s post on social media.

“This is not a joke,” the governor added. “This is not normal.”

“Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man. Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Pritzker warned Tuesday that Trump is preparing to deploy the Texas National Guard against Chicago over the governor’s repeated objections.

Trump’s threat comes as his administration is organizing massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Chicago, the country’s third-largest city.

As part of its build-up for the raids, the government relocated hundreds of federal agents to the city and staged vehicles and resources on nearby federal properties.

The Department of Defense has allowed ICE to use a Navy base on the outskirts of Chicago as a staging base for the raids. The arrangement heavily blurs the line between civil and military authority.

Pritzker said that Trump may be planning to use the ICE raids to provoke unrest in the city and create a pretext to deploy troops in Chicago.

The Trump administration’s aggressive immigration operations in Los Angeles this summer incited protests, which Trump then cited in orders deploying National Guard troops and Marines to the city.

Legal experts have told Democracy Docket that Trump sending the Texas National Guard into Illinois would dangerously threaten state sovereignty.

In a fundraising email to his supporters this week, Trump vowed to “liberate” Chicago.

Trump’s post came as several thousand D.C. residents marched in the nation’s capital to demand an end to Trump’s massive troop deployment in the district.

In addition to Chicago, Trump in recent days has threatened to deploy the military against New York, Portland, Oakland and other major cities.

The president has falsely portrayed the cities, which are in Democratic-run states, as being overrun with violent crime, while largely ignoring cities in Republican-run states that have higher crime rates.

His ongoing military deployments in Los Angeles and D.C. — and the potential deployment in Chicago — have sparked concerns that Trump may deploy troops or law enforcement in key Democratic strongholds to undermine future elections.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the operation, dubbed “Patriot 2.0,” followed a similar sweep in May. The agency said those taken into custody included individuals accused of sexual assault, drug trafficking and gang activity who had been released from local jails despite federal requests to hold them. Officials said Boston’s policies allowed dangerous offenders to remain in communities instead of being deported.

President Donald Trump, who has deployed National Guard troops and federal law enforcement officers to Washington, has also threatened repeatedly to send forces into Chicago to tackle crime there.

On Saturday, the president posted a meme on Truth Social evoking the Vietnam War-themed movie Apocalypse Now, with a caption that said, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” and saying Chicago is about to find out why he changed the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War.

Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, was asked Sunday during an interview with CNN’s on whether enforcement activities are expected in Chicago this week. “Absolutely,” he replied. “You can expect action in most sanctuary cities across the country.”

Illinois’s Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, rejected Trump’s threat, writing in a post on X that “Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.” Even so, organizers decided to postpone a major Mexican Independence Day festival scheduled for next weekend amid fears over a potential immigration crackdown. A smaller celebration went ahead as scheduled on Saturday.

But his immigration agenda is facing various tests in the U.S. courts.

For example, a federal appeals court ruled last week that the Trump administration cannot use an 18th-century wartime law to speed deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members, setting up a likely return showdown at the Supreme Court.

Some of the president's policies affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people. Here are some Trump administration efforts that have come under court scrutiny:

Alien Enemies Act

The Trump administration has used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to remove people it accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang, arguing it's an invading force.

The administration deported people it designated as members to a notorious prison in El Salvador and argued that American courts could not order them freed. The Alien Enemies Act was only used three times before in U.S. history, all during declared wars — in the War of 1812 and the two world wars.

More than 250 of the men who were deported by the U.S. to El Salvador were returned to Venezuela earlier this summer in a complex deal brokered between the three countries. But litigation over the matter has continued.

In Tuesday's ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, two judges on a three-judge panel agreed with immigrant rights lawyers and lower court judges who argued the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 was not intended to be used against gangs such as Tren de Aragua.

Lee Gelernt, who argued the case for the ACLU, said the ruling reined in ""the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”

But Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the president has the authority “to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists.”

“We expect to be vindicated on the merits in this case,” she said.

Birthright citizenship

President Trump issued an executive order that attempts to redefine birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The amendment's Citizenship Clause says all people born or naturalized in the U.S., and subject to U.S. jurisdiction, are citizens. The Trump administration asserts that a child born in the U.S. is not a citizen if the mother does not have legal immigration status or is in the country legally but temporarily, and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

States that have sued over the order — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — argue that it ignores the plain wording of the Citizenship Clause as well as a landmark birthright citizenship case in 1898. The Supreme Court had found that a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents was a citizen by virtue of his birth on American soil.

A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in late July that Trump's order is unconstitutional, affirming a lower-court decision in New Hampshire that blocked the order's enforcement nationwide.

Third-country deportations

The Trump administration has been sending people to countries where they have no ties, including El Salvador in Central America and the African nation of South Sudan.

Trump officials have said these immigrants often come from countries that won’t take them back or were convicted of violent crimes. Advocacy groups sued this year, arguing that people's due process rights were being violated and that immigrants were being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations.

In late March, a federal judge temporarily blocked third-country deportations of people without first being allowed to argue that it would jeopardize their safety. But in June, a divided Supreme Court halted that order, allowing the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands.

Lawyers for five men who were deported to the African country of Eswatini in July said Tuesday that the men have held prison for seven weeks without charges and no access to legal counsel.

Attorneys for one of the men, Jamaican national Orville Etoria, said his home country was willing to accept him back.

California immigration stops

Earlier this year, U.S. immigration authorities began conducting mass immigration raids in Southern California, rounding up predominantly Latino immigrants from locations like car washes, Home Depots, and bus stops, even sometimes ensnaring U.S. citizens.

The practice prompted a lawsuit by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in the region. The Justice Department has argued that federal agents are allowed to consider factors like race or ethnicity and occupations in an area it considers a “top enforcement priority.”

A federal judge ordered the administration to halt such tactics in seven California counties, including Los Angeles, writing that they violated the U.S. Constitution. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s temporary order.

The Trump administration filed an emergency petition in early August that asks the Supreme Court to halt the lower court’s ruling, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing that it puts a “straitjacket” on federal agents.

Temporary Protected Status

The Trump administration has sought to end programs that offer legal yet temporary authorization for people to live and work in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe.

The efforts have prompted lawsuits across the country that say more than 1.5 million people are under what's known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, or humanitarian parole.

Temporary Protected Status allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters. The status can be repeatedly renewed.

More than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela live in the U.S. under humanitarian parole, which allows people from countries where there’s war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the U.S.

To qualify, they had to fly to the U.S. at their own expense and have a financial sponsor. For most people, the designation lasts for two years.

In May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke TPS and humanitarian protections while the lawsuits proceed. As a result, it’s possible that people who had protections could be deported before the legal cases are completed.

On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen restored TPS protections for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no legal authority to revoke extensions granted under the Biden administration. In August, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed him up in a related appeal.

On the East Coast, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is deciding whether to uphold a Boston judge’s order halting humanitarian parole terminations for roughly 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Fast-track deportations

The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process for migrants who came to the country illegally and have been here less than two years.

It allows for their removal without appearing before a judge first.

Before Trump's second term, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

The change has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups. In late August, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb temporarily blocked the administration's expansion, suggesting that it's trampling on people's due process rights.

In another case, Cobb agreed in early August to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under humanitarian parole.

Cobb said the case’s “underlying question” is whether people who escaped oppression will have the chance to “plead their case within a system of rules.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sscC2JnjzhmpxUnOafoR3A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/81a0c489d571648201223b04c2be2240,N,,2025-09-07 11:57:20.116499

After the ethics complaint was filed, Libs of TikTok egged on Arizona senate Republicans.
The ethics complaint details how Ortiz did not back away from her reshare after Libs of TikTok posted about it.
“Senator Ortiz’s post is clearly protected speech under the first amendment,” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said in a statement.
“This ethics complaint is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to intimidate and silence a democratically elected legislator.","A Democratic lawmaker in Arizona who is facing calls for expulsion for resharing an Instagram post warning of immigration enforcement activity near an elementary school said that state senate Republicans “absolutely are trying to make an example out of me”.

Analise Ortiz, a Democratic state senator in Arizona, shared an Instagram post from a community organization that warned, in text only, that immigration enforcement agents were near a local elementary school.

“Alert/Alerta: ICE activity near Southwest Elementary,” the post in early August said, adding the cross streets of the school. “ICE is present. La migra esta presente.”

That post is at the center of an ethics complaint filed this week against Ortiz and a viral rightwing campaign against her.

“The ethics complaint very clearly says that they want to stop other people from sharing this type of information,” she said, calling it “a stunning escalation of intimidation”.

The controversy began when Libs of TikTok, the X account known for going after liberals online, posted about Ortiz’s reshare, claiming she was “actively impeding and doxxing ICE by posting their live locations on instagram” and that law enforcement officials should “charge her”.

No photos of agents were shared, nor were names or other identifying information about agents.

“I was not there,” Ortiz said. “There were no pictures of anybody taken. It was simply a post that said Ice presence is possible outside of an elementary school. And I think that the fact that they are outside of sensitive locations where kids should be able to learn in peace is something that people should know about. They should know how the government is acting on their behalf.”

The Libs of TikTok post went viral, leaving Ortiz with an inbox full of harassing and threatening messages. The mischaracterization that she “doxed” agents had led to the vast majority of the threats she had received, she said.

Jake Hoffman, a Republican state senator, and a handful of other Republican leaders in the chamber filed a formal ethics complaint that seeks to expel Ortiz from the chamber or, failing a vote to expel, remove her from all committees and take away her office and administrative staff. The ethics committee chair also referred the complaint to the US attorney’s office in Arizona for a potential investigation, saying Ortiz’s actions “may implicate federal law”.

After the ethics complaint was filed, Libs of TikTok egged on Arizona senate Republicans. “Make an example out of her! Enough is enough,” the account tweeted.

“What surprised me about the ethics complaint was the level of punishment they want to inflict upon me for simply exercising my first amendment right,” Ortiz said.

As immigration enforcement agents have ramped up activity across the country, activists have shared locations where they see raids or Ice agents as a way to warn people to avoid the area. In Arizona, a southern border state, fear of deportations – and of detaining people who are in the US legally – is a facet of daily life in the second Trump administration. Ortiz said she had heard from constituents who are terrified to drive without a passport on hand because they fear law enforcement won’t believe they are US citizens if they are pulled over.

Ortiz said she would not be intimidated by the ethics inquest or attempts to criminalize her sharing of information.

“If the United States of America is going to continue as a free and fair democracy, it demands that people speak out against constitutional violations,” she said. “It demands bravery, so I am going to continue to be brave in this moment.”

Hoffman claimed Ortiz’s reshare was “reckless” and “dangerous”, saying that “by publicly posting alerts about federal law enforcement activity, she actively tipped off individuals being pursued by Ice, jeopardizing the safety of officers and law-abiding citizens”. He wanted the committee to investigate her for “behavior unbecoming of an elected official and embarrassing to the entire Arizona legislature on a state and national stage”.

Hoffman was charged for his role as a fake elector after the 2020 election. Earlier this year, he was pulled over for driving 89mph in a 65mph zone in his Tesla Cybertruck emblazoned with the word “Freedom” on the back, though he was not cited because of a legal provision called legislative immunity.

The ethics complaint details how Ortiz did not back away from her reshare after Libs of TikTok posted about it. Instead, she wrote that she would alert her community to stay away when Ice is around and that she was “not fucking scared of you nor Trump’s masked goons”. After Hoffman wrote on X that he would bring an ethics complaint and wanted her expelled, she said: “Bring it on, Jake.”

Warren Petersen, the Republican state senate president, previously asked for a federal investigation into Ortiz’s reshare, claiming she may have broken a federal law that prevents “assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers or employees”.

The US attorney’s office in Arizona did not respond to a request for comment.

Ortiz said Republican lawmakers want to deprive her legislative district of its voice in the senate and silence her and others who want to stand against deportations.

“The fact they are trying to escalate it and are blatantly lying about my actions proves that this is really about authoritarianism and wanting to have a system where masked men carry out police operations in secret, and that should really concern anyone who cares about the United States constitution,” Ortiz said.

Free speech experts and other elected officials, including the state’s Democratic attorney general, have spoken out against the attacks on Ortiz for her post, which they say is well within her first amendment rights.

“Senator Ortiz’s post is clearly protected speech under the first amendment,” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said in a statement. “This ethics complaint is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to intimidate and silence a democratically elected legislator. Warren Petersen and Jake Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves for weaponizing the ethics process just because they disagree with Senator Ortiz politically.”

The ethics committee has not met yet this year and does not have operating rules in place, but will consider the complaint once those are established, said its chair, Shawnna Bolick, a Republican.

Recently, however, the Council of Europe issued a warning that such decisions could lead to serious human rights violations.
The effectiveness of policies to address this divisive challenge has also become a “key test” of public trust in governments.
The Council of Europe’s warning serves as a reminder that behind every policy decision on migrants lie individual human destinies.
To sustain and safeguard the asylum system, one crucial principle must be to ensure the repatriation of migrants is conducted with caution and safety.","Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the US has concluded agreements allowing the deportation of foreign migrants to South Sudan, Eswatini, and Rwanda. Leaving aside questions of effectiveness, concerns have arisen over the “fairness and morality” of such deals, as many of the deported individuals do not originate from those African nations.

In fact, deporting migrants to third countries is not a new practice. Previously, the UK pursued a similar approach through its agreement with Rwanda.

However, that plan faced both legal and political challenges. Nevertheless, the UK has continued seeking arrangements, including a deal with France to return migrants to French territory. Meanwhile, in 2024, Italy established reception centres in Albania, treating them as waiting points for the repatriation of migrants.

Although the strategy of “shifting the migration burden beyond borders” has stirred mixed reactions, other European countries have shown interest in adopting similar measures.

Recently, however, the Council of Europe issued a warning that such decisions could lead to serious human rights violations. Migrants relocated to third countries may face risks of torture, arbitrary detention, mass deportation, and denial of asylum rights or legal support.

In a statement on September 4, Michael O’Flaherty, Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, stressed that such policies could expose migrants to grave harm and prolonged suffering. His remarks came as a new World Health Organisation (WHO) report revealed that today more people than ever live in a country other than the one where they were born. While many people migrate out of choice, others migrate out of necessity. Some may be forcibly displaced from their homes as they flee persecution, conflict, violence, or disaster. Others facing adversity may also have little option but to move, for example to escape inhuman treatment, avoid economic hardship, access social rights, or reunite with families.

Yet the journey towards a “new life” is far from easy and may leave lasting scars. The migration experience itself is a decisive factor in the mental health of refugees.

According to the WHO report, refugees and migrants exposed to adversity are more likely than host populations to experience mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, and psychosis. Such adversity may stem from traumatic experiences in their homelands, hardships endured along the journey, such as violence, detention, or lack of basic services, or even from restrictive immigration policies, as well as poor living and working conditions in host countries.

In recent years, immigration has remained one of the most contentious issues for many Western countries. The effectiveness of policies to address this divisive challenge has also become a “key test” of public trust in governments.

In reality, the management of migration is by no means easy, especially in today’s complex global political climate marked by numerous conflict hotspots. The Council of Europe’s warning serves as a reminder that behind every policy decision on migrants lie individual human destinies.

If deportations are treated merely as a technical solution, the “doorways” between countries risk becoming “new borders” of injustice and suffering.

In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.
Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.
Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.
“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd.","ST PETERSBURG- A crowd of around 75 people gathered in St. Petersburg on Saturday to strategize ways to persuade the police chiefs of Tampa and St. Petersburg to void partnership agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they entered into earlier this year.

Legislation signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis requires that sheriffs or chief correctional officers operating a county detention facility must enter into a 287(g) agreement with ICE. That means that every county sheriff in the state needed to sign such an agreement this year, which they all have.

There is no requirement for municipalities to do the same, yet hundreds of police departments throughout the state have done so anyway. In the cases of Tampa and St. Petersburg, two of the largest cities in the state, those agreements were reached quietly earlier this year, without fanfare.

Now activists in the area say that they intend to persuade Tampa Police Chief Lee Bercaw and St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway to cancel such agreements.

“In order to foster public trust and a positive relationship with the community, we ask you to cancel this heartless, inefficient 287(g) agreement before further harm is done,” read the form letters that attendees at the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg were asked to send on Saturday to Bercaw and Holloway, as well as Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch. The letters were accessed through a QR code listed on pamphlets distributed by organizers at the event.

Threats to be removed from office

Addressing the crowd, activist Karla Correa showed a picture of Florida Attorney James Uthmeier, who has threatened to remove city council members who have shown inclination not to sign such agreements.

“He’s saying, no, you have to do it or else I’m going to remove you from office,” said Correa, with the Tampa Bay area chapter of the Party of Socialism and Liberation.

“He is the attorney general for the state of Florida. He has a lot of power. And he’s going along with Ron DeSantis’ agenda, and we see whenever anyone tries to fight against it, again, they threaten to remove them from office. That’s what happened in Orlando. That’s what happened in Key West. That’s what happened in Fort Myers.”

The Key West City Commission voided its police department’s 287(g) after learning that their police chief had signed such an agreement without commissioners’ knowledge. After they did that, Uthmeier publicly declared that the action had made Key West a “sanctuary city,” which is banned in Florida law. Shortly thereafter, the commission reconvened and approved a new 287(g) agreement on a 4-2 vote.

A similar situation happened with the Pinellas County School District earlier this year, with the school superintendent and the school board apparently unaware that their chief of police had signed an agreement. Once that news was made public, the district backed away from the agreement.

“Did anyone know that Pinellas County schools signed a 287(g) agreement for a second?” Correa asked members of the crowd. “Because ICE shouldn’t be in schools. But you know what happened right after? There was a huge public outcry, right? Parents came out. Teachers came out. Community members who don’t even have kids came out to fight against this and to oppose it. And you know what they did? And you won’t hear DeSantis talk about this. They voided that agreement,” she said to cheers in the audience.

In addition to asking the mayors and police chiefs of the two cities to use their authority to cancel the agreements, the activists are calling on the St. Petersburg and Tampa city councils to pass resolutions condemning the 287(g) agreements. And they want the Tampa Human Rights Board to “begin an immediate and thorough investigation of Tampa PD’s 287(g) partnership.”

SPPD responds

St. Petersburg Police Chief Anthony Holloway provided a written statement to the Phoenix later on Saturday.

“To clarify, our department is not part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said. “We assist ICE only when, during the course of a lawful encounter, an individual is identified as a suspect or subject in a criminal investigation. If it is determined that the individual has an active warrant, we are legally obligated to execute that warrant, whether it’s ICE-related or not, fairly and consistently. We are not seeking, nor do we receive, funding to support ICE operations.”

Attorneys representing the state have informed a judge in a lawsuit filed by the city of South Miami regarding the confusion about the law that, in fact, municipalities in Florida are not required to sign such an agreement.

Many farmers insist they do what is required of any employer when hiring workers, but say there is a growing expectation that employers police workers’ legal status.
Yet protections for workers without legal status are limited.
For years, federal lawmakers have introduced legislation that would grant legal status to long-term workers, but it has never gotten past the Senate.
Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economics expert at Michigan State University, said the bill’s pathway to legal status may be what’s holding it back.","SHOSHONE, Idaho — Just east of town, a road cuts through sagebrush and fields of cows toward Donley Farms, where Darren Taber manages the multigenerational operation.

Taber’s 900-cow dairy requires constant attention and long hours — but it’s home.

“It’s the best place in the world to raise a family,” he said. “It’s a lot of late nights. There’s a lot of times that I’m (working) 24-hour days.”

Yet more and more, Taber has been pulled away from this work and into policy, traveling to Washington, D.C., to advocate for immigration reform that has been stalled for years.

“What I cannot stand is the fact that Congress cannot get anything across the finish line,” he said. “Maybe we can’t solve it all in one big, beautiful bill. Who knows? Maybe we can.”

The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has left farmers worried about their livelihoods and workers frightened for their lives. It’s also renewed bipartisan calls to implement reforms for the people who help feed America.

“Yeah, get the criminals out,” Taber said. “But your farmworkers are not your criminals.”

President Donald Trump has indicated he might be amenable to a solution.

In June — after reports of arrests at a New Mexico dairy, at a Nebraska meat production plant and in the fields of California — the administration ordered a pause on workplace raids in agriculture and hospitality, but it reversed course days later.

Trump then said in a July 3 speech that he was working to help farmers who depend on migrant labor — indicating his administration was making progress on legislation to address the issue.

Trump and other leaders have discussed a work program that would ensure farmers have the labor they need but would not provide amnesty for farmworkers who lack legal status.

Many farmers insist they do what is required of any employer when hiring workers, but say there is a growing expectation that employers police workers’ legal status.

“We are not ICE agents,” said Andrew Mickelsen, co-owner of Mickelsen Farms, a large potato farm in Idaho. “Last time I checked, I haven’t been deputized. I haven’t been issued a bulletproof vest or a gun, and I haven’t gotten a paycheck yet to be an ICE agent.”

Nearly 70% of people working in agriculture were not born in the United States, according to federal data, and about 42% of that workforce lacks legal status. Yet protections for workers without legal status are limited.

The H-2A visa is a temporary permit that allows farmers to hire foreign farmworkers if there aren’t enough domestic workers to fill labor needs — a growing reality for employers. In 2014, the U.S. issued around 90,000 H-2A visas. Last year, that number rose to 315,000.

Yet industries that require year-round labor, such as Idaho dairy, cannot legally hire workers using the temporary visa.

“You can guess how dependent we are on an unauthorized workforce,” said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairy Association, who wants to see legal status for existing workers and access to a visa program that can meet labor demands.

“We can’t feed ourselves as a country if we don’t find a solution to this problem,” he said.

For years, federal lawmakers have introduced legislation that would grant legal status to long-term workers, but it has never gotten past the Senate.

The latest version of the bill would allow a qualified individual with extended employment in farmwork to become a “certified agricultural worker” on the condition of continued employment.

The bill also would provide at least 20,000 H-2A visas each year for the next decade for farmers with year-round labor needs. Half of those visas would be reserved for the dairy industry.

Zach Rutledge, an agricultural economics expert at Michigan State University, said the bill’s pathway to legal status may be what’s holding it back.

“It’s hard to get bipartisan support when you’re talking about legalizing hundreds of thousands of unauthorized workers — especially in our current political climate,” Rutledge said.

Given that immigrants play an important role across many sectors of the country’s economy, tension between business interests and those who support mass deportations is growing.

“We understand the need for enforcement,” Naerebout said. “But we also have to have a conversation around immigration reform so that we don’t damage our economy.”

California has the largest number of immigrants lacking legal status in the U.S., according to the Pew Research Center, and is home to about half of the unauthorized agricultural worker population, statistics show.

Since January, immigration agents have arrested hundreds of people in the state — increasing fear among those who work the fields and concern from those who employ them.

As the sun rises over the golden hills of California’s Salinas Valley, the region’s 25,000 farmworkers are already hunched at the waist, planting and harvesting America’s produce.

M.M., a farmworker from Puebla, Mexico, has been in the United States for over a decade. She works long days harvesting cauliflower, tomatoes and strawberries.

She requested anonymity because she is in the U.S. without legal status and the fear looms that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers could appear at any time. She only leaves the house to go to work.

“I’m still afraid with the uncertainty of being deported,” she said. “But, oh well. We have to keep working and move forward.”

Farmworker S.H. works on a small, organic farm nestled in the fertile soil of San Benito County — part of the “Salad Bowl of the World.” His efforts contribute to the Golden State’s $58 billion agriculture industry and yet, he said: “You don’t feel safe anywhere.”

Javier Zamora is a midsize organic farmer in the Salinas Valley who immigrated to the U.S. more than four decades ago. He grows blueberries, strawberries, tomatoes and other produce on about 100 acres of land.

Zamora wonders why the Trump administration would want to deport the people who help stock grocery shelves.

“America would not be as great as it is now if all my workforce were taken away,” he said.

Lawmakers, he said, “need to wake up and they need to do something. And it needs to be done quickly — before it’s too late.”

As of early Sunday morning, the details of the president's plans for Chicago remained sparse, but his comments have put immigrant communities on edge amid Mexican Independence Day celebrations, some of which have been canceled in anticipation of stepped-up raids around Chicago.

""I'm telling people to know your rights, be extra careful,"" Pritzker said at a press conference last week. ""Don't play into their hands, and if you have the opportunity, please protest. Pull out your phone, video everything that they're doing.""

Enforcement is ramping up in other places, too.

On Saturday, federal authorities confirmed that the Trump administration has initiated an immigration crackdown in Boston dubbed ""Patriot 2.0."" The White House is simultaneously suing city officials over alleged interference with federal efforts.

On Friday, federal agents detained hundreds of people during a Hyundai plant raid in Georgia, which officials are calling ""the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security investigations.""

The president has suggested that other Democrat-led cities, like Baltimore and New Orleans, could be next.

It follows Trump's unprecedented federal intervention in Washington, D.C. Thousands spoke out in protests on Saturday as the president's law enforcement takeover enters its fourth week.

""We've done an incredible job, and we'll be doing that with other cities throughout the country,"" Trump said on Friday, pointing to data suggesting violent crime in D.C. has dropped since his operation started.

Trump's emergency declaration taking charge of local D.C. police is set to expire on Wednesday, and an extension from Congress does not appear to be imminent.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has been critical of Trump's strategy, nevertheless signed an executive order last week outlining a framework to continue coordinating with federal law enforcement.

“I want the message to be clear to the Congress, we have a framework to request or use federal resources in our city. We don’t need a presidential emergency,"" Bowser told reporters on Wednesday.

There are signs that the president's use of the National Guard in D.C. will continue for longer.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced plans to send 316 members of the state’s National Guard to Washington, D.C., later this month, building on the president's initial deployment and following suit with seven other Republican-led states.

Meanwhile, legal challenges are mounting, and there could be more lawsuits on the horizon.

Gov. Pritzker has threatened to sue the Trump administration if the president deploys the National Guard to Chicago without his permission.

D.C. is also challenging the president's use of the guard and asking a federal court to intervene.

A similar legal battle is playing out in California after the president sent troops to Los Angeles earlier this year in response to immigration protests. Last week, a federal judge ruled the LA deployment broke a law prohibiting the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities, which the Trump administration denies.

The judge sought to restrict the guard's role starting Sept. 12, but an appeals court put implementation on pause, allowing for arguments in the case to be more thoroughly examined.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/images/gettyimages-2233525313-68bd7408e090a.jpg?crop=1xw:0.84375xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-09-07 09:57:08.002917

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to state that Alan Phetsadakone was represented in the decades-old fraud case by his defense lawyer.","A federal judge ruled Friday the Department of Homeland Security must release a 47-year-old father of four whom the government is trying to deport to Laos, a country the man hasn’t seen since he was a toddler.

Alan Phetsadakone left an immigration detention center in Tacoma on Saturday morning.

Phetsadakone, a lawful permanent resident, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in July during an annual check-in, an appointment he had gone to every year without incident for more than two decades.

U.S. District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead ruled Friday evening that the man should be immediately released from the Northwest ICE Processing Center.

Whitehead wrote in the release order that Phetsadakone’s case raised “serious questions about the Government’s alleged failure to follow required procedures when re-detaining someone released on supervision.”

Phetsadakone has been living under a supervision order since 2001 tied to a bank fraud conviction. An immigration judge ordered Phetsadakone be removed to Laos in 1998, a year after he pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud for helping others cash bad checks. Because Laos does not have a formal repatriation agreement with the U.S., and has historically rarely issued travel documents for deportation, a judge released Phetsadakone after serving several months in detention.

At Phetsadakone’s hearing Friday, U.S. attorneys said the federal government had reached an agreement with Laos and had the travel documents required to deport him there within two weeks. His arrest by ICE this July was lawful and his deportation “a certainty,” said U.S. Attorney Michelle Lambert.

But Phetsadakone’s defense attorneys said they had found “smoking gun” evidence that his defense lawyer in the decades-old fraud case had improperly advised him of the risk of deportation should he plead guilty. They have requested a judge vacate that conviction, and Whitehead granted the temporary restraining order that would release Phetsadakone until there is a ruling in the criminal case.

Jennie Pasquarella, one of Phetsadakone’s attorneys, argued ICE unlawfully arrested and detained Phetsadakone this July by not notifying him in advance that his release had been revoked. The Seattle Clemency Project attorney representing him pro bono argued there is also a serious risk that he would be deported to a third country instead of Laos, a country where Phetsadakone knows no one and whose immigration policies seem to be “changing by the minute,” said Pasquarella.

The Trump administration has escalated third-country deportations in recent months, sending people to countries they have no ties to. About a dozen countries, including South Sudan, Uganda and El Salvador, have agreed to receive these deportees.

“I cannot explain why the government is doing this,” Pasquarella said at the courtroom’s podium. “If nothing else, it’s unconstitutional punishment. It’s cruel. It’s inhumane. It’s designed to punish.”

The courtroom reached capacity Friday, its benches filled with Phetsadakone’s family and supporters, including neighbors and members of a union. Some family members embraced each other as they sat down, and others waited nervously with their eyes closed.

Phetsadakone sat quietly throughout the hearing, wearing a green uniform and occasionally looking at his children and wife of 26 years, Cheryl Eugenio, who is a U.S. citizen.

Phetsadakone ran into trouble months after turning 18, when several new friends told him about a way he could “get some quick cash,” Pasquarella said. He helped the friends deposit counterfeit and stolen checks, according to federal court records.

Phetsadakone’s attorneys argue his lawyer in the fraud case gave him bad legal advice, based on a hearing recording during which the lawyer said deportation was “not certain” if he pleaded guilty. In fact, Congress had passed a law lowering the loss threshold for aggravated felonies from $200,000 to $10,000: granting the government grounds for deportation.

Therefore, his attorneys now argue, his decision to plead is “constitutionally invalid” because his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated.

After serving eight months in detention and being released on supervision, Phetsadakone attended his annual ICE check-ins “consistently, religiously (and) dutifully” for 27 years, Pasquarella said. He married Eugenio and helped raise their three children while working two jobs at a Seattle wine importer and pillow manufacturer.

Decades after receiving his supervision order, Phetsadakone’s attorneys said he had no reason to fear an unexpected outcome during his annual appointment at the ICE field office in Tukwila on July 21. Eugenio and their three children were waiting in the car, with plans to go to lunch afterward.

Instead, ICE officers arrested Phetsadakone and transported him to the agency’s detention center in Tacoma, where he has been held in custody since.

“His whole life is here,” said Eugenio. “His family is here. It’s hard. He would have to start all over in a place where he doesn’t know anyone.” Phetsadakone can’t read Lao and is not verbally fluent, Eugenio said. She thanked supporters, including people the couple had not spoken to in years, who donated to a GoFundMe for the family, which had raised nearly $10,000 on Friday.

Kane Vongsavanh, a Virginia-based immigration attorney, said while the government is not providing precise data, he estimates “upwards of 200 deportees” have been accepted by Laos since January. That’s a big increase over past years.

Many of them have had removal orders hanging over their heads for years.

“The sad part about that is most of these crimes and most of these issues happened several decades ago,” Vongsavanh said.

Several Southeast Asian countries, including Laos and Vietnam, have historically been reluctant to accept U.S. deportees.

He recommends Southeast Asian immigrants who have removal orders get their documents in order, hire an experienced immigration attorney or seek out pro bono organizations if they don’t have the financial means to hire representation.

According to The New York Times, the coordinated operation began on Saturday, September 6, and is expected to continue for several weeks, expanding federal deportation efforts.

Officials familiar with the operation told the agency that the campaign specifically targets migrants previously detained for crimes but later released from local custody before federal processing.

The Department of Homeland Security has justified the arrests as a public safety measure. Authorities argue that state and local failures to hold detainees increase risks for communities.

This development comes as Chicago also prepares for expanded deportation operations. Local leaders there have expressed concern over potential humanitarian consequences amid already rising migrant arrivals.

In May, Massachusetts saw nearly 1,500 undocumented migrants arrested in similar federal operations. Immigration advocates warned then that large-scale enforcement disproportionately harms vulnerable families and asylum seekers.

The renewed crackdown underscores the Trump administration’s intensified immigration agenda, prioritizing enforcement actions in states where local officials have resisted deeper cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Under pressure to meet a weekly deportation quota of 10,000, the Dominican Republic’s general directorate of migration (DGM) is now pushing into bateyes.
The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, does not appear in the top 10.
The bateyes started as simple settlements on sugarcane plantations and are among the most marginalised and impoverished communities in the Dominican Republic.
“The Dominican Republic is violating its own legislation,” says Wooding.","On the yellow bus rumbling through the Dominican Republic’s sugarcane fields back to the settlement, Sainristil sat among the jolting bodies of other Haitian workers in ripped orange shirts. These journeys are routine – always the same grumbling stomachs in anticipation of dinner, the same chatter among men who share a job, a home and a homeland.

But that evening, as the workers’ bus pulled into the cul-de-sac of communal housing, it came to a halt before two white buses marked with the words “Migration control”.

“They grabbed us like dogs,” says Sainristil, referring to the 3 July raid in Construcción, where uniformed men bundled 11 of the workers into the vehicles so they could be deported. Construcción is a batey, one of the Dominican informal sugarcane settlements that have long been safe zones for Haitian immigrants and Dominicans of Haitian descent.

But that is changing. Under pressure to meet a weekly deportation quota of 10,000, the Dominican Republic’s general directorate of migration (DGM) is now pushing into bateyes. Raids are increasing, and even people born in the Dominican Republic – with documents or not – are being rounded up and deported, flagrantly disregarding laws, according to human rights organisations.

Targeting Haitian immigrants became widespread during the second term of the Dominican president, Luis Abinader, whose government imposed the new quota in October 2024, when 15 measures to “combat illegal immigration and guarantee national sovereignty” were announced.

This intensified enforcement comes during a rise in nationalist sentiment. Most Dominicans – 59% – believe that immigration harms the country, well above the regional average for negative views towards migrants.

Haitians are a target even though they are one of the world’s populations most vulnerable to climate disasters – a major factor in their emigration, alongside poverty, urban violence and food insecurity.

During the first 20 years of this century, Haiti was one of the top three countries – after Puerto Rico and Myanmar – to be affected by extreme weather events, based on the Climate Risk Index.

The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti, does not appear in the top 10.

Experts agree that environmental degradation, worsened by Haiti’s dwindling 3% tree cover, has led to widespread displacement. By February 2025, violence and climate-related disasters had displaced more than 1 million people – about 10% of the population.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the climate crisis is a crucial driver of forced migration, with more than a quarter of displaced households in Haiti forced to move multiple times, largely due to hurricanes, floods and landslides.

The bateyes started as simple settlements on sugarcane plantations and are among the most marginalised and impoverished communities in the Dominican Republic. As the workers’ families expanded, they evolved into multigenerational communities.

While private bateyes, such as Construcción, still follow strict residency rules limiting housing to workers and their families, many public bateyes have become functioning neighbourhoods, blending into nearby towns and cities.

In Monte Coca, a public batey, Miranda scoops rice into bowls for each family member. The room is dark, with light streaming in from an opening in the wall as she cooks over a charcoal stove, sweating in the 30C (86F) heat. Each bowl has its owner, but in the last month she has had to set three aside, praying her sons and nephew return.

“I felt like part of my heart was torn away,” says Miranda, standing where she was when she was told they had been detained. “I wanted to go look for my son but I couldn’t,” she says, “because if I had gone, they would have taken me too.”

Although Miranda, her sons and nephew were all born in the Dominican Republic, none are recognised as citizens by the state. Their lack of documentation stems from nationality laws that have long excluded Dominicans of Haitian descent.

Deportation figures from the DGM do not match those of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) because many Haitians are victims of a racket in which people are detained by corrupt officials whom family members must then pay to get their relatives freed.

The problem is not new and has been acknowledged by Abinader, who says his government is working to combat it. From January to June, the DGM recorded more than 184,000 deportations – 56,000 more than were reported by the IOM. The difference is the number of multiple arrests of the same person.

“The issue is that people are not being counted, events are being counted,” says Bridget Wooding, director of the Caribbean Migrants Observatory (Obmica), a research centre studying migration dynamics in the region based in the Dominican Republic’s capital, Santo Domingo. “You can have the same person detained and deported several times.”

Miranda’s family were victims of the scam. Her husband, along with Carlo, a Monte Coca community leader, had to race to raise the money before his boys were deported. They got enough money together with the community’s help but, when they sent it, the agents blocked Carlo’s number. At four o’clock the next morning, the boys were loaded back on to the truck, this time bound for the border.

Instead of finding a lawyer, the family paid the buscones, as the scammers are known, a second time and the boys were returned home after four days in Haiti. Yet within the month, as Miranda’s sons sat outside with their cousin, her youngest was caught again.

“The first time, it felt like my soul left me. The second, I didn’t know what to do,” says Miranda.

“It’s like a business. If you have money, you don’t go to Haiti. But it has become more aggressive and more abusive,” adds Carlo.

The practice of targeting Haitians has been condemned by human rights defenders. Gabrielle Apollon, director of the Haiti Project at New York University’s Global Justice Clinic, denounces the intentional secrecy behind the detentions and deportations.

“People are rounded up in these cage-like deportation trucks and shipped off to Haiti as quickly as they can be. Nobody has any recourse [to the law],” she says. “How are you going to find a lawyer if you can’t even contact a parent to get you any access?”

The government spells out the rules and rights around deportations but in practice, laws are broken and human rights are disregarded, campaigners say. “The Dominican Republic is violating its own legislation,” says Wooding. “Virtually anybody in uniform may take matters into their own hands and participate in these activities.”

The Dominican Republic’s general directorate of migration was approached for comment.

Yet within the batey communities of San Pedro and Hato Mayor, it is common knowledge that migration does not respect individuals’ dignity or fundamental human rights.

Many communities in this region have a leader of sorts, who tries to help meet the community’s needs. The job now carries the new weight of navigating the increased number of immigration cases. And while deportations within the bateyes were almost unheard of before the quota, now every community faces a very real fear.

“They’re going into people’s homes,” says Fidel Herredia, a community leader who can recount numerous instances of migration officers carrying out night-time raids in his batey of Alejandro Bass.

“They come in [the house] like – ‘Hello, hello! Who’s there?! Haitian!’ Boom!” Herredia yells. “They throw you in the truck and take you away like you’re an animal.”

Jon Valdez, a migrant who has spent 46 years working the fields, is wary about what lies ahead for Haitians. But after decades in these sugarcane communities, he is confident about their strength in adversity.

“They think we are alone,” says Valdez. “But we are not alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a39e476ec61044525d21fc777dc029be70f33c/310_0_2051_1641/master/2051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0fca2b953c08fe05399bcb6c76500212",N,,2025-09-07 07:56:30.035769

UK politics live: Asylum seekers to be moved from hotels to barracks as Starmer toughens immigration plans

A government source said “nothing is off the table” for the new home secretary Shabana Mahmood

The new home secretary is expected to unveil plans to move asylum seekers from hotels into military barracks as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to harden his immigration policy amid rising numbers of crossings in the Channel.

Shabana Mahmood is reportedly set to announce the use of Ministry of Defence sites to house people after a wave of protests outside migrant accommodation over the summer.

The defence secretary John Healey confirmed to Sky News that he has placed military planners into the Home Office to scout out military facilities, after an estimated 1,000 people arrived in the UK by small boat over the course of Saturday.

It comes after the prime minister continued his major reshuffle of his top team and junior ministers.

The prime minister sacked Rachel Reeves’s sister from the Cabinet and farming minister Daniel Zeichner, while Jason Stockwood, who had a senior role at dating site Match.com, has been appointed to the Department of Business and Trade.

It comes as his chief secretary Darren Jones denied that Labour were in crisis, and rebuffed Nigel Farage’s prediction that there would be a general election in 2027.

Starmer moved quickly to appoint David Lammy deputy prime minister while Yvette Cooper has been moved from home secretary to take up a new role as foreign secretary, with justice secretary Shabana Mahmood replacing her at the Home Office.

Reform UK’s head of policy has denied claims that migrants will be housed in shipping containers, insisting the party would use “purpose-built modular steel structures”.

Speaking on Sky News, Zia Yusuf defended proposals for rapid-build detention facilities, citing international examples.

“We can look around the world at where things have worked and worked well,” he said.

“President Trump stood up 3,000 detention beds in eight days. That was this year in the state of Florida – using steel modular structures.”

When presenter Trevor Phillips asked: “Shipping containers?”, Mr Yusuf replied: “They’re not shipping containers, they’re purpose-built modular steel structures.”

Defence secretary disputes claim that Angela Rayner was treated unfairly

John Healey said “any government is stronger with Angela Rayner” but she is “not a victim”.

He rejected suggestions by Labour Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham that she had been treated unfairly.

After being shown a clip of Mr Burnham’s remarks, he said: “I dispute that. Our focus has been on the public that elected us, the delivery that we’re charged to change their lives. It’s a big part of the job we all do.

“Our Government will miss Angela Rayner. She’s not been a victim. She’s been under a lot of pressure and Andy Burnham’s right about that.

“But she’s been an inspiration to many, particularly working-class women.

“She’s been a very effective minister leading the overhaul… of employment rights… and also starting planning reform that will lead to us building a lot more homes.

“Any government is stronger with Angela Rayner but we’ve got a good new team in place and that’s our job.”

Starmer shouldn’t punish winter fuel rebels, Andy Burnham says

Andy Burnham has called for the Labour deputy leadership contest to be used as a discussion about the management of the Labour Party.

The Greater Manchester mayor said “it is right to have a discussion about the internal management of the Labour Party”.

In a warning to Sir Keir Starmer, he said: “Labour MPs need to be they need to listen to them more and respect them more.

“They were the ones who caused the change in terms of winter fuel and disability benefits, but they shouldn't be punished for that.

“I see good people, good MPs, losing the whip, people like Rachel Maskell, that doesn't seem fair to me. It didn't happen in the governments I was in, in Gordon Brown's government or Tony Blair's government.”

Healey defends Labour's record in office after Rayner resignation

“Clear, swift, fair action” was taken over Angela Rayner’s tax affairs, John Healey said as he defended the Government’s record in office.

“It isn’t whether they happen, it’s how a prime minister and a government deals with them.

Angela Rayner resignation is a 'loss' for Labour government, Healey says

John Healey said Angela Rayner would be a “loss” to Government but did not say whether there would be any changes to Labour’s flagship workers’ rights Bill following her resignation.

Asked whether the sacking of employment rights minister Justin Madders and the departure of Ms Rayner meant the legislation would be watered down, the Defence Secretary said: “No, I think the plan to upgrade what will be the biggest upgrade in workers’ rights for a generation, led by Angela Rayner as one of the marks of how effective she’s been as minister and what a loss she’ll be to Government.”

Asked whether that meant people could expect no changes to the legislation, he said: “I’m really confident that we’ll deliver what we promised in the manifesto, the biggest upgrade of workers’ rights for a generation.

“The Bill’s been set out.”

He said the new team would take up the work already done by Ms Rayner and Mr Madders.

‘I have put military planners into the Home Office to scout accommodation sites,’ defence secretary says

The defence secretary has placed military planners into the Home Office to scout out military facilities to be used to house small boat migrants.

John Healey was asked about reports that the new home secretary Shabana Mahmood is planning to shut asylum hotels by housing migrants in army barracks.

He told Sky News: “With the home office, I have been putting military planners into their border command and into their planning for the future, and we are looking at the potential use of military and non military use sites for temporary accommodation for the people who come across these small boats that may not have a right to be here or need to be processed rapidly before we can decide whether or not they should stay or whether or not we deport them.”

‘Year one was fixing the mess… now we will rebuild and renew,’ Healey claims

John Healey has said Labour spent its first year in power “fixing the mess” left behind by the Conservatives.

And the defence secretary added that the coming years will now be focused on “renewing and rebuilding”.Following the prime minister’s reshuffle over the weekend, Mr Healey told Sky News: “What Keir Starmer has done is put a new team in place and said to us all, you've got to go up a gear.

“You've got to go up a gear to demonstrate that government can deliver for people.

Thursday’s operation was the biggest immigration raid ever carried out at a single site during the second Trump administration, which began in January.
After obtaining the personal information of the workers, the investigators reportedly issued temporary permits only to those whose legal status had been verified, allowing them to exit the premises, while others were transported to an immigration detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.
US immigration officials said that was the central issue in the raid.
Construction of the plant began in the second half of 2023, as most processes have now entered their final stages.","Concerns in Seoul over a massive immigration raid in Georgia that led to the detention of hundreds of Korean workers eased Sunday afternoon, after a senior presidential official announced that negotiations with Washington had concluded.

Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff to President Lee Jae Myung, said a chartered flight was being prepared to bring the workers home upon the completion of additional administrative procedures.

Though updates on exactly when the detainees would be released had not been made available as of press time, The Korea Herald has compiled key information about the Trump administration's largest single-site immigration crackdown to date, conducted at the electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture of Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Energy Solution.

Thursday’s operation was the biggest immigration raid ever carried out at a single site during the second Trump administration, which began in January.

After blocking major roads leading to the plant, some 500 investigators from different US government agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, reportedly raided the site, deploying helicopters and military vehicles.

The investigators detained all the construction workers at the site to verify whether they were legally residing in the United States.

After obtaining the personal information of the workers, the investigators reportedly issued temporary permits only to those whose legal status had been verified, allowing them to exit the premises, while others were transported to an immigration detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.

Arrested workers were mostly put on a bus with their hands bound by cable ties, while some had chains around both their legs and wrists.

According to US authorities, a total of 475 people were arrested in the operation.

LG Energy Solution confirmed Sunday that 47 of its employees — 46 Koreans and one Indonesian — were taken into custody. Almost 250 personnel working for the affiliated HL-GA Battery, mostly Koreans, were detained by US authorities.

Many of those reportedly entered the US using B1 visas — issued for business purposes, such as attending meetings or signing contracts — or through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization visa waiver program for short-term stays. US immigration officials said that was the central issue in the raid.

Foreign nationals must acquire an appropriate visa such as the H-1B, L1 or E2 to legally obtain employment at workplaces located in the US. But as those visas can take months to obtain and their numbers are capped, they are often deemed impractical for companies that need to dispatch workers frequently or on short notice. Industry officials also complain that wait times for all types of visas have lengthened since the start of the Trump administration.

According to Korean media reports, the US allocates annual H-1B visa quotas to certain countries with which it has free trade agreements, including Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Chile and Australia. Despite having a free trade agreement with the US, South Korea does not receive a quota.

In response to the concern, an official from Seoul’s Foreign Ministry, who requested anonymity, noted that H-1B visas are distributed through a lottery. The official said that the ministry has repeatedly urged the US government and Congress since 2012 to create a separate visa quota for Korean professionals, such as via the proposed Partner With Korea Act.

The most recent version of the bill, which would allow the establishment of a new E-4 visa for up to 15,000 Korean nationals per year to be employed in specialty occupations, was also initiated by Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Republican Rep. Young Kim — both of California — on July 23.

The E-4 visas would be valid for a maximum of two years and renewable indefinitely, according to the official. They are not to be linked to permanent residency eligibility.

Meanwhile, the ministry official explained that US authorities reviewed whether the activities of detained workers holding B-1 visas were consistent with the purpose of stay permitted under their visas.

The B-1 visa may be used by workers for purposes including staff training or the installation, operation or maintenance of machinery or equipment. But actual construction work is not permitted, and wages may not be paid by a US-based entity.

The Korean workers are being held at the Folkston ICE Processing Center in southern Georgia, where immigration authorities hold foreign nationals after arrest to review their immigration status and charges against them and to determine further action, including possible deportation.

The facility had been flagged for poor conditions after an inspection was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security in 2021.

According to the DHS report, “Violation of ICE Detention Standards at Folkston ICE Processing Center and Folkston Annex,” Folkston facilities were unsanitary and dilapidated, with torn mattresses, water leaks, mold growth and water damage, rundown showers, mold and debris in the ventilation system, insect infestations, inoperable toilets, the absence of hot meals and other violations.

The inspectors added that the facility’s medical staff did not provide timely access to specialized care or adequate mental health treatment for detainees.

The Office of Inspector General reportedly determined that ICE had accepted most of its recommended improvements.

But human rights organizations in the US have continued to raise concerns over conditions in the detention center after the death of an Indian national, who had been detained there in April 2024.

In 2023, Hyundai Motor Co. and LG Energy Solution agreed to establish a North American joint venture, HL-GA Battery Co., investing $4.3 billion to build a factory capable of producing about 30 gigawatt-hours of battery cells annually — enough to supply roughly 300,000 electric vehicles.

The factory is located at the Hyundai Motor Group Meta Plant America site in Georgia, a major hub for Korean industry in the US that hosts more than 100 Korean companies, including Samsung, Hyundai Motor and LG, symbolizing the Korea-US manufacturing alliance.

Construction of the plant began in the second half of 2023, as most processes have now entered their final stages.

However, construction has been fully suspended following Thursday's immigration crackdown.

Seoul said it was told by Washington that the operation was carried out under a court-issued warrant to crack down on illegal employment and prevent the exploitation of undocumented workers.

But the Foreign Ministry said Seoul maintains the position that law enforcement in the US should not unfairly undermine the business activities of Korean investors or the rights of Korean nationals.

Standing along sidewalks in front of a Jewel-Osco store at Main Street and Geneva Road, they held signs, rang bells, drummed and chanted.

“ICE out of Wheaton! We are all Wheaton,” cried Cristobal Cavazos of Casa DuPage Workers Center, rallying the crowd of mostly white, middle-aged and older people, which was the point. “He (President Donald Trump) did not take into account his base of older, white Americans would fight back.”

Similar protests were held in Chicago and some other suburbs Friday and Saturday, ahead of an expected surge in ICE operations this weekend.

Officials in Mundelein, Highland Park, North Chicago, Waukegan and other suburbs have issued statements emphasizing their law enforcement officers won’t participate in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities and that their communities are safe for all, including immigrants.

Organizers of the Wheaton protest chose the Jewel-Osco site because an immigrant man was arrested in the store’s parking lot Aug. 1.

Cavazos said the man was at the store to pick up relatives who were cleaning the store.

“We saw what ICE terrorism is doing to what the Bible says are ‘the least of these,’” said Cavazos, adding janitors, restaurant workers and other laborers are targeted.

Some marched to and from a nearby Home Depot store. Organizers said Home Depots nationwide cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Undocumented immigrants have been known to congregate in Home Depot lots, where people hire them for day jobs. Home Depot denies the claim.

Penny Ellsworth of Glen Ellyn was at the protest with friend Jana Cronin of Wheaton.

“Yes, I am an outlier,” said Cronin when asked if she was related to the Republican Cronins of DuPage County, which include a former county board chairman.

Ellsworth and Cronin said they didn’t protest much when they were younger. Ellsworth attended an anti-Vietnam War protest, and Cronin said she protested the Iraq War.

“Once Trump got reelected, that did it,” Ellsworth said. “We just cannot sit still.”

The women have taken to visiting courthouses and restaurants, car washes and other businesses where some immigrants, documented or otherwise, are likely to be. They hand out cards listing the rights people have if they are picked up by ICE.

Plenty of drivers honked their horns in support, including a man driving a Jewel-Osco semitrailer to the store. He also gave a thumbs-up.

Or national sales taxes could be set slightly higher for imports.","Unless the Supreme Court rules otherwise, President Trump will soon require approval from Congress to keep in place the broad-based tariffs he has imposed, altering the nation’s social contract and increasing economic inequality.

Trump and his Cabinet have boasted that tariffs, now averaging almost 20 percent, will bring in tens or even hundreds of billions annually in new revenue into federal coffers. Alongside this narrative, administration officials claim that the tariff revenue can replace income taxes to fund government operations and pay interest on the national debt.

But the U.S. Court of Appeals underscored just before Labor Day that tariffs are taxes — and that only Congress has the power to raise taxes.

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act upon which Trump hinges most of his tariffs does not authorize the president to impose tariffs or any other tax, the court ruled. Trump’s unconstitutional use of these emergency powers is particularly poignant because his tariffs, which are expected to raise as much as $3.3 trillion over 10 years, affect a major part of the U.S. economy.

For most of our country’s early history, tariffs served as the federal government’s primary source of revenue. Congress set tariffs, not the president; income and other taxes were later added to cover the cost of major wars and expanding government services. “In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,” according to the majority opinion, “Congress began to delegate to the Executive limited authority to ‘activate or suspend’ tariff rates through international agreements,” as the U.S. became more engaged in global affairs.

Today, in their 7-4 ruling, the judges join a growing number of economists and business analysts who conceptualize tariffs as sales taxes passed along to the citizenry in the form of higher prices. This year’s historic spike in tariffs — coupled with the tax cuts just made permanent by Congress — make the U.S. tax system more regressive by shifting the tax burden toward the lower-income end of the scale.

“Heavy reliance on sales and excise taxes makes tax systems more regressive,” the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy states in its annual Who Pays? report. “A progressive, graduated rate income tax makes overall tax systems less regressive or more progressive.”

Federal tax policy analysts measuring the effects of suddenly higher and fast-changing tariffs are in a whole new territory. But they can look to states’ experience in weighing the impact and fairness of a variety of taxes, including those on sales, income and property.

At the state level, a proposal to impose a 20 percent sales tax and flatter income tax, as Trump and Congress have essentially just done, would be decried as unfair, because the burden would fall disproportionately on people with lower incomes.

By affirming the appeals court decision, the Supreme Court could provide an off-ramp with political cover for Trump’s administration to back away from tariffs increasingly perceived as harmful to Trump’s working-class base — and bring back the Constitution’s intent that lawmakers control the power of the purse.

To control the national debt, for example, Congress could replace Trump’s jumbled high tariffs with a smaller national sales tax covering both foreign and domestic products. It could also impose a value added tax, as many other countries do. Or national sales taxes could be set slightly higher for imports.

The important thing is that Congress needs to act — and a ruling to that effect could be a win-win if it preserves the separation of powers and gives Trump an escape route from a misguided tariff scheme.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/656abe2a76ce44.73019614.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-07 08:57:12.116415

South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun on Saturday said President Lee has instructed officials to swiftly resolve the matter, stressing that the rights and interests of South Korean nationals and the business operations of South Korean companies investing in the US “must not be infringed upon”, South Korea’s official Yonhap news agency said in a report.

Cho said the government has set up a team to respond to the arrest of more than 300 Koreans at the facility, under construction in the southern state of Georgia, and that he may go to Washington, DC, to meet with officials if needed.

“We are deeply concerned and feel a heavy sense of responsibility over the arrests of our nationals,” Cho was quoted by Yonhap before an emergency meeting on Saturday to tackle the incident.

“We will discuss sending a senior Foreign Ministry official to the site without delay, and, if necessary, I will personally travel to Washington to hold consultations with the US administration,” he said.

The plant where the raid took place – part of US President Donald Trump’s escalating immigration crackdown – is intended to supply batteries for electric vehicles.

Responding to a reporter’s question about the immigration raid, Trump on Friday remarked during an event at the White House, “I would say that they were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job.”

Steven Schrank, an ICE official, justified the detentions, saying some of those detained had illegally crossed the US border, others arrived with visas that prohibited them from working, and some overstayed their work visas.

South Korea’s opposition People Power Party (PPP) reacted angrily to the detentions, warning they “could pose a serious risk” to the country.

“This is a grave matter that could lead to broader repercussions for Korean companies and communities across the United States,” PPP chairman Jang Dong-hyeok said in a statement.

As part of the original preliminary injunction, Border Patrol agents were required to provide the ACLU with documentation on their specific and individual reasonable suspicion for each warrantless stop.
How the Border Patrol justified arrests The ACLU also says that Border Patrol’s official documentation of the raid, required by the court order, is riddled with other factual errors and boilerplate language.
During discovery, Border Patrol gave the ACLU 11 such arrest reports for the Sacramento raid.
Border Patrol would not provide reports for individuals who were detained but then released, the motion states.","The ACLU and United Farm Workers have filed a motion alleging that the Border Patrol violated a court order intended to curb racial profiling and unlawful, warrantless arrests in the Central Valley.

They want the judge to require new training and forbid agents involved in a July raid in Sacramento from participating in other operations until they are retrained.

In April, a federal district court judge ruled that the Border Patrol likely violated the Constitution’s protections against unreasonable search and seizure during a January operation in Kern County called “Operation Return to Sender,” in which agents swarmed a Home Depot and Latino market, among other areas frequented by laborers. The judge ordered the Border Patrol, led by El Centro Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, to stop the raids in California’s Eastern District, which covers much of the state’s Central Valley, including Sacramento.

Bovino in June took his agents to Los Angeles, where they spent weeks aggressively pursuing Latino-looking workers outside of Home Depots, car washes, bus stops and other areas. The agents often wore masks and used unmarked vehicles.

After a federal district court judge temporarily barred agents from conducting raids in the Los Angeles area, Bovino briefly moved north to Sacramento in July, detaining Latino day laborers in a Home Depot parking lot.

In an interview near the parking lot with Fox News, Bovino indicated at the time that his operations were ramping up, not slowing down. “There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said.

“We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”

Bovino told Fox the raids were targeted and based on intel.

“Everything we do is targeted,” he said. “We did have prior intelligence that there were targets that we were interested in and around that Home Depot, as well as other targeted enforcement packages in and around the Sacramento area.”

In a motion filed last week, the ACLU and the United Farm Workers asked the federal district court to enforce the preliminary injunction issued in April that barred Border Patrol agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion and from making warrantless arrests without assessing flight risk.

If granted, the motion could potentially bar Bovino from planning or participating in new raids in the Eastern District. Bovino appears to be moving on regardless: He announced Tuesday on his social media account that the L.A. crackdown would be expanding to other cities across the country.

A Border Patrol spokesman did not return a request for comment about the ACLU and UFW’s motion.

If the plaintiffs in the Kern County case are successful in getting a judge to strengthen or enforce the original injunction, the case could have nationwide implications, providing a legal strategy that could be replicated in communities where agents are using similar tactics. In Los Angeles and Southern California, agents have continued high-profile raids and violent tactics, despite a similar but separate temporary restraining order in the Central District, barring similar activity there.

As part of the original preliminary injunction, Border Patrol agents were required to provide the ACLU with documentation on their specific and individual reasonable suspicion for each warrantless stop.

The plaintiffs allege agents fabricated and copied and pasted boilerplate language for those reports from the raid at the Home Depot in south Sacramento.

According to the filing, dozens of armed and masked agents from the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies corralled people in the parking lot in Sacramento, ordering them not to move while demanding to see their papers.

Witnesses described unmarked Chevy trucks, agents dressed “like soldiers,” and people being grabbed and handcuffed with no explanation. At least one U.S. citizen was chased and detained during the operation, but Border Patrol won’t release that arrest report to the ACLU because the agency said it was unrelated to an immigration violation, according to the court documents. The agency told the media that the man slashed one of their tires in the parking lot.

Student detained near Home Depot sweep

Agents also tackled and arrested an 18-year-old high school student who happened to be walking to a nearby Ross, according to the ACLU and UFW’s motion.

Selvin Osbeli Mejia Diaz, a senior at Valley High School, fled violence in Central America last year and came to the United States as an unaccompanied minor. He lives with his aunt in Sacramento and is complying with the orders in his immigration court case seeking asylum, according to the ACLU and UFW motion.

According to his declaration, he was walking to the store to buy a shirt when an unmarked Chevy pulled up behind him. A masked agent burst out from the vehicle, tackled him to the ground, and handcuffed him without asking any questions, according to Mejia Diaz’s declaration.

“Everything happened very fast, and I felt very afraid because I did not know who the man was,” Mejia Diaz wrote in his declaration. “He was much taller than me and he used a lot of force, and he immediately handcuffed me while I was on the ground … I think they saw me and figured they could arrest me because I looked Latino.”

Mejia Diaz was born in Guatemala and turned himself in to border agents in June 2024 after crossing the U.S. border. After the Home Depot raid, he was taken to a detention center in downtown Sacramento, where he had to sleep on a hard ceramic floor with an aluminum blanket. He said he was detained for several days before he was allowed to call his aunt for a couple of minutes.

He is still being detained in the Imperial Regional Detention Facility.

The Border Patrol’s arrest report for Mejia Diaz incorrectly states he was in the Home Depot parking lot, the ACLU alleges, which they say supports their assertion that agents are using “copy and pasted” language for each arrest report.

How the Border Patrol justified arrests

The ACLU also says that Border Patrol’s official documentation of the raid, required by the court order, is riddled with other factual errors and boilerplate language.

The forms, known as Form I-213s, are meant to document agents’ reasonable suspicions for each warrantless stop they make. During discovery, Border Patrol gave the ACLU 11 such arrest reports for the Sacramento raid. Three of them included “X” placeholders instead of specific information about locations or names or details for the arrests.

Nearly every report used identical language, claiming people “fled from agents” as a factor in the agents’ reasonable suspicion. Several witnesses told the ACLU some people did not run, according to the motion. The plaintiffs also argue that running from masked, armed men who do not identify themselves should not be enough for reasonable suspicion.

A handful of the reports justified the warrantless arrests by stating: “Sacramento, California has been identified as a city where many illegal aliens are known to stay, live and work without having any legal documentation in the United States.” Others noted that California is a sanctuary state.

“(Person) was located in California, which is a sanctuary state. Sanctuary states shield the identity of illegal aliens from immigration officials,” the arrest reports noted. The plaintiffs argue that someone being in a sanctuary state is not enough cause to give an agent reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally.

California’s sanctuary law curbs local law enforcement cooperation with immigration authorities and prevents the automatic transfer of people to federal immigration custody, except for people who have been convicted of serious or violent felonies.

Border Patrol would not provide reports for individuals who were detained but then released, the motion states. The ACLU is asking the judge to shorten the amount of time Border Patrol has to share the arrest reports from seven days to four days because many of the people detained in the Sacramento raid had already been deported by the time they got the arrest reports, according to their motion.

A hearing on the motion to enforce the injunction is set for October in Fresno.

The group said it had information proving plans to do so are quietly in the works.

The Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (FIRRP), an Arizona-based organization, added Honduran children to an already-existing lawsuit on Friday.

The original lawsuit led to a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of Guatemalan children last weekend.

In a statement, the FIRRP said it received reports that the U.S. government will have plans to “illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

This lawsuit comes after a chaotic Labor Day weekend, halting the U.S. government from . The children had come to the U.S. alone, living in shelters or with foster care families in the country.

Advocates representing migrant children across the country filed lawsuits to stop the government from removing them. On Sunday, a federal judge ordered that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

According to a filing by the Department of Justice on Saturday, the U.S. government initially identified 457 Guatemalan children for possible deportation. None of the 457 children could have a pending asylum screening or claim, as they had to have parents or legal in Guatemala and be at least 10 years of age.

This resulted in the removal of 91 children.

327 children were found eligible for deportation, including the 76 children who boarded the planes early Sunday. The government described this as a first phase, according to a statement by Angie Salazar, the acting director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

All 76 children on the plane were at least 14 years old, and “self-reported” to authorities, telling them that they had a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala but none in the U.S.

Children who cross the Southern Border without any parents or guardians are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Department of Health and Human Services.

The children typically reside in shelters across the country, which the resettlement office oversees, until they are eventually released to a sponsor. The sponsor is usually a relative.

Children began crossing the border in large numbers alone, without guardians or parents, in 2014. In the 2022 fiscal year, the number of children crossing the border alone peaked at 152,060, according to the Associated Press.

Lawyers representing the Justice Department said federal law allows the Department of Health and Human Services to “repatriate” or “reunite” children through taking the children out of the country.

The lawyers noted that if the child hasn’t been a victim of “severe” human trafficking, is not at risk if he or she is returned to their native country and does not face a “credible fear” of persecution there, they can be sent to their native country.

The child also cannot be “repatriated” if they have a pending asylum claim.

Friday’s FIRRP lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras. The children have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras. Some of the children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands the government allow the children to present their cases to an immigration judge, provide them with access to legal counsel and place them in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.",https://katu.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/center/90/d83b99b1-e5bb-4398-8480-9ec2628a0b5c-cgs_government_department_of_justice_logo_building_ic.png,N,,2025-09-07 01:56:38.295219

Though the holiday falls on Sept. 16, celebrations in Chicago span more than a week and draw hundreds of thousands of participants. Festivities kicked off with a Saturday parade through the heavily Mexican Pilsen neighborhood and will continue with car caravans and lively street parties.

But this year, the typically joyful period coincides with Trump’s threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he has targeted for expanded federal enforcement.

His administration has said it will step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, as it did in Los Angeles, and would deploy National Guard troops. In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump deployed them last month in Washington, D.C., as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital.

Trump posted an illustration of himself against a Chicago-skyline ablaze with flames and helicopters on Truth Social on Saturday.

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” he posted, along with “I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” referencing a 1979 war film. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to be renamed the Department of War.

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on the social platform X. “Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Although details about the promised Chicago operation have been sparse, there’s already widespread opposition as protesters marched through downtown on Saturday evening. State and city leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.

Mixed feelings about postponing festivities

The extended Mexican Independence Day celebrations reflect the size and vitality of Chicago’s Mexican American community. Mexicans make up more than one-fifth of the city’s total population and about 74% of its Latino residents, according to 2022 U.S. Census estimates.

Parade and festival organizers have been divided over whether to move forward with precautions or postpone, in hopes that it will feel safer for many participants to have a true celebration in several months’ time. El Grito Chicago, a downtown Mexican Independence Day festival set for next weekend, was postponed this week by organizers in order to protect people.

“But also we just refuse to let our festival be a pawn in this political game,” said Germán González, an organizer of El Grito Chicago.

In Pilsen and Little Village, two of the city’s best-known neighborhoods with restaurants, businesses and cultural ties to Mexican culture, residents expressed disappointment that the potential federal intervention instilled such fear and anxiety in the community at a time usually characterized by joy, togetherness and celebration of Mexican American heritage.

Celebrating, but with precautions

On Saturday morning, some parade-goers grabbed free, bright-orange whistles and flyers from volunteers standing outside the Lozano Branch of the Chicago Public Library. “Blow the whistle on ICE!” the flyers read, encouraging a nonviolent tactic to raise alarm if they saw agents.

Marchers held up cardboard signs painted with monarch butterflies, the migratory species that travels between the U.S. and Mexico. Many cheered “Viva Mexico!”

Drivers of vintage cars honked their horns and a drummer kept time for a group of dancers bedecked in feathers. Horseback riders clip-clopped down the street, and one lifted up a large Mexican flag.

Claudia Alvarez, whose 10-year-old daughter was nearby riding a pony, said it’s important that politicians see people out celebrating, though the crowd seemed smaller this year.

“At these hours you should be able to see plenty of people in the streets enjoying themselves, but now there’s not really a lot of people,” she said.

Fabio Fernandez, 39, owner of an art and T-shirt company with a residency at a Pilsen streetwear shop, called it “troubling” and “disheartening” that the possibility of federal intervention has impacted celebrations.

He said there’s a mood of anxiety in the neighborhood, which has translated to lower sales and reduced foot traffic for local businesses like his, Fernandez said.

“Come back to 18th Street. Support small businesses here. They’re still working hard as hell to keep their businesses alive,” he said.

Alejandro Vences, 30, became a U.S. citizen this year, “which gives me some comfort during this time,” he said while eating pozole verde at a local Mexican restaurant. Still, he said, the anxiety is palpable.

“For us, our Independence Day has always been a celebration of our culture,” he said. “It’s always been a celebration of who we are. It feels like we don’t get to celebrate our culture in the same way.”

Protest against ICE

A few miles away in downtown, more than a thousand protesters marched through the streets on Saturday evening with signs bearing slogans like “I.C.E. out of Illinois, I.C.E. out of everywhere.”

Speakers offered the crowd instructions on what to do if encountering Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. They also drew comparisons between the proposed ICE crackdown on Chicago and Israel’s presence in Gaza.

“We are inspired by the steadfastness of Palestinians in Gaza, and it is why we refuse to cower to Trump and his threats,” Nazek Sankari, co-chair of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, said to the crowd as many waved Palestinian flags and donned keffiyehs.

Viviana Barajas, leader with the community organization Palenque LSNA, promised that Chicagoans would “stand up” as Los Angeles had if Trump deploys the National Guard in their city.

“If he thinks these frivolous theatrics to undermine our sovereignty will shut out the passion we have for protecting our people, this is Chicago, and he is sorely mistaken,” Barajas said. “We have been studying LA and D.C., and they have stood up for their cities.”

In addition to Sanchez-Carrillo’s term of imprisonment, upon his release, he will be remanded to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation proceedings. The court also ordered the forfeiture of $7,750 in U.S. currency; a Smith and Wesson 9mm handgun; and associated ammunition.

According to court documents and admissions made at Sanchez-Carrillo’s change of plea and sentencing hearings, an investigation into the defendant began in March 2025 when a confidential informant purchased methamphetamine from Sanchez-Carrillo. On April 3, 2025, law enforcement executed search warrants on Sanchez-Carrillo’s apartment and his vehicle. During the search of his apartment, law enforcement recovered, 1,249 grams of fentanyl, 571 grams of heroin, 11,099 grams of methamphetamine, and 15 grams of cocaine, along with a Smith and Wesson 9mm handgun, and $7,750 in United States currency. Sanchez-Carrillo admitted that he knowingly possessed and intended to distribute the narcotics for profit and that he knew he was restricted from possessing the firearm, which affected interstate commerce because he was in the United States illegally.

Additionally, court documents reveal that Sanchez-Carrillo admitted that he entered the United States on or after December 14, 2023, and eluded examination and inspection by immigration officers until his apprehension on April 3, 2025. Sanchez-Carrillo also admitted that after being in the United States illegally for 30 days or longer, he deliberately failed to apply for registration. Court documents reveal that Sanchez-Carrillo had not applied for registration at the time he was found by immigration officers in Salt Lake County, Utah, and remains unregistered.

“Pumping poison in the form of illegal narcotics into our communities will not be taken lightly, said Acting U.S. Attorney Felice John Viti of the District of Utah. “Sanchez-Carrillo’s sentence sends a clear message to the defendant and others willing to break federal laws, that if you choose to engage in drug trafficking, illegally possess a firearm in the United States or unlawfully enter the United States you will face serious criminal consequences.”

“Individuals like Sanchez-Carrillo seek to profit while our communities are left to bear the cost of addiction, violence, and death,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert Bohls of the Salt Lake City FBI. “The FBI will relentlessly pursue and investigate drug traffickers who threaten public safety.”

“The sentencing of Sanchez-Carrillo sends a clear message to anyone involved in bringing drugs into our community: you will be caught, prosecuted, and held accountable,” said Lester R.

TRANSCRIPT

“From day one I will seal the borders, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens the hell back home.”

That's Donald Trump, speaking in the lead-up to the 2024 US election as part of a campaign characterised by regular rhetoric on immigration.

Since Trump's return to the White House, the news has been dominated by regular examples of the President making good on his promises to organise mass deportations.

But there have been widespread objections, with regular street protests and even supporters turning up where ICE teams are, trying to prevent arrests.

Yet ICE raids, deportations, and protests against them are not a new phenomenon.

While the Republican party has become known in recent years for its hardline policy stance, the beloved GOP President Ronald Reagan - in the eyes of some - never made immigration a central focus of his government.

He called for America to welcome those from overseas, eventually signing a bill that saw 2.7 million undocumented people granted permanent residence.

“This bill - the Immigration and Reform Control Act that I will sign in a moment - is the most comprehensive reform of our immigration system since 1952.”

By contrast, Democratic presidents have frequently talked tough on immigration, like Bill Clinton in his 1995 State of the Union address.

“All Americans are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country.”

Another Democratic President, Barack Obama, became known for deporting an estimated 2.5 million from the US, more than any other previous administration.

As a result, in 2014 National Council of La Raza President Janet Murguía called him the 'deporter in chief', and ads were run ahead of his second election campaign like this one from Nevada conservative group, American Principles in Action.

""Don't be fooled by President Obama's words. He's not committed to immigrants. He only wants our vote.”

But some have argued there's a key difference between these previous governments and the Trump administration.

In 2024, Trump had promised to focus on what he called ""dangerous criminals"", a position he still maintains.

“We were inundated by millions of people, many millions of during the Biden administration. They say 21 million. And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers.”

Studies and reports suggest former Presidents also focussed on those convicted of crimes - and people recently caught crossing the border without authorisation.

But government figures released this year suggest a much wider net is now being cast by the present White House.

The figures indicate most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions - and are sometimes taken into custody as they have their regular check-ins with officials, part of the legal pathway to residency and citizenship.

Top White House official Stephen Miller has driven much of this activity, setting a quota for at least 3,000 arrests per day and telling ICE leadership they should target anyone without legal status.

“On a day to day basis, you're going to see exponentially larger numbers of illegal aliens being arrested and removed from the interior.”

Such moves have prompted concern that the pendulum has swung from legitimate immigration policy initiatives to politically-motivated responses, underpinned by long-held biases against immigrants.

Democratic Representative for the District of Columbia, Eleanor Holmes Norton, is among those to suggest Trump's recent order for National Guard troops and ICE agents to deploy to Washington DC is proof of his partisan motives and bias.

“No emergency exists in DC that the president did not create himself.”

But the US is not alone in taking a hardline approach to immigration policy.

Such stances have also grown in popularity in Europe as the continent grapples with the movement of millions fleeing war and poverty in their home countries.

Germany is one of the nations with the highest numbers of illegal entrants - but Greece and Italy are also among those countries on the front line, especially for boat arrivals.

Spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, Shabia Mantoo, had this to say in 2022.

“We do know that people are becoming increasingly desperate when there's an absence of pathways to safety, that they will continue to be exploited by unscrupulous smugglers and unfortunately will be risking their lives in these journeys.”

Eventually, in 2024, European M-Ps endorsed a new Pact on Migration and Asylum that required all E-U members to take some form of responsibilty for managing asylum applications.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen [[lion]] said it was the right way to go.

“Today we have voted in favour of a package that provides for a robust legislative framework that is the same in all member states, that puts humanity first, that understands all the different, difficult aspects of this issue.”

But it appears to have done little to appease the ongoing underlying tensions.

While human rights groups and some MPs believe it's too much, some conservative politicians want the rules to be even tougher - like Greece's far right group Voice of Reason leader,

""You have filled our countries with illegal migrants with the blessing of Germany and France. We pay Islam that hates us out of our savings to turn our cities into ghettoes, to rape and to murder before our eyes in the name of Allah. We are filled with Mohammed and Mahmoud in a Europe that has become unrecognisable.”

These tensions have played out in communities all over Europe, like Altena in Germany.

The town in the Lenne river valley made national headlines in 2015 when it volunteered to take in 100 more migrants than required as part of Germany's response to an influx of more than a million migrants into the country.

It was seen as a model of Chancellor Angela Merkel's pledge.

""Wir schaffen das ((We can do this)).”

Yet while Altena saw an opportunity to reverse years of population and economic decline, cracks started to show early on.

Shortly after the first arrivals in 2015, a local firefighter set a building housing refugees ablaze, and two years later, mayor Andreas Hollstein survived a knife attack by a man who said he'd been ignored and marginalised while hundreds of immigrants had been helped.

Hollstein says those were isolated incidents.

""We were in complete agreement as politicians. All the parties represented on the Altena city council were in agreement and still are today.”

Some of those who made their way to the town say they were warmly welcomed - and still are.

That includes former Syrian refugee Humam Algburi.

""This program was a success. The way they handled people, what they did. They also listened to us. Sometimes I had problems and I went to the city administration of Altena, A lady was there, who spoke Arabic. I explained the situation and then it was resolved. It was very, very good.”

But with more migrants arriving every year, the mood among some residents has started to noticeably sour - and today, some complain that the number of refugees and asylum seekers is getting too high.

So says Altena citizen Elke Randelhoff. ""Of course, there were many families who said yes, as Mrs. Merkel said, this culture of welcome, of taking someone in, inviting them to lunch, to a get-together, all of that happened. But among the majority of the population, acceptance was not so high, and it became less and less. Yes, unfortunately.”

These misgivings - alongside frustrations about rising living costs and strained public finances - have led to a rise in support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, not just in Altena but across the country.

In Poland, border measures to control so-called illegal immigration was a central issue in June's presidential election where nationalist conservative Karol Nawrocki - who wants the country to follow a path inspired by Trump - narrowly won.

""My program is: no to illegal migration; yes to the Polish złoty, no to the euro.”

Migration issues have also been at the forefront of politics in the UK, where promises to limit those coming in have been made on a regular basis - by different governments of different political persuasions.

The UK currently faces a record number of asylum claims and arrivals by migrants in small boats across the Channel, including more than 28,000 this year, and in recent weeks there have been sometimes ugly scenes at anti-immigration protests, as tensions boil over.

Some of the protesters have objected to the presence of asylum seekers who have been housed in UK hostels as they wait to have their cases determined.

UNNAMED MALE PROTESTER: ""They're really close to tipping point, this country. So many of us are struggling to pay for everything and working so they can lounge about in hotels.""

UNNAMED FEMALE PROTESTER: ""Honestly, get them one. It's not safe when they're here.”

Counter protesters say the migrants are being wrongly targeted.

COUNTER PROTESTER: ""It's just unfair the way that these people are being scapegoated. I understand the unrest, and there is a conversation to be had about how these are getting here, but it's not their fault.”

The public discontent has handed Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage's populist Reform UK party a consistent lead in opinion polls.

He has argued that illegal immigrants have more rights than local people - prompting the British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to go even further and harder.

“Well, look, I understand why people want the hotels closed. I want them closed and I will work across the board to close them as quickly as possible. That is my aspiration.”

The Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, has criticised such responses - and the plans of Nigel Farage's party for mass deportation of asylum seekers.

He says more appropriate and long term solutions are required.

“You haven't solved the problem. You've just put it somewhere else and you've done nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country... We should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short-term, knee-jerk - you know, send them in this case, send them home.”

European Central Bank President Christine Legarde says the irony is that migrants have significantly boosted Europe's economy, in large part by filling labour shortages in an ageing population, and contributing to lower inflation.

The US example seems to be providing plenty of evidence in support of that position.

Immigrants make up almost 20 percent of the US workforce, and Dallas-based Federal Reserve Bank labor economist, Pia Orrenius, says immigrants normally contribute at least 50 percent of job growth in the U.S.

Yet a range of studies are suggesting such growth has slowed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics in August sharply revising down employment growth for May and June to the tune of 258,000 fewer jobs created.

The revision infuriated Trump, who sacked the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, accusing her - without evidence - of fudging the data.

“We'll be announcing a new statistician some time over the next three of four days. We had no confidence - I mean, the numbers were ridiculous which she announced. But that was just one negative number.”

Similar results however are emerging from different sources.

Preliminary analysis of Census data from the Pew Research Center has suggested more than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July.

That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

All of this is showing up in key industries like construction.

An Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data has found the number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas.

The association's chief economist Ken Simonson says there are many reasons for construction employment stalling and retreating - but that contractors would still hire more people if they could find them.

Arkansas-based general contractor supervisor Robby Robertson says it's not a job most people want to do.

“It's very hard these days to get people to do construction. It's extremely hard. And they are willing to do it, the Hispanic descent. They basically are stepping up and will do some of the hard work.”

The trouble is, Robby Robertson says, about half of his workers - scared by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on a job site in Florida 230 miles [[370 kilometres]] away - have left, and stayed gone.

“This particular job here is a huge job for the community. Well, the community is gonna miss out if we can't get it finished. And those raids happened a good bit away from here. There's a lot of closer jobs than this one. So I know they're all being affected as well.”

Immigrants make up almost 45 percent of the workforce in farming, fishing and forestry, too - and similar scenarios are playing out on farms across the country.

In McAllen, Texas, just across the border from Mexico, Elizabeth Rodriguez from the National Farmworker Ministry says there won't be enough workers to harvest the corn and cotton fields that are ready for picking.

She says the impact is going to affect the whole food chain - from field workers to truck drivers to people working in packing houses and in sales.

Farmer Greg Tesch says they're seeing that in Ventura County in California too.

“If things are ripe such as - our neighbours have bell peppers here. If they dont harvest within two or three days, and the crop is sunburnt or over mature or breaking a different colour or the market changes - so with the vegetable crops it's very critical. With the fruit crops it's critical but slightly less critical. But still we need the labour and we need the labour, or else we'll miss things. We'll fall behind.”

Greg Tesch says the quantity and timing of ICE raids are unsettling a lot of people.

“Nobody feels safe when they hear the word ICE - even the documented people. We know the neighbourhood is full of a combination of those with and without documents. And there's always a rumour. Even - a rumour can start and it will keep people home. So it affects everything that we do.”

But federal authorities remain undeterred, as White House Border czar Tom Homan has made clear.

“Yell and scream all you want. You're not going to stop ICE from doing our job.”",https://images.sbs.com.au/dims4/default/c9b4e89/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1013+0+94/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2Fa5%2F3b4d4af64d7093b7713a3dc70d50%2Fa-man-is-detained-by-ice-agents-after-leaving-a-court-hearing-in-new-york-aap.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 00:56:31.089318

The protest began at 5 p.m. at the intersection of Ida B Wells Drive and Michigan Avenue near Grant Park.

“We cannot accept the divide and conquer rhetoric that calls our neighbors criminals, calls our siblings illegals,” Kobi Guillory, CAARPR Activist, said.

Thousands flocked to the area to condemn what they call a dangerous agenda by the Trump administration targeting immigrant communities under the false pretext of crime reduction.

“Terrorizing our communities by sticking the National Guard against its own people,” said Viviana Barajas of Palenque LSNA.

With reports of a potential federal intervention, safety marshals stayed alert along the march route.

Prior to the protest, President Donald Trump shared a photo on Truth Social on Saturday morning, hinting at the potential raids.

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning..'” the president’s image post read. “Chicago about to find out why it’s called the department of war.”

In the photo, which appears to have been generated using artificial intelligence, the president can be seen sitting on a beach in Vietnam era military fatigues, with the Chicago skyline behind him as a fire burns to his left and a collection of military helicopters fly nearby.

Additionally, the image has the words “Chipocalypse Now” written on it.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson took to social media to respond to the president’s threat. He wrote:

“The President’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution. We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Demonstrators say the image was another attempt to incite fear, vowing to continue their fight for immigrant rights and against the targeting of their communities.

“Every single immigrant is a human. Every single immigrant has every single right to have their families stay together,” Francisco “Paco” Amador, Pastor of New Life Community Church Little Village, said.

DHS and its US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arm are calling the operation Patriot 2.0, modifying the name of a May deportation surge that led to the arrest of 1,500 people in the state, according to the reports.

A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The operation is expected to last several weeks, the New York Times said, quoting unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter. One of the sources told the Times that Patriot 2.0 was focused on targeting immigrants who had been released from custody despite Ice agents attempting to pick them up from local jails.

It was not immediately clear how many federal officers were involved in the crackdown, which comes as Chicago braces for a Trump administration ramp-up of deportations in the third-largest US city.

NBC10 Boston quoted a statement from a DHS spokesperson as deriding the Boston mayor Michelle Wu’s so-called sanctuary policies.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,” the statement reported by NBC10 said.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration have been steadily building since March when Wu testified before Congress alongside three other Democratic mayors to defend their cities’ immigration policies – specifically so-called sanctuary city laws that limit state and local law enforcement cooperation with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Critics of these policies claim that sanctuary laws undermine federal law enforcement’s ability to arrest and deport individuals with criminal records.

As part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration, it has pushed for mass deportations and targeted “sanctuary cities” in particular.

Wu has defended her city’s policies in a letter to US attorney general Pam Bondi: “The City of Boston is the safest major city in America,” she wrote. “Our progress is the result of decades of community policing and partnership between local law enforcement and community leaders, who share a commitment to making Boston a safe and welcoming home for everyone.”

In response, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons, said that the agency intended to “flood the zone, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions”.

As the threat of federal actions looms, Wu said last week that her administration was actively preparing for the possibility of a federal national guard deployment.

Wu also said her administration was reviewing relevant legal precedents and working “very closely” with community members “to ensure people know what’s happening and that this is not something that is needed or wanted or legally sound”.

Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line.
The sprawling manufacturing site The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.
Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.","Hundreds of federal agents descended on a sprawling site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in Georgia and detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals.

This is the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site state officials have long called Georgia’s largest economic development project.

The detainment of South Korean nationals also sets it apart, as they are rarely caught up in immigration enforcement compared to other nationalities.

Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist. Others had plastic ties around their wrists as they boarded a Georgia inmate-transfer bus.

Here are some things to know about the raid and the people impacted:

The workers detained

South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.

Some of them worked for the battery plant operated by HL-GA Battery Co., a joint venture by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution that is slated to open next year, while others were employed by contractors and subcontractors at the construction site, according to Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations.

He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.

But an immigration attorney representing two of the detained workers said his clients arrived from South Korea under a visa waiver program that enables them to travel for tourism or business for stays of 90 days or less without obtaining a visa.

Attorney Charles Kuck said one of his clients has been in the U.S. for a couple of weeks, while the other has been in the country for about 45 days, adding that they had been planning to return home soon.

The detainees also included a lawful permanent resident who was kept in custody for having a prior record involving firearm and drug offenses, since committing a crime of “moral turpitude” can put their status in jeopardy, Lindsay Williams, a public affairs officer for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said Saturday.

Williams denied reports that U.S. citizens had been detained at the site since “once citizens have identified themselves, we have no authority.”

Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement Friday that none of its employees had been detained as far as it knew and that it is reviewing its practices to make sure suppliers and subcontractors follow U.S. employment laws. LG told The Associated Press that it couldn’t immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.

The South Korean government expressed “concern and regret” over the operation targeting its citizens and is sending diplomats to the site.

“The business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed in the process of U.S. law enforcement,” South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jaewoong said in a televised statement from Seoul.

Most of the people detained have been taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None of them have been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said, but the investigation is ongoing.

Family members and friends of the detainees were having a hard time locating them or figuring out how to get in touch with them, James Woo, communications director for the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said Saturday in an email.

Woo added that many of the families were in South Korea because many of the detainees were in the United States only for business purposes.

Raid is the result of a monthslong investigation

The raid was the result of a monthslong investigation into allegations of illegal hiring at the site, Schrank said.

In a search warrant and related affidavits, agents sought everything from employment records for current and former workers and timecards to video and photos of workers.

Court records filed this week indicated that prosecutors do not know who hired what it called “hundreds of illegal aliens.” The identity of the “actual company or contractor hiring the illegal aliens is currently unknown,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote in a Thursday court filing.

The sprawling manufacturing site

The raid targeted a manufacturing site widely considered one of Georgia’s largest and most high profile.

Hyundai Motor Group started manufacturing EVs at the $7.6 billion plant a year ago. Today, the site employs about 1,200 people in a largely rural area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Savannah.

Agents specifically honed in on an adjacent plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power EVs.

The Hyundai site is in Bryan County, which saw its population increase by more than a quarter in the early 2020s and stood at almost 47,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year data is available. The county’s Asian population went from 1.5% in 2018 to 2.2% in 2023, and the growth was primarily among people of Indian descent, according to Census Bureau figures.

Raid was the ‘largest single site enforcement operation’

From farms and construction sites to restaurants and auto repair shops, there have been a wide array of workplace raids undertaken in this administration. But most have been smaller, including a raid the same day as the Georgia one in which federal officers took away dozens of workers from a snack-bar manufacturer in Cato, New York.

Other recent high-profile raids have included one in July targeting a legal marijuana farm northwest of Los Angeles. More than 360 people were arrested in one of the largest raids since Trump took office in January. Another one took place at an Omaha. Nebraska, meat production plant and involved dozens of workers being taken away.

Schrank described the one in Georgia as the “largest single site enforcement operation” in the agency’s two-decade history.

The majority of the people detained are Koreans. During the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2024, only 46 Koreans were deported during out of more than 270,000 removals for all nationalities, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Community members and advocates have mixed reactions

Kemp and other Georgia Republican officials, who had courted Hyundai and celebrated the EV plant’s opening, issued statements Friday saying all employers in the state were expected to follow the law.

The nonprofit legal advocacy organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta described the raid in a joint statement as “unacceptable.”

“Our communities know the workers targeted at Hyundai are everyday people who are trying to feed their families, build stronger communities, and work toward a better future,” the statement said.

Sammie Rentz opened the Viet Huong Supermarket less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Hyundai site six months ago and said he worries business may not bounce back after falling off sharply since the raid.

“I’m concerned. Koreans are very proud people, and I bet they’re not appreciating what just happened. I’m worried about them cutting and running, or starting an exit strategy,” he said.

Ellabell resident Tanya Cox, who lives less than a mile from the Hyundai site, said she had no ill feelings toward Korean nationals or other immigrant workers at the site. But few neighbors were employed there, and she felt like more construction jobs at the battery plant should have gone to local residents.

“I don’t see how it’s brought a lot of jobs to our community or nearby communities,” Cox said.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also responded to Trump's post, writing on X, “The president’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break out constitution.”

As for the Naval Base, the mayor of North Chicago told NBC Chicago federal agents will use office spaces there for their operations and will stay in hotels in Lake County.

NBC10 Boston has reached out to Gov.","A federal official says that ICE has begun a new operation in Massachusetts targeting criminal immigrants in the country without documentation.

ICE, as the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is known, is conducting a follow-up to a surge in May it's called Operation Patriot 2.0, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which ICE is a part of, told NBC10 Boston on Saturday.

The May operation, Operation Patriot, resulted in nearly 1,500 people being arrested, officials said at the time.

In the new statement, the DHS spokesperson, who didn't give their name, referred to the initial operation as a success, and derided the so-called sanctuary policy of Boston and its mayor, Michelle Wu, as privileging criminals over U.S. citizens.

""Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens. ICE is arresting sex offenders, pedophiles, murderers, drug dealers, and gang members released by local authorities,"" the statement said.

Wu has reiterated that its policies on immigrants -- limiting local officials' cooperation with deportation enforcement -- have made it among the country's safest cities, including in her response to a federal lawsuit filed this week over Boston's ""sanctuary"" law, the Boston Trust Act.

Wu released a statement to NBC10 Boston on Saturday night addressing the latest operation in the area, saying, ""For months, the Trump DOJ, DHS, and ICE have been spreading blatant lies and threatening to 'bring hell' to cities like Boston who refuse to bow down to their authoritarian agenda, so this unconstitutional attack is not a surprise.""

""This country was born facing down bullies, with Bostonians leading the way,"" Wu continued. ""Today Boston is the safest major city in the country because we have worked to build trust in the community, so that everyone feels safe seeking help or reporting a crime. We will not be bullied or intimidated into abandoning the efforts that make Boston a safe home for everyone.”

It wasn't immediately clear how many federal agents were taking part in Operation Patriot 2.0, or what Massachusetts communities the operation was being conducted in. The New York Times, citing sources, reported that the operation was expected to last several weeks; the DHS spokesperson's statement didn't address how long Patriot 2.0 would take.

ICE agents were seen in the town of Clinton on Friday morning.

According to a filing by the Department of Justice on Saturday, the U.S. government initially identified 457 Guatemalan children for possible deportation.","A legal aid group sued the U.S. government preemptively to block it from deporting a dozen Honduran children. The group said it had information proving plans to do so are quietly in the works.

The Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (FIRRP), an Arizona-based organization, added Honduran children to an already-existing lawsuit on Friday.

The original lawsuit led to a judge temporarily blocking the deportation of Guatemalan children last weekend.

In a statement, the FIRRP said it received reports that the U.S. government will have plans to “illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.”

This lawsuit comes after a chaotic Labor Day weekend, halting the U.S. government from . The children had come to the U.S. alone, living in shelters or with foster care families in the country.

Advocates representing migrant children across the country filed lawsuits to stop the government from removing them. On Sunday, a federal judge ordered that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

According to a filing by the Department of Justice on Saturday, the U.S. government initially identified 457 Guatemalan children for possible deportation. None of the 457 children could have a pending asylum screening or claim, as they had to have parents or legal in Guatemala and be at least 10 years of age.

This resulted in the removal of 91 children.

327 children were found eligible for deportation, including the 76 children who boarded the planes early Sunday. The government described this as a first phase, according to a statement by Angie Salazar, the acting director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

All 76 children on the plane were at least 14 years old, and “self-reported” to authorities, telling them that they had a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala but none in the U.S.

Children who cross the Southern Border without any parents or guardians are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement under the Department of Health and Human Services.

The children typically reside in shelters across the country, which the resettlement office oversees, until they are eventually released to a sponsor. The sponsor is usually a relative.

Children began crossing the border in large numbers alone, without guardians or parents, in 2014. In the 2022 fiscal year, the number of children crossing the border alone peaked at 152,060, according to the Associated Press.

Lawyers representing the Justice Department said federal law allows the Department of Health and Human Services to “repatriate” or “reunite” children through taking the children out of the country.

The lawyers noted that if the child hasn’t been a victim of “severe” human trafficking, is not at risk if he or she is returned to their native country and does not face a “credible fear” of persecution there, they can be sent to their native country.

The child also cannot be “repatriated” if they have a pending asylum claim.

Friday’s FIRRP lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras. The children have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras. Some of the children have parents who are already in the United States.

The lawsuit demands the government allow the children to present their cases to an immigration judge, provide them with access to legal counsel and place them in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.",https://komonews.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/center/90/d83b99b1-e5bb-4398-8480-9ec2628a0b5c-cgs_government_department_of_justice_logo_building_ic.png,N,,2025-09-06 22:56:53.039850

Immigration courts, which fall under the Justice Department rather than the judiciary, must now follow the board’s decision.
The policy, introduced in July, is being challenged in federal court.
Several lawsuits argue that prolonged detention without bond violates federal law and constitutional protections.","An immigration appellate board on Friday upheld a Trump administration policy that denies bond hearings to immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization, expanding mandatory detention to thousands already in custody and potentially millions more nationwide.

The policy is being challenged in federal court, but the Board of Immigration Appeals’ ruling is expected to quickly curb judges’ long practice of granting bond to immigrants not deemed flight risks or dangers.

The Los Angeles Times reported the ruling bars immigration judges from granting bond, requiring detainees to remain in custody through removal proceedings that can last years. Immigration courts, which fall under the Justice Department rather than the judiciary, must now follow the board’s decision.

The policy, introduced in July, is being challenged in federal court. Several lawsuits argue that prolonged detention without bond violates federal law and constitutional protections. A class-action case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

Supporters of the policy say it strengthens enforcement by preventing detainees from being released while their cases proceed. Critics, including immigrant rights attorneys, argue that the approach could increase detention significantly, strain detention facilities, and pressure individuals to abandon their cases.

The ruling stems from the case of a Venezuelan national who entered the United States near El Paso, Texas, in 2022 and was later granted Temporary Protected Status, which was terminated in April 2023 following an administration decision that remains under litigation. The board concluded that people who are illegally inside the U.S. must be detained through the entirety of their immigration proceedings.

The new determination effectively places long-term residents who entered the country illegally in the same category as those who more recently made an illegal border crossing. All are now subject to mandatory detention without the option of bond.

Trump administration targets immigrants

Immigrants lacking permanent legal status are not eligible to enroll in comprehensive Medicaid coverage. However, states bill the federal government for emergency and pregnancy care provided to anyone.

Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., expanded their Medicaid programs with their own funds to cover low-income children without legal status. Seven of those states, plus Washington, D.C., have also provided full-scope coverage to some adult immigrants living in the country illegally.

States under review say they are following the law.

“Spending money on a congressionally authorized medical benefit program that helps people get emergency treatments for cancer, dialysis and anti-rejection medications for organ transplants is decidedly not waste, fraud and abuse,” said Mike Faulk, deputy communications director for Washington state Attorney General Nick Brown.

In the process, 475 people, including 300 Koreans, were reportedly arrested. Most of the South Koreans arrested are currently in a detention facility in Folkston, Georgia.

2021 Audit Office Points Out Leaks, Fungi, Worms, etc

The name of the detention facility is Processing Center. It is a place where ICE investigates the residence status and charges of arrested foreigners and detain them until they decide on a processing policy, including deportation.

In the past, the Folkston facility was pointed out for its poor environment during a random inspection by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) audit office.

According to the report released by the audit office in June 2022, the audit office identified a number of ""violations that undermine the health, safety and rights of prisoners"" in the inspection conducted from November 16-18, 2021.

The audit office pointed to ""torn mattresses, leaks, stagnant water, mold, old showers, mold and debris in ventilation systems, pervasive bugs, hot water-deficient showers, inoperable toilets, broken thermometers in kitchen freezers, and absence of warm meals.""

The audit office said, ""The medical staff at the facility did not provide special treatment or adequate mental health treatment for the inmate in a timely manner. Folkston did not respond in a timely or complete manner to the grievances or requests of the inmate,"" it said.

He also pointed out that he improperly handcuffed the inmate and did not properly manage the inmate's possessions.

Since then, the audit office has determined that ICE has mostly accepted the audit office's recommendations for improvement. As a result, the living environment of the facility seems to have improved to some extent, but local human rights organizations have raised concerns since then.

In 2024, there will be deaths of inmates

In April 2024, some pointed out that Jaspal Singh, an Indian national who was arrested while attempting to enter the country illegally, died after being imprisoned in Folkston, and that medical response may have been insufficient.

In a statement the day before, the Atlanta, Georgia-based human rights group Asian Americans for Justice (AAAJ) criticized ICE's crackdown on the construction site of the Hyundai Motor-LG Ensol plant, pointing out ""inhumane conditions and violations"" at the Folkston detention center.

The Folkestone Detention Center is owned and managed by private company GEO Group and has a capacity of about 1100.

ICE detention centers in the United States are generally known to have poor living conditions. According to a report released by the audit office in September 2024, the audit office surveyed 17 detention centers, including Folkston, between 2020 and 2023 and pointed out that they did not fully comply with DHS's own environmental health and safety standards.

The audit office said, ""As a result, it has undermined the ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for employees and inmates.""",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202509/07/news-p.v1.20250907.ae38c4add25d43c78bd5a1a0e79356ff_P1.png,N,,2025-09-06 19:56:42.260534

Lawmakers and staffers had hoped to ask officials questions about the legal justification for the strike, and even get basic details like which military unit conducted the attack, what type of munition was used, and the kind of intelligence gathering that went into determining the identities and intentions of those on the boat.

Broadly, administration officials have sought to make the argument that the 11 people on a speedboat that the U.S. blew up in international waters in the Caribbean this week were legitimate military targets because they were members of a loosely organized Venezuelan criminal gang called Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization.

""The strike was the obvious result of designating them a terrorist organization,"" said one person familiar with the Pentagon's thinking. ""If there was a boat full of al Qaeda fighters smuggling explosives towards the U.S., would anyone even ask this question?""

But Congress in 2001 explicitly determined the U.S. to be at war with al Qaeda, officially stamping them as combatants who the U.S. is legally allowed to kill under both domestic and international law. It has not done so for Tren de Aragua.

The designation of the group as a foreign terrorist organization — or FTO — under U.S. statute gives the president the authority to impose financial and legal penalties, like sanctions, but it does not automatically authorize the use of lethal force.

The president has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to use military force when it is in the national interest, and when it does not amount to ""war"" in the constitutional sense, which requires an act of Congress.

Past administrations have interpreted these standards fairly broadly — especially in the decadeslong war against al Qaeda, ISIS and other evolving Islamist terror groups — and Trump officials have also claimed the president was exercising his inherent Article II powers here.

He said the military was ""postured to carry out further military operations,"" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials have indicated that they intend to do.

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that ""the strike was fully consistent with the law of armed conflict"" — suggesting that the administration wants wartime rules to apply to the group.

""It's legal madlibs,"" said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues. ""They're throwing a lot of words out there that don't necessarily go together or constitute a coherent legal justification.""

Few details on the deceased

Even if the action taken against the 11 people in the boat did constitute a strike against a group with whom the U.S. was engaged in armed conflict, there are other legal questions and contradictions within the administration's public accounting of the episode.

Finucane and others pointed to Rubio's admission that the boat could have been interdicted rather than destroyed — as has been done in the past — but that the president ordered a lethal strike as a matter of first, not last, resort.

""That gives away the ballgame right there,"" said a former Pentagon lawyer who left the government in recent months. ""Any remotely plausible argument for inherent commander-in-chief authority to take military action would require showing there wasn't an alternative to lethal force.""

Trump, in his letter to Congress, also claimed that the administration acted in self-defense because of ""the inability or unwillingness of some states in the region to address the continuing threat to United States persons and interests emanating from their territories"" — language that echoes some key justifications for the use of force under international law.

""If you're admitting you could have just interdicted, how was blowing up necessary?"" this person said.

And perhaps most importantly, experts and congressional aides said, the administration so far has provided few factual details about the 11 people on the boat that would support their assessment that they were a legitimate military target.

Rubio and Trump offered conflicting assessments of where the boat was heading — Rubio initially said the alleged drugs on board were ""probably"" bound for Trinidad or another Caribbean country, while Trump said the vessel was headed to the U.S. Rubio later said the U.S. had intelligence the vessel ""was headed towards, eventually, the United States.""

The military and the CIA have been criticized in the past for killings of civilians whom they believed were terrorists.

International law prohibits the deliberate killing of civilians, even in the context of an armed conflict. Domestic law, meanwhile, prohibits unilateral and premeditated killings of non-military targets.

Trump’s post comes as he ramps up federal enforcement in Chicago and the city prepares for anticipated increased operations by ICE.","As crowds celebrated the Mexican Independence Day parade in Pilsen and the city prepares for ramped-up immigration enforcement, President Donald Trump threatened Chicago in a post on social media Saturday, saying the city was about to find out “why it’s called the Department of War.”

“‘I love the smell of deportations in the morning,’” he posted on Truth Social, a reference to the 1979 Vietnam War movie “Apocalypse Now” where Robert Duvall’s character Lt. Col. Kilgore says, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning.”

“Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of War,” the post continued, which included an image of Trump dressed in an Army uniform and helicopters flying in the background with the words “Chipocalypse Now.”

Trump signed an executive order Friday authorizing the Department of War as a secondary title for the Department of Defense in a move that he said sends “a message of strength.”

The White House shared the post on its X account.

Gov. JB Pritzker responded to Trump’s post Saturday on X, saying it “is not normal.”

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Pritzker said in the post.

“This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

Speaking at the 24th annual Mexican Independence Day Parade in Pilsen on Saturday, Sen. Dick Durbin called Trump’s post “disgusting.” “To suggest that the troops are coming into Chicago is an embarrassment,” he said.

In an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Briefing With Jen Psaki” on Friday night, Pritzker said the federal government was “preparing to invade the communities around Chicago like Little Village, like Pilsen perhaps beginning early morning tomorrow.”

In a post on X, Mayor Brandon Johnson called on Chicagoans to protect each other amid the threats.

“The President’s threats are beneath the honor of our nation, but the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,” Johnson said in the post. “We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Defending people is what brought Priscilla Read to the Pilsen parade on Saturday.

“We’re organizing to document detentions, report them, and do our best to defend people who are detained. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons we’re here today. Cameras at the ready. So far, there haven’t been any incidents, but [we are] prepared to document because that’s basically what we can do at this point,” said Read, 76.

“If you are defenders of democracy and human rights, you need to be in solidarity right now.”

Kenneth Morrison of Pilsen watched the parade go by as he sat outside Cafe Jumping Bean. “It’s disturbing that [Trump] wants to pick a fight.”

He said he thinks the posts will continue to fuel preconceived negative notions of Chicago.

People not living in Chicago “believe the narrative that Chicago is a hellhole. They don’t see anything like what we just saw a moment ago,” he said of the celebration at the parade.

“They just think we’re dodging bullets,” he added.

Trump’s post comes as he ramps up federal enforcement in Chicago and the city prepares for anticipated increased operations by ICE.

The New York Times reports that ICE officials have requisitioned thousands of handcuffs, belly chains, leg irons, as well as a number of gas masks, license plate readers and buses in advance of the Chicago operation.

In his MSNBC interview, Pritzker said the Illinois State Police received a call from Gregory Bovino, a leader at U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and ICE who is leading the planned deployment in Chicago, who said troops “are coming and that they intend to be in place by the end of this week.”

This week, Trump suggested that New Orleans could be his next target for deploying the National Guard, in addition to sending troops to Chicago and Baltimore. He sent troops and federal agents to patrol the streets of Washington, D.C., last month and to Los Angeles following clashes between hundreds of protesters and federal immigration authorities in riot gear.

Demonstrators protested Saturday outside the Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago where hundreds of federal agents are being sent to carry out Trump’s mission to curb crime and make immigration arrests in Chicago.

A protest was planned in the Loop at 5 p.m. Saturday.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/830f54f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2F93%2Fdcbd2d73402d8ef47c4799cc76ce%2Funtitled-design-copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 19:56:46.159658

By then, Guerrero had also moved there, but because she hadn’t updated her address, her immigration case remained in Florida.","As detentions spike amid a historic immigration crackdown, so has the price of legal remedies for those facing deportation.

Take a typical marriage-based green card case in Florida. Seven years ago, it might cost immigrants about $4,000 in legal fees. Hiring an immigration attorney to defend against deportation? Back then it could run around $10,000.

Today, the costs of green card cases have more than tripled, running up to $15,000, according to the Seattle-based Boundless Immigration group, which assists immigrants and their families with the legal system. Defense against deportation fees jumped 20% to as much as $12,000 or more.

These costs hit hardest for immigrants in labor and service jobs, unlike tech or professional workers, whose companies can cover some or all immigration paperwork.

The price hikes are yet another lesson in supply-and-demand economics, reflecting the challenges of hiring an immigration attorney when the market is flooded with so many would-be clients.

Immigration attorneys point to a combination of heavier caseloads along with more complicated cases that demand additional time and resources as reasons for climbing costs, leaving a growing number of immigrants without representation.

Lisette Sanchez, an immigration attorney in Tampa, said preparing even a simple case requires far more research, strategy and documentation than it did a decade ago. Additional time raises costs.

Sanchez also said demand for qualified immigration counsel has never been higher, while the supply of experienced attorneys has not kept up.

“Fees have gone up, but they reflect the growing demands and pressures of practicing in these areas,” Sanchez said.

Adonia Simpson, deputy director for policy and pro bono at the American Bar Association’s Commission on Immigration, said backlogs in immigration courts can add to costs. Nationwide, there are 3.4 million such cases, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Six in 10 people facing deportation lack legal counsel, according to the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice.

In Florida, about 500,000 people are in immigration court proceedings, and nearly 370,000 lack a lawyer, according to federal data collected by Syracuse University.

In Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco and Polk counties, more than 57,000 people are in removal proceedings, data shows, and fewer than 1 in 4 has a lawyer. Over thesummer, of 1,800 cases filed in those four counties, fewer than 1 in 5 had an attorney.

With new rules and policies, the work has become more difficult, said Simpson, requiring lengthy briefs, extensive evidence and careful client preparation.

The situation is daunting for immigrants who are detained and often on shortened timelines. With no court-appointed counsel, many proceed without representation, said Simpson.

“Having counsel can increase the likelihood of success on the merits of their case and improve efficiency of the courts,” said Simpson. “Unfortunately, due to funding cuts, many nonprofit organizations lack the capacity to provide free or low-cost representation.”

Robert Sichta, an immigration attorney with the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Florida, said the cost of hiring a lawyer is often out of reach for many, especially given their income levels. His group provides legal support but cannot take on every case, so it works with other attorneys who lower their fees and offer payment plans.

New fees and charges, including those tied to work permit applications for asylum-seekers, add another layer of financial strain, said Sichta.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced rates for various forms and applications under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July. Among the new costs:

$550 for an initial employment authorization and $275 for renewals;

a $100 filing fee for asylum applications and $100 annual asylum fee for pending cases;

$250 for Special Immigrant Juvenile petitions, which apply to anyone under age 21.

$500 for Temporary Protected Status, up from $50.

The fees increase each year based on inflation.

Many immigrants without legal representation have been in the country less than two years. Others are not yet employed and rely on temporary housing with family members or friends while they begin to settle into their communities.

“It’s an uphill battle that’s only getting worse,” Sichta said. “Unless, like regular courts, we start allowing the appointment of counsel paid for by government sources. As if that’s going to happen with the current administration.”

Alexa Figueroa arrived with no money when she crossed the southern border with her 10-year-old daughter last year using an app that allows immigrants to schedule appointments with border officials and request entry.

The app, CBP One, was introduced during the Biden administration. More than a million applied, obtaining work permits and receiving permission to stay in the country for up to two years.

Figueroa, 30, is unemployed and can barely cover her cellphone bill with the help of a sister she lives with in Davenport. Two weeks ago, she had her first hearing in immigration court in Orlando. No one was with her, except her daughter.

At the hearing, Figueroa said the judge recommended she find an immigration attorney. Otherwise, she would have to represent herself at her next hearing in October.

“I don’t know how I’m going to do it,” Figueroa said while waiting with her daughter for a relative to pick them up outside the court. “I want to do things the right way, but I have no savings and no job to pay a lawyer.”

Danielle Hernandez, an immigration attorney in Ybor City, said it’s understandable that many people who come to the United States do not have the ability to pay initially, and often do not consider the legal fees involved. Many only consider the hefty cost of being smuggled across the border, Hernandez said.

Isabel Guerrero, 47, from Colombia, entered the U.S. three years ago through Piedras Negras, a Mexican city near the Texas border, with one of her four children.

For her removal case,she hired an attorney who lives in South Carolina. By then, Guerrero had also moved there, but because she hadn’t updated her address, her immigration case remained in Florida. At a recent hearing in Orlando, she faced the judge alone.

Guerrero is in removal proceedings, a court process to decide whether someone should be deported. She said more than 60% of her wages from working in a vegetable warehouse go toward paying her lawyer and fees.

“If you only knew all the effort it takes to pay for a lawyer … you can’t even imagine, sometimes it’s not enough,” said Guerrero. “But it’s what you have to do. Alone, I don’t think I could make it.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/tampa_bay_times_articles_917/e80f9ec8d1667f7df48c0d4b986cbe8f,N,,2025-09-07 00:57:57.778432

Guwahati: BJP’s key ally in the NDA — Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) — on Saturday opposed the Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order 2025 issued by the Union home ministry recently. In a news conference at the party headquarters, AGP vice-president Kumar Deepak Das said AGP would move the Supreme Court against the order, which he said violates the March 25, 1971, cut-off date endorsed by the Assam Accord for the detection and deportation of illegal migrants from Assam. Former AGP MP Kumar Dipak Das said, “The AGP has never compromised on the Assam Accord and will not do so.” Expressing dissatisfaction with the order that affects Assam and the northeast as well, the AGP clarified that despite being part of the NDA, it does not support this order that allows entry, stay, and exit of people of minority communities from neighbouring countries in India. Many organisations in Assam have viewed this order as an extension of the cut-off date of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act by 10 years. However, the AGP has not taken any decision to part ways with the NDA. “The AGP consistently opposed both the former CAB and the current CAA. Additionally, the AGP sought support from other national parties to oppose the CAA. The AGP challenged the CAA in the Supreme Court, saying that CAA cannot be implemented in Assam because, if implemented, it will violate the Assam Accord. It was due to the AGP’s petition that the SC ordered a separate hearing for Assam and the Northeast,” Das said. “Regarding the recent order, the AGP will once again file a petition in court challenging the recent directive,” he added. Das said the latest order has created a hurdle as far as the implementation of the Assam Accord is concerned. Considering the problems created by the home ministry’s order, the AGP, on Friday evening, convened a meeting of senior leaders where it was decided to move the SC against the order.

Again. - Zeteo,Team Zeteo,,,,,https://zeteo.com/p/this-week-in-democracy-week-33-trump,"A federal appeals court ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with the termination of more than $16 billion in grants authorized by the Biden administration for non-profit organizations to fight climate change.
The move has raised concerns, including from one person involved in the planning of their reassignment, who says officers may not have experience or would receive insufficient training for immigration court proceedings, including deportation hearings.
Speaking to reporters, Trump said he will be sending federal law enforcement to both Chicago and Baltimore, but didn’t specify a timeline for the deployment.
The Trump administration never told Congressional leaders about the operation, potentially violating federal law.
A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from ending the Temporary Protected Status of more than one million people from Haiti and Venezuela.","Trump authorized a military strike on a boat in the Caribbean that his administration alleges was occupied by 11 members of the Tren de Aragua gang who were transporting drugs from Venezuela. The strike, which Trump said killed all 11 on board, took place without congressional approval and may have violated international human rights and maritime law. It remains unclear under what US legal or constitutional authority Trump took action or how the military determined that the individuals aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later said the military will keep assets in the region and strike anyone “trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist.”

A federal judge ruled that Trump’s deployment of the military to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the army from performing domestic law enforcement actions without authorization from Congress. While the judge noted that it’s legal to deploy the officials to protect federal property, he said that Trump is using the military as a “national police force with the President as its chief.”

A federal appeals court blocked the Trump administration from rapidly deporting Venezuelans accused of being in a gang under the Alien Enemies Act, finding there was no “invasion” or “predatory incursion” to do so, which is required under the 1798 wartime law.

Legal advocacy organizations have said the move has led to some of the parents being arrested.

Speaking to reporters, Trump said he will be sending federal law enforcement to both Chicago and Baltimore, but didn’t specify a timeline for the deployment. Trump also said that many of the people arrested as part of his DC crackdown on crime were “born to be criminals.”

DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, issued an executive order to provide indefinite coordination with federal law enforcement. As the Washington Post writes, the order “may quell any showdown over what happens” when Trump’s 30-day federal takeover expires next week.

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie introduced what’s known as a discharge petition in an effort to force a vote on the release of the Epstein files. The measure must receive 218 signatures to succeed. A White House official later told NBC News in an email that Republicans deciding to sign on to the “attention-seeking” petition “would be viewed as a very hostile act to the administration.”

The New York Times reported that Trump’s advisers have discussed offering positions in the administration to New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the city’s Republican mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa in an effort to help former Governor Andrew Cuomo defeat frontrunner and Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani in November’s general election. Politico later reported that Adams, who met with Trump’s team in Florida earlier this week, was offered a position at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.

During a press conference where survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s abuse called on lawmakers and the Justice Department to release the entirety of the files related to the sex traffickers, survivor Lisa Phillips announced that the group would create a confidential list of Epstein associates on their own if the government doesn’t take action, saying, “We will confidently compile the names we all know were regularly in the Epstein world.”

More than 1,000 current and former Department of Health and Human Services employees signed a letter calling for RFK Jr. to resign, saying he “continues to endanger the nation’s health.” They say if Kennedy doesn’t resign, Trump and Congress should appoint a new secretary, “one whose qualifications and experience ensure that health policy is informed by independent and unbiased peer-reviewed science.”

AP reported that Trump is expected to ask the Supreme Court to overturn a jury decision in a civil lawsuit that found him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll, along with defamation, according to a filing last week that saw his lawyers ask the Supreme Court to extend a deadline for challenging the verdict to mid-November as Trump “intends to seek review” of “significant issues” related to the trial and an appeals court upholding the decision. In response, Carroll’s lawyer said, “We do not believe that President Trump will be able to present any legal issues in the Carroll cases that merit review” by the Supreme Court.

The House voted to toss a censure resolution against Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver, which would have also resulted in her removal from the Committee on Homeland Security. McIver was charged in May with assaulting and interfering with ICE agents at an immigration detention facility in New Jersey. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Angola, the largest maximum-security prison in the US, was built on the grounds of a cotton plantation, and individuals incarcerated there are forced to work in the fields in extreme heat for as little as pennies an hour and face punishment if they refuse to work.

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from freezing over $2 billion in federal research grants from Harvard University, calling the move illegal and accusing the administration of using “antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from canceling $4.9 billion in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress, thwarting the president’s attempt to use a “pocket rescission” to claw back the funding. In his decision, the judge ordered the release of $11.5 billion in funds that are set to expire at the end of the month.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow said the Trump administration is planning to make the US citizenship test harder, calling the current test “just too easy.”

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll extended orders for National Guard troops to remain on active duty in DC until Nov. 30, though Trump could still terminate the mission earlier.

Reuters reported that current and former FBI employees are concerned that Trump’s use of agents in his DC law enforcement takeover is exposing the agency’s fleet of unmarked cars, which could compromise its national security and surveillance work.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump’s Justice Department launched an investigation into Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, following two criminal referrals for alleged mortgage fraud by the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The investigation, which has already resulted in the issuing of subpoenas, is being led by Trump’s “weaponization czar” and DOJ special attorney Ed Martin, who sent a letter to Fed chair Jerome Powell last month calling for him to fire Cook. In response, her lawyer noted that questions over how she described her properties aren’t fraud, “but it takes nothing for this DOJ to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again.”

The recently fired CDC director, Susan Monarez, penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal warning that while she lost her job, “America’s children could lose far more,” noting that she was directed to preapprove recommendations from a vaccine advisory panel “filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric” without reviewing them. She added, “The CDC can’t fulfill its obligation to the American people if its leader can’t demand proof in decision-making.”

The acting deputy chief of a Justice Department unit was caught on a hidden camera by the far-right O’Keefe Media Group saying that the government will “redact every Republican” from a list of Epstein associates and “leave all the liberal, Democratic people in those files.” He also said Ghislaine Maxwell was transferred to a minimum-security prison in an effort to offer “her something to keep her mouth shut.” In a statement, the official said his comments were based on “what I’ve learned in the media and not from anything I’ve done at or learned via work.” On Twitter, a DOJ spokesperson said the official’s comments “have absolutely zero bearing with reality and reflect a total lack of knowledge of the DOJ’s review process.”

Trump filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to block the reinstatement of a Biden-appointed Federal Trade Commission member and let her termination proceed while the legality of the move is challenged in court.

The Times also reported that in 2019, during Trump’s first term, the president greenlit a top secret operation which sent a team of Navy SEALs to North Korea to plant an electronic device in an effort to intercept the communications of Kim Jong-Un. The mission was unsuccessful after the SEALs killed a boat crew of unarmed civilians and sank their bodies. The Trump administration never told Congressional leaders about the operation, potentially violating federal law.

Breyer on Saturday defended a judge accused of defying a Supreme Court ruling, saying in an interview that he knew the judge to be scrupulously honest and respectful of higher courts.

“I never saw an instance where he would deliberately defy a controlling opinion or legal statement from our court or from the Supreme Court,” Justice Breyer said.
Justice Gorsuch acknowledged that such orders are not final determinations, but said that “even probabilistic holdings” like the one in April must command respect.
The criticism prompted an unusual apology from Judge Young at a hearing last week.","Justice Stephen G. Breyer on Saturday defended a judge accused of defying a Supreme Court ruling, saying in an interview that he knew the judge to be scrupulously honest and respectful of higher courts.

Justice Breyer, who retired from the court in 2022, has avoided criticism of his former colleagues. He declined on Saturday to directly address Justice Neil M. Gorsuch’s concurring opinion last month accusing Judge William G. Young, of the Federal District Court in Boston, of ignoring a binding precedent.

But that opinion plainly prompted Justice Breyer’s decision to step forward with rare public comments in praise of Judge Young as model jurist whose rulings he had often reviewed during his 14 years as an appeals court judge in Boston.

“I never saw an instance where he would deliberately defy a controlling opinion or legal statement from our court or from the Supreme Court,” Justice Breyer said. “I never even had an instinct or a guess or a hunch or anything that he was doing anything like that deliberately.”

Justice Breyer’s comments were the latest indication of growing tensions within the judiciary, as courts grapple with the flood of lawsuits prompted by the Trump administration’s sweeping efforts to remake the government, and as trial judges struggle to interpret the Supreme Court’s emergency orders.

Justice Gorsuch had harsh words for Judge Young, accusing him of serious misconduct in a ruling restoring grants from the National Institutes of Health that the Trump administration had sought to cancel.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” Justice Gorsuch wrote, adding that Judge Young had ignored the reasoning in an unsigned four-paragraph interim order in a different case in April.

Justice Gorsuch acknowledged that such orders are not final determinations, but said that “even probabilistic holdings” like the one in April must command respect. “Whatever their own views, judges are duty bound to respect ‘the hierarchy of the federal court system created by the Constitution and Congress,’” he added, citing an earlier opinion.

Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh joined the concurring opinion.

The criticism prompted an unusual apology from Judge Young at a hearing last week.

“Before we do anything, I really feel it’s incumbent upon me to — on the record here — to apologize to Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh if they think that anything this court has done has been done in defiance of a precedential action of the Supreme Court of the United States,” said Judge Young, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1985.

He added that “I can do nothing more than to say as honestly as I can: I certainly did not so intend, and that is foreign in every respect to the nature of how I have conducted myself as a judicial officer.”

Judge Young was not alone in trying to make sense of the Supreme Court’s cryptic orders on what critics call its shadow docket. Ruling for Harvard last week in its suit against the Trump administration, Judge Allison D. Burroughs, another federal judge in Boston, wrote that “the Supreme Court’s recent emergency docket rulings regarding grant terminations have not been models of clarity, and have left many issues unresolved.”

Responding to Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence, she wrote that “it is unhelpful and unnecessary to criticize district courts for ‘defying’ the Supreme Court when they are working to find the right answer in a rapidly evolving doctrinal landscape, where they must grapple with both existing precedent and interim guidance from the Supreme Court that appears to set that precedent aside without much explanation or consensus.”

At last week’s hearing, Judge Young, 84, seemed to be reeling from a blow to his reputation administered by a Supreme Court justice.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/06/multimedia/06dc-breyer-pjcw/06dc-breyer-pjcw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 21:58:43.860096

The new home secretary is reportedly set to announce the use of Ministry of Defence sites to house people after a wave of protests outside migrant accommodation over the summer.

The scale of the challenge facing the former justice secretary was illustrated on Saturday when an estimated 1,000 people arrived in the UK by small boats.

Dozens of asylum hotels are expected to close after they became the focal point of several demonstrations in recent months. Ministers are also close to agreeing a returns deal with Germany, having already secured one with France, the Daily Telegraph reported.

It comes after the prime minister carried out a major reshuffle including wide-ranging changes at the Home Office as he seeks to tighten his grip on immigration and draw a line under Angela Rayner’s resignation.

The chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, earlier denied that the government was in crisis and insisted Starmer now has the “strongest team” in place around the cabinet table following Rayner’s departure.

He ruled out the prospect of an early election amid opposition claims that the upheaval could open splits within Labour and collapse the prime minister’s authority.

Speaking to broadcasters on Saturday, Jones dismissed suggestions that the rejig could delay the Starmer’s self-described “phase two” of government by moving senior figures to unfamiliar briefs.

“It’s not instability insofar as the outcomes that we’re delivering are the same,” Jones, who is also the newly appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Breakfast.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4d9f282c7de2a9b9f5ce7196323f48199b97110/1470_0_2083_1666/master/2083.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=abe6cbcca9362ebd8a4d278b51b8362a",N,,2025-09-06 18:56:48.756312

Shin’s wife, DeNae Shin, thanked the Salt Lake City community for its support over the last few weeks.","A Utah violinist who has played with high-profile orchestras has been released on bond after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month.

Donggin Shin, 37, was apprehended by immigration authorities in a hotel parking lot while he was on a work trip in Colorado and placed in ICE detention on Aug. 18. His father brought him to the U.S. from South Korea when he was a child and he lives in Salt Lake City, according to his attorney, Adam Crayk.

Shin, who goes by the name John, was held at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora, Colorado — more than 500 miles away from his home — according to an ICE database. He was released on $25,000 bond on Tuesday.

“I never thought I would have to feel what it’s like to be shackled on my ankles and my wrist, feeling like some kind of a serious criminal, as if I have murdered someone,” Shin said at a press conference Friday, according to KSL-TV, an NBC affiliate based in Salt Lake City.

“I was absolutely terrified. Obviously, I cried all day,” he added.

Shin was held for a total of 17 days and is now wearing an ankle monitor, according to Crayk.

Shin was identified by ICE’s Fugitive Operations Team, which is generally focused on apprehending immigrants who have committed serious crimes and are considered national security threats, according to charging documents.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In response to previous questions about Shin, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told NBC News: “Our message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.”

The official added that Shin had a DUI conviction. Records show the matter was resolved after Shin pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense in 2020 and served his probation.

Crayk, Shin’s attorney, told NBC New in a previous interview that his client’s father was battling brain cancer at the time of his prior arrest.

“My father was losing a battle to a Level 4 glioblastoma brain tumor. He had limited time to live,” Shin said, according to KSL-TV. “I fell into a depression during that time and the impaired driving followed.”

Shin entered the U.S. on a tourist visa on Sept. 3, 1998, which “required him to depart the U.S. by March 3, 1999,” according to DHS. But Crayk previously told NBC News that this timeline is incomplete, as Shin’s father switched to a student visa, which conferred status onto Shin at the time.

Crayk said Shin became a DACA recipient years later, but lost his DACA protections due to his 2020 conviction. He has remained without lawful status for the last four and a half years.

Shin works in telecommunications but has played with the prestigious Utah Symphony and Ballet West in recent years.

Musicians have been playing at the state Capitol each day, determined to raise awareness until Shin returns home.

Shin’s wife, DeNae Shin, thanked the Salt Lake City community for its support over the last few weeks.

“During those really dark times where I was feeling such despair, it was really those letters that kept me going,” she said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250829-utah-symphony-mn-1405-eeb352.jpg",N,,2025-09-06 18:56:57.012371

Recent judicial rulings and legislative proposals, such as the Dignity Act of 2025, underscore the fragility of labor supply chains in agriculture, hospitality, and healthcare. For investors, this uncertainty presents both risks and opportunities, as capital allocation shifts toward automation and labor diversification strategies.

The TPS Dilemma: Legal Uncertainty and Labor Market Volatility

The Trump administration’s 2025 efforts to terminate TPS protections for Venezuelans and Haitians have triggered a cascade of legal challenges. A federal judge initially blocked these actions, calling them “arbitrary and capricious,” but the Supreme Court later allowed the administration to proceed, creating a legal limbo for 350,000 individuals [1]. This instability has disrupted labor markets: in Florida alone, TPS holders contributed $485.9 million in state and local taxes in 2023, supporting critical services like education and infrastructure [3]. Their sudden removal could destabilize industries already grappling with post-pandemic labor shortages.

Agriculture, for instance, relies on TPS holders for 25% of its workforce, with over half of agricultural product graders being foreign-born [2]. The termination of TPS protections has already led to a 30% increase in operational costs and a 15% drop in output in some regions [1]. Similarly, hospitality and healthcare face acute challenges. In South Florida, 15,000 Venezuelan TPS holders previously worked in hospitality, and their absence has forced businesses to cut services or raise prices [1]. Healthcare, which employs 50,000 TPS holders as home health aides and nursing assistants, risks a 135,000-worker shortage by 2036 if immigration policies tighten further [2].

Capital Allocation Shifts: Automation and Diversification

Faced with labor shortages, industries are accelerating investments in automation and workforce diversification. In agriculture, AI-driven systems for crop monitoring and robotic harvesters are gaining traction, with California’s $50 billion agricultural sector leading the charge [4]. Hospitality chains like Disney and Walmart have already begun replacing TPS-dependent roles with automated inventory systems and AI-powered customer service tools [5]. Meanwhile, healthcare providers are adopting AI for diagnostics and administrative tasks, reducing reliance on human labor for routine functions [6].

The Dignity Act of 2025, which includes provisions for asylum reform and legal immigration updates, may further shape these trends. While the bill does not directly address TPS, its emphasis on border security and workforce modernization signals a regulatory environment where automation and compliance-driven labor strategies will thrive [7]. Investors are also eyeing hybrid solutions: for example, combining automation with targeted recruitment of non-TPS immigrant workers or expanding vocational training programs to upskill domestic labor [3].

Investment Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the key risks lie in sector-specific vulnerabilities. Agriculture and hospitality face immediate exposure to labor disruptions, with operational costs projected to rise as TPS protections wane. Conversely, opportunities exist in firms developing automation technologies, labor analytics platforms, and compliance software tailored to immigration-dependent industries. The healthcare sector, while facing long-term staffing challenges, offers growth potential in AI-driven care solutions and telehealth services that reduce reliance on in-person labor [6].

However, the political landscape remains unpredictable. The Biden administration’s potential reinstatement of TPS protections could stabilize labor markets, while further Trump-era policies might accelerate automation adoption. Investors must also weigh the ethical and reputational risks of over-reliance on automation, which could exacerbate job displacement among low-skilled workers [8].

Conclusion

The TPS litigation saga highlights the intersection of immigration policy, labor economics, and technological innovation. While legal uncertainty poses short-term risks, it also drives long-term capital reallocation toward resilient, technology-enabled solutions. Investors who navigate this landscape by hedging against labor volatility—through diversified portfolios that include automation firms, compliance experts, and immigrant workforce advocates—may position themselves to thrive in an evolving economic order.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 22:57:00.755461

Pritzker has blasted Trump for suggesting that major cities should be asking the federal government for assistance with law enforcement, citing dwindling crime statistics and calling the request “an insult.”","Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) lambasted President Trump on Saturday for joking about immigration enforcement efforts, including plans to target Chicago, calling the president a “wannabe dictator.”

“The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Pritzker wrote on social platform X in response to a meme shared by Trump. “This is not a joke. This is not normal.”

“Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man,” he added. “Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”

Trump earlier Saturday posted an image generated by artificial intelligence (AI) to his Truth Social platform that showed his likeness as a law enforcement official. The background includes an image of Chicago burning, several helicopters and text that reads “Chipocalypse Now” — a nod to the 1979 movie “Apocalypse Now.”

In the caption, the president wrote, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning… Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

The comment comes just a day after he signed an executive order to rebrand the Defense Department to the Department of War.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) railed against the post in a Saturday social media post, stating it is “beneath the honor of our nation.”

“But the reality is that he wants to occupy our city and break our Constitution,” Johnson wrote on X. “We must defend our democracy from this authoritarianism by protecting each other and protecting Chicago from Donald Trump.”

Trump late last month signaled his administration would look to the Windy City next in its efforts to tackle crime and illegal immigration. The White House already confirmed that is looking to use a Navy base near Chicago to support its migrant detention efforts.

The president has also threatened to deploy National Guard troops to the city, pointing to what he called success in his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., to aid in the expected crackdown. While his moves in the nation’s capital are protected under the federal district’s Home Rule Act, Illinois is a sovereign state.

Any effort to deploy troops to Chicago without the governor requesting assistance would likely result in a legal battle, like the one that played out in Los Angeles over deportation raids.

Local officials in The Prairie State have pushed back on the administration’s threat, suggesting Trump is overstepping his authority. Johnson signed a protective order late last month to combat the potential deployment of soldiers.

The city’s Office of Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee Rights also rolled out an updated website earlier this week with step-by-step guidance on how immigrants can protect themselves.

The statement added that Munoz-Gutierrez had been repatriated after being transferred to the custody of Mexican Ambassador Alejandro Estivill Castro in a “smooth and orderly” process.

South Sudan thanked Mexico for its cooperation and said it had received assurances Munoz-Gutierrez would not be subjected to “torture, inhumane or degrading treatment, or undue prosecution upon his return”.

The statement said he had been treated with “full respect for his human dignity and fundamental rights” during his stay in the capital, Juba.

The repatriation was carried out “in full accordance with relevant international law, bilateral agreements, and established diplomatic protocols”, it added.

‘Felt kidnapped’

In comments to journalists in Juba, Munoz-Gutierrez said he “felt kidnapped” when the US sent him to South Sudan.

“I was not planning to come to South Sudan, but while I was here, they treated me well,” he said. “I finished my time in the United States, and they were supposed to return me to Mexico. Instead, they wrongfully sent me to South Sudan.”

The US Department of Homeland Security has said Munoz-Gutierrez had a conviction for second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.

South Sudan is discussing with other countries the repatriation of the six deportees still in its custody, said Apuk Ayuel Mayen, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry.

It is not clear if the deportees have access to legal representation. Only one of eight was from South Sudan.

Rights groups have argued that the Trump administration’s increasing practice of deporting migrants to third countries violates international law and the basic rights of migrants.

The deportations have faced opposition by courts in the US although the Supreme Court in June allowed the government to restart swift removals of migrants to countries other than their homelands.

The plant is a joint venture between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution.

ICE released video of what officials say is the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the Homeland Security Investigations. It shows officers shackling workers and loading them onto Georgia prison buses.

""This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans,"" said Steven Schrank, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations for Georgia and Alabama, during a news conference announcing the operation. ""We are sending a clear and unequivocal message that those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy and violate federal laws will be held accountable.""

He said it was not an operation where agents simply rounded up people and put them on buses, but the result of a months-long investigation. The workers, Schrank said, were either illegally present in the U.S. or working unlawfully.

The arrests add to tension with a key ally at a time when President Trump has been pushing for trade deals and more South Korean investment in the U.S. Hyundai also has an auto plant in Montgomery, Ala., and has announced plans to invest more than $5 billion in a steel plant in Louisiana.

""I would say that they were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job,"" Trump said when asked about the raid at the White House on Friday.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia says the raid raises questions about both the president's immigration strategy and how the firms were able to allegedly employ workers without proper documentation.

""Companies should not be able to get rich in Georgia by exploiting immigrant workers and putting them at risk of politically motivated raids and violations of due process,"" Warnock said in a statement. ""It's bad for our economy, bad for Georgia's workers, and bad for law-abiding Georgia families living in fear of this administration.""

Hyundai Motor Co. says it's working to understand the specific circumstances of the arrests.

""Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,"" the company said in a statement, promising an internal investigation into employment compliance.

""Hyundai has zero tolerance for those who don't follow the law,"" it said.

In a statement to Yonhap on Saturday, LG Energy Solution said it has suspended all business trips to the U.S. and told workers visiting the U.S. to stay in their accommodations or return to South Korea immediately. The company said its chief human resources officer is heading to the U.S. to address the issues on site.

""We will make every effort to promptly resolve the situation, including ensuring the speedy and safe return of all employees,"" LG Energy Solution said.

- Encaleret was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported over the study period

- Based on these findings, BridgeBio intends to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret, an orally-administered investigational therapy, in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026

PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, announced today that encaleret showed parathyroid hormone (PTH)-independent normalization of blood and urine calcium in post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. The Phase 2 results were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting 2025.

“Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a challenging condition to manage because treatment involves striking a balance between blood and urine calcium. With conventional therapy, using calcium and active vitamin D, we typically aim for a low or low-normal blood calcium to reduce the risk of high urinary calcium which can cause kidney calcifications and renal injury. Unfortunately, not all patients are able to achieve this balance, and many still struggle – some with the disruptive symptoms of low blood calcium, and others with persistently high urine calcium,” said Iris Hartley, M.D., endocrinologist and clinician investigator at the National Institute of Dental and Cranial Facial Research of the National Institutes of Health. “There is a clear need for better options. New results from this study are very promising, suggesting a potential path for improved calcium control in a convenient pill form.”

The Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluated the PTH-independent effects of encaleret on renal calcium handling in patients with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Ten participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism were administered encaleret at 162 mg twice daily for up to 5 days. Calcitriol was stopped one day prior to the first dose. After starting encaleret, calcium and calcitriol were titrated based on blood calcium. The findings from the study include:

Encaleret treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in fractional excretion of calcium in nine participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism

80% of post-surgical hypoparathyroidism participants achieved concomitant blood and urine calcium in the normal reference range within 5 days of treatment initiation compared to 0% of participants on conventional therapy at baseline

These results support the continued evaluation of encaleret as an orally-administered treatment option for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism

“These Phase 2 results show that encaleret may help normalize blood and urine calcium in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, in the absence of stimulating PTH secretion, due to its effect on the calcium-sensing receptor expressed in the kidney. Based on these encouraging findings, we intend to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026,” said Scott Adler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Calcilytix, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing encaleret.

During ASBMR 2025, we also presented data from two preclinical studies of infigratinib, which demonstrated that low-dose infigratinib significantly improved bone growth in a hypochondroplasia mouse model as well as enhanced skull development in a Crouzon/Pfeiffer syndrome model. These data underscore the therapy’s broad potential for treating skeletal conditions. Additionally, the study of infigratinib in the hypochondroplasia mouse model was recently published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

HONG KONG, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Garden Stage Limited (NASDAQ: GSIW) (“GSIW” or the “Company”), today announced that it received a delinquency notification letter (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) on September 5, 2025 indicating that the Company is not currently in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq’s Listing Rules for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as the closing bid price for the Company’s ordinary shares listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market was below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. The Notice provides that the Company has a period of 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice, or until March 4, 2026, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.

The receipt of the Notice has no immediate effect on the Company’s business operations or the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares, which will continue to trade uninterrupted on the Nasdaq under the ticker “GSIW.” Pursuant to the Notice, the Company has until March 4, 2026 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, during which time the Company’s ordinary shares will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If at any time before March 4, 2026, the bid price of the Company’s ordinary shares closes at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide written confirmation of compliance to the Company.

In the event that the Company does not regain compliance by March 4, 2026, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, the Company would be required to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period.

SHANGHAI, China, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hesai Group (NASDAQ: HSAI) (“Hesai” or the “Company”), the global leader in three-dimensional light detection and ranging (lidar) solutions, today announced the launch of its global offering (the “Global Offering”) of 17,000,000 Class B ordinary shares of the Company, which comprises a Hong Kong public offering of initially 1,700,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing on September 8, 2025 Hong Kong time (the “Hong Kong Public Offering”) and an international offering of initially 15,300,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing today (the “International Offering”), and dual-primary listing of its Class B ordinary shares on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong Kong Stock Exchange”) under the stock code “2525”.

The Company’s American depositary shares (the “ADSs”), each representing one Class B ordinary share of the Company, will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”). Investors in the Global Offering will only be able to purchase Class B ordinary shares and will not be able to take delivery of ADSs. Upon listing of the Class B ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Class B ordinary shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be fully fungible with the ADSs listed on Nasdaq.

The Company has an offer size adjustment option, exercisable with prior written agreement with the Sponsor-OCs (as defined below) on or before the time of pricing, pursuant to which the Company may allot and issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, to cover additional demand.

In addition, the Company expects to grant the international underwriters an over-allotment option to require the Company to issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares in the International Offering (or up to 2,932,500 Class B ordinary shares if the offer size adjustment option is exercised in full), representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Global Offering.

The initial number of Class B ordinary shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Offering represent approximately 10% and 90% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, respectively, subject to reallocation, offer size adjustment, and over-allotment. Subject to the level of oversubscription in the Hong Kong Public Offering and reallocation, as described in the Hong Kong prospectus to be issued by the Company in Hong Kong dated September 8, 2025, the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering could be adjusted to up to a maximum of 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering.

The offer price for the Hong Kong Public Offering (the “Hong Kong Offer Price”) will be no more than HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share (the “Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price”), or US$29.04, per Class B ordinary share (equivalent to US$29.04 per ADS) based on an exchange rate of HK$7.8499 to US$1.00 as of June 30, 2025 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The offer price for the International Offering tranche of the Global Offering (the “International Offer Price”) may be set higher than, or the same as, the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price. The Company will set the International Offer Price on or about September 12, 2025, Hong Kong time, by taking into consideration, among other factors, the closing price of the ADSs on the Nasdaq on the last trading day on or before September 12, 2025 and investor demand during the marketing process. The final Hong Kong Offer Price will be set at the lower of the final International Offer Price and the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price of HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share. The shares will be traded in board lots of 20 Class B ordinary shares.

The Company has entered into cornerstone investment agreements with HHLR Advisors (part of Hillhouse Group), Taikang Life, WT Asset Management, Grab, Hongda Group and Commando Global Fund. Under such agreements, the cornerstone investors have agreed to, subject to certain conditions, subscribe for such number of Class B ordinary shares that may be purchased with an aggregate amount of approximately US$148.0 million, or approximately HK$1,153.7 million at the International Offer Price, representing approximately 29.8% of the Class B ordinary shares initially being offered under the Global Offering assuming such Class B ordinary shares are sold at the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price, which percentage is subject to the offer size adjustment option and the over-allotment option. Such Class B ordinary shares are being sold in reliance on Regulation S and are exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and this cornerstone placing will form part of the International Offering.

The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering for investment in research and development, investment in its manufacturing capabilities, business development to accelerate its business expansion, and working capital and general corporate purposes.
