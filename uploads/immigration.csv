U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb concluded that President Donald Trump’s military takeover in Washington, D.C., violates the Constitution and illegally intrudes on local officials’ authority to direct law enforcement in the district. She put her order on hold for 21 days to allow for an appeal, however.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to challenge the Guard deployments. He asked the judge to enjoin the White House from deploying Guard troops without the mayor’s consent.

In August, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a crime emergency in Washington. Within a month, more than 2,300 National Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling the city under the command of the Secretary of the Army. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist in patrols.

It’s unclear how long the deployments will last, but attorneys from Schwalb’s office said Guard troops are likely to remain in the city through at least next summer.

“Our constitutional democracy will never be the same if these occupations are permitted to stand,” they wrote.

Government lawyers said Congress empowered the president to control the D.C. National Guard’s operation. They argued that Schwalb’s lawsuit is a frivolous “political stunt” threatening to undermine a successful campaign to reduce violent crime in the district.

“There is no sensible reason for an injunction unwinding this arrangement now, particularly since the District’s claims have no merit,” Justice Department attorneys wrote.

Trump’s Guard deployments have led to other court challenges. On Monday, a federal appeals court suspended an order blocking Trump from taking command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. In September, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration illegally sent Guard troops to the Los Angeles area after days of protests over immigration raids.

In Washington, the Trump administration deputized Guard troops to serve as special U.S. Marshal Service deputies. Schwalb’s office said out-of-state troops are impermissibly operating as a federal military police force in D.C., inflaming tensions with residents and diverting local police resources.

“Every day that this lawless incursion continues, the District suffers harm to its sovereign authority to conduct local law enforcement as it chooses,” his office’s attorneys wrote.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/11/2025-11-15T202246Z_993386267_RC28XHAAC9M4_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-PROTEST-1024x697.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 16:57:03.380966

Josh Shapiro ‘s administration said the federal government didn’t identify a single commercial driver’s license issued to someone who wasn’t eligible.
The administration said approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner’s permit or commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania.
His comments came after DHS said it had arrested an Uzbek national with a commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania.
The government shutdown delayed reviews in other states, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.","The Trump administration threatened Thursday to withhold nearly $75 million in funding if Pennsylvania does not immediately revoke what the administration claims are illegally issued commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants.

The move by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to target Pennsylvania follows similar action against California. Both states are run by Democratic governors who have criticized President Donald Trump’s administration and who are viewed as potential top-shelf contenders to be the party’s 2028 presidential nominee.

Duffy has made it a priority to scrutinize how the licenses are issued since August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. That incident thrust the issue into the public’s consciousness.

In a statement Thursday, DOT spokesperson Danna Almeida said all states were being reviewed.

It’s unclear how many people would be affected in Pennsylvania. In any case, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro ‘s administration said the federal government didn’t identify a single commercial driver’s license issued to someone who wasn’t eligible.

Still, a letter Thursday from the Republican administration to Shapiro cited an audit that found two out of 150 people whose licenses exceeded their lawful presence in the country.

In four cases it had reviewed, the federal government said Pennsylvania provided no evidence that it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof that they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.

The Trump administration called on Pennsylvania to stop issuing new, renewed and transferred commercial driver’s licenses and permits, as well as conduct an audit to identify those licenses whose expirations exceed the driver’s lawful stay in the U.S.

It is also asking the state to void noncompliant licenses and remove those drivers from the road. The administration said approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner’s permit or commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania.

The governors of California and Pennsylvania — Gavin Newsom and Shapiro — are tough critics of Trump, and both have been repeated targets of Trump’s administration.

Shapiro’s administration said the state transportation department ceased issuing commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration published a regulation in late September that would severely limit which immigrants can get one.

A federal court has put the rule on hold for now, but Shapiro’s administration said its transportation department still hasn’t resumed issuing what are called “non-domiciled CDLs.”

Pennsylvania’s transportation department said Thursday that it follows federal rules for verifying an immigrant applicant’s lawful presence in the country by checking the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s database.

But Shapiro this week suggested that DHS was falling short by failing to properly maintain that database, which states use to check an immigrant’s legal status before issuing a driver’s license to a noncitizen.

His comments came after DHS said it had arrested an Uzbek national with a commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania. The man, who had a work authorization granted in 2024, was wanted in his home country for belonging to a terrorist organization, the department said.

But Shapiro said the state transportation department checked the federal database over the summer before issuing a CDL to the man, and he was authorized to get one. The state rechecked the database this week, and it still listed him as qualified to get a CDL, Shapiro said.

“They clearly are not minding the shop, and they’ve gotta get better, because every single state in the country relies on this database when making a determination as to who qualifies for a CDL. We relied on the feds before issuing this one,” Shapiro said.

California, which said it would revoke 17,000 licenses, is the only state the administration has acted against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The government shutdown delayed reviews in other states, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey, and Levy from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Pritzker’s executive order also explicitly calls for the commission to hold public hearings to document the conduct of federal officials.
The commission has been tasked with providing an initial report on its findings and recommendations to Pritzker no later than Jan. 31.","SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois Accountability Commission is continuing to ramp up even as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago region winds down, at least for now.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday announced the appointment of two new commissioners and additional staff to the independent commission he created via executive order last month. It is tasked with producing a public record of alleged abuses perpetrated by federal agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” It will also examine the impact of such conduct on Illinois residents and communities and offer recommendations for accountability and reform.

Pritzker appointed attorney Jimmy Arce, a former federal prosecutor who was involved in the Justice Department’s civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department; and Ric Estrada, the CEO of Metropolitan Family Services, which is one the state’s largest human services organizations. Eight commissioners have now been appointed.

“Since I signed the executive order, with guidance from the commissioners, the Illinois Department of Human Rights has been diligently working to set the foundation for this truly ground-breaking work to bring accountability for the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” Pritzker said. “The appointments of Jimmy and Ric to the Commission round out this incredible team of public servants committed to demanding answers and the ongoing pursuit of justice for the people of Illinois.”

Staff also hired

The commission has also hired Hina Mahood, a former deputy chief of staff at the Department of Human Services who most recently was director of Illinois initiatives for the JB & MK Pritzker Family Foundation, as its executive director.

The commission has also hired two attorneys with plans to hire more support staff in the coming weeks, the governor’s office said.

Pritzker announced the commission’s formation at the height of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement blitz, which the Department of Homeland Security claims — as of last month — resulted in the arrests of more than 3,300 people.

But it also led to violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, often outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview but also during enforcement operations in Chicago neighborhoods. Agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, often used riot control weapons like tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.

While DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois that the operation is “ongoing,” there is evidence that it quickly wound down last week, with Bovino leaving Chicago for North Carolina and taking many of his agents with him.

And Trump administration lawyers told a federal judge earlier this week that only four detainees were being held in the Broadview facility, a stunning decline from testimony earlier this month of former detainees who described holding rooms stuffed with hundreds of people.

However, the reprieve may be short-lived. The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that as many as 1,000 agents could hit the streets in March — four times the amount in town over the past two months.

Commission ramping up

The commission will ramp up its operations during the expected lull period.

Commissioners and staff have started outreach efforts, explored community partnerships and are conducting a “landscape analysis” of information already in the public domain to examine the impact of related and ongoing litigation, according to the governor’s office.

But it’s still a work in progress. Pritzker notably encouraged people to document interactions with federal agents by taking videos with their phones. But on the commission’s website, there was still no method to submit such evidence directly to the commission as of Thursday afternoon. Instead, people are encouraged to contact a hotline operated by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, an outside group.

“The commission will provide updates to the public if there are other avenues to share information,” the website states.

Beyond that, the website lists information about the commissioners and executive staff, the language of the executive order that created it, links to news releases about it and links directing people to legal help and information about their rights when interacting with law enforcement.

Pritzker’s executive order also explicitly calls for the commission to hold public hearings to document the conduct of federal officials. But no information is yet available about when those will be held or how members of the public can participate.

The commission has been tasked with providing an initial report on its findings and recommendations to Pritzker no later than Jan. 31.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They’ve also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven’t returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn’t target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump’s aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles.

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000.

Virginia Beach police said John W. Bennett, 54, and Mark B. Bennett, 59, were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit malicious wounding.

John Bennett is employed as an assistant principal at Kempsville High School. A spokesperson for Virginia Beach City Public Schools said he has worked for the division since 2009 and is currently on leave.

He was arrested in Virginia Beach at 10:47 a.m. Wednesday. On the same morning, Nov. 19, Mark Bennett was taken into custody at Norfolk International Airport at 9:42 a.m. with help from airport police.

According to a criminal complaint filed in Virginia Beach General District Court, an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the two brothers while dining inside a Pho restaurant on General Booth Boulevard on Nov. 15.

The officer reported hearing the men talk about ICE agents “kidnapping individuals” and said the conversation led him to believe the brothers “needed to do something about it.”

The complaint says the brothers discussed reuniting and that Mark Bennett said he planned to fly to Las Vegas to meet with “like-minded individuals” and return with “enforcement ideas and plans.”

Mark also allegedly said he had recently purchased an assault rifle because it could fire explosive rounds capable of penetrating body armor — and claimed he wanted to “go hunting.” Investigators wrote that John Bennett expressed support during the conversation and showed interest in joining the Las Vegas trip.

The off-duty officer told investigators that Mark Bennett disclosed he had purchased a plane ticket for Nov. 19. Detectives later confirmed the booking.

Following an arraignment on Thursday, both were granted bond.

“These allegations of violence against law enforcement, the very ones who protect and serve our communities, are incredibly alarming,” said VBPD Chief Paul W.

""The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) will not participate in immigration enforcement actions with ICE. They will adhere to House Bill 218, releasing individuals in their custody to ICE within the required two-day period.

Sheriff McFadden emphasized, ""We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community.

I will continue to protect this city and every single one of its citizens.""

Federal agents have arrested over 250 people during a North Carolina immigration crackdown centered around Charlotte, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday.

The operation, which began over the weekend, is part of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts, involving the deployment of military and immigration agents to Democratic-run cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles.

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that ""border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended"" in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies ""continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.""

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, ""ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.""

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods - school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

""We're only open because I'm an American citizen, so it doesn't bother me,"" he said. ""But of course, business is down. I have no customers.""

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

The agricultural industry is feeling the strain from President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, and Republican lawmakers are certainly hearing about it back home.

What elected officials will do about farmers’ frustrations is much less clear — an indication that relief could be far away.

“Members are beginning to talk about it, but it doesn’t feel as though a particular solution is coming into focus yet, and clearly the White House is going to be the most important player in these conversations,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, who sits on the House Agriculture Committee.

Ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in agricultural centers, from California to Wisconsin to New York, have increased pressure on members of Congress to provide fixes for farmers who say they are facing labor shortages.

In Wisconsin, for example, a 2023 University of Wisconsin study found that 70% of labor on the state’s dairy farms was done by undocumented workers. Many of those farmers have turned to existing temporary visas — like the H-2A visa, a seasonal agricultural visa — to staff their farms. The Trump administration moved to strip back labor protections for farmers hiring workers on the visa earlier this year, in an effort to streamline H-2A visas.

But those visas are inherently limited for year-round work, like at dairy farms.

The program is also associated with high costs and a slow-moving bureaucracy. Democrats and immigrant advocates said the administration’s move put workers at risk of abuse and exploitation. Approximately 17% of agricultural workers have an H-2A visa.

There are currently several proposed reforms floating around the Capitol.

A bipartisan bill introduced in May by Reps. Dan Newhouse and Zoe Lofgren proposes streamlining the H-2A visa process and providing visas for year-round agricultural employers.

Wisconsin Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden has proposed legislation that would allow undocumented farmworkers to gain legal employment status, as long as they haven’t committed a crime. Both immigrants and their employers would be required to acknowledge the worker’s status and pay a fine.

“We got to understand, at this point these people are our neighbors. Our kids go to school together, and they’re part of our communities,” Van Orden said. “I don’t want these people having to hide underneath a trailer when immigration shows up.”

Van Orden’s bill has no co-sponsors.

Lawmakers formed a task force in 2023 to consider possible reforms to the H-2A visa program and improve the industry’s reliable labor shortage.

The Republican-majority House Committee on Agriculture has readied a bill that largely follows task force recommendations — which include proposals to streamline administrative paperwork, expedite application review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and change the wage system — to overhaul the H-2A program.

Committee chair Rep. Glenn Thompson said the bill is awaiting “technical assistance” from the Department of Labor. That final step had been delayed by shutdown furloughs, he said. The Department of Labor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We’re very close to introducing a very strong, I’ll call it a tripartisan bill, because that includes Republicans, Democrats and individuals from the industry,” Thompson said.

The bill draft is expected to be ready for public review by early January.

Rep. Salud Carbajal, a Democrat on the agriculture committee, however, says he hasn’t heard from his Republican colleagues or the White House on the issue.

“There’s been no communication from my colleagues on the other side and from this administration,” he said.

Republicans say the White House is engaged on the issue. Thompson told NOTUS that he’s been in “frequent discussions” with the White House and the Department of Agriculture about immigrant farmworkers.

Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who also sits on the House Agriculture Committee, said the White House is “in the mood here to engage” on farmworker visas.

“A while back, the president acknowledged in a speech that we got to up the game on having more and simpler processes for having farm workers available. I know we feel that in California with our specialty crops,” LaMalfa said.

Trump in June suggested that farms would get a pass in the deportation crackdown — a statement that senior administration officials seemed to disagree with.

Immigration advocates haven’t been happy with the administration’s visa policy changes thus far.

Alexandra Sossa, the chief executive officer with the Farmworker and Landscaper Advocacy Project, said that her organization is “not in favor” of the H-2A visa program, which it associates with “human labor trafficking and labor exploitation.”

And now, with the ongoing immigration raids, she says, farmworkers who are brought to the country under the visa program fear deportation, and those who are considering coming under the program are apprehensive about doing so.

“We are talking about workers who wake up at 4 a.m. in the morning and start working at 5 a.m. and end working around 9 to 10 p.m., Monday to Sunday. So that’s not easy to find, and it’s a difficult job to do. The consequences on the economy are reflected when you go to the grocery store to buy food,” Sossa said.

Democrats, meanwhile, are calling for larger immigration reform to address the dangerous working conditions that the H-2A program has led to, while also giving a bigger pathway to work.

“When people are exploited, we’ve got to crack down on that,” Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat on the House Committee on Agriculture, said about the concerns regarding H-2A visas. “But I just think the climate that’s been created by this administration makes it difficult for some Republicans to even want to talk about the issue.”

“I hear from farmers all the time about concerns that their labor force will disappear, or that they can’t count on workers,” McGovern said.",https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asse2Q1A0071-copy.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&quality=100&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-20 14:57:28.488466

In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data.
During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives.
Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon.
In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves.","Peebles asked the probation manager if Horton could be arrested when he came in for a court date the next day. Horton’s probation file shows the manager said she would try to help.

But Horton never showed up to court, according to his probation file, and Nashville police didn’t arrest him until it was too late.

Ten days after that call, probation and police records show, Horton waited for Peebles outside her apartment. Khloe told WPLN she remembers seeing Horton pointing a gun at her mom. She remembers throwing her arms around his legs and pleading with him, “no, no, no.” She remembers trying to call 911 while her mom, shot in both legs, lay in the street bleeding to death.

Horton is now awaiting trial on charges of killing Peebles. He and his lawyer declined to comment for this story. The case file is sealed and the public defender’s office declined to comment further on whether Horton has entered a plea.

Throughout the period when Peebles reported he was threatening and hurting her, Horton was released repeatedly into the community under the stipulation that probation officers would be actively supervising him. But in Tennessee, a state with one of the highest rates of women killed by men, WPLN and ProPublica found that a deadly blind spot in the probation supervision system emerges at a time when experts say domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable.

When an offender under probation supervision violates the rules by being charged with a new crime or being found with a firearm, for example, a warrant may be issued for their arrest. When law enforcement serves that warrant, the offender can either end up behind bars or back out on probation while awaiting a court date.

But between the time a probation violation warrant is signed by a judge and when it is served, probation officers stop conducting any in-person supervision: For a high-risk offender, this means probation officers are no longer holding three in-person meetings per month; they also no longer conduct a monthly unannounced home visit to look for drugs and guns. That period of suspended face-to-face checks can stretch for months — in one instance, for more than 400 days.

In Horton’s case, he remained free, armed and dangerous for three months.

That pause of in-person supervision is spelled out in the Tennessee Department of Correction’s standards of supervision. Between 2019 and 2022, WPLN and ProPublica found at least six people, including Peebles, were shot to death during the gap in oversight. All were young Black mothers, ages 20 to 31. One victim was a cheerleading coach and a mom of two. Another woman was shot while her 2-year-old daughter lay on the bed nearby. In a third case, a mother of three was found in a creek days before Christmas with a purple domestic violence bracelet around her wrist. Their deaths left 12 children without their mothers.

TDOC declined to make any probation officials available for this story. In an emailed statement, Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said that “supervision remains active” for offenders who have warrants but “the objective changes.” Instead of ensuring offenders are abiding by the rules of probation, she said, officers help to bring that person into custody by sharing relevant case information with law enforcement. Gallagher confirmed there is no in-person supervision during that time.

This blind spot is one of the ways that the state failed to stop offenders from harming domestic violence victims. WPLN and ProPublica examined hundreds of fatal domestic violence shootings between 2007 and 2023 in Tennessee’s five most populous cities. The reporting, which expanded on our earlier investigations into Tennessee’s lax enforcement of gun prohibitions, found that among these fatal domestic violence shootings, at least 86 people — about 1 in every 4 — were allegedly killed by a suspect who was legally prohibited from having a firearm. Sixteen of those suspects were also on probation. In a Second Amendment-friendly state like Tennessee where laws make it easy for more people to carry firearms in more places, little can stop a person intent on getting a gun, even if they are legally barred from doing so. One backstop is the state’s probation officers, who are in close contact with violent, high-risk offenders and can search homes for prohibited weapons without a warrant if they have “reasonable suspicion,” TDOC said.

According to the department’s own documents, a probation officer’s mission is to ensure public safety. In cases where there is an open warrant, the department relies on law enforcement to prioritize the arrests of probation violators and on judges to incarcerate repeat violators instead of releasing them back into supervision and the community. The result: Some offenders like Horton return to the street.

“The system did her wrong,” Peebles’ mom, Karen Peebles, said. “If the police department had did their job, and the probation office had did theirs — I think it could have been prevented.”

“The Red Flags”

Peebles’s friends and family called her Chippie because she had a high, singsongy voice, like a chipmunk. She was loud, funny and always smiling. Almost every night, Peebles talked to her mom on the phone, and she never missed a Sunday dinner.

Her family said she started dating Horton around 2018, giving in after he had pursued her for years. She was hesitant, in part because of his criminal history. Horton had just started 10 years of supervised probation after he pleaded guilty to facilitation of second-degree murder in a robbery where a man was shot and killed.

“Even when she saw the red flags, she would just try anything in her power to try to make him better,” her cousin Princess Pinkston said. “She felt like she could save everybody.”

The probation department classified Horton as a high-risk violent probationer, which meant that every month his probation officer was required to see him face-to-face three times, conduct a home visit and check to make sure he hadn’t been arrested. This kind of supervision is more intensive and time-consuming than what low-risk offenders get.

In some probation departments across the country, probation officers are assigned either high-, medium- or low-risk offenders. Experts say this allows specialized teams to focus on intense monitoring of a smaller caseload of high-risk offenders, while lower-risk probationers are left to newer officers.

“It’s like the medical profession,” said Susan Rice, former president of the American Probation and Parole Association. “If you’re a specialist doctor and you do only the high-risk heart surgeries, you’re not going to have as many clients as a general practitioner who sees everybody that comes in with a runny nose.”

But in Tennessee, officers handle a mix of high-, medium- and low-risk offenders. And Tennessee’s probation offices do not have specialized domestic violence teams or training. A report from victim advocates more than a decade ago said these changes could save lives in the most dangerous cases. “This report should be viewed as a guide for where to begin changing policy,” the report reads, “and by doing so, ultimately reduce the occurrence of domestic violence homicides in Nashville-Davidson County.”

Rice said it is common practice nationwide to have mixed caseloads in probation departments. In an email, TDOC said the same, adding that all officers are “trained in areas like situational awareness and de-escalation techniques to identify warning signs and manage conflict.”

Most of the 16 alleged suspects who WPLN and ProPublica found were both prohibited from having a gun and under supervision by the probation department were deemed high or moderate risks by TDOC.

In addition, all 16 were under supervision in Memphis or Nashville, the state’s busiest offices. In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data.

Horton was assigned to the Nashville office, eventually coming under the supervision of probation officer Derrick Finch, who had been on the job a little more than a year at the time. Finch told WPLN that at one point he had more than 100 offenders in his caseload. Records show the department fired him in 2024 after seven years on the job for reporting that he conducted a home visit with an offender who was in custody at that time. Finch said he thought he had conducted the visit when he was entering his case notes at the end of the month.

“I got let go because I couldn’t keep up with the caseload anymore,” Finch explained in an interview with WPLN.

By early January of 2019, Horton had been on probation for about a year. His relationship with Peebles was fracturing and she was referring to him as her ex in court records. She joined her own family dinners less frequently, and when she did show up, her mom said, something was always off. She would wear long-sleeved shirts, even in the middle of sweltering Tennessee summers. Once she arrived on crutches, claiming she had fallen down the stairs. Another time she had a black eye, and told her family that a door had swung back and hit her.

Multiple studies have shown that the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim is when they are trying to leave their abuser, often turning to the courts and law enforcement for protection.

But the case notes in Horton’s probation file seem to only scratch the surface of what her family suspected was happening behind closed doors. The case notes show Finch ticking through a standardized assessment of Horton’s progress, noting his body language, behavior and next steps. “Offender reported as directed.”

“Offender was calm, alert and oriented.”

“Offender seeking full-time employment at this time.”

“Offender advises he is in process of moving in with his mother.”

“Will advise offender next report date.”

Finch said the department wants officers to have a rapport with the offenders they are supervising, “but who’s got time for that? It’s very hard to do everything they want you to do, because there’s so much to do.”

He said when a “problem child” arose in his caseload, there was not much he could do about it.

“If this guy wants to change, we can help him,” Finch said of probationers. “But if he doesn’t — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do?”

“A Slap on the Wrist”

In a court document, Peebles alleged that on Jan. 12, 2019, Horton went on Facebook Live and said he would kill her before he saw her with another man. He called her multiple times, she wrote, then showed up at her house, blocking her car with his. They started arguing. He punched her twice in the head. She ran to her car to escape and he chased her, she wrote. He tore the windshield wipers off of her car and used them to strike the glass as she cowered inside the locked vehicle. Horton fled when she called police.

What followed was a string of actions by probation officers, law enforcement and the courts that left Horton free and Peebles afraid.

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department filed a domestic assault charge against Horton. MNPD arrested Horton and searched his home for weapons, according to probation records. He paid a bond to get out of jail while awaiting his court date.

According to TDOC policy, Horton’s arrest on suspicion of domestic assault required Finch to file a report and request a warrant for a probation violation.

That policy says that warrants for violations posing “an immediate and/or imminent threat to public safety” should be requested “as soon as possible.” Finch submitted a violation warrant to his supervisor and requested a judge sign it on Jan. 22, 2019, according to probation records.

Once a judge signed it, the warrant was sent to police, who arrested Horton two days later. But at a court hearing, Peebles failed to appear to testify on the assault charge and the case was dismissed. Her mom said that Peebles did not show up because she was afraid, and that Horton had threatened her if she pursued charges.

“The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence,” Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office, said. “If the evidence isn’t there, we have no choice, we can’t go forward.”

For this reason, the Nashville Office of Family Safety has called for the district attorney’s office to rely more on evidence such as 911 calls, body camera footage or forensic exams instead of just victim testimony.

Once the assault charge against Horton was dropped, the probation violation that was based on those charges was dismissed. Horton remained in the community under Finch’s supervision.

And it didn’t take long before the process started all over again.

On Jan. 28, 2019, Horton was arrested in nearby Marshall County. Law enforcement officers reported finding four bags of a white substance believed to be cocaine on him, as well as a stolen Glock 26 9 mm handgun.

Being arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with the intent to sell is a probation violation, as is being a felon in possession of firearms.

So, records show, Finch requested another probation violation warrant to bring Horton in front of a judge. Horton was arrested and released on bond the next day.

Despite Horton’s status as a high-risk offender, his multiple arrests in a month and his possession of a prohibited firearm, Judge Jennifer Smith returned Horton to probation supervision instead of incarcerating him. In a statement to WPLN, Smith said she cannot comment on previous decisions.

In at least two other domestic violence gun homicide cases in 2021 a probationer was caught with a gun prior to the shooting — even though they were prohibited from having a firearm because of a prior conviction and because they were on probation. As with Horton, judges did not revoke their probation for being found with a gun.

“There are people who are telling us over and over again with their actions that they have no desire to change,” said Becky Bullard, deputy director of programs at Nashville’s Office of Family Safety, about abusers on probation who continue to perpetuate harm. “And when someone is waving that flag to us to say, ‘Hey, I’m out here practicing all of these high-risk behaviors with someone I’m supposed to care about,’ that is someone raising their hand and telling us that they’re about to murder.”

Shari Bryant was a Nashville probation officer from 2020 to 2025, and she said she left the job to become an accountant. She said it was common for someone to continuously violate probation with few consequences. Even in these high-risk, violent cases.

In one of the case files TDOC provided in response to WPLN and ProPublica’s record requests, a Memphis offender named Torian Williams was sentenced to probation for aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon. He was classified as a medium risk and charged while on probation for having two guns. He would go on to shoot and kill his 20-year-old girlfriend Demya Gordon in 2021. For that crime, he took a plea deal for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and was released to probation again. During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives. Williams died in 2025.

“Obviously, they’re not learning their lessons, right? They just keep getting a slap on the wrist,” Bryant said. “They keep getting out and getting away with it.”

That revolving door allowed Horton to remain on probation and return to the street again.

“He Is Going to Kill Me”

Months before she was killed, Peebles was in the bedroom of her apartment when she heard a loud boom at the back door. It was a stormy summer night, July 13, 2019.

“I got up walked to the door seen Brandon with a gun,” she wrote in a court document. He pointed the gun at her, and she ran out of her apartment. A neighbor later told the court that she was awakened by gunshots that went through her roof, her walls and her mirror. The neighbor, peeking through the blinds, saw Horton running with a gun in his hand. A few moments later, she saw Peebles climbing down a tree.

When police arrived, they could not find Horton. Metro Nashville Police Department charged him with felon in possession of a weapon, aggravated assault and aggravated burglary. And, for the third time in less than a year, Finch requested a probation violation warrant for Horton’s arrest.

Then, as is spelled out in TDOC’s standards of supervision, Finch stopped supervising Horton in person until police could arrest him. In the past, police served the warrant in a matter of days. This time, it would take three months for the police to catch up with Horton. For those three months, all that was required of Finch was a once-a-month check for arrests in the computer system. Police would not arrest Horton until after he allegedly killed Peebles. He has been behind bars ever since.

Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon.

“It’s kind of a messed-up process,” said Rice of the American Probation and Parole Association. “Do we really want that period of supervision to stop if they’re not incarcerated during that time?”

In the six cases of domestic violence homicide that occurred during this supervision gap, WPLN and ProPublica found the time between when a warrant was issued and when police made an arrest stretched from as few as nine days to as many as 425 days. In all six cases, the alleged offender was put on probation for a gun-related offense. In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves. But in Tennessee, officers must contact law enforcement. TDOC said while probation officers cannot make arrests themselves, they work with local, state and federal law enforcement, sharing information such as “addresses, photographs, known associates, and other leads” to assist in locating the offender.

When asked why it took so long to serve warrants in cases like Horton’s, the Metro Nashville Police Department said that “wanted persons frequently change where they stay or leave town and they are often difficult to locate.” MNPD said it works closely with probation officers to serve offenders if they continue to come in for office visits or when they show up for their court dates.

MNPD said it has one documented attempt to serve Horton’s violation warrant between the time it was issued in July and Oct. 17, when Peebles was killed. That attempt was on Oct. 9. Police said no one answered the door at Horton’s address.

Peebles requested another protection order against Horton in October 2019. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.

“Detectives spend their days researching people with outstanding warrants so they can arrest them,” said Debra Fessenden, chief policy adviser with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, an agency that handles warrants for Memphis. “No one is ignoring the warrants.”

She said that not all intelligence leads to a timely arrest.

“It’s not unusual — because of resources, training and protocol — that law enforcement decides, ‘We’ll just serve this when we pull someone over’” for a traffic stop, said Julia Weber, a California-based expert who trains law enforcement and probation departments on dangerous domestic violence cases.

“What I tell communities is we have to recognize how dangerous a decision that is.”

In her final days, records show that Peebles was increasingly aware of how much danger she was in.

She had already called the probation department once for help getting Horton’s warrant served at his Marshall County court date. Days later, on Oct. 11, she called again to say that Horton had failed to appear in court “because he spoke to officer finch and was told that he would be taken into custody at that time on his warrant,” the probation file notes. The manager wrote that Peebles was upset and that Horton was threatening to hurt her.

In an interview with WPLN, Finch denied warning Horton.

“Everything that could have been done was done from our end,” Finch said. “Once that warrant is filed, there is nothing else that we can do.”

Six days after Peebles’ final call to the probation department, Horton allegedly shot and killed her outside of her apartment while her daughter, Khloe, struggled to call for help. Horton was arrested the next morning, and Smith, the judge who had allowed his release, later revoked his probation.

“Chippie should be here with her child, with her mom,” said Pinkston, Peebles’ cousin. “She had told you many times, ‘No, he’s serious. He is going to kill me.’ … Now it’s too late.”

Khloe is in high school now. For a long time after her mom died, Khloe said, she heard the gunshots in her sleep. She lives in her mom’s childhood bedroom to feel closer to her.

She’s starting to fully understand the ways the system did not protect her mom from Horton. But the 14-year-old says she has lived each day since her mom’s death struggling with a guilt she cannot shake.

“I always felt like her death was on me,” Khloe said, remembering how she had forgotten her phone in the kitchen that day, so they returned to the apartment to get it. “If we would never went back to that house … maybe she would have still been here.”

New York state Sen. Lea Webb (D) said she was “deeply troubled” by the cancellations.","SYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR) — The Trump administration will no longer allow New York county courts or state supreme court justices to preside over citizenship ceremonies and has canceled many swearings-in already scheduled upstate.

In recent days, Nexstar’s WSYR has learned of naturalization ceremonies being canceled by the federal government without explanation across several New York counties.

Matthew Tragesser, spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), offered the following explanation to WSYR:

“USCIS is dedicated to ensuring that all aspects of the naturalization process comply with federal law. After reviewing the jurisdiction of certain New York county courts under the Immigration and Nationality Act, we have determined that these courts do not meet the statutory requirements to conduct naturalization ceremonies. As a result, USCIS will transition from judicial to administrative ceremonies to ensure compliance with the law. Aliens scheduled for ceremonies at these courts will be rescheduled, and their naturalization process will continue.”

Onondaga County Clerk Emily Bersani confirmed that the ceremony she had planned for Wednesday was canceled without specific reasoning. She hasn’t been informed about the status of ceremonies planned for 2026, including the annual New Americans Day event at the New York State Fair.

In general, a judge presides over New York ceremonies in a courthouse. USCIS conducts administrative ceremonies in regional offices.

It’s unclear what impact the change will have on naturalization ceremonies typically held in federal courtrooms, as is customary at the Federal Building in Downtown Syracuse.

The federal court’s Northern District of New York has multiple scheduled ceremonies still listed on its website. A spokesperson for the district said Wednesday the ceremonies were still being planned.

New York state Sen. Lea Webb (D) said she was “deeply troubled” by the cancellations.

“These milestones honor the commitment of families who have spent years legally navigating our immigration system to affirm their place in the country and state. The decision to halt or obstruct these events is unacceptable and undermines the process for citizenship and the values of fairness and opportunity for our communities,” Webb said. “We need the full restoration of naturalization ceremonies so that our state can continue to welcome new citizens with dignity and respect.”

State Sen. Chris Ryan (D) added that the move is “deeply concerning” and feels “unpatriotic.” In a lengthy response, Ryan said he had attended multiple naturalization ceremonies in 2025 in which he witnessed immigrants being “moved to tears” after earning their citizenship through hard work and while maneuvering the complex legal system.

“While maintaining secure borders is important, discouraging immigrants from becoming lawful U.S. citizens runs counter to our nation’s values,” Ryan said. “I strongly urge the USCIS and the Federal Administration to reconsider their decision and resume naturalization ceremonies in Upstate New York.”

New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a letter to USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, demanded answers regarding the cancellations, which she said were reported in Broome, Onondaga, Rockland, Schenectady, Tompkins, Washington and Westchester counties. She further noted that the move had raised alarm among both Democratic and Republican state officials.

One such Republican, Binghamton Mayor Jared Kraham, relayed his disappointment in a Facebook post, saying “the Trump administration’s handling of immigration matters continues to raise concerns.” He also called on the USCIS to restore and reschedule the canceled ceremonies.

“The individuals who were days away from taking their oath of citizenship deserve the chance to complete that journey,” Kraham wrote. “Any further delay means playing politics with people’s lives.”

SCOTUS Quick Hits

Former Justice Stephen Breyer is scheduled to speak to students at Suffolk University in Boston this morning. The event is closed to the public.

Tomorrow, the justices will take part in a private conference, where they will discuss cases and vote on petitions for review.

Mark your calendars: SCOTUSblog will be hosting a live blog during the oral argument in Trump v. Slaughter on Monday, Dec. 8. The live blog will begin at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Morning Reads

Opposition to tariffs is widespread but few Americans expect the Supreme Court to strike them down (Taylor Orth, YouGov) — A new survey from YouGov investigated how Americans view trade and the Supreme Court case on President Donald Trump’s signature tariffs. The survey showed that more Americans expect the court to “allow Trump’s tariffs to stand than expect it will strike them down (42% vs. 25%).” There was a partisan gap on this question, with 34% of Democrats saying that the court “probably will strike down Trump’s tariffs” compared to 18% of Republicans.

Appeals court panel rejects Trump’s ‘Big Lie’ defamation lawsuit against CNN (Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein, Politico) — On Tuesday, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that Trump’s defamation lawsuit against CNN cannot continue because CNN’s challenged behavior is protected by the First Amendment. Trump had been seeking to hold the network accountable for using the phrase “Big Lie,” which is “often associated with Adolf Hitler,” in coverage of his “false claims of fraud in the 2020 election,” according to Politico. “Trump could ask the full bench of the 11th Circuit to rehear the case or appeal to the Supreme Court. A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team signaled the president would appeal, saying he ‘will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion.'”

Trump administration prevails in appeal over tear gas tactics in Chicago (Diana Novak Jones, Reuters) — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit on Tuesday “blocked a judge’s order that had restricted how ICE agents could use tear gas and other weapons on people protesting immigration crackdowns in Chicago,” according to Reuters. The pause is in effect at least until the court “more fully review[s]” the order, which, according to the Trump administration, led to impermissible micromanagement of federal law enforcement officers. This dispute over the activities of federal immigration agents is taking place as the Supreme Court considers whether Trump can deploy the National Guard to Chicago.

Texas judge temporarily blocks law requiring Ten Commandments in schools (Michelle Watson, CNN) — On Tuesday, a federal judge in Texas “issued a preliminary injunction requiring certain Texas public school districts to remove displays of the Ten Commandments,” holding that the displays violate the First Amendment’s establishment clause, according to CNN. “It is the latest victory in a series of legal challenges to laws requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments” in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. “Legal experts have said it’s likely the cases will eventually reach the US Supreme Court.”

Just Announced: ‘Heroes of 1776’ by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch (Iyana Jones, Publishers Weekly) — Last week, Justice Neil Gorsuch announced that he’s working on a children’s book about the Declaration of Independence during an interview with Fox News. On Tuesday, Publishers Weekly shared more details about the project. “Heroes of 1776: The Story of the Declaration of Independence will cover many influential figures in the creation of the founding document, ranging from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin to lesser-known figures such as Caesar Rodney and Thomas Paine.” The book “will hit shelves on May 5, 2026.”

A Closer Look: Upcoming Petitions for Review

The justices will next consider petitions for review at a private conference on Friday. Several such cases can be found on our petitions page, which highlights particularly notable disputes awaiting the Supreme Court’s attention.

Here’s a closer look at three of the issues that will be in front of the justices tomorrow.

Birthright citizenship

Last term, the court weighed in on a case stemming from President Donald Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship without considering the merits of that order. Instead, the justices addressed the universal injunctions used to put the order on hold nationwide and held that federal district courts lacked the authority to issue such injunctions.

Now, the court has been asked to directly consider whether birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the Constitution. The Trump administration raised that issue in two nearly identical petitions filed at the end of September, contending that the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause “was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children—not to the children of temporary visitors or illegal aliens.”

The respondents in the cases, including families who claim they would be affected by the order and a group of states, have argued that the administration is misinterpreting the 14th Amendment and overlooking related federal laws and Supreme Court precedent. They’ve urged the court to deny review and, in that way, prevent the order from taking effect.

Voting Rights Act

Last month, the court heard a second round of oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais and considered whether intentionally creating majority-minority congressional districts to satisfy Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. A majority of justices appeared ready to curtail Section 2, which outlaws discrimination in voting practices, by potentially making it harder to bring a Section 2 claim, as SCOTUSblog reported at the time.

On Friday, the justices will weigh several petitions for review raising the same or similar questions about Section 2 of the VRA as Callais. But unlike Callais, they ask whether Section 2 allows lawsuits by private plaintiffs.

In a brief opinion concurring in a 2021 decision on Arizona voting provisions, Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, noted that the court in several cases has assumed that private plaintiffs may bring such a suit, but has never decided this issue.

Parental rights

In Foote v. Ludlow School Committee, which was described by Amy in recent piece, the justices have been asked to consider parental rights in public schools by a Massachusetts couple who contend that school officials encouraged their middle-school-aged child to adopt a new gender identity without their knowledge or consent. Such actions violate the right of parents to direct their child’s upbringing and education, they said, as well as their right to make medical and mental health decisions for their child.

School officials have urged the court not to take up the case, stating that the teachers’ actions did not stem from formal guidance of the Ludlow School Committee. Rather, the court should wait to weigh in on parental rights in public schools until a dispute presents “actual school district policies” that can be addressed, they wrote.

When the court turned down a similar appeal last month, Justice Samuel Alito wrote a statement, joined by Thomas and Gorsuch, in which he acknowledged that denying review was the correct decision but described policies “that purposely interfere with parents’ access to critical information about their children’s gender identity choices and school personnel’s involvement in and influence on those choices” as of “great and growing national importance.”

Parental Rights

Last month, the Supreme Court turned down an appeal from a group of Colorado parents who argued that a school district interfered with their parental rights when it left them out of discussions about their children’s gender identity. On Friday, the justices will consider a similar request from a Massachusetts couple who contend that school officials not only socially transitioned their middle-school-aged child over their objections but also hid that fact from them.

If your child has a court case with child welfare authorities, ICE should keep you near that court.
If there is a detention center closer to your child or the child welfare court, you can ask ICE to move you there.
If a court or child welfare agency requires you to visit with your child, ICE policy says they must make that visitation possible.
Helping to set up calls or meetings with a case worker, if your child is in the child welfare system.","If ICE arrests you, ICE’s policy says the arresting officer should allow you to make arrangements for your child’s care. You can demand to call family or someone else you trust to come get your child and make plans for their care. ICE is supposed to wait until that person arrives and is not supposed to leave your child alone. If you cannot find someone to take care of your child or if the arresting officer thinks your child is being hurt or neglected, ICE policy says the officer must call child protective services. In that case, that agency will come to take custody of your child.

If ICE is arresting you, their policy says they should not take your child as well. That means ICE officers are not allowed to put your child in their car or take them away from a parent being arrested, unless they have a warrant to arrest the child too.

It is also important to know that:

You do not have to tell the immigration agent your child’s immigration status. You should only tell them who will take care of your child and ask to call that person. The person you choose to care for your child should have legal status or U.S. citizenship.

If the arresting officer has a warrant for your child or finds out your child does not have legal status, they may detain your child with you. You could be sent to a facility for adults and your child might be sent to a different facility for children, or you could be jailed together.

If you have a child who came to the U.S. alone and was later placed in your care by the government (a child considered an “unaccompanied child” or former “unaccompanied child”), ICE’s policy says the arresting officer must contact local authorities.

If your child is a U.S. citizen or has valid legal status, ICE is not supposed to arrest or detain them.

While you are in ICE detention, ICE’s policy says they should not transfer or move you away from your child. If your child has a court case with child welfare authorities, ICE should keep you near that court. If there is a detention center closer to your child or the child welfare court, you can ask ICE to move you there. The choice is up to ICE to approve or deny your request.

If you want to see your child while in detention, you have the right to have regular visits with your child. ICE’s policy says you have to make your request in writing. Do not let that stop you from asking to visit your child in person, but you might have to write it down or have someone help you write it down. Jail staff are supposed to help set up a visit within 30 days after you ask. In some jails, in-person visits are not allowed. If that happens, jail staff should help you have a video or telephone call with your child. You can also ask to be moved to a jail that allows in-person visits, but ICE does not promise they will approve that ask.

If a court or child welfare agency requires you to visit with your child, ICE policy says they must make that visitation possible.

Some jails have people called “custody and removal coordinators.” They are not the same as your ICE officer. Some jails may call them “social workers” even though that is not their official title. Their job is to help you make plans for someone else to care for your child while you are in ICE detention. They can also help you talk to a case worker in the child welfare system if you have a child in the court system and you need help making case plan requirements to get your child back. This help might include:

Helping to set up phone or video calls with lawyers.

Helping you ask for a visit from your consulate to apply for passports or other travel documents.

Helping to set up calls or meetings with a case worker, if your child is in the child welfare system.

Sharing information with your child’s caregiver about when you may be deported so that you can try to leave together.

It is also important to tell the custody and removal coordinator or any other staff in the detention facility if your parental status changes so they can make sure your parental rights are protected. For example, if you or your partner has a new baby born while you are in detention, or if one of your children enters the state child welfare system, it is important for the custody and removal coordinator to know

If you have a family or child welfare proceeding that is necessary to keep or get back custody of your child, you have the right to appear in-person for that hearing. You, the court, or the child welfare agency court must give ICE a written document that says you must participate in such proceedings. This document could be a court notice, a letter, or a court order.

If ICE says they can’t take you to court in person, they may set up another form of participation, like a telephone or video appearance. If there is a custody and removal coordinator in the jail you are being held in, they can also help set this up.

If ICE is going to deport you, you have the right to make decisions about what happens to your child. You can decide to have your child remain in the United States, whether they are a U.S. citizen or immigrant child, even if they do not have legal status. While it is your choice to have your child stay in the United States, ICE policy says the officer is required to have you put this decision in writing. If this is not done, then ICE officers must swear that this was what you told them was your choice. The custody and removal coordinator or other staff are supposed to help you make plans to leave your child with another caregiver, if that is your choice.

You can also decide that your child will leave the United States and come with you. This includes U.S. citizen and immigrant children. In some cases, ICE may give you time to buy flights so you can leave the country together. It may also be the case that a child follows you to your home country after your deportation. ICE is also supposed to allow you to talk with lawyers, consulates, and family members to help you make plans and sign important documents before you leave the country.

You can make a different choice for each of your children if that is what you think is best for them. The choice is yours about what happens to your children, no matter what ICE officers may tell you.

We know many immigrant parents may not have the time or money to hire a lawyer to speak up for them. If your ICE officer is ignoring your requests, or if the custody and removal coordinators are not helping you, you can try calling ICE’s Detention, Removals, and Information Line (DRIL) to make a complaint.

This hotline is free for people in ICE detention. The DRIL line has people who speak different languages and can talk with you, but you might have to wait on hold. Look for a flyer in your housing unit with the DRIL line number (it may be 9116# or 1-888-351-4024).",https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cropped-cropped-nilc-resource-social-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:58:03.110024

Foreword from the Home Secretary

The story of migration in Britain is the story of my family, and many others like us. My father came here in the early 1970s, and my mother a little less than a decade later. Both came to seek a better life, and they found one here in Britain. They became Brits themselves, and Brummies too.

They brought up four children just as proud to be a part of this country, and that great city, as them. This is not just my story. It is the story of many of my constituents in Birmingham Ladywood. It is the story of many millions more across this country.

I am a patriot. Mine is a love of this country: one that is forever changing, while something essential about it always endures. It is a patriotism that finds room for those who trace their roots back many generations, and those, like me, who do not.

But for some in our country today, this broad patriotism is narrowing. Divides are growing. The goal of building a greater Britain is giving way to the lure of a littler England.

Some will choose to scorn this analysis. They would rather we simply wished it away. But those who look like me do not have that luxury. Our lives – and the lives of our families – are more dangerous in a country that turns inwards. We have no choice but to ask: what is the cause of our division? And how might this country be united?

It is clear the pace and scale of migration in this country has not just been unprecedented but also destabilising. Between 2021 and 2024, we have seen net migration of an additional 2.6 million people. Around one in every 30 people in this country today arrived in these four years.

This extraordinary open border experiment was the legacy of the last Conservative government. The bar to entry was lowered significantly. This was most evident in the Health and Care visa. An attempt to fill between 6,000 and 40,000 jobs saw the arrival of 616,000 individuals from 2022 to 2024. Over half were not even arriving to work in that sector but were instead dependants of those who were. Fraud, as any constituency Member of Parliament can tell you, was rife.

The successful story of migration in Britain has always depended on two things. Firstly, that each wave of migrants becomes a part of our wider cultural life. And secondly, that they pay back to the country that has given them a home. This does not mean assimilation. We have built a multi-faith, multi-ethnic democracy that is pluralistic, grounded in tolerance towards difference. But it does demand contribution and integration.

To become a part of this country, permanently, is therefore not a right but a privilege – and one that must be earned. This government has already announced that we will lift the starting point at which most people can receive indefinite leave to remain to ten years. In this consultation, we set out the conditions by which settlement might then be earned.

Some of these conditions are required to qualify for settlement at any time. Today, settlement is near automatic. The only qualifications required are to have lived in this country for, in most cases, five years, and to have not received a prison sentence of over a year. Now, the qualifying bar will be set higher. Applicants must have a clean criminal record. They must speak English to a high standard. They must make a sustained and measurable economic contribution. Finally, they must have no debt in this country.

On top of that, we are consulting on a series of conditions that could either add to, or subtract from, the baseline 10-year qualifying period. An earlier settlement could be available to those who make an outsized contribution to our national life, such as high-talent, high taxpayers; those who have worked at a certain level of seniority in our public services; or those who have volunteered extensively in their local communities.

Separately, and not subject to consultation, settlement will be quicker for those who have a uniquely strong attachment to this country, including the spouses and dependants of British citizens and British Nationals (Overseas) (BN(O)s) from Hong Kong.

We propose that settlement is delayed for those who contribute less to our public life. This includes those who have claimed benefits payments. A long penalty would also be applied to those who have entered the country illegally – aiming to strongly discourage entering the country via these routes. This follows the announcement of a new, 20-year settlement path for refugees who remain on the new ""core protection"" support.

The consultation is open on some cohorts of special interest. This includes settlement rights for children, members of the armed forces, and victims of certain crimes.

As well as considering the responsibilities that are expected of those who seek a permanent life in this country, the consultation also raises the question of what rights are provided as a result. Specifically, it proposes that benefits should not be available to those who have settled status, and asks whether they should instead be reserved for those who have achieved British citizenship.

This consultation also addresses the specific question of low-skilled and low-wage migrants who arrived on the Health and Care visa. Migrants on lower wages who bring non-working dependants and children are likely to present significant fiscal costs to the UK. It is therefore right that we apply more stringent controls for this group before they qualify for settled status. Under our current rules, they will usually qualify for benefits payments and council housing five years after arrival. As the majority of this group began arriving from 2022 onwards, this is currently set to begin in 2027. We consult here on a separate baseline qualifying period, of 15 years, for this group.

Crucially, for these and every other group mentioned here, we propose to apply these changes to everyone in the country today who has not already received indefinite leave to remain. This would mean that those who are due to reach settlement in the coming months and years would be subject to the new requirements for earned settlement, as soon as our immigration rules have changed.

We will not, and would never, take away settled status from those who have already been granted it. These are people who have been in our country for years, even decades. They have families here. They have contributed to our society. Fairness is the most fundamental of British values. We made these people a promise when we gave them settlement. We welcomed them here permanently at that point, and we do not break our promises.

This document sets out how we will introduce a new model of settlement that is earned, not automatic. I invite all of those who have an interest in this matter to respond to this consultation with their views and recommendations.

Perhaps most importantly, I have set out here why we believe these changes are necessary. I love this country, which opened its arms to my parents around fifty years ago. But I am profoundly concerned by the division I see in it now, which is fuelled by a pace and scale of migration that is placing immense pressure on local communities.

For those who believe that migration is part of modern Britain's story, and must continue to be, we must prove that migration still works for this country. That means that those who come here must contribute, play their part, and enrich our national life. That is how we can retain our position as the greatest multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy in the world.

Introduction

Settlement plays a vital role in fostering integration and cohesion, and this government is clear that these are not automatic entitlements but privileges that must be earned through meaningful contribution. This government proposes a revised framework, where individuals must demonstrate sustained compliance, economic activity, and alignment with British values.

This approach ensures that those granted settlement and citizenship are well-integrated, economically self-sufficient, and committed to the communities they join, thereby strengthening social cohesion and public confidence in the immigration system.

This paper sets out the details of a consultation on proposals to reform the current settlement rules in favour of an ""earned settlement"" model. This consultation is open to anyone who wishes to share their views, including individuals, organisations, and other stakeholders who may be affected by or have an interest in the proposed changes. It will run for 12 weeks. The consultation questionnaire can be found at Annex B of this paper.

A paper summarising the responses to this consultation, alongside economic and equality impact assessments, will be published in due course.

In line with the UK's obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement, settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) is out of scope for both this consultation and the planned reforms. Grants of settlement related to the Windrush Scheme are also out of scope for both this consultation and the planned reforms. There will be no changes implemented for either scheme in relation to the settlement reforms.

Individuals who already hold settled status are also out of scope of measures to reform the granting of settlement and, therefore, this consultation.

The issue of providing a clear pathway to settlement for children in care and care leavers is also out of scope of this consultation

Approach

Settlement grants are expected to significantly increase over the next 5 years, around 1.6 million people are forecast to settle between 2026 and 2030, with a peak in annual volumes of around 450,000 in 2028. This expected increase is driven by increased immigration in 2022–2024, especially of those on Health and Care visas.

For migrants to make a positive fiscal contribution, they must contribute more through taxation than they cost by using public services. The fiscal contribution of migrants varies across different migrant cohorts, influenced by factors such as employment rate, income level, age, and their propensity to use different types of public services.

The consultation will seek views on options to reduce the current forecast volumes and associated impact over the coming years. We are consulting on a number of options to achieve this, namely a) increasing the baseline qualifying period for settlement to 10 years b) increasing the qualifying period for settlement to 15 years for those in the Skilled worker route in a role below RQF level 6 (equivalent to a bachelor's degree), and c) implementing a No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) condition at Settlement. Following the consultation, the government will set out its preferred option, or combination of options, to achieve this.

Earned Settlement

'Earned settlement' is a principle that recognises the value of long-term contribution to the UK. Rather than granting settlement after a fixed period, this approach ensures that individuals demonstrate sustained commitment through work, community involvement, or other meaningful contributions before being granted permanent status. It aims to reward those who actively support the country's social and economic fabric, reinforcing fairness and public confidence in the immigration system.

The new model will increase the standard qualifying period for settlement to ten years. However, individuals will also have the opportunity to reduce this period based on their contributions to the UK economy and society.

It is proposed that the earned settlement system will be based on a 'time adjustment' model, built on four core pillars and designed to ensure that applicants make a meaningful contribution to UK society and meet clear, measurable standards. These four core pillars will be:

• Character – This reformed system will, as now, provide for the refusal of applications where core requirements relating to their character and conduct (including criminal record, compliance with immigration requirements and considerations pertaining to the public good) are met. It will be mandatory to meet such requirements, and there will be no ability to trade with other considerations to determine the qualifying period. We will conduct a root and branch review of the criminality thresholds that apply across all immigration routes. Our expectation is that you should not be able to settle with a criminal record. Revised thresholds will be set out in due course.

• Integration – The reformed system will ensure that applicants demonstrate meaningful engagement with British society.

• Contribution – The reformed system will reward individuals who have made a sustained and measurable economic contribution to the UK, on the principle that any accelerated path to settlement should be earned through active participation in the economy.

• Residence – The reformed system will recognise lawful, continuous residence in the UK. Individuals will not, however, normally qualify on the basis of residence alone.

The default qualifying period for settlement will be increased from the current 5 years to 10 years, with exceptions for certain groups or individuals.

In developing an earned settlement system, we will take full account of the appropriate pathways to settlement and citizenship for children either born in the UK or arriving here. This will include unaccompanied children and other vulnerable children or families. We will take account of their specific needs and vulnerabilities. We particularly welcome views on how the development of an earned settlement system should take account of children.

The current definition of settlement

Settlement in the UK is a prerequisite for becoming a British citizen and brings lifelong benefits. Settlement is also an important step in integrating and contributing to local communities and the wider country.

Settlement is defined as a person having no time limit on their stay in the UK and being ordinarily resident. Settlement is the right to live permanently in the UK without conditions in relation to accessing the labour market and public funds and so confers significant benefits. The holder can work, study and access public funds for which they qualify.

Settlement can only be revoked for reasons of criminality; deception or fraud in obtaining the status; or other significant non-conducive reasons. A person's settled status is invalidated if they are deported. Settled status may also lapse if the holder remains outside the UK for more than 2 years.

Settlement is a prerequisite to being eligible for naturalisation as a British citizen.

Of the almost 70 different routes within the Immigration Rules, approximately 40 lead to settlement. The routes to settlement fall under one of four broad categories:

• Work: for applicants who have completed a qualifying period on an unsponsored route (Innovator, Global Talent, Investor) or a sponsored work route (Skilled Worker/Minister of Religion/Sportsperson) or legacy unsponsored work routes (Representative of an Overseas Business/UK Ancestry and ECAA workers/business persons). Work routes leading to settlement generally allow for the worker to be accompanied or joined by their dependent partner and children.

• Family: for a family member of a person who is British, settled in the UK, is an EU citizen with pre-settled status under the EUSS or has limited leave as a refugee or as a person granted humanitarian protection. Family applicants may be accompanied or joined by their dependent partner and children and some other dependent relatives are allowed - for example, adult dependant relatives.

• Protection: currently for applicants who have completed a period of limited leave as a refugee or as a person granted humanitarian protection. These routes allow for the person to be accompanied or joined by dependent partners and children, and other family members in exceptional circumstances.

• Other: includes applicants on the family route who are victims of domestic violence or bereaved partners, those who qualify on the basis of their long residence or private life, discharged members of HM Forces, stateless persons, adopted children, and those granted discretionary leave, leave outside the rules.

How does the system operate now?

The core requirements for settlement include that the applicant must have spent a qualifying period, which is usually 5 years, with a visa on a route to settlement. There are some routes that allow immediate settlement, and some which offer a shorter qualifying period of 3 years. These routes are detailed in the section below.

To qualify for settlement the person must have demonstrated integration (showing knowledge of English language and life in the UK) and not breached immigration law or committed criminal offences. In some cases, there are also route-specific requirements.

There are also longer routes to settlement (typically ten years) for individuals who have not met the core requirements of standard settlement pathways, have breached immigration laws, or would otherwise be refused on suitability grounds, but whose cases involve human rights considerations.

Of the 70 immigration routes, not all lead to settlement, these routes include for example as a visitor, student, or temporary worker.

Latest evidence on settlement

Historical settlement applications

The number of grants of settlement, also known as indefinite leave to remain (ILR), in a given year is a function of a combination of factors, including previous years' immigration levels, changes in policy and operational priorities. [1] The number of people granted settlement peaked in 2010 at almost 250,000, but has remained below 200,000 in every subsequent year, averaging 111,000 per year from 2011 to 2024. [2] This document does not consider those granted settled or pre-settled status as part of the EUSS. [3]

The spike in settlement in 2010 was due to a large number of grants on a discretionary basis (82,295 grants in 2010), mainly under measures aimed at clearing the backlog of outstanding unresolved cases. [4] The fall in settlement grants from 2010 to 2016 was in part due to a 2012 policy change that increased the residence requirement for Family visas from 2 to 5 years, delaying some grants that would otherwise have been made earlier. [5]

Since 2017, settlement grants have been rising. In the year ending Q2 2025, there were 163,000 grants of settlement, up 18% from the previous year. [6] The overall rise in settlement grants since 2017 has been driven by a combination of factors. There has been a significant rise in entry clearance visas granted on most routes to settlement, excluding Covid impacted years. There has also been an increase in extensions of stay over the period on major routes to settlement. [7] Since 2017, settlement volumes from the Skilled Worker/Tier 2 route have risen considerably to levels comparable with the pre-2012 predecessor routes.

Figure 1: Settlement applications and grants, year ending 2004 to 2024 [8] (thousands)

[…]

The majority of people who went on to achieve settlement between 2021 and 2024 did so after initially coming to the UK on work routes (31% in 2024), family routes (30% in 2024), or to study (11% in 2024). [9] The number who came initially as Asylum claimants has fluctuated over the period, but has increased since 2021. [10] A significant proportion of those granted settlement since 2021 were dependants, typically the partners or children of those who came to work and study. Dependants made up 26% of total settlement grants between 2021 and 2024. [11]

[…]

Figure 2.2: Routes to settlement by prior category of leave, 2021 to 2024 [13] (thousands

[…]

Not all visa routes provide a direct route to settlement. For example, migrants entering on study routes will typically need to switch onto routes such as Work or Family before applying for settlement. Between 2021 and 2024, Study made up 13% of Settlement volumes by initial category of leave (i.e. the route on which migrants arrived in the UK), compared to just 1% by prior category of leave (i.e. the route migrants were on at the point they applied for settlement). [14] In 2024, 37% of settlement grants had Family as their category of leave prior to settlement, compared to 33% who were on Work routes. [15]

Future settlement forecast

In the next five years, settlement volumes are forecast to increase significantly, due to the unprecedented level of migration to the UK in recent years. Most of those forecast to settle arrived in the UK between 2021 and 2024, a period of record high net migration. [16]

While significant uncertainty exists over the future behaviour of potential applicants, the Home Office estimates that between 1.3 million and 2.2 million people will settle in the UK between 2026 and 2030 (central estimate 1.6m), peaking at between 359,000 and 620,000 in 2028 (central estimate 450,000).

Figure 3: Settlement Forecast - actuals (2017-2024) and forecast (2025-2030) [17] - thousands

[…]

These estimates are based on published Home Office data on migrant inflows to the UK through to 2024, and a set of assumptions on the propensity of these individuals to choose to settle in the UK. In essence, the central scenario assumes settlement behaviour in line with historical patterns, with a range modelled around it to reflect uncertainty in the propensity to settle.

Three factors underlie this increase in settlement, over and above historical patterns:

• First, the 154,000 people granted a Hong Kong BN(O) LTE or LTR visa in 2021 and 2022 will become eligible to settle in 2026 and 2027 [18]. The Home Office forecasts 92,000 additional settlement applications from this cohort in 2026 and 54,000 in 2027. [19]

• Second, the significant increase in people granted a Health and Care entry clearance visa, including a significant cohort working in the care sector, totalling 616,000 between 2022 and 2024 will become eligible for settlement between 2027 and 2029. [20] The Home Office estimates that the UK will see 384,000 additional settlement applications from this cohort over this period, with a peak at 210,000 in 2028.

• Finally, the number of granted Skilled Worker entry clearance visas also spiked between 2022 and 2024, totalling 344,000. [21] These visas will also become eligible for settlement between 2027 and 2029, and the Home Office estimates that this cohort will account for around 222,000 settlement applications over this period.

Skilled Worker main applicants, both on Health and Care visas and other routes, have brought increased numbers of dependants since 2021. A significant proportion of the cohort expected to be granted settlement from these routes will be dependants, many of them children. Greater numbers of dependants could lead to an increased likelihood of applying for settlement, pushing up settlement numbers further.

Characteristics of recent migrants on a path to settlement

There is uncertainty over the settlement behaviour of migrants based on individual characteristics beyond their initial visa category. However, as the makeup of migration has changed over the last five years, so will the characteristics of those claiming settlement over the next five years.

Changes in Work Migration

Between 2021 and 2024, there has been significant growth in lower-skilled migration on work routes, particularly on the Health and Care visa, which is estimated to make up nearly half (47%) of settlement grants in 2028.

The implementation of the Skilled Worker visa in December 2020, which replaced the previous Tier 2 visa, changed the skill composition of migrants coming to the UK under work routes. Under the Tier 2 system, eligibility was largely restricted to occupations at RQF Level 6 and above - typically graduate-level roles. [24] In contrast, the Skilled Worker route expanded eligibility to include RQF Level 3 to 5 roles, as well as removing previous numerical ceilings on admissions under the route, opening the door to medium and lower-skilled workers. In 2021, 13% of Skilled Worker main applicant visas issued were below RQF 6, rising to 53% in the year ending June 2024.

Changes to the Health and Care route also affected the skill mix. In February 2022, at the advice of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), Senior Care and Care Workers were made eligible for the Health and Care route. [25] Around half of Health and Care entry clearance visas issued to main applicants in 2022 were issued to Senior Care and Care Workers, rising to over 70% in 2023. [26] This led to a sharp increase in visa grants for below RQF 6 roles; 75% of Skilled Work visas on the Health and Care route were issued to occupations below RQF Level 6 in 2023, up from 11% in 2021. [27]

Between 2021 and 2024, there was also a significant increase in the number of dependants being brought to the UK. Over 2016-2019 Tier 2 General visa holders brought 0.74 dependants per main applicant on average. [28] Over 2021 to 2024 Skilled Workers (including Health and Care) brought on average 1.14. [29] From 2022 to 2023 Health and Care visa holders brought significantly more dependants than other routes, 56% of visas issued to new entrants on the Health and Care visa were issued to dependants in this period compared to just 43% of Skilled Worker visas. [30] Research by the Migration Observatory indicates that main applicants who come with dependants are more likely to obtain settlement than those who come alone. [31]

The Home Office's settlement forecast, based on historical settlement behaviour, includes 462,000 individuals between 2026 and 2030 who arrived on the Health and Care route.

This represents a substantial new cohort, as there were no settlement grants from this route prior to 2025. Skilled Worker settlement volumes will also increase over this period; Home Office forecast that there will be 306,000 settlement grants from individuals who arrived on non-Health and Care Skilled Worker visas over the same period. This equates to 61,000 settlement grants per year, up from 39,000 settlement grants in 2024 for individuals who arrived on Worker visas. Given that most of the growth in entry clearance on these routes has been in lower skilled jobs, a large proportion of settlement grants to Skilled Workers from 2026 to 2030 will be to lower-skilled worker cohorts and their dependants.

Changes in Family Migration

Prior to April 2024, individuals sponsoring a Partner on the Family visa had to meet a minimum income requirement (MIR) of £18,600. This increased by 56% to £29,000 in April 2024. [32] This marked the first rise in the MIR since its introduction at £18,600 in 2012. The MIR declined significantly in real terms over this time due to inflation.

Based on historical settlement behaviour, the Home Office forecasts around 280,000 migrants could settle between 2026-2030 from Family and dependant routes. The majority of these will have arrived in the UK before the 2024 MIR increase.

Changes in Study Migration

The numbers of migrants arriving in the UK on the Study route increased substantially from 2021 to 2024 compared to previous years. From 2017 to 2019, an average of 238,000 student visas were issued per year under the previous Tier 4 – General Student route. [33] From 2021 to 2023, this increased to 532,000 per year. Student main applicants over this period brought significantly more dependants. [34] From 2017 to 2019, Students brought 0.06 dependants per main applicant on average, compared to 0.26 between 2021 and 2023. [35]

Evidence from the MAC suggests that a significant proportion of international students who arrived since 2021 are switching into roles below RQF 6. In their 2024 'Rapid Review of the Graduate Route', the MAC found that almost half (49%) of those who switched directly from the Student route into work routes switched into Senior Care worker and Care worker roles, while 20% of those who switched from the Graduate route also entered these occupations. [36]

Individuals who arrived on the Study route are estimated to form only a small proportion of those reaching settlement between 2026 and 2030, despite a significant increase in student numbers. Home Office forecasting based on historical behaviour estimates that there will be 105,000 settlement grants over this period. Based on historical behaviour settlement volumes from the Study route appear low. However, it is likely that the introduction of the Graduate route in 2021 and higher dependency ratio of recent cohorts will lead to a higher proportion of international students remaining in the UK and eventually reaching settlement, compared to previous cohorts.

Economic and fiscal impacts

The changes set out above suggest that a significant proportion of migrants settling from 2026 to 2030 will have lower skill levels than previous cohorts of migrants. The high number of dependants connected with this cohort further suggests that they are more likely to obtain settlement and remain in the UK in the long-term. [37]

Home Office analysis of internal management information shows that migrants working in below RQF 6 occupations typically have lower salaries than migrants working in occupations requiring higher skill levels. Internal data estimates that the median salary of migrants working in RQF 3-5 roles was around £12,000 lower than the overall route medians for Skilled Worker and Health and Care (excluding Care Work occupations) in 2024/25.

Home Office analysis [38] matching visas granted between April 2019 and March 2023 to PAYE data showed that median salaries for Senior Care and Care Workers were between £23,000 and £26,000 for financial year 2023/24. This is significantly below the median full-time salary in the UK - £37,000 as of April 2024. [39]

Figure 5: Median annual adjusted earnings for granted Sponsored Work entry clearance visas [40] , financial year 2023 to 2024

[…]

Note: Senior Care Worker and Care Worker dependants are assumed to have the same median salary as general Health and Care dependants.

For migrants to make a positive fiscal contribution, they must contribute more through taxation than they cost by using public services. The fiscal contribution of migrants varies across different migrant cohorts, influenced by factors such as employment rate, income level, age, and their propensity to use different types of public services. As well as fiscal contributions, migrants contribute to the UK in a number of other ways; many migrants work in important roles providing vital services, such as supporting the NHS.

Fiscal impacts can also vary by time spent in the country. Both benefits and costs can vary over time. In the longer-term, costs can increase as migrants get older, have children and can increase again when migrants achieve settlement and become eligible to receive benefits, including Universal Credit and access to the state pension. In June 2025, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) reported that 213,000 migrants with settlement were claiming Universal Credit. [41]

In September 2024, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated the cumulative fiscal impact of a representative migrant coming to the UK at the age of 25. [42] This analysis was undertaken for an ""average-wage"" migrant, earning the same as the UK average (assumed to be £38,200 using ASHE 2024 data), a ""high-wage"" migrant earning 30 per cent more (£49,700) and a ""low-wage"" migrant earning 50 per cent less (£19,100).

It found that some cohorts of migrants such as those on the Skilled Worker visa in RQF 6+ roles and on ""high-value"" routes such as the Global Talent routes are likely to approximate ""average-wage"" or ""high-wage"" migrants. Those in RQF 3-5 roles, such as Senior Care and Care Workers and their dependants, who have lower skill-levels and lower earnings are likely to make less of a contribution than ""average wage"" migrants though still likely above the ""low wage"" migrant category, who never make a net positive fiscal contribution in the long run.

Many Skilled Workers who arrive in the UK are older than 25 at time of arrival - for these cohorts, their cumulative fiscal impact will be lower in each period when compared to a migrant who arrives closer to 25 with the same salary.

Figure 6, below, only considers adult migrants; migrant households with children, who incur significantly higher levels of public spending in the short term, must earn substantially more to make a net positive fiscal contribution. From 2021 to 2024, 27% of all applications [43] for Health and Care visas were under 16. Over the same period 18% of all applications for other Skilled Worker visas were under 16.

Figure 6: OBR cumulative fiscal impact of representative migrants [44]

Further immigration rule changes

Due to recent rule changes the makeup of future cohorts of migrants to the UK will be different to the 2021 to 2024 cohort. In response to unprecedented levels of net migration, changes to the immigration rules came into effect from 2024 to restrict dependants for Senior Care and Care workers and on the Student route. [45] [46] The minimum salary threshold on the Skilled Worker visa was also raised to £38,700. [47]

Further rule changes introduced under the Spring 2025 Immigration White Paper have tightened requirements, with a view to reducing net migration levels. [48] The skills threshold on the Skilled Worker route (including Skilled Worker – Health and Care) has been restored to RQF 6+, closing the Senior Care and Care worker route to new entrants, along with increases to minimum salary thresholds and dependant restrictions for migrants accessing the route via the Immigration Shortage Occupation List or the Temporary Shortage List.

Key requirements of an earned settlement system

Our working assumption is that the system should operate on a 'time adjustment' model, meaning that the qualifying period will be adjustable upwards or downwards from a baseline qualifying period, depending on the individual circumstances of the case.

As set out in the Immigration White Paper, we will move to a system in which the baseline qualifying period for settlement for most migrants is increased from 5 years to 10 years.

As set out in the Restoring Order and Control: A Statement on the government's asylum and returns policy, we will introduce a starting point of a 20-year qualifying period of settlement for those recognised as refugees. Those who move from core protection onto the new core protection-work and study routes will be able to earn reductions. However, refugees will never be in a better position than those coming to the UK on recognised migration routes (such as workers), who are subject to the usual standard settlement qualifying period of 10 years.

Resettled refugees who have been granted protection and moved to the UK through official resettlement programmes are intended to start at 10 years, bringing them in line with other arrivals on planned migration routes. Individuals who arrive on these routes will have a quicker route to settlement than those who claim asylum in-country. This is justified on the basis that the caps for these routes will be devised to reflect local area capacity to absorb, so it is appropriate to grant them a shorter path to settlement.

The considerations informing the design will be based on four core pillars, designed to ensure that applicants make a meaningful contribution to UK society and meet clear, measurable standards. These four core pillars will be:

• Character – This reformed system will, as now, provide for the refusal of applications where core requirements relating to their character and conduct (for example, having a criminal conviction, non-compliance with immigration requirements and considerations pertaining to the public good). It will be mandatory to meet such requirements, and there will be no ability to trade with other considerations to determine the qualifying period. We will conduct a root and branch review of the criminality thresholds that apply across all immigration routes. Our expectation is that you should not be able to settle with a criminal record. Revised thresholds will be set out in due course.

• Integration – The reformed system will ensure that applicants demonstrate meaningful engagement with British society.

• Contribution – The reformed system will reward individuals who have made a sustained and measurable economic contribution to the UK, on the principle that any accelerated path to settlement should be earned through active participation in the economy.

• Residence – The reformed system will recognise lawful, continuous residence in the UK. Individuals will not, however, normally qualify on the basis of residence alone.

An outline of how the proposed earned settlement system would work is set out in the tables below. In these tables, criteria that applicants must meet to be considered, or that may increase or reduce the qualifying period for settlement, are linked to the four pillars set out above.

Eligibility for settlement: mandatory requirements

There will be minimum mandatory requirements that all applicants must meet in order to be granted settlement. These are set out in Table 1 below. We are not consulting on whether these should be included in the earned settlement model with the exception of ""contribution"", where we are consulting on the length of time the requirement to have an earned income should apply to.

Table 3: Considerations that will increase the baseline qualifying period. Note: only one of the listed considerations (i.e. the one that causes the largest increase) would be applied in the case of any single application. This will take precedence over any reduction to the baseline.

This consultation includes questions intended to seek respondents' views on the impacts of the proposed model. Further information on how the criteria are intended to work is set out below.

The tables above set out how the baseline qualifying period may be adjusted upwards or downwards. In order to meet the qualifying period requirement, the applicant will, as now, need to have spent the required period of time in the UK in a route, or routes, that leads to settlement. The Immigration Rules will specify which routes lead to settlement and which do not, and it is not intended that the position as to which routes fall into each category will change (Figure 1 above sets out those routes which currently lead to settlement).

A consequence of the proposed system is that there will no longer be a separate long residence route. The purpose of the existing long residence route will be superseded by arrangements in which the baseline qualifying period is adjustable for considerations relating to contribution and integration.

Contribution and Integration

Under these proposals, the qualifying period for settlement may be reduced where criteria relating to the applicant's contribution and integration are met.

In the case of integration, it is proposed that the applicant may qualify for a reduction in the qualifying period on the basis of working in the community or having proficiency in English that is higher (at C1 level or above) than the minimum level of proficiency (B2 level) required to qualify for settlement.

In the case of economic contribution, the government's view is that arrangements for settlement should reward those who are making the greatest contribution, and that earnings are the best means of objectively measuring economic contribution. This consultation therefore seeks views on linking earned reductions to earnings and specifically a proposal that applicants should attract a shorter qualifying period for settlement if they have, in the 3 years immediately prior to applying, earned a taxable annual income of above £50,270 (earning a reduction of 5 years) or £125,140 (earning a reduction of 7 years). These thresholds have been selected as they equate to the current thresholds for payment of Income Tax at the higher and additional rate respectively. (Note: it is not, however, the proposal that these income-related thresholds would track future changes to the tax system.)

These proposals would mean that the income threshold at which an applicant might earn an income-based reduction in the qualifying period for settlement is higher than the salary threshold that may apply to an overseas national initially seeking entry under the Skilled Worker route. The government's view is that it is reasonable to reserve a shorter pathway to settlement to those who achieve some progression in their earnings and economic contribution post-entry.

In addition, this consultation also seeks views on the proposal that that there should be a similarly shorter pathway to settlement for those who are working in vital public services, particularly where earnings are based on national pay scales and may not meet the proposed threshold for an income-based reduction in the qualifying period. This might include, for example, medical and teaching professionals working in public services. It is, however, envisaged that the above reduction in the qualifying period for public service roles would apply only to those working in skilled occupations (i.e. at RQF Level 6 or above).

This consultation also seeks views on how far contribution-based criteria for reducing the qualifying period should reward those who have demonstrated a commitment to contributing to their community through, for example, volunteering. This government recognises the vital role that volunteers have in communities throughout the country. They contribute to the very fabric of British life, and everyone who takes part should be celebrated for their efforts to deliver change.

Volunteering is any activity that involves spending time, unpaid, doing something that aims to benefit someone else (other than close friends or relatives), the community or the environment. Volunteering can be formal and organised by organisations or informal within communities. It should always be a free choice made by the person giving up their time. It often has benefits for both the wider community and the individual taking part.

Volunteering and employment are fundamentally different. There is no legal definition of what constitutes a volunteer or the act of volunteering in the UK, but there is for employment. Volunteers give their time without obligation and can stop volunteering when they choose to.

Specific routes of entry and residence (including those admitted as the partner, parent or child of a British citizen and have held that status for the duration of their qualifying period or as a holder of Hong Kong British National (Overseas) status) will attract a reduction in the qualifying period. These groups will therefore be able to settle after 5 years, as they can now, subject to the mandatory requirements.

Individuals on high-skilled routes make an important contribution to the economy through the skills they bring. In recognition of that, it is proposed that those with 3 years of continuous residence as a Global Talent worker or Innovator Founder will benefit from a reduction of up to 7 years. It is therefore expected that most individuals who hold either visa should continue to benefit from an accelerated route to settlement after 3 years, subject to the mandatory requirements. Furthermore, we are consulting on whether family members of this group should benefit from a 5-year reduction.

This means, however, that with the exception of the above categories, those routes (for example, the Skilled Worker route) that currently lead to settlement after 5 years continuous stay will cease to do so and will default to a qualifying period of 10 years, except where an earned reduction on the basis of contribution or integration applies.

Non-compliance and negative contributions

Under earned settlement, a person's pathway to settlement will also depend on their history of compliance with immigration laws. This may affect both their qualifying period for settlement and whether an application for settlement will be considered at all. The government believes it is right that those who do not comply with immigration laws should expect this to impact on their pathway to settlement and that, even where breaches do not have the consequence of resulting in outright refusal of an application, they should result in their qualifying period being extended.

In the case of those who overstay their leave, the Immigration Rules already provide that an application for permission to stay (including settlement) may be refused if the applicant has breached immigration laws by overstaying their leave. Under these proposals, it would additionally be the case that, where it was judged that an overstaying breach should not lead to outright refusal, it would nevertheless cause the qualifying period for settlement to be increased. We are consulting on whether this should be 5, 10, 15 or as high as 20 years.

It is proposed that an increase in the qualifying period should similarly apply where the applicant originally entered the UK illegally, or where the applicant originally entered as a visitor. This would mean, for example, that a person who entered the UK illegally could have a route to settlement as high as 30 years.

This consultation also seeks views on whether the qualifying period should be increased by five or ten years if the applicant has claimed public funds. It should be noted that recourse to public funds may constitute a breach of conditions and therefore result in outright refusal of an application on general grounds. The proposal here is that even where there has not been a breach of conditions (for example, where the Home Office waived an individual's no recourse to public funds condition), or there has been a breach but it does not warrant refusal of the application, it should nevertheless give rise to an increase in the required qualifying period.

Settlement and public funds

In reforming settlement arrangements, the government wishes to address the concern that increasing volumes of settlement grants are not subject to restrictions on access to public funds.

This might be addressed by increasing the pathway to settlement for groups less likely to make a net fiscal contribution over the long-term – for example workers in lower wage occupations. We are therefore consulting on whether a contribution-based approach should mean that the existing pathway for settlement is increased (beyond the standard baseline of 10 years) for those admitted to the UK specifically to work in occupations skilled below RQF Level 6. This might involve increasing the baseline qualifying period to 15 years where the worker has been sponsored for a role skilled below RQF Level 6 (for example, under the Skilled Worker and Health and Care routes).

The consultation seeks views on whether the law should be changed so that it would be possible to make settlement subject to a ""no recourse to public funds"" condition. The government believes that the development of an earned settlement system should include a reassessment of the benefits accruing to settlement and where the accrual of those benefits might in future sit in the journey to settlement and citizenship respectively. Under this option, new migrants granted settlement would continue to be unable to access specified benefits in line with existing visa conditions. This would have the effect of shifting the default position on access to benefits to citizenship rather than settlement.

Dependants and children

Under the existing system, dependants of those who enter and stay in, for example, economic routes are able to qualify for settlement at the point that the principal applicant is granted settlement and without having to meet any additional conditions. We anticipate that this will substantially change under the earned settlement system. We expect it to become the position that the qualifying period for settlement for a person granted entry and stay as the adult dependants of an economic migrant will be separately determined according to their own attributes and circumstances. This will mean that a person admitted as the dependant of an economic migrant will not necessarily enjoy the same qualifying period for settlement as their partner. It may be shorter or longer, according to their particular circumstances.

It would, however, remain the position that a person whose basis of stay has been as a dependant will only have a pathway to settlement where the main applicant is able to qualify. For example, in the case of an economic migrant whose application fails under grounds for mandatory refusal, their dependants will not (as now) have a pathway to settlement independently of the main applicant.

In the case of children, it is acknowledged that many of the requirements in the earned reduction model outlined above – such as making NICs or meeting an income threshold – cannot be met by those who may still be children at the point that their parents become eligible for settlement. At the same time, however, the introduction of an earned settlement system with a longer baseline qualifying period does bring into focus whether and how those who turn 18 during their parents' qualifying period should be brought within earned settlement principles and be expected to qualify for settlement in their own right.

The consultation questionnaire therefore includes questions seeking views on how dependants should be accommodated within an earned settlement system. The Home Office considers that the system should continue to provide a window during which those who were originally given a permission as a dependent child when they are under 18 can be granted settlement (or a limited permission to extend their stay) at the same time as their parents, even if they are over 18 at that point. The Home Office will, however, develop proposals under which a cut-off point, linked to age, may operate, and at which point such a person will transition to an immigration pathway under which they progress to settled status in their own right. This could, for example, involve specifying an age limit below which some mandatory requirements (i.e. the requirement to have paid NICs in the 3 years prior to applying) are waived.

We intend to adhere to commitments laid out in the 2025 UK Immigration White Paper, titled Restoring Control over the Immigration System, to ensure children who have been in the UK for most of their life, turn 18 and discover they do not have status, are fully supported and able to regularise their status and settle. We plan to put in place appropriate safeguards for children who were not aware they were here unlawfully and who have not previously been involved with their immigration status.

Vulnerable groups and compassionate circumstances

There are existing arrangements under which settlement may be granted, without being subject to a minimum qualifying period of residence, to adult family members needing long-term care from a UK-based relative; to individuals whose relationship (on a partner visa) has broken down due to domestic abuse; those entering the UK on resettlement schemes; and to partners of UK citizens or settled persons who have died. We will continue to have pathways to settlement for these groups. We are consulting on whether

and how an earned settlement system may be tailored for these groups and other groups that may require such treatment in the light of their vulnerability or compassionate circumstances.

HM Armed Forces

The Armed Forces Covenant is a national commitment that those who serve or have served in HM Armed Forces should not face disadvantage due to their service. The government recognises the sacrifices made by service personnel and their families — including the loss of civilian freedoms — in defence of the UK. The government is committed to upholding the Covenant by ensuring fair treatment for all who serve or have served, including non-UK personnel. The consultation will seek views on the treatment of armed forces members under the earned settlement system, but we are not proposing that HM Armed Forces and their family members should have a different pathway to settlement than they do today.

Transitional Arrangements

This consultation includes questions intended to seek respondents' views on how far the implementation of the earned settlement model should be accompanied by transitional measures.

Transitional arrangements refer to temporary measures or rules put in place to manage the shift from one system, or policy framework, to another. Without any transitional arrangements, the earned settlement policy will affect people already in the system, who are not already settled when relevant Immigration Rules come into force. Transitional arrangements may be designed to ease the impact of policy change, especially for individuals or groups already afforded permissions by the previous system. The consultation seeks views on whether there should be transitional arrangements for those already on a pathway to settlement.

Citizenship

The Immigration White Paper also stated that reforms to citizenship will be introduced, and that these would build on any changes made to settlement through the earned settlement approach. These would aim to reflect similar principles for extending qualifying periods, while allowing those who have made greater contributions to qualify sooner.

We recognise both that primary legislation will be required to make any changes to the British Nationality Act 1981 and that any recommendations should understandably await this consultation process for settlement and subsequent decisions on approaches to be taken. The processes for applicants to reach settlement and then move on to citizenship will need to work together and make sense, for both the applicant and the system.

Exporting carceral migration “management”: €30 million from the EU to Senegal for migration control

Exporting carceral migration “management”: €30 million from the EU to Senegal for migration control

Topic

Country/Region

€30 million from the EU's aid budget has been provided to Senegal for migration control. An examination of European Commission documents makes clear the main focus of the funding: border surveillance and control, maritime interception of people trying to leave Senegal to travel to European territory, and reception/detention infrastructure.

Key points

In October 2024 the EU announced it would provide €30 million from its aid budget to Senegal

The funding focuses on stepping up the fight against migrant smuggling: measures to enhance border surveillance and control, maritime interception, and reception/detention infrastructure

The funding priorities align with some of those supported by the Senegalese government elected in April 2024, but also fit neatly into longer-term dynamics of cooperation with the EU and other external actors

Ultimately, the plans can be seen as contributing to a new era of carceral EU migration “management” in West Africa

EU budget boost for Senegal

In October 2024, Jutta Urpilainen, the former European Commissioner for International Partnerships, visited Senegal. During the visit she announced that the Commission would be providing a fresh €30million to support Senegalese authorities in their fight against irregular migration.

According to Urpilainen at the time, the funding will “strengthen capacity to provide relief to migrants, fight trafficking, and raise awareness.” Recent reporting by Andrei Popviciu and documents obtained through requests to EU institutions offer more detail on the EU’s and Senegal’s plans.

The funding will come from the EU’s “Flexible Mechanism for Migration and Forced Displacement in Subsaharan Africa Action” (pdf), part of the EU’s almost €80 billion Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI).

Most of it will be distributed through the second phase of the Common Operational Partnership (pdf) (Partenariat Opérationnel Conjoint), a police cooperation project. While the first phase of the POC project focused on the fight against criminal networks tied to smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings, the second phase now also includes efforts to curb terrorism.

The budget increase follows “high-level discussions” between the EU and Senegal defining “common interests in the areas of border management, prevention, smuggling, and information communication.” These common interests are also influenced by long term cooperation between the EU and Senegal in the field of migration control, and the longstanding role of external actors in Senegalese migration and border governance.

Peak in arrivals on the Canary Islands and long-term EU involvement

Urpilainen’s announcement came in the context of an all-time high in arrivals on the so-called Atlantic Route to the Canary Islands from Senegal, Mauritania, and Morocco. In 2024 this was the deadliest migration route in the world. The increase in arrivals took place in the context of the EU and Senegal’s long engagement on containing and constraining mobility.

Beyond the Common Operational Partnership (COP), the EU has a broader stake in migration “management” in Senegal. Its long-term engagements include so-called capacity building projects seeking to enhance border and surveillance infrastructure. Development aid has been deployed to curb the so-called root-causes of migration.

The EU previously also had an operational presence in the country. From Between 2006 and 2018, Frontex conducted surveillance of Senegal’s maritime borders (pdf) under its Operations Hera II and III. Spain’s Guardia Civil are still present, with at least four boats deployed.

Diverging and converging interests in Senegal–EU migration cooperation

Hoping to re-deploy Frontex to Senegal, in July 2022 the Council of the EU authorised negotiations on a “status agreement”. This would let Frontex conduct border surveillance operations in the country. Negotiations on a working arrangement on technical cooperation between Frontex and Senegal were noted in EU documents as early as 2016.

The reinstalment of Frontex (pdf) remains a key priority of the EU, but is a contentious issue (pdf). In absence of an agreement to monitor Senegalese waters, Frontex entered into discussions with the Authorities of Cape Verde regarding aerial surveillance on the so-called Atlantic route (pdf).

The flights were officially launched in November 2025, aiming “to enhance situational awareness over the Atlantic.” This is despite reported internal concerns over human rights protection, in particular in regard to the principle of non-refoulement, raised by Frontex's Fundamental Rights Officer, Jonas Grimheden.

Cooperation on deportation is another contentious topic between Senegal and the EU. To enhance pressure on this front, the Commission proposed ‘visa sanctions’ in 2022. They have not yet been approved by the Council. The EU is also stalling the launch of a Talent Partnership (pdf) with Senegal, which would open legal migration routes.

In recent years there have been demonstrations in Senegal in relation to European immigration policies. Protesters have denounced the unjust treatment of visa applicants by European and other embassies, calling for swifter and less stringent application procedures, the suspension of outsourcing, and the reduction of waiting times.

Civil society actors, including the Senegalese branch of Amnesty International, have expressed serious concerns over the potential deployment of Frontex. Others, such as Boza Fii, have actively organized against its presence.

The linkage of migration governance, growing social inequality and extractivism, most notably industrial fishing, has also been clearly noted by Senegalese civil society. Meanwhile, the loss of lives along the Atlantic route remains a major concern for affected communities.

Convergence despite contention: stopping illegalised migration

The EU considers that the Senegalese government has a clear interest in “developing an effective system of border management, including maritime, land borders and international airports.” Indeed, cooperation in the field of border and migration control between the two sides has been going on for years.

In March 2024, the party Patriotes africains du Sénégal pour le travail, l'éthique et la fraternité (PASTEF) won both the presidential and parliamentary elections. The party has an an ostensibly anti-imperialist and neo-sovereigntist agenda.

The current focus on stopping illegalised departures follows initiatives taken up by the previous government. In late 2020, Senegal launched its Interministerial Committee for the Fight against Irregular Migration (Comité Interministériel de Lutte contre la Migration Irrégulière, CILMI), which formulated the country’s 2023 Strategy to Fight Irregular Migration.

After a tragic shipwreck costing the lives of at least 37 passengers in September 2024, Senegal’s president Bassirou Diomaye Faye reasserted the government’s commitment to stopping migrant smuggling. In April this year the prime minister, Ousman Sonko, announced the government’s intention to penalize smugglers more harshly.

The additional budget support announced by the EU in October 2024 is set to support these and related initiatives, propping up an increasingly restrictive approach towards illegalized emigration.

Funding migration control: from a Trust Fund to a Flexible Mechanism

As noted, the €30 million will be distributed via the EU’s Flexible Mechanism for Migration and Forced Displacement in Subsaharan Africa. This is part of the near-€80 billion Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation (NDICI) budget.

The Flexible Mechanism follows on from the EU Trust Fund for Africa, and is designed to:

Strengthen partner countries’ cooperation with the EU on migration and forced displacement

Support partner countries’ national and sub-national capacities to tackle migration and/or forced displacement challenges identified in migration dialogues with the EU

The funding provided through the Flexible Mechanism comes with strong conditions attached (pdf). Country interventions depend not only on the displacement situation faced by the country concerned, but also on its relations with the EU and level of engagement on:

the fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings;

hosting migrants and/or displaced people in line with EU and international standards;

reinforcing “migration management capacities”;

deportations and reintegration;

legal migration and the implementation on the Global Compact on Refugees.

€30 million for border control, surveillance, and detention

A European Commission “concept note” (pdf), released following an access to documents request, offers more insight into what will be funded by the €30 million budget increase. Four key objectives (table 1) are supposed to be achieved across five axes (table 2).

Most of the actions seek to enhance the border control and surveillance powers of the Senegalese security forces, raising serious concerns regarding the potential for human rights abuses. Similar issues arise with the actions linked to enhanced protection and assistance to migrants.

Table 1: Four key objectives of the action (compiled by author)

Table 2: Principal axis of the action (compiled by the author)

Enhancing border control, surveillance, and intelligence capacity

Under the Flexible Mechanism, numerous measures to reinforce border control and surveillance at Senegal’s maritime, riparian, land, and air borders are foreseen. Measures include the acquisition of border patrol boats for the police and gendarmerie (some with search and rescue capacity), and the building of the infrastructure needed to manage and maintain the vessels. It was expected that 15 boats would be provided by mid-2025.

Increased securitisation of the land border entails construction and rehabilitation of border posts. There is significant emphasis in the documents “interconnection of these posts” and facilitating communication between gendarmerie, police, and customs, as well as material support to the territorial brigades of the gendarmerie.

Support will also be provided to what might seem rather unusual actors in a border control context: the National Agency for Maritime Affairs (Agence Nationale des Affaires Maritime) and the Fisheries Directorate (Direction des Pêches).

This is linked to the development of a regulatory framework for the registration of small boats and motors. The aim is to enhance state control over vessels and to facilitate investigations if they are used for illegalised maritime migration.

Financing and training (new) migration control actors

There are further steps aimed at strengthening of intelligence and investigation work. The regional branches of the National Division to Fight Migrant Smuggling and Assimilated Practices (Division Nationale de Lutte contre le Traffic de Migrants et Practices Assimilées) will have their “operational capacity” reinforced, building on previous EU funding.

The National Division to Fight Migrant Smuggling was founded in January 2018. It initially received bilateral support from France. Follow-up support came from the EU’s Common Operational Partnership. The Division is part of Senegal’s border police (Direction General de la Police de l’Air et des Frontières).

With around fifty police officers working under the authority of a police commissioner, it has become the key security actor in the country’s efforts against migrant smuggling. Besides its headquarters in the capital, the EU has funded regional branches in Rosso, Karang, Tambacounda, Kédougou, Saint Louis, Saly, and Ziguinchor.

Additionally, the creation of a new border patrol unit (Unités de Patrouilles Frontalières) will be supported. In line with long-ongoing negotiations, “synergies” with Frontex are expected.

Finally, the EU funding aims to improve investigations on fraudulent documents. To do so, the creation, equipping and training of a Division of Investigation against Fraudulent Documents at the heart of the Police de l’Air et des Frontières is planned.

Finally, there will be funding for information campaigns aimed at deterring illegalised migration. These will be based on the experience gained through the EUTF funded ‘Tekki fii’ project.

Building so-called “reception centres”

The Commission “concept note” further reveals that the EU also plans to fund the construction of four reception centres for “rescued/ intercepted migrants”.

Given the EU’s track record both within and without its borders, any proposal to fund “reception centres” requires close scrutiny. Examined in context, there is a very strong risk that “interception for search and rescue” will become “interception for detention”.

The proposed locations for the “reception centres” are Saint Louis, M’bour, the port of Dakar and Dakar airport. The funding will also support the development and implementation of a Standard Operating Procedure on disembarkation of rescued people. This was recently developed by the International Organization for Migration, alongside the development of procedures and internal directives.

The “protection” element of the action pertains predominantly to the treatment of people once intercepted and detained. The intention is to contract civil society organisations to monitor the treatment of migrants and advise security forces on their rights.

A de facto detention infrastructure?

There is a significant risk that the so-called reception centres will end up as a de facto detention infrastructure. The “concept note” specifies that migrants should stay in these centres for the first 72 hours after rescue/interception.

The document contains a reference to a distinct zone for “smugglers” in the centres. Here, interviews for investigative purposes would be carried out and people may be detained for longer periods.

How this will work in practice remains to be seen, and may lead to the long-term detention of migrants. The Senegalese legal framework (Law 2005-06 of 10 May 2005) does not meaningfully distinguish between smugglers and migrants.

Article 12 of the law says migrants should be excluded from prosecution only if they were not aware that they were committing an offence. Recent research, longer-standing work and recent reporting highlight that migrants have been prosecuted under the law.

A proposal to amend the law was technically adopted in 2019. This would have introduced a distinction between smugglers and migrants, thereby aligning the Senegalese legal framework with the UN Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. However, it has not yet been legally adopted.

The idea of building “reception centres” as such is not new. It first appeared officially in Senegal’s National Strategy for the Fight against Irregular Migration. The strategy calls for “administrative detention centres” at border crossing points.

Currently, post-interception practice involves holding migrants in police custody for between 72 and 96 hours. With police stations often ill-equipped to host larger groups, accommodation in classrooms has been noted.

A report by the IOM on disembarkation assistance highlights the crude detention/assistance logic at play: “Migrants often hide in local populations, which slows down the investigation and does not allow for appropriate support for the victims.”

Whatever the Senegalese government’s own political rationales, external partners have encouraged more prosecutions for migrant smuggling.

One of the indicators used to measure the success of EU funding under the Flexible Mechanism (pdf) is the number of cases investigated and prosecuted. The number of convictions was used as an indicator in a previous Joint EU–Senegal Strategy Document that guided cooperation and programming.

Maritime containment rather than enhanced sea rescue capacity

The concept note also foregrounds the need to enhance search and rescue capacity and the imperative of saving lives at sea.

Measures foreseen include improving of surveillance capabilities and setting up a coordination centre for maritime operations in Dakar, which will have four antennas in coastal regions: Saint-Louis, Petite-Cote, Saloum, and “South”.

The coordination centre will focus solely on cases related to smuggling of migrants, trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking, and piracy.

It will coexist with Senegal’s main Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and its secondary rescue centres. These operate under the High Authority for the Coordination of Maritime Safety, Maritime Security and Protection of the Marine Environment (Haute Autorité chargée de la Coordination de la Sécurité maritime, de la Sûreté maritime et de la Protection de l’Environnement marin), established in 2006.

The Decree establishing the High Authority gives it responsibility for coordination in all areas relating to safety, security, and environmental protection within maritime and inland waters under Senegalese jurisdiction (article 3). In normal circumstances it is responsible for ensuring the operational readiness of the main Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and the secondary rescue centres (article 6).

The Order on the Organisation and Functioning of the High Authority (also approved in 2006) further defines its role. It should coordinate all missions carried out by the specialised bodies, gendarmerie, national police and the navy that promote a secure maritime environment. This includes the safeguarding of persons (article 15 and 16).

However, coordination of migration-related maritime incidents is carried out by a parallel structure coordinated by security forces. Interventions at sea with a “migration mandate” (relating to both interception and rescue) are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, which is supported by the Spanish Guardia Civil.

Interceptions, meaning the act of stopping, detaining, or redirecting a vessel before it reaches its intended destination represent nearly all cases coordinated under this framework. Interception is distinct from rescue, the latter being life-saving assistance to a vessel and its occupants that are in distress or danger at sea.

Interception itself can be deadly and dangerous, as illustrated in 2023 case in which 17 passengers of a boat lost their lives. Furthermore, a recent study published by Statewatch and the Transnational Institute finds that 92.3% of all interceptions carried out under Frontex’s Operation Hera II amounted to pushbacks.

The EU-funded action proposes enhancing search and rescue capacities and protecting migrants’ lives. However, it misses the chance to invest in Senegal’s overall maritime coordination infrastructure, focusing instead on the country’s migration interception infrastructure. This mirrors the EU’s wider “Rescue-Through-Interdiction/Rescue-Without-Protection’ Paradigm.”

This comes at the same time that artisanal fishing along Senegal’s coasts, an important economic sector increasingly under pressure, is becoming more dangerous and deadly. This demise is linked to industrial overfishing and oil and gas exploitation along the Senegalese coast. It is an important factor in many young people’s decision to leave.

An investment the country’s overall search and rescue coordination infrastructure could have at least contributed to enhancing the human security of all actors present in the Senegalese maritime space.

Lip service to human rights

The underlying aims of the €30 million budget are interception, detention and an instrumental concern for human life. The initiative maps onto longer-term developments predating the change of government in 2024, marked by the long-term involvement of external actors, often operating with EU funding.

The intervention is indicative of a wider regional trend of EU-funded actions enforcing detention and disregarding human rights concerns. This comes in the guise of “fighting migrant smuggling,” which is both a condition for and objective of EU financial support.

Together, these factors constitute the building blocks of a new era of carceral EU migration “management” in West Africa.

Good morning Chair Restler and Members of the Committee, and thank you for convening this important hearing on protecting New York City from federal overreach. This is an urgent moment. National Guard or federal troops have been deployed, against the wishes of state and local elected officials, to Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and now Charlotte, stoking fear, provoking chaos, and imposing federal power in a manner designed to undermine constitutional democracy. ICE agents are lawlessly abducting our neighbors every single day. President Trump has weaponized federal funding, using taxpayer dollars for purposes of coercion and extortion.

Now, in the wake of New Yorkers’ election of Mayor-election Zohran Mamdani, Trump and his Administration are threatening to send troops here, to further ratchet up ICE agents’ brownshirted abductions across the five boroughs, and to cut off funds to which we are legally entitled. It is a critical moment for unified action by New York’s local, state, and federal officials. It has been profoundly disappointing that Eric Adams has utterly failed to stand up for New Yorkers in the face of this federal onslaught; and let’s be clear: that’s a key reason why voters utterly rejected him at the polls. Thank you to the City Council for approaching this issue with the deadly seriousness it requires, and for convening today’s hearing. This is a moment for New Yorkers to be united in our resolve.

Federal overreach has primarily taken on three forms: (1) aggressive abduction, detention, and deportation of immigrants, without sufficient legal basis; (2) weaponizing and withdrawal of federal funds; and (3) deployment of out-of-state National Guard or federal troops without sufficient rationale and over the objection of state and local officials. New York City has already seen the first two. Now, we are preparing for the third. I will talk briefly about each, and how New York can respond.

Abduction and detention of immigrant New Yorkers, without legal basis

Nearly one in three New Yorkers is an immigrant, and over half of the City’s workforce is made up of immigrants or children of immigrants. These are not just numbers, they are home health aides, delivery workers, small-business owners, students getting their high school diplomas, and parents juggling two jobs. They are New York City.

Trump’s cruel and often lawless mass deportation agenda violates the Constitution, and the values of this immigrant city, with that copper-plated statue in the harbor. In recent months, I have spent a great deal of time in immigration court. It is impossible to sit there, day after day, watching masked ICE agents violate the centuries-old sanctuary of courthouses, separating families and abducting individuals following the rules for seeking asylum pursuant to the global convention against torture, without identifying themselves, presenting warrants, and giving any reason for the arrests, and not feel heartbroken and furious.

And we are already seeing how quickly that agenda can devastate communities. The horrific raid on Canal Street, where immigrant street vendors were swept up in a show of force meant to intimidate an entire neighborhood, is just the first example.

In court, at ICE check-ins, and now increasingly in our neighborhoods, the consequences are not abstract. They fall on real people, with real lives and families and schools and jobs. The Trump Administration has detained or deported thousands of immigrants (and some U.S. citizens), the significant majority of whom had no criminal record and presented no public safety threat. Here are just a few of the New Yorkers we have met in recent weeks whose lives have been upended by this broken system:

Joel, a 16-year-old junior at Gotham Collaborative High School with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, was detained at his ICE check-in despite having lawful protection. He was taken into ORR custody and held for several weeks before a judge finally ordered his release on November 17, allowing him to return to his loved ones, his community, and his favorite classes.

I watched ICE agents seize “George” immediately after his master calendar hearing, even though the immigration judge had simply asked him to provide additional information for his asylum application and return in April 2026. Agents detained him without verifying his identity and later released him only after realizing he was not the person they were targeting. My office helped connect him with legal services so he can prepare his asylum case.

Following his master calendar hearing, “Connor” was detained by ICE in front of his wife and three young children and transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana. Because NYFIUP contracts restrict out-of-state representation and legal providers in Louisiana are extremely limited, he was unable to secure counsel to appeal a removal order issued against him while he was detained.

These are not isolated cases. They are snapshots of a system designed to intimidate, destabilize, and deport. And it is about to get worse. Just this week, White House Border Czar Tom Homan, who is competing to be both the crudest and cruelest member of the administration, threatened to “flood the zone” and send more federal agents here.

New York City is the largest sanctuary city in the country, home to the largest population of immigrants in the country. With a new incoming Mayor, we have a real opportunity to change course.

Thanks to the Council and immigration advocates, last year’s budget saw a major increase in funding for immigration legal services, but the need remains far greater than the resources we have. These service providers, advocates, volunteers, and mutual aid groups are doing the heavy work, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to show up for immigrant New Yorkers. What is most urgent now is flexible funding that can respond to fast-changing conditions, from full representation in removal proceedings to emergency habeas petitions for New Yorkers taken to out-of-state detention centers, and to expand the capacity of our legal services providers so they can keep pace with the rising demand.

My office looked at how other sanctuary cities are responding and found promising models an incoming Mayor could replicate:

In Los Angeles, the City coordinates rapid response efforts while trusted community groups, labor unions, and mutual aid networks lead the on the ground work, protecting sensitive data and mobilizing quickly when ICE shows up.

In Illinois and Colorado, centralized intake systems gather key information once and route people quickly to the right help, reducing confusion and helping ensure no one falls through the cracks.

In Colorado, nonprofits partner with a vetted network of private immigration attorneys through a shared platform, almost like a virtual law firm, which expands capacity by shifting straightforward cases to private counsel so nonprofits can focus on complex deportation defense.

And in Chicago, the Mayor strengthened sanctuary protections through executive orders requiring clear officer identification, increasing transparency around federal enforcement, and coordinating citywide defense of residents’ rights.

New York City knows how to rise to moments like this. We should advance the bills that will strengthen our sanctuary city laws, like Council Member Hanif’s Trust Act and the New York for All Act at the State level. And we should look to the best practices in other cities to strengthen our legal service and rapid-response capacity today, along with the City–State task force I have called for to identify vulnerable funding streams, so that we are far more prepared for what is coming tomorrow.

My office is preparing a detailed memo for the incoming Mamdani Administration on how it can better coordinate with legal service providers, deploy the funding that the City Council allocated, address procurement issues to deploy these resources effectively, and provide legal protection, advice, and representation to as many of our neighbors as possible. We will of course be glad to provide it to the Council as well.

Weaponizing and withdrawal of federal funds

Just days after the election, my office released Protecting NYC, a report that assessed the risks ahead, from threats to the City’s budget, economy, and infrastructure to the rights and protections of the most vulnerable New Yorkers. It identified how federal funding cuts, immigration enforcement, infrastructure pullbacks, and civil rights rollbacks could play out in real time. Many of those risks are now coming to fruition, and still the City did next to nothing to prepare.

When we uncovered that 80 million dollars in FEMA funds, money already disbursed to New York City, had been quietly clawed back by the Trump Administration, and Mayor Adams was failing to do anything about it, we forced the Adams Administration to sue to get our money back. That case is still in court. The Law Department is working diligently to get our money back, but it is woefully understaffed.

At the same time, New York City’s funds have been clawed back or jeopardized in many other areas as well. Trump has canceled or delayed $450 million in clean energy grants, $34 in counterterrorism funding, millions is grant for afterschool and other public education programs, and $18 billion in infrastructure funding. Now, following the election of Zohran Mamdani, Trump has threatened to withhold more funds, essentially seeking to punish New Yorkers for exercise our constitutional rights to elect our own representatives.

Mayor-elect Mamdani has rightly pledged to quickly hire additional attorneys, and to work closely with New York State Attorney General Tish James and Governor Hochul on more coordinated litigation to protect New York City’s funds. This is critical. These are funds that were legally appropriated by Congress, and are due to New York City. We need a coordinated, aggressive legal approach to get them back.

Ultimately, I am optimistic that courts will order these funds be released to us. However, it may take many months or even years for those cases to work their way through the court system. That’s why a better-coordinated financial strategy is needed.

In my Tin Cup Day remarks last year, I urged the creation of a City and State task force to identify which funding streams were most at risk from federal retaliation, and to allocate additional funding to the General Reserve to make sure we have sufficient funds to avoid sudden cuts to housing, public health, human services, or infrastructure. That work is even more urgent now.

As we approach budget season for both the State and City, I urge leaders to work together on a coordinated plan, that includes transparent identification of the funds that are at risk, coordinated legal strategy, an increase in the General Reserve, and regular updates from elected officials, in a united fashion. As we move past the shameful capitulation of the Adams Administration, I hope elected officials across levels of government will work together. Governor Hochul, Attorney General James, and Mayor-elect Mamdani can lead the way – and include legislative leaders from the State Legislature and the City Council, the State and City Comptrollers, our District Attorneys, and of course a wide array of other stakeholders as well. This is a time for united action.

National Guard and federal troop deployment

United action is what we will need as well in the face of anticipated deployment of out-of-state National Guard and federal troops. As lawyers for Portland and Chicago have argued in court, these deployments violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the President’s power to federalize the Guard, or for federal troops to engage in civilian law enforcement.

New York State and New York City are working together, first in efforts to persuade Trump not to deploy troops here (which is worth trying, of course, given Trump’s mercurial nature), but also on aggressive legal strategies to enjoin any such deployment. I am encouraged by the cooperation of Governor Hochul and Mayor-elect Mamdani in these efforts. Though they come from different wings of the Democratic Party, they are showing a commitment to work together that can serve as a model for all of us.

Maybe, somehow, despite their cruelty, ignorance, thuggish instincts, and willingness to violate the Constitution, Trump and Homan will wise up and decide not to try to deploy the National Guard or federal troops here. They got a taste of how New Yorkers will respond on Canal street, when dozens of regular New Yorkers – not people who had downloaded a resistance app or purchased whistles in advance – surrounded the agents, and made clear that New Yorkers revile ICE.

Through persuasion and some amount of acceptable flattery of his monstrous ego; through clarity that federal occupation will not ultimately succeed, and in fact will have a significant political backlash for Trump, as we saw in this month’s elections; and through a proactive and coordinated legal strategy, hopefully we can avoid the stationing of federal troops here.

Taking action together

But if Trump proceeds with the deployment, as seems likely, we will all need to work together to respond. Hands Off NYC is a coalition of over 100 community groups, labor unions, advocacy organizations, businesses, and other stakeholders, providing New Yorkers with know-you-rights training, ICE watch, how to organize and mobilize neighborhood support, nonviolent resistance, and more.

It has been heartening to see New Yorkers taking action together by the hundreds of thousands – turning out to the No Kings and Hands Off NYC marches, participating in courtwatching at 26 Federal Plaza, showing up for neighbors in grassroots ways as on Canal Street, or in more coordinated actions.

Just this weekend, I was out with Councilmembers Hanif and Aviles, as we reached out to hundreds of businesses, many of whom employ immigrants, to talk about action they can take to protect employees and neighbors. Some of the steps people can take are simple but powerful. While ICE agents are allowed to come into the parts of a store where customers are allowed, if store owners or managers simply place an “Employees Only” sign on the break room, supply room, or employee bathroom, now ICE agents would need to present a judicial warrant for entry.

We are doing this work in a spirit of patriotism, building a broad coalition, and in the spirit of nonviolent civil disobedience and bearing witness. That is the spirit in which I started attending court hearings at 26 Federal Plaza in June, as a result of which I was arrested by ICE agents in June while simply trying to accompany an asylum-seeker named Edgardo out of 26 Federal Plaza. That is the spirit in which I joined with other elected officials and New Yorkers in an effort to conduct oversight of the tenth floor at 26 Federal Plaza and to see whether ICE was complying with a federal injunction limiting detention and requiring humane conditions like clean bedding, hygiene supplies, and access to counsel. Instead of transparency, we were met with obstruction and arrest.

This week, we had our first court appearance on that arrest. While the legislators received adjournments in contemplation of dismissal, I chose to move forward with trial – because the real crime is not what we did in the elevator lobby demanding access, but what ICE is doing behind those closed doors. If ICE and DHS can question why I stood in that hallway, then I will question what they were doing on the other side of it.

In federal court this week, we participated in due process. But our immigrant neighbors have not. And we intend to use our platform to ensure the rule of law.

Finally, the actions we are discussing today are consistent with our history as New Yorkers. Next year, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of this country. Just six weeks after the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, British troops occupied New York City, following the Battle of Brooklyn. What followed was a seven-year long occupation, characterized by martial law, harsh conditions, extensive damage to the city, and cruel detentions.

New Yorkers resisted tyranny then; and we are resisting tyranny now. Lets act together so that, when the history books are written, they reflect that Trump’s tyranny began to fail when he sought to occupy New York City, in the days after we elected Zohran Mamdani as our mayor – our first Muslim mayor, and our first immigrant mayor in generations – and New Yorkers remembered who we are, remembered what it means to wake up every day in this city with that copper-plated statue in the harbor, and relit the lamp of liberty, for the whole world to see.

New Yorkers have risen to these challenges before. We can do it again now.

Thank you again, Chair Restler, and thank you to the Council for your commitment to protecting the people who make this city home.

We didn’t take them to court on the FEMA funding. You could say we threatened to take it to court ourselves.

People throughout Charlotte have been using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.
There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.
“I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate WCNC.
High school students in the district staged a walkout Tuesday morning to protest immigration enforcement in the city.","The pews of the Charlotte church were packed as onlookers watched a man restrain a woman while a group in bright vests furiously blew their whistles and filmed the interaction, chanting, “La migra esta aqui.”

Another group loudly sang, “This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”

Clapping then erupted from the crowd.

The scene was among several role-play scenarios hundreds watched Wednesday evening at Dilworth United Methodist Church as part of a training on how to respond to the expanding federal immigration enforcement operation that has gripped the Charlotte area and left residents on high alert.

“Let’s practice our whistling language,” Rev. Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.

“We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”

The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.

The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts over 250 arrests in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.

Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.

People throughout Charlotte have been using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.

Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.

‘Loving your neighbors is holy’

Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.

Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”

Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.

“They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.

Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.

Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.

“People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”

That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.

She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.

“This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.

Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets

“What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”

“What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”

These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.

“I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”

Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than 30,000 students were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.

“We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”

The district issued a statement Sunday night that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.

“I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate WCNC. “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”

As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.

Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.

“We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”

Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.

“Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”

Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.

Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.

Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group announced on social media.

High school students in the district staged a walkout Tuesday morning to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.

“The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.

Business owners work to protect customers

Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.

Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.

“When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”

While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.

About half the mom-and-pop businesses the community development organization CharlotteEast works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.

“From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.

A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.

Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.

“I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247342884-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-20 09:58:29.825575

It came as activists in Eugene-Springfield reported another uptick in ICE activity Wednesday, including near the Marcola Apartments on Pierce Parkway.

University of Oregon General Counsel Jessica Price warned faculty could be charged if they try to stop a detainment, or guide a student to an alternate exit to avoid federal law enforcement.

She said while classrooms are generally private spaces, hallways are public and ICE officers can access them.

""Someone with really good intentions might promise someone safety and say, 'in my class, you are safe,'"" said Price. ""And I would say, don't make promises you can't keep.”

Price said if staff are presented with a warrant from federal law enforcement, they should forward it along to the university's legal team.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles.

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that “border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended” in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “ Operation Charlotte’s Web ” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

“We’re only open because I’m an American citizen, so it doesn’t bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well.

Louisiana Republicans voiced their support on Wednesday. The chair of the state party, Derek Babcock, said it shows a commitment from Trump and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to “keeping our citizens safe.”

The head of the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter said they were compiling information to help people know their rights and coordinating with legal services and groups connected with the immigrant community.

“We urge those with privilege and the opportunity to risk it to stand up for their neighbors and friends,” said Alanah Odoms with the ACLU of Louisiana.

Why it matters: A single joint task force raid last weekend in San Antonio netted more arrests than ICE and Border Patrol's high-profile entry into Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Texas raid, which targeted alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, resulted in more than 140 arrests, Axios San Antonio reported. Two days of surged enforcement in Charlotte totaled 130, according to press statements for the respective operations.

The San Antonio operation also resulted in more arrests than a similar operation in Chicago with federal agents and a Black Hawk helicopter, which caught 37 people.

Zoom in: The task forces, co-led by the FBI and ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, will eventually have outposts in all 50 states. They're up and running in South Texas, Alaska and Indianapolis.

They'll have a centralized command center led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Kristi Noem, with a mandate to combat cartels, international gangs and terror groups.

The task forces were established by a Day One Executive Order from Trump and began ""full implementation"" in September, according to the FBI.

Immigrants without status caught in the investigations will either be deported or used ""to pursue investigations and prosecution of those individuals,"" said Section Chief Mark Remily, who leads the Bureau's Transnational Organized Crime Program.

Zoom out: ICE has so far done high-profile operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, with one planned after Thanksgiving in New Orleans.

The immigration enforcement agency touts the arrests of the ""worst of the worst."" But it's behind on the administration's ambitious goal of 3,000 arrests a day and one million deportations per year.

To boost stats, the agency has turned to Border Patrol agents, who have used more aggressive tactics to make arrests, to aid its mission.

The result has also led to community resistance as well as lawsuits over excessive use of force, arrests of U.S. citizens and warrantless arrests.

Between the lines: The new task forces are drawing agents to their mission, as concerns grow that thousands of law enforcement officers are being assigned to the immigration agenda instead of their prior roles, as the New York Times investigated.

The priority shift has led to a drop in investigations on child trafficking, sex crimes and time-sensitive tracking of sanctioned products, like oil from Iran, the Times reports.

""D.H.S. keeps being pulled further away from its core missions in protecting the homeland,"" David Lapan, who served as DHS press secretary during the first Trump administration, told the Times.

The bottom line: ""The government has never had a one centralized location to really combat and coordinate the transnational criminal threats that we target,"" Remily said on the FBI's in-house podcast.",https://images.axios.com/wdKx9Zil7KuRE_qBpfw_mOkEZDY=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/11/19/1763595528028.jpeg,N,,2025-11-20 10:58:00.739864

“We are a city, state and country that has benefited from the hard work of immigrants,” Assm.
Praeli said the Trump administration’s policies have resulted in nearly 200,000 people either being deported or leaving the country on their own.
Those two sectors are expected to be hardest hit because immigrants tend to work in fields such as agriculture and construction.
Many of these people are being pulled from the hospitality and construction industries, she said.","An ongoing federal crackdown on immigrants is shrinking Nevada’s workforce in key industries and the state’s economy could suffer because of it, according to panelists who spoke on the issue earlier this month in Las Vegas.

The aggressive immigration tactics from President Donald Trump’s administration — including multimillion-dollar ads encouraging immigrants to self-deport — could reduce the raw number of workers keeping the state’s economy humming, panelists said at the Nov. 6 event hosted by FWD.us and Dream Big Nevada.

Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) added that immigrants are afraid to go to work, school, hospitals, immigration hearings and other events because of high arrest targets given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — and at least one business owner said he’s seen it firsthand.

“I’m personally seeing on construction sites and in our warehouses we have a lack of the construction workforce because now they’re actually afraid to be on the job site,” said Abraham Camejo, founder of small business Camejo Safety. “So not only am I having to train them and make sure that they’re complying with safety regulations from working on our roofs, on our landscaping jobs, but now they’re afraid of going to work.”

According to Maria Praeli, deputy manager of government operations for FWD.us, a nonprofit that focuses on immigration and criminal justice, Nevada has one of the largest immigrant populations in the country. Immigrants make up a quarter of Nevada’s workforce, with nearly 400,000 workers, and bring in $20.2 billion to the state’s economy.

“We are a city, state and country that has benefited from the hard work of immigrants,” Assm. Howard Watts (D-Las Vegas) said during the event at the East Las Vegas Community Center.

They work across industries, including 36 percent in construction, 31 percent in leisure and hospitality, 25 percent in transportation and 24 percent in agriculture, according to FWD.us. In Las Vegas alone, the immigrant community spends $16.6 billion a year and pays $4.3 billion a year in taxes.

Praeli said the Trump administration’s policies have resulted in nearly 200,000 people either being deported or leaving the country on their own. An analysis by her organization — which was started by Silicon Valley leaders including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for comprehensive immigration reform — estimates that by the end of the president’s four-year term, the average American family nationwide will have to pay a little over $2,000 a year due to immigration enforcement.

FWD.us ran economic simulations based on 2024 data on immigrant and U.S. workers to see how deportation, a reduction in work permits and a decrease in new workers coming into the country would change labor supply, production costs and ultimately the prices Americans pay by 2028.

The analysis stated “producer prices can be expected to increase by 14.5 percent for most food products and 6.1 percent in construction” because of immigration changes, on top of price changes stemming from other inflationary causes. Those two sectors are expected to be hardest hit because immigrants tend to work in fields such as agriculture and construction.

The report adds that “America’s working class spends most of their income on food and housing, and consequently would experience the highest cost-of-living increases.” This comes even as inflation, affordability and economic concerns are a top priority for voters and immigration being a lower priority.

Praeli said the mass deportations are affecting workers who had previously been authorized to be in the country, such as those here under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and on a Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Many of these people are being pulled from the hospitality and construction industries, she said.

FWD.us said “canceling or restricting legal work permits for those with TPS and other protected statuses, including asylum seekers, would result in nearly 2.6 million workers being sidelined from the labor market.”

Praeli also said the executive order that imposes a $100,000 fee for employers seeking H-1B visas will lead to a “massive loss of highly skilled workers across many industries.”

“We are seeing more talks about the cancellation of work permits for asylum seekers and temporary protective status holders, which will pull even more essential workers out of the economy without action from Congress to protect immigrants,” Praeli said.

Lee said the fight against hard-line immigration policies is a “slow process and it’s hard.” She also noted she cosponsored the Dignity Act, which among other things created protections for asylum seekers. The bill was introduced this summer but has made little progress since.

“It’s heartbreaking for all of us,” Lee said. “We’ve taken issues to the courts, and I know it’s not fast enough but we have been moved to a seismic shift in the environment. All I can say is we can never give up.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/01/09394fbf-immigration-rally-012125-8-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 10:58:05.013411

Greg Abbott of Texas declared on Tuesday that one of the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy and civil rights groups is a foreign terrorist organization, saying the move will prohibit the organization from acquiring land in Texas and authorize the state attorney general “to sue to shut them down” in Texas.

In his declaration, Abbott said that the group, the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, had direct ties to Hamas, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. government. The nonprofit, known by its initials, CAIR, has denied having any such ties.

The governor also suggested, without offering evidence, that CAIR’s leadership sought to impose Islamic law, known as Shariah, on Americans.

The council on Tuesday responded to Abbott in a letter, calling his declaration “defamatory” and saying it had “no basis in law or fact.”

“You do not have the authority to unilaterally declare any Americans or American institutions terrorist groups,” wrote Robert S. McCaw, the council’s director of government affairs. “Nor is there any basis to level this smear against our organization.”

CAIR Attracted Intense Scrutiny

Abbott appeared to be the first state leader to make such a declaration about the organization, which has been a presence in American political debates for more than 30 years. CAIR has attracted intensifying scrutiny and criticism since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent war in the Gaza Strip.

Abbott’s move went further than the Trump administration has so far been willing to go. His declaration also included the Muslim Brotherhood, a group founded in Egypt almost a century ago that has a range of overseas offshoots.

This year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that similar actions by the federal government against both groups were “in the works,” But the administration has yet to follow through.

Abbott also went further than the state’s hardline conservative Republican Party leadership, which urged Rubio last month to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, but did not say the same about CAIR.

Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.
Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture.
They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.
They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.","A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is set to testify Thursday about the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia, as the Trump administration continues its push to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration urged U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to lift an August order that prevents Abrego Garcia from being deported to a third-party country without due process, arguing that the government has gone through all the necessary steps to remove Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador even though in 2019, an immigration judge granted him a legal status known as withholding of removal because of concerns Abrego Garcia could be persecuted by gangs there.

He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.

In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.

Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.

The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process steps would be unwarranted.

Abrego Garcia's ""claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,"" the Justice Department said in its filing. ""This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.""

In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made ""sufficient and credible"" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.

In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on ""a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,"" following a U.S. request.

Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.

They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.

""The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,"" the attorneys said in a response to the Justice Department's motion.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also asked Xinis to keep her block on his deportation in place ""unless and until an immigration judge concurs"" with the Trump administration's determinations.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/26/85b95d25-c652-4055-894c-5f4fa66c686b/thumbnail/1200x630/ea7c75906231f245785d8803d60fb153/gettyimages-2231358090.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 08:57:00.795983

The coalition says the video appears to show agents pointing guns at a mother and her four children and forcibly removing the mother from her bed.

The ICE agents were reportedly searching for an individual who does not live at the address. According to the coalition and reporting by The City, the agents were looking for the mother’s cousin. All four children are U.S. citizens, The City reported.

“You see ICE agents become aware of the surveillance equipment that is at the home. They move it to not capture what they’re going to be doing,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said in an interview with NY1. He said the cousin ICE was searching for never lived at the home.

“But that didn’t stop them from kicking in their door and terrorizing them,” Awawdeh said. After the cellphone video ends, he said the mother was grabbed by her hair and neck while her children watched.

“Think about the little children who had to witness their mom being manhandled,” he said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson disputed the coalition’s account, saying allegations that the woman and her children were threatened with firearms were “false.”

“On Thursday, Nov. 13, ICE and U.S. Marshals Service attempted to serve a criminal arrest warrant for Raymundo Gabriel Huerra-Betancourt. His criminal history includes assault, reckless driving, and illegal re-entry. The woman in this video was the target's cousin,” the spokesperson said, adding that the address was listed on Huerra-Betancourt’s probation form and associated with his Social Security number and phone records.

“Officers approached the residence and knocked on the door for approximately 20 minutes, attempting to gain voluntary cooperation to enter the residence. When no response was received, officers used their training and lawfully entered the home. Upon entering the house, Jennifer Diaz, the target's cousin, refused to respond to the officers’ repeated knocking. Diaz refused to comply with officers’ commands despite explicitly being told to exit the room for her safety. Officers safely guided her and the children to the kitchen for their safety while they searched for the criminal target,” the spokesperson added.

The NYPD briefly responded but left after being told it was an ICE operation, as interfering with federal agents is illegal.

“It breaks my heart that a neighbor rightfully thought this was a home invasion, a family got traumatized,” City Councilmember Alexa Aviles, chair of the Committee on Immigration, said. She said the video raises questions about enforcement protocols and due process.

“What's illegal is busting out a door without following appropriate protocol,” Aviles said. “[Dragging] this mother out with her children at gunpoint.”

Advocates say the footage underscores the need for oversight and for families to know their rights.

“They have the right to remain silent, the right to ask for an attorney, the right not to open the door if there is no judicial warrant,"" Awawdeh said.

Their goal, of course, is to gerrymander U.S. House districts for 2026.
Mass immigration distorts both apportionment, which is the distribution of U.S. House seats among states, and also redistricting, which is the drawing of legislative boundaries within states.
The distortion is due to the 25 million noncitizens added to the U.S. population through immigration.
All of these groups show up in census data, but by law they cannot be voters in federal or state elections.","Interest in the midterm elections has developed even earlier than usual this cycle, due in large part to redistricting battles. Six states have already taken the unusual step of redistricting between decennial censuses, with several more states actively considering it. Their goal, of course, is to gerrymander U.S. House districts for 2026. California alone may net five extra seats for Democrats, thanks to its new district lines.

What is sometimes forgotten in the restricting debate is the role that immigration plays in distorting representation, effectively worsening the impacts of gerrymanders. Mass immigration distorts both apportionment, which is the distribution of U.S. House seats among states, and also redistricting, which is the drawing of legislative boundaries within states.

The distortion is due to the 25 million noncitizens added to the U.S. population through immigration. Noncitizens include not only illegal immigrants, but also legal permanent residents, guest workers, foreign students, etc. All of these groups show up in census data, but by law they cannot be voters in federal or state elections.

Rather than apportioning U.S. House seats by the number of eligible voters in each state, the current system apportions seats based on the total population of each state, which includes noncitizens. Since some states have far more noncitizens than average, those states get significantly more representatives per eligible voter than do states with smaller numbers of noncitizens.

Why it matters: In an earlier update, the agency said 44 of the roughly 130 arrests made during the first two days were ""criminal illegal aliens.""

Yes, but: That leaves between 86 and 206 people whose criminal backgrounds or immigration statuses are unclear.

Of the 44, DHS identified only a handful, whom it described as the ""worst of the worst"" criminals. The list included two people whom DHS describes as known gang members. Other crimes ranged from larceny to aggravated assault to driving while intoxicated. One of the featured individuals had only a bench warrant and ""illegal entry"" listed as their crime.

Axios is awaiting a response to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the full names and criminal backgrounds of those apprehended in Charlotte during ""Operation Charlotte's Web,"" which launched Nov. 15.

Catch up quick: DHS says the purpose of the Charlotte enforcement ""surge"" is to target serious criminals, including alleged murderers and child sex offenders, and those who were released from jail after immigration detainers weren't honored.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has a reputation for not ""cooperating"" with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but he's since said relationships with federal partners are improving.

Reality check: Nationwide, Border Patrol and ICE agents have been accused of stopping law-abiding citizens of Latino descent and asking them to prove citizenship, or in some cases, wrongfully detaining them.

In Chicago, 97% of undocumented immigrants detained by ICE in raids from June to early October who are still in the country had no criminal record at the time of their arrest, NPR reported, citing a Department of Justice document.

After the Trump administration tripled ICE's quota, arrests of people without criminal charges or convictions spiked, Axios reported in June.

The big picture: The ongoing Charlotte operation, now in its fifth day, is rattling the Latino community and weighing on the local economy. Immigrant-owned businesses have temporarily closed, construction sites have emptied, and school absences have surged.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools reports 30,399 students were absent on Monday. Nearly 25,700 were out on Tuesday, according to unofficial totals.

Read on … to learn more about what LAist uncovered about the latest issue embroiling the city agency responsible for LAX and its contractor.

An ongoing dispute over maintenance of parts of the system that powers the LAX Automated People Mover could be the reason the long-awaited train won’t open until next summer, or even later, according to public documents reviewed by LAist.

The current dispute adds to a long series of disagreements between the city and LINXS, the group of companies contracted to design, build and operate the train, that have led to the ongoing saga of delays, hundreds of millions in cost overruns and diminishing public confidence that there’ll ever be a rail-only connection to LAX.

An L.A. County Civil Grand Jury report released earlier this year claimed that LINXS has used the dispute resolution process and “political pressures” to force contract extensions and additional compensation throughout the design and construction process.

In October, LAist reported about how the train’s estimated completion date moved from early 2026 to next summer. The dispute detailed in the public documents offers a more specific reason for the delay, which was previously opaque.

Dispute over metering cabinet equipment

In February, staff from city agencies directed LINXS to repair faulty equipment in a metering cabinet, according to a summary of the dispute and findings by a third-party evaluator. While the type of equipment isn’t specified, it’s likely related to measuring the power distributed throughout the system.

Power was partially shut down during the period of repair work, which lasted until July 2025.

That power shut-off delayed critical testing of the technology that allows for central control of the train’s systems, according to the third-party evaluator.

The third-party evaluator’s report said LINXS argued it was not required by contract to perform the repair work and is entitled to a schedule extension and compensation. The third-party evaluator, whose recommendations are not legally binding, agreed with LINXS’ position.

Los Angeles World Airports, the agency that manages LAX and the Van Nuys Airport, did not participate in an August hearing regarding the dispute, the third-party evaluator’s findings said.

The agency “rejected” the third-party evaluator’s conclusions, according to a November report from a management consulting firm retained by project lenders to monitor project progress.

What happens next?

According to the project contract, if a dispute remains unresolved after inquiring with the third-party evaluator, the next step is for LINXS to file a claim under a section of state law that governs complaints against public entities.

A section on the California Tort Claims Act on the Sacramento County Public Law Library website notes that the claim is a required precursor to any civil action.

“Filing a claim gives the agency the opportunity to settle the claim before a lawsuit is filed and to investigate the claim so that it can properly defend itself, or to correct the conditions or practices that led to the claim,” the website states.

The management consulting firm’s November report notes that LINXS “formally submitted” a claim on Oct. 21, triggering a 60-day period for the city to “respond to the claim and sets out the basis for the LINXS entitlements to relief.”

“Submission of [the] claim was explicitly requested by [Los Angeles World Airports] as a precursor to negotiation,” the report continues.

The status of the Automated People Mover

In a statement, Los Angeles World Airports said it’s not ""unusual"" to see ""contractual disputes"" on large capital projects like the Automated People Mover and that the train is still on schedule to open to the public next summer.

“LINXS continues to assure us the train will be ready for the FIFA World Cup, but we have back up plans in place to ensure an outstanding experience for all fans who visit Los Angeles,” the statement added. “[Los Angeles World Airports] does not comment on pending legal matters.”

To find the page relevant to the Automated People Mover, head to emma.msrb.org. Then, in the search box on the upper righthand corner, search for 13048VBA5.

Halfway down the page, select the “Disclosure Documents” tab, and you’ll see a list of documents, including the third-party evaluator’s findings, as well as the monthly reports from LINXS and the management consulting firm.

Construction on the project is nearly complete, and most of the current work is focused on testing and ensuring all the parts of the system work together.

In November, Fluor, one of the companies that makes up LINXS, reported to investors that they can expect the Automated People Mover to “reach substantial completion over [the] next 3 quarters.”

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which was also named in the documents about the dispute, declined to comment.

LAist also reached out to LINXS and the companies that make up the group, but did not receive any response.

The management consulting firm also did not respond to emails requesting an interview.

News that Warner Bros. Discovery is up for sale has Hollywood buzzing. The legendary film studio, which has grown to include streaming services and cable channels, is currently accepting non-binding bids until Thursday. According to company spokesperson Robert Gibbs, they expect to have a decision about the sale by Christmas.

It's become something of a Hollywood parlor game to guess who will ultimately take over the business, which was founded in 1923 by four brothers: Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies.

Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. By 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length ""talkie"" picture: The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson.

Over the years, Warner Brothers has made or distributed countless iconic films including: Casablanca, The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon in the 1940's. The list goes on, with titles like A Clockwork Orange, Goodfellas, Barbie, as well as Bugs Bunny and all the Looney Tunes cartoons.

Warners Brothers has had multiple owners over the decades. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery. And in June, the company announced it would split in two, with film, TV and streaming studios in one camp, and in the other, mostly legacy cable channels, including CNN.

The planned split has not yet happened, and a new buyer might get the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery and its film and TV libraries.

As the film industry continues to consolidate, there's speculation that Warner Brothers' old rival Paramount could take over. Having just merged as Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has already made several overtures.

The idea of streaming giant Netflix buying the company has raised antitrust concerns on Capitol Hill. In an earnings call last month, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors, ""We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks. There is no change there.""

Industry watchers suggest other suitors could be Comcast, Amazon, or an investor who's not already in the entertainment business.

Regardless of whoever does end up buying the company, theater owners say they hope making movies for cinemas will be a priority.

""As long as we have more movies,"" says Daniel Loria, senior vice president at The Boxoffice Company, which analyzes data from studios and theaters. ""That doesn't mean the same amount, doesn't mean less, but more movies. I think you're going to find folks in the movie theater industry support any business decision that gets us there.""

Loria recalls that after Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. Crunching the numbers, Loria says in 2016, a year before the merger announcement, Disney and Fox released a total of 38 theatrical films. This year, the consolidated studios released 18.

That's a problem for theater owners who've been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down; they're competing with movie-watching on TVs, computers and phones.

Some theater owners and cinephiles also fear studio conglomerates will only greenlight a few big-budget blockbusters, leaving the lower budget indies behind.

""The concern is you're going to see less of that risk taking, less of that experimentation and less of that embracing new directors, new filmmakers in the future,"" says Max Friend, the CEO of Filmbot, the ticketing platform for independent cinemas in the U.S. ""It's really important that there are studios that are funding and supporting, cultivating that kind of work.""

He points out that this year, Warner Brothers made a string of critical hits, including Ryan Coogler's Sinners, the horror film Weapons and Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another.

Friend wonders if the next owner will take similar risks with future original, creative films.

Topline:

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman says his office is looking into allegations that people filed fake claims of childhood sexual abuse as part of two large settlements the L.A. County Board of Supervisors approved this year.

Potential amnesty: Hochman said anyone who filed a fraudulent claim and comes forward to cooperate with his office could potentially avoid prosecution. He said his office would offer something called ""use immunity,"" which he said means someone who comes forward and shares complete, truthful information about a fraudulent claim they filed would, in exchange, not have those words used against them in court. He would not go as far as to say that doing so would protect them from prosecution.

"" It's not a guarantee, but it is certainly a significant factor in deciding of the probably what will amount to hundreds of cases, potential cases that we might have, which ones we go forward on and which ones we don't.""

The backstory: In April, L.A. County supervisors approved a $4 billion settlement for thousands of people who said they were sexually abused as children while under the county's supervision. The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed in 2021 and grew to include claims against several county departments, including Probation, Children and Family Services, Parks and Recreation, Health Services, Sheriff and Fire. In late October, the Board signed off on a second payout of $828 million for a separate batch of claims.

Why it matters: Hochman said it will ultimately be taxpayers footing the bill for those two sums, and he wants to make sure L.A. County taxpayers aren't on the hook for fake claims.

"" That'll be you and me paying for that,"" Hochman said. ""That'll be our children paying for it. ... These are valuable dollars that otherwise could go to other purposes.""

Why now: The D.A.'s announcement follows a unanimous vote by L.A. County supervisors last month to direct the county counsel to investigate fraudulent claims. Days before the vote, the L.A. Times reported some plaintiffs were paid cash in exchange for agreeing to work with a law firm to sue the county.

What's next: The D.A.'s office says anyone with information about false sex abuse claims can call the hotline for the investigation at (844) 901-0001, or report it online.

A downtown hearing kicked off Wednesday, during which a federal judge will consider holding the city of Los Angeles in contempt of court. The hearing is the latest step in a long-running legal saga regarding the city's response to the region’s homelessness crisis.

The hearing was ordered by U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who has been overseeing a settlement in a lawsuit brought against the city by the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, a group of downtown business and property owners. L.A. Alliance sued the city, and county, in 2020 for failing to adequately address homelessness.

Several witnesses are expected to testify during the contempt-of-court hearing, including Gita O’Neill, the new head of the region’s top homeless services agency, and Matt Szabo, the L.A. city administrative officer.

L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger watched at least part of Wednesday’s hearing in the courtroom.

Why now?

Carter said in court documents that he’s concerned “the city has demonstrated a continuous pattern of delay” in meeting its obligations under court orders. During a hearing last week, the judge pointed to several delays, including recently reported issues related to data and interviewing city employees.

The judge noted that similar concerns have come up at previous hearings. Carter told attorneys for the city in March 2024 that he “indicated to the mayor that I’ve already reached the decision that the plaintiffs were misled” and “this is bad faith,” according to court transcripts.

The judge said in a Nov. 14 order that he’s concerned the “delay continues to this day.”

The contempt hearing is expected to cover whether the city has complied with court orders and provided regular updates to the court under the settlement agreement.

Reducing delays

Attorneys for the city have pushed back against the hearing, filing objections with the judge and making an unsuccessful emergency request with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block it from happening.

City authorities also asked the appeals court to press pause on the judge’s order to appoint a monitor in the case to make sure the city stays on track with the settlement. The city argued that Carter handed the monitor “a blank check to interfere with the democratic process,” according to court documents.

The appeals court partly denied the city’s request. It allowed Wednesday’s hearing to move forward, but it agreed to pause the appointment of Daniel Garrie as monitor.

In light of that response, attorneys for the city have argued that looking at the city’s cooperation with Garrie “would be inappropriate” during the hearing and that L.A. “cannot be held in contempt for either the substance or the manner of its compliance with the order,” according to court documents.

Previous hearings related to the settlement have elicited tense questioning of witnesses and harsh words from the judge, who has been vocal about reducing delays and moving the case forward.

In an opening statement Wednesday, Theane Evangelis — one of the attorneys representing the city — urged the judge to “turn down the heat” on the closely watched case. Evangelis said the “city is constantly under fire” in court while L.A. has made “enormous strides” in getting people off the streets.

Elizabeth Mitchell, lead attorney for L.A. Alliance, said the city treats transparency as a burden.

She said Wednesday that the “city still fights oversight harder than it fights homelessness” and that the court should address L.A. 's “consistent” delays throughout the case.

What’s next?

The hearing will resume Dec. 2, when more witnesses can appear in person.

City authorities told the court they believed a one-day hearing wouldn't be enough time to go over all the evidence.

If the judge does find the city of L.A. in contempt of court and that it ""isn't doing what it promised to do,"" the consequences could range from nothing all the way up to serious sanctions, according to Matthew Umhofer, an attorney for L.A. Alliance.

Umhofer told LAist after the hearing that sanctions could include the court ordering more intensive monitoring of the city’s performance, imposing new requirements on the city, monetary penalties or possibly a receivership.

Carter previously stopped short of seizing control of the city’s hundreds of millions of dollars in homelessness spending and handing it to a court-appointed receiver, deciding against that option in a June ruling.

L.A. Alliance is considering asking for an extension to the settlement agreement, Umhofer said.

“The city has gotten away with not complying for a very long time,” he said. “So extending the agreement can be among the things that we might ask for ... given the pattern of delay and obstruction.""

The Seventh Circuit panel cautioned against ""overreading"" its stay, noting that a fast-track appeal could result in a ""more tailored and appropriate"" order.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction after media organizations and demonstrators accused federal officers of using excessive force during an immigration operation that has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since September across Chicago and nearby communities.

Justice Department lawyers argued that the order restricted law enforcement’s ability to carry out its duties and could ""subvert"" the constitutional structure.

The panel said the order was ""too prescriptive"" because it specified riot control weapons and other devices in a way that ""resembles a federal regulation.""

Ellis’ order barred agents from using physical force and chemical agents such as tear gas and pepper balls unless necessary or to prevent ""an immediate threat."" The judge said the use of those tools violated the constitutional rights of journalists and protesters.

Witnesses told the court they were tear-gassed, shot with pepper balls while praying, and had guns pointed at them.

Ellis found that Trump administration witnesses were ""simply not credible,"" including Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander who led the Chicago area operation before moving on to North Carolina.

Bovino has defended the agents’ use of force and oversaw about 230 officers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the region beginning in September. Federal border agents are expected to next be deployed to New Orleans.

The immigration operation has drawn multiple lawsuits, including claims of inhumane conditions at a federal immigration facility — allegations that prompted a federal judge and attorneys to visit the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement center outside Chicago last week.

At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.
From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim.
The gutting of the immigration court has driven migrants to one place where standards of judicial independence are upheld: federal court.","The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away.

“I can’t do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.”

“I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.”

Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing.

The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant.

Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man’s asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife’s shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case.

The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.”

Similar scenes of courthouse arrests, part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics.

Trump's pledge during his 2024 campaign, to impose hardline immigration policies was a major reason he won a second term. Now that Americans have seen how the his plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57% of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security.

Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation's 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

In a court system with a backlog of about 3.8 million asylum cases, families have been torn apart and lives upended. Due process seemingly is an afterthought.

“When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations"" of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges.

""That’s what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.”

Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump's allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line.

Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints.

Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings.

“As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance.

But that is not how cases are often unfolding.

Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials.

According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump's claims that he is targeting the ‘worst of the worst,’ most don't have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data.

ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom.

“Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.

The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.

“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.”

The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.

It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge’s performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings.

To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers' claims.

“It’s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court.

Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias.

The memos highlight the courts’ weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution.

In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts, about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases.

“It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general.

Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had ""restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.”

DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

For some inside the courts, work has become a stressful, lonesome grind. Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated.

One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America’s borders was a patriotic duty.

The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel’s memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author’s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.”

Today, its message torments.

“This isn’t what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said.

After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether.

Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP.

Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

The harsh tactics have had one effect the administration wants: Voluntary migrant departures have soared, with more than 14,000 people seeking court permission to self-deport in the first eight months of 2025, according to federal data collected by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that pushes for transparency in migration proceedings. That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting.

At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.

“I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala.

“I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico.

Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim.

“There’s a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.”

The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny’s Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots.

But Nemer’s fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him.

“As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,’ I knew I was being terminated,” she said.

Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency ""has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.”

No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed.

Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency’s “Fork in the Road” resignation offer.

The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP.

It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34% nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways.

Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List, a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration’s policies and personnel decisions.

The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America’s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration.

“As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn’t exist before,” he said.

Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed.

Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges.

“All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.”

The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned.

Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried.

Word of the former judge's return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing.

“By the third hug I couldn’t hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

Bug spray, sunscreen, fans and umbrellas compete with legal binders in the bed of a Toyota pickup across the street from immigration court in San Antonio.

This is the new office of American Gateways.

In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court.

But lawyers for American Gateways keep coming, four times a week, setting up in a parking lot. The conference room they once occupied inside the courthouse is now used as a break room for ICE agents.

Assistance ranges from helping immigrants file motions to rehearsing what they will say to judges. When they can, they sign people up for virtual appearances to minimize the risk of arrest.

The gutting of the immigration court has driven migrants to one place where standards of judicial independence are upheld: federal court.

Since May 15, when courthouse sweeps began, migrants have filed more than 3,000 habeas corpus petitions — to determine if someone is lawfully held in custody — seeking release.

The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases.

“The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney.

One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela.

Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu’s husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

Those unable to afford a lawyer so they can sue in federal court have little recourse.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified.

The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents.

The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband’s arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.”

The husband clutched the sleeping infant’s carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone.

“I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!”

Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers.

The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention.

Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear.","A federal judge is continuing his investigation into whether the Trump administration defied court orders in a high-profile immigration case involving the Alien Enemies Act, he said Wednesday.

In an 8-3 ruling last week, a federal appeals court left in place an earlier decision that blocked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's April order, which said that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over its ""willful disregard"" of his order in March to turn around two planes carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members bound for a prison in El Salvador.

But the panel also found that even though his initial ruling had been struck down, Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order.

""The district court's order here was a measured and essential response to what it reasonably perceived as shocking executive branch conduct,"" Judges Nina Pillard, Robert Wilkins and Bradley Garcia wrote in a joint opinion.

""I will be going forward with it,"" Boasberg said. ""I certainly intend to find out what happened that day.""

In April, Boasberg wrote that the Justice Department's actions were ""sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such [a] conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.""

""The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,"" Boasberg wrote.

Boasberg will also continue to hear arguments on the merits of the case, which arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-invoked law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans whom his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.

After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a group of Venezuelan migrants immediately sued to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. Boasberg swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, in an emergency hearing, ordered government lawyers to return to the U.S. people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed toward El Salvador.

The judge then blocked the Trump administration from conducting deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities, however.

But Boasberg said that after his orders, the government did not stop the removal process under the Alien Enemies Act, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the invocation of the act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.

Remarks by Trump administration officials raised questions for Boasberg regarding whether it had violated his order. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that ""boasts"" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele ""intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.""

Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear.

On Wednesday, Boasberg said that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and live witness testimony under oath, if needed.

Potential witnesses, Boasberg said, include Erez Reuveni, who admitted in court that the Justice Department should not have deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia in March and was put on leave and then fired by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS News' ""60 Minutes"", Reuveni said he was called to a meeting with Emil Bove, who was then the No. 3 in charge at the Justice Department and is now a federal judge, and Bove told him to potentially ignore court orders if a judge tried to slow the Alien Enemies Act deportations that were underway.

""Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what,"" Reuveni said. ""Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'""

Another likely witness, Boasberg said, is Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general who was the attorney of record in the first hearings in the case.

In court, Boasberg asked Ensign if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did, but the planes never turned around.

He said he's likely to hold his first hearing on the contempt investigation the week after Thanksgiving.

""Justice requires me to move promptly on this,"" Boasberg said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/30/e406d206-bca9-49e5-a2b7-e250bf89acbe/thumbnail/1200x630/ec0ac6d3df330957aaf5387871adb021/ap25093587208419.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 03:56:38.364202

The 51-year-old father and grandfather was arrested in Crestwood last month during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement ""blitz"" in the Chicago area.

But last week, he was released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after prevailing in a federal court case. Three days after his return home, he sat down with the ABC7 Chicago I-Team to share his story.

""I felt so much terror, so much fear,"" Cabrera told the I-Team, speaking in Spanish. ""We longed to see two minutes of daylight, but we never saw it in the 41 days I was there.""

Cabrera is one of hundreds of people identified by the Department of Homeland Security as possibly arrested in violation of a 2022 consent decree restricting when agents can arrest someone without a warrant.

It was on Oct. 3 when Ramiro Cabrera, owner of ""Cabrera Rental Center"" was setting up a tent for a business in Crestwood when surveillance footage captured federal immigration agents pull up in a white van. And in less than three minutes, he was in federal custody.

""No one expects that,"" Cabrera told the I-Team. ""We were working at my company, doing our normal jobs. And in a matter of minutes, two minutes changed my world so much.""

Cabrera has lived in the U.S. without legal permission for more than 20 years, and has four U.S. citizen children, including a 19-year-old daughter he supports.

He has no criminal record, according to court declarations. But after agents arrested him, Cabrera says he was treated like a criminal.

""I don't know why that happens in a country like the United States,"" Cabrera told the I-Team.

Cabrera said he was initially taken to the Broadview ICE facility for two days, where he says he was given two bottles of water per day with a ham sandwich, and no phone calls with his attorney.

""There were between 90 and 110 of us there on the two nights I was there,"" Cabrera said. ""I think I slept for about half an hour each night. The bathrooms had no doors. We didn't bathe; we didn't change our clothes, very sad, terrifying.""

Cabrera said at one point during his time at Broadview, he had to be taken to an outside hospital due to complications from high blood pressure.

""I thought I might die. I said, 'My God, forgive me if I die. My daughters are fine. I'm leaving, but I felt like I was dying,'"" Cabera said. ""They took me to the hospital; they took good care of me. They cured me.""

Cabrera's daughter, Mariana, said she and her family lived in constant anxiety during the 41 days he was gone, knowing where their father was.

""It was hard to know, going to sleep, especially when he was in Broadview when we heard of the conditions there,"" Mariana said. ""Knowing that, like, I get to sleep in a comfortable bed tonight while he's there because he's undocumented.""

Since his time at Broadview, a federal judge has ordered ICE to improve conditions at the facility after hearing testimony from people detained about unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.

Cabrera was eventually transferred to an ICE detention facility in Clay County, Indiana, where he remained until his release.

As the I-Team previously reported, Cabrera's attorney, former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jennifer Peyton, filed a habeas petition in federal court, challenging Cabrera's detention as unlawful and demanding due process.

More than 30 character witness letters were filed in his support from members in the community, Peyton said, and it was the habeas case that ultimately led to a judge ordering his release last week.

""I cried when I left. I called (my daughter); she cried,"" Cabrera told the I-Team. ""Only a miracle could happen, and it happened.""

While his habeas case was proceeding, Cabrera was also added as a class member in litigation over a 2022 consent decree restricting when immigration agents can arrest someone without a warrant, often referred to as the ""Castañon Nava settlement.""

He is one of more than 600 people who the Department of Homeland Security has since identified as possibly arrested in violation of that agreement.

Judge Jeffrey Cummings has ordered more than 400 people to be released by this Friday, and on Tuesday, Cummings denied a request by the government to delay the release.

If Cabrera hadn't been released already, he would have been included in that group.

In the list of individuals that DHS officials filed with the court, Cabrera was designated as having a ""Medium"" risk to public safety, but no further explanation was given on the basis for that designation. Attorneys have questioned the methods behind these ratings.

DHS officials did not respond to the I-Team's questions about the designation, or request for comment on Cabrera's release.

Cabrera and his attorney said that designation makes no sense.

""That part of the government makes me sad. It makes me very sad because I've been a defender of the government,"" Cabrera told the I-Team. ""No matter if they're Democrats or Republicans, it's the best government in the world. They're just doing things wrong right now.""

Cabrera's immigration case is not over. His attorney told the I-Team he's awaiting a new court date to be set in immigration court.

While he's happy to be home, Cabrera hopes the people he met while in ICE custody -- most of whom he said did not have criminal histories -- will be released to their families just like him.

""I will always ask God in my prayers that they get out because they should be with their families, like I am,"" Cabrera said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18177687_111925-WLS-iteam-ice-detainee-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-20 00:56:16.270406

Nearly one year since his return to the White House, Trump’s insistence that legal immigration is not only tolerable but an economic necessity continues to roil hardliners on the right, who are at odds with the business and tech interests that Trump has long aligned himself with.

“The people who are against us are really, really smart,” Trump said. “They’re unbelievable patriots, but they just don’t understand — our people have to be taught.”

He added that companies that invest big money to create plants here need to “bring a lot of their people from their country to get that plant open, operating and working. I’m sorry. So my poll numbers just went down, but with smart people, they’ve gone way up.”

Trump’s statement is unlikely to quell the MAGA anger, which has bubbled up every few months since the president was elected. Many saw in the president someone who would fight to curtail nearly all immigration, sparked by concerns over job losses or, more controversially, racially tinged fears about Americans being replaced by foreigners.

Trump reignited the debate earlier this month when he said on Fox News that Americans don’t have “certain talents” to fill jobs, in response to Laura Ingraham, who had pushed him on his stance on visas for high-skilled workers, known as H-1Bs. And even as the White House and much of the Trump base was consumed with the vote to release the Epstein files this week, frustration among key Trump allies about the president’s comments simmered beneath the surface.

With little hope that Congress can reach a solution on immigration, the president is in a quagmire of his own making. He is caught between those within his base and administration who want to overhaul the employment visa system and others who argue that the economy is dependent on low- and high-skilled immigrant labor, and that the country’s policies must reflect that reality.

“You’ve got things like H-1Bs taking away jobs from Americans, that’s huge,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) told POLITICO last week. She added that it’s a top issue for her constituents.

Some Trump allies argue that the outrage is misplaced and point to the president’s September decision to charge a $100,000 fee for new applicants to receive a visa through the H1-B program, which allows workers such as engineers and computer programmers to temporarily work in the United States. The move was designed to reduce the number of visas used by U.S. companies. The administration earlier this month also announced new probes into H-1B abuse.

The White House has argued that Trump has done more than past presidents to prioritize American workers by tightening immigration laws, including by issuing new guidance to ensure unauthorized immigrants are not allowed access to federal workforce development resources and grants and changes to the U.S. citizenship test.

“Under the President’s bold leadership, all employment gains have gone exclusively to American-born workers; critical and long-overdue reforms are being made to the H-1B visa process; America’s manufacturing industry is being reshored through powerful tariffs and trade deals; and illegal immigrants are no longer stealing taxpayer-funded benefits,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Trump’s comments on Wednesday aren’t the only time he’s unveiled a soft spot in his otherwise hardline immigration stance. He spurred MAGA blowback in June, when he promised a solution for farmers who rely on undocumented labor, which immigration hawks slammed as a slippery slope. And after vowing to aggressively revoke Chinese student visas earlier this year, the president reversed course, announcing he would allow 600,000 Chinese students to attend U.S. universities.

Trump’s Kennedy Center comments are at odds with immigration hawks and senior policymakers in his administration who insist the program needs to be overhauled.

“If you reform ‘x,’ but keep ‘y’ part of the system, it won’t matter either way,” said Kevin Lynn, a fellow at the right-leaning Institute for Sound Public Policy think tank in Washington who leads an effort advocating on behalf of U.S. tech workers. “The H1-B visa system is not being abused, it’s working exactly as designed to to displace American workers and prevent recourse.”

It also appears that Trump’s message is at odds with Vice President JD Vance who, in a separate interview with Fox News last week, said that the U.S. should use technology to “empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor.”

Trump’s break with his base reflects his desire to increase investments in the tech and manufacturing sectors, which the president does not believe would be possible — in the short term — without foreign workers.

The president also has close ties to the tech industry, a top user of the H-1B program. During the last fiscal year, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google relied most on H-1B visas. Those companies have contributed handsomely to Trump efforts including his inaugural fund and the $300 million ballroom that will replace the White House East Wing.

“You saw the list … they’re all on there, and they all want their H-1B workers,” said a person close to the administration, granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “So he’s hearing about this from all of those folks.”

Trump’s defense of foreign workers has some fearing that it will kill the already slim chance for Congress to pass immigration reform. Still, some lawmakers have moved ahead with legislation to overhaul a system they say is increasingly harming American college graduates.

“I tend to be on the skeptical side of that program,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told POLITICO, adding that the president’s $100,000 fee for H-1B applicants is a “good idea.”

“In general we want to do everything we can to promote American workers and get as many Americans into jobs, get wages up,” he said. “I tend to view all of our visa policies through that lens.”

Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) introduced a bill in September which would restructure the lottery system for H1-B visas and direct DHS to eliminate the Optional Practical Training program, which advocates say has allowed companies to hire foreign-born workers without having to pay the government taxes for their work under the auspices of continuing their education. Other H-1B legislation is expected in the coming weeks and months, though it’s unclear if there will be an appetite without buy-in from the White House.

“There’s a political imperative after the GOP got their heads handed to them,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies think tank in Washington, which favors restrictions on legal immigration. “There’s a real election in a year, and lots of messaging from Labor and DHS about protecting American workers. But action is needed.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F55%2F22%2F7a4823e3493283ae3a19c85f0c25%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2247496868,N,,2025-11-19 21:56:27.582480

Chula Vista has been the site of at least one high-profile, immigration-related arrest this year.
A disclosure process could give residents more clarity on when and where federal immigration agents are launching enforcement actions.
Elsewhere in California, city officials have been divided over whether to tell residents when federal immigration agents are in town.
While similar resolutions have drawn large crowds and sparked heated deliberation in other cities, Chula Vista City hall was relatively quiet Tuesday night.","Chula Vista residents will be getting more information about how their police officers interact with federal immigration officials after the City Council voted Tuesday to develop a new disclosure process.

In a 4-0 vote, council members in San Diego County’s second-largest city directed the city attorney to develop clear procedures for how police should respond to agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“Sometimes we don't even know that there's ICE activity happening in the city,” said Councilmember Cesar Fernandez, who led development of the resolution. “But if the department were to learn of it, they need to report it in a timely fashion.”

Mayor John McCann, the lone Republican on the city’s five-member council, abstained. McCann claimed he was unable to “oppose or potentially oppose federal law” as a naval reserve officer.

Tuesday’s resolution makes Chula Vista the latest city in San Diego County to establish new protections for immigrants amid the Trump administration’s aggressive mass deportation campaign. Others include San Diego, Oceanside and Vista.

Chula Vista has been the site of at least one high-profile, immigration-related arrest this year. In August, ICE agents arrested a parent from South Korea outside an East Chula Vista elementary school. The parent’s children were in the backseat of the car.

Elected officials sharply criticized the actions of armed federal agents, who made the arrest during morning dropoff. Councilmember Michael Inzunza said the display of force was too close to the school and unnecessary for apprehending someone who does not appear to have been charged with or convicted of a crime.

“If this was just an expired visa or a warrant, why make such a traumatic event?” Inzunza told KPBS in August.

A disclosure process could give residents more clarity on when and where federal immigration agents are launching enforcement actions.

In an interview with KPBS, Fernandez said he envisioned Chula Vista police publishing a notice on their public data portal every time they were contacted by ICE or other federal immigration agencies.

ICE has arrested at least 35 people in Chula Vista this year, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by KPBS. More than half of them, 51%, had not been charged or convicted of a crime.

Those numbers are up from previous years amid ICE’s acceleration of arrests in San Diego and Imperial County. Last year, ICE arrested just nine people in Chula Vista, and six of them had been convicted of crimes. In 2023, ICE arrested 4 people — all of them convicted of crimes, the data show.

Elsewhere in California, city officials have been divided over whether to tell residents when federal immigration agents are in town.

This summer, the Orange County city of Santa Ana considered its own alert policy requiring police to alert residents of ICE activity within 48 hours of receiving a notification. But they backed off the idea after U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said his office could prosecute city officials over the policy.

Chula Vista’s disclosure policy is still under development, but Fernandez said his hope is to provide clarity for both police officers and residents.

“It provides that transparency for the public and ultimately creates more trust for residents in our city,” he said.

Tuesday’s resolution also included other restrictions on immigration enforcement.

For example, it tasks city staff with reworking the language of city agreements to bar future contractors from sharing personal data in “cooperation with discriminatory enforcement actions.”

Council members also asked city staff to create a digital “Know Your Rights” campaign and explore partnering with immigration law groups to offer residents legal services.

While similar resolutions have drawn large crowds and sparked heated deliberation in other cities, Chula Vista City hall was relatively quiet Tuesday night.

Longtime human rights advocate Pedro Rios sent a written notice of support. Two commenters spoke in opposition of the resolution, including newly appointed city Housing and Homelessness Commissioner Bogdan Matuszynski.

“This is virtue-signalling to the most I have ever seen,” said Matuszynski “If you vote yes on this, you are actually dividing us more.”

Councilmember Jose Preciado pushed back on Matuszynski’s argument. He said families are being “attacked” under President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

“I use that language very clearly,” Preciado said. “Immigration law is a civil matter. It should be dealt with in a civil way. But it is not that.”",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/b535914/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3175+0+428/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a%2F5e%2F3089e116482789f66209f3b399c5%2F20250722-ksuzuki-chula-vista-city-council-file-060.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:22.583076

An immigration policy based on dignity What would dignity-based immigration policy require?","The past 10 months have seen the second Trump administration pursue increasingly draconian immigration enforcement policies aimed at seizing and removing unauthorized immigrants or even those who are perceived to be. Sandra Portocarrero writes that this approach ignores basic human dignity. Human dignity, she argues, is an inherent quality, and should not be based on someone’s worth to American society. A dignity-based immigration policy would end the current administration’s practices and mean a fundamental shift in the way we think and talk about immigration.

There are different approaches to describe, justify, or challenge the Trump administration’s draconian policies for managing the presence of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Those in favor believe that anyone who has crossed the border illegally or overstayed their visa has clearly violated the law and should face the consequences of their actions. Others with moderate views believe that certain “ideal undocumented immigrants”—those who work and contribute positively to American society—should be spared from the threat of deportation or other draconian policies, precisely because of their contributions. And then there are people, like me, who believe that any decision or action affecting any human being, including unauthorized immigrants, should be made on the basis of dignity. That is, founded on the principle that people have inherent human worth not because of their economic contributions to society but simply because they exist.

In writing this piece, I first thought of providing a justification for why people migrate to the United States. I considered writing about US intervention in Latin America and how privatization and deregulation led to the destabilization of political economies, pushing people to seek better lives in places like the United States. Or perhaps writing about the Bracero Program, the temporary labor initiative that ran from 1942 to 1964, which brought millions of Mexican laborers into the US to address labor shortages. What would have happened to the United States’ agricultural and railroad industries during and after World War II without the braceros? But enough justifications in favor of unauthorized immigrants have been written on the basis of US intervention abroad or US policy. The underlying tone in those arguments hovers somewhere between “we created this mess, let’s deal with it” and “unauthorized immigrants are hardworking people. Let’s keep them.”

Dignity is an inherent quality – not based on someone’s “worth”

The justification I provide here is made solely on the basis of dignity. Our modern understanding of dignity is heavily influenced by philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that dignity stems from human rational autonomy—a quality that requires us to treat every person as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. This means that our appreciation of someone, or the worth we attribute to a person, should not be based on what that person does for American society through the fulfillment of jobs that “nobody wants” or jobs where the undocumented worker is exploited and underpaid. In the Kantian sense, dignity is not earned through productivity or good behavior. Dignity is an inherent quality of being human. So, when we condition our treatment of unauthorized immigrants on their utility to American society—when we ask, “what have you done for us Americans?” we reduce human beings to mere instruments, violating the very foundation of human dignity.

It is worth noting that neither the Declaration of Independence nor the US Constitution explicitly mentions the word “dignity.” Yet the concept permeates both documents and the jurisprudence that has shaped American society. My interpretation of the Declaration’s assertion that all people “are created equal” and “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” is that worth and dignity are inherent to the human condition. The Constitution’s protections in the Bill of Rights against searches and seizures, cruel punishment, and deprivations of life, liberty, or property without due process all flow from an underlying recognition of human worth. While the authors of the US Constitution may not have used the word, they built a system of government premised on respect for human dignity.

The consequences when human dignity is not honored

But what happens when government actions, regardless of which administration, fail to honor the dignity of humans? In part IV of her dissent in Utah v. Strieff (2016), Justice Sotomayor wrote about how unlawful police stops violate the dignity of people and “corrode all our civil liberties.” Writing to herself, she added how such violations of dignity and the risk of being a victim of scrutiny disproportionately affects those who are Black and Global Majority, describing how these practices implies that people are not “citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state just waiting to be cataloged.”

Indeed, these experiences resonate with the experience of unauthorized immigrants. Current immigration enforcement practices—workplace raids, detention centers, family separations, the constant threat of deportation—treat human beings as subjects to be surveilled, catalogued, and removed. What is more worrisome is that these practices allow for racial profiling, the practice of targeting individuals for suspicious activities based solely on the individuals perceived race or ethnicity or country of origin, in a country where racial segregation and the practice of slavery was once legal. In fact, in a 6-3 vote in the Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem case, the Supreme Court granted an emergency request from the Trump administration that temporarily allowed Immigration and Costumes Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents to stop anyone they perceived to be in the state of California without authorization. Most of the people stopped by these agents during these raids were perceived as Latinos. Again, Justice Sotomayor dissented. She warned that the US Supreme Court’s decision risked turning Latinos into second class citizens. Sotomayor said: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.” The practice of stopping people based on how they look denies the fundamental dignity of millions of people living in the United States.

But the violation of dignity extends beyond enforcement practices to the very language and framing of the immigration debate. When we speak of unauthorized immigrants as “illegals,” we deny their humanity. When we debate their presence based solely on economic impact or whether they are a net benefit to the economy or a fiscal burden—we engage in precisely the kind of instrumental reasoning that denies their dignity, because we refer to people as means rather than ends.

Arguments that defend unauthorized immigrants on the basis of their contributions—“they work hard,” “they pay taxes,” “they do jobs Americans won’t do”—inadvertently participate in this instrumentalization. These arguments, while well-intentioned, make the dignity of people conditional.

An immigration policy based on dignity

What would dignity-based immigration policy require? At a minimum, it would demand an end to degrading and dehumanizing practices: detention centers that separate families and hold people in cage-like conditions, abolishing travel bans based on people’s characteristics, workplace raids that terrorize communities; deportations that occur without adequate due process or consideration of family ties and community integration. It would require us to create pathways for people already living in the United States to regularize their status, not because they have earned it through good behavior or economic contributions, but because their dignity demands that we not perpetually relegate millions to a legal limbo, such as those who currently fall under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) categories, that denies them basic protections and opportunities.

More broadly, it would require a fundamental shift in how we think and talk about immigration. Instead of asking what unauthorized immigrants have done to deserve to stay, we should ask what justifies treating any group of human beings as perpetually excludable from the protections and recognition that dignity demands. Instead of debating who among unauthorized immigrants is worthy of compassion—the DACA, the essential workers, the parents of US citizens—we should recognize that all are worthy simply by virtue of being human. This is not some sort of naivete mixed with idealism. It is a practical framework grounded in the fundamental principles of human rights and the constitutional democracy we, Americans, have historically fought for and deserve.",https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/58/files/2025/11/Dignity-not-detention-Flickr-747x420-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:27.086317

Circuit Court of Appeals put the entire order on hold.
Then, on Nov. 5, she presided over an eight-hour hearing featuring emotional testimony from witnesses who spoke of jarring encounters with armed federal agents.
Ellis’ order, which is now on hold, forbade agents from using “riot control weapons” against protesters or observers who pose no immediate threat, and without two warnings.
The 7th Circuit then found that the meetings would infringe on the separation of powers.","The federal appeals court in Chicago signaled Wednesday it might narrow an historic order handed down earlier this month, which limited the use of force by federal agents amid the aggressive deportation campaign that swept the city this fall.

For now, a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put the entire order on hold. The panel found the Nov. 6 preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to be “overbroad.” But it also promised a quick appeal process.

“In no uncertain terms,” the panel wrote, “the district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them.

“The practical effect is to enjoin all law enforcement officers within the executive branch,” it said.

The panel, made up of Judges Michael Brennan, Frank Easterbrook and Michael Scudder, set a briefing schedule that lasts through Dec. 8. Oral arguments have not been scheduled.

It’s the second time the 7th Circuit has intervened in the case before Ellis, brought by media organizations such as the Chicago Headline Club, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Newspaper Guild, which represents journalists at the Chicago Sun-Times.

It became a high-profile vehicle for lawyers to challenge the use of tear gas, pepper balls and other aggressive tactics by U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and the agents who carried out “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Ellis at one point forced Bovino into her courtroom and also required him to sit for a five-hour deposition. Then, on Nov. 5, she presided over an eight-hour hearing featuring emotional testimony from witnesses who spoke of jarring encounters with armed federal agents.

She also heard portions of Bovino’s videotaped deposition, in which he said the agents’ use of force had been “more than exemplary.”

But news broke days after Ellis handed down her preliminary injunction that Bovino and many of his agents would be leaving town, at least for the winter. They’ve since taken their deportation campaign to Charlotte, North Carolina.

A DHS source told the Chicago Sun-Times they could return four-fold in March. Ellis made note of that reporting as she recently scheduled a trial on a more permanent ruling for March 2. She’s also set to meet with lawyers in the case Thursday.

Ellis’ order, which is now on hold, forbade agents from using “riot control weapons” against protesters or observers who pose no immediate threat, and without two warnings. It restricted the feds’ use of chokeholds, and it required agents to display identifying star or badge numbers “conspicuously” in “two separate places.”

Ellis made clear during the litigation that she did not intend to micromanage agents, nor did she mean to interfere with the executive branch’s decision to enforce federal immigration law.

Still, the appellate panel found that her order “resembles a federal regulation” when it came to restrictions on the use of “riot control weapons.”

The appeals court panel also questioned whether the plaintiffs have standing that gives them the authority to sue the Trump administration. They said there are “open questions” as to whether the harm allegedly inflicted upon the plaintiffs in the past “is likely to imminently happen to them in the future.”

“A fear that such harm will recur is insufficient, on its own, to show standing for injunctive relief,” the panel wrote. “And we are aware of public reporting suggesting that the enhanced immigration enforcement initiative may have lessened or ceased, which could affect both the justiciability of this case and the propriety of injunctive relief.”

The panel also warned, “do not overread today’s order,” promising the expedited appeal process.

“We have not concluded that preliminary relief is precluded,” the panel wrote. “Acting on a very compressed timeline, the district court has developed voluminous and robust factual findings. Those findings may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by these plaintiffs.”

The 7th Circuit also intervened last month after Ellis, having already ordered Bovino into her courtroom, told him she wanted him to return every weeknight over seven days, so they could discuss his agents’ daily actions.

She did so after hearing claims that the agents, including Bovino, were using tear gas without justification.

Bovino agreed to the meetings. But the Justice Department challenged the order. The 7th Circuit then found that the meetings would infringe on the separation of powers.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6557f53/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3558+0+299/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2Fce%2Fccd2e281474696beb85729a280cd%2Fbroadviewprotest-100425-013.JPG,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:41.004437

A key premise of the hearing was the wrongful detention of U.S. citizens in immigration enforcement, which have become visible amid the U.S. government’s sweeping efforts in immigration raids.
A recent ProPublica report counted 170 such incidents since the beginning of the Trump administration.
“We’re watching the Trump administration weaponize the government and military against its citizens right now,” Salinas concluded.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in an opening statement that people on the left continue to vilify immigration enforcement officials who are simply carrying out their duties under the law, and assaults and attacks on immigration officers have skyrocketed.","House Democrats held a forum Wednesday to call attention to harms from President Donald Trump’s tough-on-immigration enforcement push, highlighting stories of individuals who interacted with immigration agents.

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the event was necessary to push back on Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions and the Trump administration’s policies.

“Democrats are doing what Republicans won’t, sounding the alarm on what Border Patrol and ICE are doing to American citizens and communities across the country under the Trump administration,” Thompson said.

Witnesses included Rev. David Black, a Chicago-based pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, who told of his story of immigration agents firing upon him with pepper balls while he was protesting at the Broadview ICE Detention Center.

“We know very little about what happens to people after they are detained by ICE, though many are sent to outsourced internment camps, which have been described by independent observers as death camps,” Black said.

James Brown, a military veteran, told the story about his wife Donna Hughes Brown, an Irish national whom he said legal permanent U.S. resident with a green card. He said she is currently in immigration detention based on misdemeanor bad check charges from more than a decade ago that were valued at $60.

Brown questioned why the Trump administration would seek to detain his wife for the misdemeanor and seek to deport her while Trump issues pardons in million-dollar fraud cases.

“You know, my wife’s got a $60 deal, and they pardon people for millions of dollars,” Brown said. “Just insane.”

Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs on immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union, told the forum the Trump administration policies were not about immigration enforcement but “consolidating power.”

“The administration promises safety but threatens the safety of us by unleashing agents in our communities and essentially promising them immunity, immunity that they do not have,” Shah said.

Other witnesses were pediatricians — Minal Giri, executive director of the Midwest Human Rights Consortium, and Alan Shapiro, senior medical director of the Bronx Health Collective — who warned about the immigration raids’ impact on the health of children and called for schools and hospital to be declared safe zones from immigration enforcement.

A key premise of the hearing was the wrongful detention of U.S. citizens in immigration enforcement, which have become visible amid the U.S. government’s sweeping efforts in immigration raids. A recent ProPublica report counted 170 such incidents since the beginning of the Trump administration.

Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-Ore., said the number is actually “at least 172” and shared the stories of two of her constituents who are U.S. citizens and detained by immigration enforcement.

One was a woman who was with her husband and taken from her car, had a gun pointed to her face, her wrists handcuffed to her ankles and was detained for hours at a field office in Portland before immigration officers realized their mistake, Salinas said.

The other was a man who was taken from work site by masked ICE agents, forced on to the floor of van and held for hours at a field office despite his pleas they had the wrong person, she said.

“We’re watching the Trump administration weaponize the government and military against its citizens right now,” Salinas concluded. “This is plain and simple. That is what they’re doing.”

Senate hearing

The forum took place as a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee concurrently held a separate hearing titled, “ICE Under Fire: The Radical Left’s Crusade Against Immigration Enforcement,” which a different perspective on immigration enforcement and hostility toward officials as the problem.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in an opening statement that people on the left continue to vilify immigration enforcement officials who are simply carrying out their duties under the law, and assaults and attacks on immigration officers have skyrocketed.

He said people have rammed officers with vehicles, thrown rocks, bottles and smoke grenades, laid down in roads to prevent officers from leaving and slashed tires on government vehicles, among other actions.

“Protestors have made violent threats against ICE officers, comparing them to fascists and Nazis, inciting more violence against immigration officers who are again are simply doing the job Congress asked them to do, they are enforcing federal laws,” Cornyn said.

Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said in an opening statement that American citizens were caught up in these raids, such as a pregnant woman in Florida, a U.S. citizen, who was thrown to the ground in an arrest and later miscarried.

“What we are seeing every day is new acts of brutality and misuse of force in communities across the country,” Padilla said.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/police_gold_medal671_120622-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:56:31.626508

State sovereign immunity derives from the traditional immunity held by governments at the time of the Constitution’s ratification.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court should hold that the NJTC can be held accountable in court for the injuries it causes.","Under our constitutional system, states like New Jersey have sovereign immunity, which protects them from being sued unless they have agreed to it. But states can create corporations that are distinct from the state to carry out public functions like transportation. Buses operated by one such entity, the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJTC), struck and injured people in New York and Pennsylvania. When defending against suits to recover damages, the NJTC insisted that it was immune from suit as an arm of the State of New Jersey. The Court of Appeals of New York disagreed, while the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed that the NJTC was immune. The United States Supreme Court agreed to review both decisions.

In November 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that the NJTC lacks sovereign immunity and can be sued for injuries it causes.

State sovereign immunity derives from the traditional immunity held by governments at the time of the Constitution’s ratification. And under English common law at that time, corporations like the NJTC were considered legal entities distinct from the sovereign, which could sue and be sued, regardless of whether they served a public purpose. As a wealth of scholarly treatises and judicial decisions makes clear, the common law inextricably associated the capacity to sue and be sued with corporate status. Accordingly, even corporate entities associated with the monarch, like the East India Company, the Bank of England, and others, were routinely sued in the decades preceding ratification of the Constitution.

The American Framers embraced the English rule that state-affiliated corporations could be haled into court. As Chief Justice John Marshall recognized, American “ideas of a corporation, its privileges and its disabilities,” were “derived entirely from the English books.” Throughout the federal and state constitutional conventions, participants consistently distinguished corporations from true sovereigns like the states. Precisely because the states were not corporations, it was understood that states would retain their sovereignty and be immune from suit without their consent.

It was also understood, however, that state-affiliated corporations, unlike the states themselves, were amenable to suit. In the early decades of the new nation, the Supreme Court regularly exercised jurisdiction over these corporations, such as state-created and state-controlled banks. The Court was clear that “public corporations,” i.e., those “founded by the government, for public purposes,” could be sued just like any others. These cases demonstrate that corporations like the NJTC traditionally lacked the sovereign immunity of the states that created them.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should hold that the NJTC can be held accountable in court for the injuries it causes.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:45.915194

And in 1969, the year following his deportation order, a court issued another order allowing Bojerski to be released from custody and apply for employment authorization, according to Stoller.
But the court did not rule the deportation order fulfilled—and therefore invalid—and denied his application for permanent residency.
After 15 years of compliance under the most recent supervision order, Bojerski was taken into ICE custody during his follow-up immigration meeting on October 30.
According to his wife, Bojerski is unable to take his regular medications and is now in a wheelchair.","In October, Paul John Bojerski, a 79-year-old grandfather who has been in the United States since he was five, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for not complying with a deportation order that was issued nearly 60 years ago. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Bojerski to remain in ICE detention as she considers the complications of the case.

Over the summer, Bojerski was told during a routine meeting with immigration officials that he must self-deport or face detention based on an unenforced deportation order issued in 1968, the Orlando Sentinel recently reported. But with no passport or country to return to, David Stoller, Bojerski's immigration attorney, says Bojerski has nowhere to go.

""There are situations where it is just impracticable to try and deport them,"" Stoller told WESH 2 News, a local NBC News affiliate.

Bojerski, whose birth name is Zbigniew Janusz Bojerski, was born to Polish parents in a German refugee camp in 1946 following World War II and has been in the U.S. since his parents legally immigrated in 1952, according to the Sentinel. Although he was admitted as a lawful permanent resident under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, Bojerski never became a citizen. Following a conviction for larceny and receiving stolen goods in his early 20s, Bojerski was ordered to be deported, reports the Sentinel.

However, attempts to deport Bojerski failed after Poland and West Germany—both under communist rule at the time—refused to take him. And in 1969, the year following his deportation order, a court issued another order allowing Bojerski to be released from custody and apply for employment authorization, according to Stoller.

After his release, Bojerski ran into legal trouble again and was convicted of rape in 1972. Bojerski's wife of 37 years, Gayle Bojerski, told the Sentinel that the conviction stemmed from a fraternity party incident involving multiple students. Although Bojerski was convicted and served three years in prison, he maintains that he was not involved in the incident. After his release, Bojerski would go on to complete school and become an optician, according to the Sentinel, which ultimately led him to move to Florida, where he met his wife and worked until his retirement.

Bojerski later applied for permanent residency through his wife, arguing that he was eligible because the 1968 deportation order had been fulfilled, and cited multiple trips out of the country where he had been able to reenter without issue or questioning by immigration officials. But the court did not rule the deportation order fulfilled—and therefore invalid—and denied his application for permanent residency. Instead, the court issued a new supervision order in 2010.

After 15 years of compliance under the most recent supervision order, Bojerski was taken into ICE custody during his follow-up immigration meeting on October 30. Since being detained, Bojerski—who's undergone three back surgeries—has been in declining health. According to his wife, Bojerski is unable to take his regular medications and is now in a wheelchair. Last week, Bojerski was left on the floor for hours and suffered a minor concussion after facility staff were locked out and unable to help after he fell from his chair while sleeping.

During his bond hearing on Tuesday, Judge Romy Lerner said she had ""concerns"" about detaining Bojerski given his age and health, according to the Sentinel. But for now, Lerner has postponed making a determination on whether he could be released on bond, given the case's complications. ""Unfortunately,"" Lerner said during the hearing, ""no matter what I decide, the government may appeal my decision, which may involve you remaining in detention even if I were to grant the bond."" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lawyer confirmed that she would appeal a decision to grant Bojerski bond—despite agreeing that he is not a flight risk—and will issue a new deportation order to deport him to a third country if Lerner rules the 1968 deportation order invalid, reports the Sentinel.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/11/krtphotoslive958615-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 21:56:30.731392

One of the school’s infant teachers, Diana Santillana Galeano — known to the students as “Miss Diana” — was abducted by ICE on the morning of November 5 as she prepared to start her shift for the day. While my 3-year-old son did not see the teacher’s abduction, we arrived at the school — Rayito de Sol, located in the Roscoe Village neighborhood — shortly thereafter, and he was emotionally shaken by the traumatic aftermath unfolding at his beloved daycare.

Seeing his classmates, teachers, and other parents weeping and huddling together caused my son to break down. He eventually became withdrawn and quiet, appearing to become numb in the midst of the chaos around him. My husband was thankfully able to leave work to come to the school and care for him at home. He did his best to offer what comfort he could, telling our son that mommy had to stay behind at the school because I was a “helper” and that I needed to help Miss Diana come back. The next seven days were a whirlwind of community care and rapid organizing, as we tried to help our kids process this trauma.

How Can We Comfort Our Children When the Trauma Is Ongoing?

After a child witnesses a traumatic event, parents are generally advised to reassure the child that they are safe, to promise that the grownups in their life will protect them from harm, and to confirm that the threat has passed. But parents living in cities being terrorized by Donald Trump’s secret police can’t actually offer these recommended words of comfort to our kids — to do so would be a bald-faced lie.

Because the truth is that while this regime still reigns — with a bloated Department of Homeland Security budget, helmed by untrained, violent agents hell-bent on ignoring laws while abducting our neighbors, and with little to no meaningful resistance by an opposition party — our children are not safe.

Children in Illinois have suffered months of systematic physical and emotional abuse by ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents during Operation Midway Blitz, with kids of color enduring the worst of it. For example:

A baby was recently pepper sprayed in Cicero.

Kids in South Shore were zip-tied — restrained with plastic flex-cuffs on their wrists — after their home was raided in the dead of night, so that agents could cosplay Call of Duty characters and rappel from a military-grade helicopter.

A child suffering from stage four cancer lost her primary caregiver to a raid in a Home Depot parking lot in Niles, Illinois, a village near Chicago’s northwest border.

Children playing outside at an elementary school in Logan Square were surrounded by tear gas as agents tossed canisters through their car windows.

A 15-year-old boy on the Southeast side was slammed to the ground and then disappeared into a garage for several hours.

Numerous schools across the city have been forced into soft lockdowns after ICE has abducted family members, nannies, or workers outside of schools. Teachers have reported their kids crying, expressing feelings of fear and confusion.

Once separated from their parents, this regime has also pressured children to renounce asylum claims, threatening them with criminal liability if they do not self-deport.

ICE claims in their video propaganda that raids like the South Shore attack removed criminals from our streets. Not only was this later determined to be false, but untold levels of terror were inflicted on innocent children that day.

How We Mobilized to Defend Miss Diana

I was already working as a part-time immigration attorney and anti-ICE organizer before the abduction of the infant teacher at my son’s daycare, so I was fortunately in a position to begin leading efforts for Miss Diana’s release. The values that the school cultivates — empathy, diversity, and altruism — lend themselves well to a robust parent community that instantly sprang into action. Together we rapidly mobilized for Miss Diana.

Phone calls from parents and community members to elected officials and legal counsel led to a same-day press conference and a vital habeas corpus petition filed on Miss Diana’s behalf in federal court by 2 p.m. that day, just a few hours after ICE stormed the daycare. Such petitions have been crucial for disappeared Chicagoans; DHS enjoys shipping our abducted neighbors to states like Kentucky, Michigan, or Louisiana within 24 to 48 hours after routinely denying them access to legal counsel at Broadview, the immigration jail just west of Chicago, known for its “unnecessarily cruel” and inhumane conditions, where members of our community have been protesting ever since ICE began its occupation of our city. Here, because of our swift action, the Northern District of Illinois retained jurisdiction in Miss Diana’s case.

A community rally that night drew upwards of 500 people and also aided in our fundraising efforts, eventually growing her legal defense fund to over $150,000. Parents at the school banded together physically as well: Because the school was closed for several days as a result, some formed communal home daycares among themselves.

We spent the next week circulating a petition calling for Miss Diana’s immediate release, creating t-shirts and yard signs, and making thoughtful media appearances. We wrote cold direct messages to Instagram influencers and celebrities. We joined Zoom conferences in collaboration with local unions and the ACLU for Know Your Rights seminars and participated in “Migra Watch” trainings led by one of the city’s leading resistance organizations, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, that shared knowledge on how to safely document and record ICE. We collaborated with local Alderman Matt Martin for a Purple Day of Action in solidarity with Miss Diana and all care workers. We tied purple ribbons — symbolizing Miss Diana’s favorite color and the color of the union working with child care staff — to local schools in the neighborhood and held rallies demanding that ICE leave Chicago and return Miss Diana to her community. We protested at Broadview and praised the suburban moms who were arrested in solidarity with our fight.

We also created a care plan for the rest of our teachers in line with the dozens of other mutual aid networks that have been vital in Chicago to support our immigrant communities. Many of our teachers suffer from food insecurity as a result of their fear over leaving the house because of ICE, so we began coordinating meal donations and deliveries. We offered to escort them to their cars or homes and signed up for patrol shifts outside of the school, whistles at the ready should ICE return. We began working with the school’s administration to assist them with long term immigration support. We did all of this while attempting to ignore a vile smear campaign orchestrated by DHS’s social media operators and explaining to folks that a “.gov” website is not in any way a reliable source to cite for information.

These Fears Take a Toll on All Our Children

Like all moms juggling numerous tasks at once, we tackled this work while also trying to prioritize the increasing emotional needs of our kids. We crafted thoughtful responses as best we could to their heartbreaking questions, like “If I speak Spanish outside of our house, are they going to take me too?” For families of immigrants especially, when they asked these questions, we wanted to reassure them, but struggled not to mislead. The Trump administration makes baseless claims that agents are only going after “the worst of the worst,” but Chicagoans recognize this as a blatant lie. They’ve stolen U.S. citizens simply for being Brown. They’ve snatched our tamale workers, our teachers, and our gardeners. Being undocumented is not a criminal offense no matter how many times Kristi Noem tries to convince you otherwise, and, regardless, nothing would justify the indiscriminate violence that “shocks the conscience,” according to one federal judge, that we’ve seeing from these federal agents. I’ve lived in Chicago for 15 years and have only felt unsafe when these masked agents started invading our communities.

This new danger has taken a toll on our children. Many parents have described their kids working through their trauma through role playing, relaying nightmares, struggling with sleep, and emotional outbursts. A new study links Trump’s immigration raids to rising fear and mental health risks among kids in immigrant families. Researchers identified harm to emotional development and academic performance. Chicago public schools reported that attendance is down significantly since Trump began terrorizing our beloved city.

What do you say to a child in this moment? I often struggle with how to explain this level of anti-immigrant racism to my two kids. I try instead to highlight our resistance: I bring them with me to anti-ICE rallies, they help me make HANDS OFF CHICAGO posters, and we read books like “Dreamers” by Yuyu Morales and “Prisons Must Fall” by Mariame Kaba and Jane Ball. We work on our Spanish and visit Latine neighborhoods for “Dia de Los Muertos” celebrations. My husband shows them videos of me whistling at ICE near our home and collecting tear gas canisters. When they see my gas mask on the table and ask me why I need that, I teach them about state violence while explaining the tools I have to defend myself and our neighbors.

Last week our community received the incredible news that Miss Diana was released by DHS after a federal judge determined her detention was illegal. We were overjoyed to celebrate this win with our children and eager to spotlight how the collective can prevail. When our community came together with a singular goal, we defeated an enemy much larger and more powerful than us. Anchored by Miss Diana’s strength and grace, we hope that this lesson can be a balm to some of our children’s fears. At the same time, we want them to know that this fight isn’t over. These resources should be available to all of our abducted neighbors, not just beloved daycare teachers with the backing of an army of parents. And we intend to continue organizing to achieve this.

Fascism relies on division. Leaning hard into your community is a powerful tool in opposition. As I look to my comrades in Charlotte and New Orleans, I am hopeful that they will build on Chicago’s resistance to keep their children, and all of their neighbors, safe.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2244959570-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:44.605141

“Our priority is to uphold the human rights standards that these individuals deserve and to ensure that plans to house undocumented immigrants at the joint base do not interfere with military readiness.” Loading...","President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed months ago that it would use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst as an immigrant detention center, but in a letter sent to two New Jersey congressmen this week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said there’s “no firm timeframe” for when the facility will begin operations.

Noem’s letter to Reps. Donald Norcross (D-Camden) and Herb Conaway (D-Delran), the latter of whom represents half of the base in Congress, indicates that the process of constructing the infrastructure needed to detain immigrants has not even begun, and that DHS is still “assess[ing] the viability” of such a plan.

“Currently, there is no approved construction plan for the location of this facility and no firm timeframe for intakes or length of operation at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst,” Noem wrote. “ICE is working with [the Department of War] to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy to support this site. Should a contract be awarded to build and operate a detention facility at this location, the contract will establish the detention standards by which the detention operator will be obligated to abide.”

Some of Noem’s answers, though, could be out of date; the letter is dated September 29, 2025, but Norcross and Conaway said they did not receive it until November 17. Their initial letter to Noem requesting details on the JBMDL plan was sent on July 28.

New Jersey currently has two operational immigrant detention facilities, the Elizabeth Detention Center and Delaney Hall in Newark, that collectively have around 1,300 beds. The Trump administration, which has sought to massively ramp up the country’s immigrant detention and deportation networks, began looking into the possibility of using JBMDL in Burlington and Ocean Counties as as detention center at the beginning of this year, and confirmed in a July 15 letter to Conaway that they were moving ahead with the plan.

Conaway, Norcross, and most of their Democratic colleagues in the New Jersey delegation quickly sent a letter asking a number of follow-up questions: when would the facility begin operations? Who would be detained there? Would federal officials coordinate with base leaders and surrounding communities? What costs would be reimbursed?

Noem’s response answers some of those questions. She wrote that detainees will be allowed access to medical care and legal representation, and that DHS will “coordinate with law enforcement partners”; she also claimed that ICE is focusing its detention efforts on criminals and other potentially dangerous persons, though data from New Jersey’s two existing detention centers show that isn’t necessarily the case.

“ICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, weighing all relevant factors, including risk of flight, danger to public safety, and national security concerns,” Noem wrote. “ICE also evaluates humanitarian circumstances as required by law, including serious medical conditions or primary caregiver status. Consistent with Trump Administration directives, however, ICE is prioritizing the detention of criminal aliens, cartel-linked traffickers, and others who pose clear threats to the safety and security of the United States.”

Noem’s letter is the second response Conaway and Norcross have gotten from the Trump administration on JBMDL; the first, an October letter from the Department of Defense, contained no new information at all.

The two congressmen said in a statement that they remain concerned about the Trump administration’s “ongoing disregard” for undocumented immigrants’ rights, and that they will continue to press for detailed answers on the administration’s plans for JBMDL.

“While we acknowledge that the Department of Homeland Security has finally responded to our questions, we will continue to monitor for any further developments regarding plans to house undocumented immigrants at the joint base,” they said. “Our priority is to uphold the human rights standards that these individuals deserve and to ensure that plans to house undocumented immigrants at the joint base do not interfere with military readiness.”

“Republicans claim they care about rejecting the horrific actions of abusive regimes but refuse to call out the authoritarianism we’re seeing unfold right before our eyes,” said Pettersen. “Trump is unhinged — he’s weaponized our judicial system to target anyone who disagrees with him, worked to silence the press dedicated to exposing his corruption, and has terrorized immigrant communities – including citizens, legal residents, and even children – and deployed the military against our country’s own citizens.

The city had been on high alert since last week, as reports surfaced that the operation would involve armored vehicles and as many as 200 agents.

Immigrants in Charlotte are the latest target of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement blitz.

It was only a matter of time before a city in the American South became the subject of a CBP operation. Cities across the United States like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Chicago had been previously targeted with excessive and unnecessary enforcement tactics.

Yet, Charlotte has a different history of immigration than those cities—one that makes these raids, arrests, and tactics especially worrisome for the city’s Latino community.

North Carolina’s Latino population does not stretch back generations like in cities such as Los Angeles or Chicago. Rather, the Latino population in the state has grown exponentially since the 1990s. Charlotte is a prime example of how Latino immigrants contributed to the development of cities across the South as well as other non-traditional immigrant gateways. As the immigrant population in the city increased, construction boomed and Charlotte grew into a thriving economic hub, serving as the home of Bank of America’s headquarters. It is not unusual for cities to grow on the backs of immigrant workers, but it is particularly true for Charlotte. Immigrants not only contributed to the city’s traditional industries like construction and hospitality; they also opened new businesses and revitalized neighborhoods in the Queen City. Now, those same businesses that propped up Charlotte’s economy are in jeopardy of closing as a result of the fear fostered by these aggressive enforcement tactics.

The politics of immigrant rights issues in the city have been complex. Back in 2006, Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, was one of the first jurisdictions in the nation to implement a 287(g) agreement – a section in the Immigration and Nationality Act that allows local law enforcement agencies to deputize local officers to carry out certain immigration enforcement functions. This type of collaboration between local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) then spread throughout several other counties in North Carolina and throughout the country.

However, the collaboration had its costs. First, it eroded the trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Why would noncitizens report crimes committed against them if they thought that by doing so, they could attract police officers who could ask them for proof of immigration status and potentially deport them? Fewer crimes reported means fewer crimes investigated and solved.

Second, the U.S. Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against the sheriff in Alamance County, North Carolina – about an hour and a half drive from Charlotte – for racial profiling Latinos through the 287(g) program. The lawsuit against Alamance led to the termination of the 287(g) agreement in that jurisdiction.

Fueled by the movement away from continued cooperation with ICE, and after arduous advocacy from grassroots organizations, several candidates running for sheriff in North Carolina counties in 2018, including in Mecklenburg, vowed to discontinue their 287(g) agreement if elected; and they were. This did not make Charlotte a “sanctuary” jurisdiction by any means, but the shift gave Republican lawmakers in the state the pretext they sought to brand the Mecklenburg County as such and invite harsher enforcement tactics.

The administration’s latest assault in Charlotte is an effort to stifle the dissent communities have expressed against fueling the administration’s deportation pipeline. The administration’s, and now Republican lawmakers’, talking point is that the deployment is to keep communities safe and assist efforts to reduce crime.

But that explanation doesn’t check out. Charlotte Police figures show reductions in violent crime in the city over the past years. What crimes was CBP targeting when agents were filmed shattering the car window of a Latino U.S. citizen and violently dragging him out? None. CBP let him go, and Charlotte Police were not called. In the eyes of CBP, he looked undocumented. In fact, North Carolina Governor Josh Stein came out and claimed that CBP’s actions amounted to racial profiling.

What is most alarming is that the U.S. Supreme Court implicitly sanctioned these tactics. In Vazquez Perdomo v. Noem, the Court paused a lower court order that had set limits on immigration enforcement agencies’ use of “roving patrols” to target those who appear to be noncitizens. Justice Sotomayor gave a stark warning in her dissent, noting that Latinos would bear the brunt of SCOTUS’ action.

In a previous life, I worked in immigrants’ rights did more Know-Your-Rights (KYRs) presentations than I can remember. KYRs are always tricky because the audience expects to hear magic words that will lead law enforcement officers to respect people’s rights. In practice, however, law enforcement will likely find an exception to the rules that gets them the result they seek – be it the right to interrogate or even search an individual. As such, the right to remain silent was the most crucial piece of information one could share with community members. And while that piece of advice still applies, such words don’t seem to stop the Border Patrol officers conducting these enforcement actions from interrogating, harassing, and threatening Latinos who fit the profile of who they think is an undocumented person.

Charlotte’s vibrant immigrant community heavily contributed to and continues to power the growth of the city. Time and time again, however, immigrant communities are scapegoated by politicians looking to score partisan points, blaming noncitizens for crime despite statistics that show the contrary, and Charlotte is no exception.

The inspiring news is that the people of Charlotte have risen to voice their opposition. It is no secret that the immigrants’ rights infrastructure in a city like Charlotte is not as robust as other larger cities that have faced these actions. But community members, elected officials, organizations and attorneys are leveraging their limited resources to respond to this crisis.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immigration-impact-north-carolina-charlotte.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 17:58:19.021307

But so far, their demands to add guardrails to funding bills to stop the administration from engaging in so-called “pocket rescissions” have gone unanswered.

One senior House Republican, though, did try to add such a provision to an appropriations bill — only for the White House to intervene and stop him, NOTUS has learned.

The Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, is the mastermind behind the administration’s pocket rescissions strategy which involves a request from the president to withhold money already appropriated by Congress. But the request comes so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn’t have enough time to act within the allotted timeframe. and the administration considers the money rescinded once the fiscal year ends.

Sign Up for NOTUS’ Free Daily Newsletter

The Trump White House had so far used pocket rescissions once, when it withheld nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid in August. The Supreme Court allowed the move, effectively greenlighting Vought’s strategy for the near future.

But in July, Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee and one of the 12 so-called “cardinals,” quietly added a provision to the fiscal 2026 bill for the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee — which funds the agencies most impacted by Trump’s two rescissions requests — that would have addressed pocket rescissions.

The clause, Sec. 7065, would have given Congress an extra 45 days to consider rescissions requests submitted late in the fiscal year.

After the bill text was released, Vought reached out to Díaz-Balart, explaining that the White House was concerned about the provision, one senior White House official told NOTUS. The official said that after Vought relayed the issue, Díaz-Balart removed the provision.

The White House did more than just reach out to Díaz-Balart. Republican appropriators started receiving pressure from the White House to not support the bill if the provision remained, according to a source familiar with the matter.

A second source familiar with the matter told NOTUS that some GOP appropriators contacted the White House shortly after the bill came out to let officials know that they were “working to get it out.”

Members quickly spoke to Díaz-Balart about the provision, urging him to remove it. Rep. Andy Harris, a top appropriator and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, which has continuously supported the White House’s rescissions efforts, confirmed to NOTUS that he spoke with the Florida congressman, saying “there was discussion about (the provision) and it never came to fruition.”

Rep. Andrew Clyde, another appropriator and Freedom Caucus member, told NOTUS that Díaz-Balart’s move “would have eviscerated pocket rescissions. It wasn’t supported, so it came out.” He declined to comment on conversations he had with Díaz-Balart on the issue, saying that “member to member conversations are private.”

Rep. Chuck Edwards, vice chair of the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs appropriations subcommittee, told NOTUS that he spoke with Díaz-Balart and that they “agree that the idea of pocket rescissions has been a new one, one that we’ve never faced before.”

“We should have a broader discussion on handling this situation. Whatever we decide has to be agreed on by the White House, since ultimately the president would have to sign off on anything,” Edwards told NOTUS.

“I had rather Congress have the authority and the power of the purse. One more small provision in exercising that authority, it deserves a broader conversation,” Edwards added.

When asked what drove him to add the provision to the bill, Díaz-Balart told NOTUS, “I’ve always believed that Congress has a tendency to always give too much away to the administration — any president, any administration.” Díaz-Balart said the language was not targeted at the Trump administration specifically and added that he has a “great relationship” with Vought and the White House.

The Government Accountability Office has said pocket rescissions are an attempt by the executive branch to circumvent Congress’ power of the purse and unilaterally withhold congressionally approved funding, and are therefore unlawful. Díaz-Balart did not address their lawfulness but Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, the latter of whom chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, believe they are illegal.

“My bill is a great bill,” Díaz-Balart said. “I got a lot of input from different members on different issues, on everything you can think of.”

House appropriations bills typically pass in party-line votes, so Díaz-Balart could not afford to lose any Republicans in the narrow majority. The congressman introduced a manager’s amendment changing some of the bill’s text and quietly added a note to remove the pocket rescissions clause. At the bill’s full committee markup in July, when Díaz-Balart brought up the amendment for a vote, he explained various of the provisions that would change in the bill, but did not specifically address the portion eliminating Sec. 7065.

Democrats did.

The section, House Appropriations Ranking Chair Rosa DeLauro said at the hearing, “is a clear check on agency overreach and accountability and is intended to ensure that this committee, that the Congress remains at the center of appropriations decisions.”

“There weren’t a lot of things in this bill that I liked, but I applauded and I appreciated Sec. 7065 — and now it’s gone,” Rep. Betty McCollum echoed at the time.

Speaking directly to Díaz-Balart, she added, “I realize that you have some challenges on your side, … but I cannot ideally stand back and not speak to the fine provision that you put in the bill.”

“You had a great idea, I wish you would have stuck with it,” she continued.

Ultimately, Republican appropriators passed the manager’s amendment, and the pocket rescissions provision was removed from the bill. Díaz-Balart said the manager’s amendment was “not unusual” and that “it’s part of the process where you’re constantly tweaking, moving, changing in committee, and then also on the floor, and then obviously in negotiations.”

DeLauro told NOTUS she still thinks about the provision. The ranking member said that she raised it in meetings with Congress’ top appropriators — Rep. Tom Cole along with Collins and Sen. Patty Murray — as something she wanted to add to a bipartisan continuing resolution before the government shut down in October. Guardrails against pocket rescissions ultimately did not make it into the GOP continuing resolution.

“We were anticipating that we would move in that direction,” DeLauro said. “The consensus among the four corners of appropriations was that we would have a bipartisan continuing resolution that would consider Democratic priorities and would consider looking at these issues — a mechanism to keep them from stealing what we appropriate.”",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/ab88d5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2250+0+209/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2Fb4%2Fb9977a8c4372bee9e09e61812d26%2Fap23297505367306.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 17:57:28.834125

In a previous interview with Lookout Eugene-Springfield, Juanita Avila, a business owner in Cottage Grove, described how federal immigration enforcement officers yanked her from her minivan and held her down on the street Nov. 5. A resident since 2014 in the community about 19 miles south of Springfield, Avila has won support from friends and neighbors appalled by the ICE actions.

Chris Ellis told commissioners he lives around the corner from Avila’s store.

“What they did to her, what they’ve been doing to so many others everywhere, this is straight-out barbaric,” Ellis said. “There’s no other way to describe it. These people are just mindless psychos.”

Ellis said his grandfather, who fought the Nazis in World War II, would have been angry “to see the same thing happening here that he witnessed in Europe 80 years ago.”

“It has to stop,” Ellis said, echoing what many in the room expressed to commissioners. “It has no place whatsoever in a civilized democracy.”

Avila attended the commissioners’ meeting but didn’t address officials. Others spoke out, reflecting on the shattered peace and tumultuous times.

“Lane County has been a bit of an oasis until last week, when terror came to our front door,” Brenda Kame’enui, a Eugene resident, told the group.

She urged commissioners to speak out “loud and clear” to federal authorities about the proper standards for law enforcement behavior, to stand up for the rights of all county residents and “denounce excessive force.”

“The lawless federal government needs to hear from every county and state in the nation,” Kame’enui said.

County commissioners expressed support for immigrant communities and said they’d do what they can to help.

Commission Chair David Loveall shared a story about an undocumented friend he has worked with on development projects for years, who “shed tears of great fear,” worried he would be detained and have to rebuild his immigration status anew.

Loveall said he’s helped that person obtain legal representation and written letters of recommendation to aid his immigration process.

“This is everyone’s problem,” Loveall said, encouraging people to “be involved in a brown person’s life. … It’s not us and them, it’s us.”

Commissioner Heather Buch, who participated in a vigil in Cottage Grove after the ICE raids, said the event was well-attended and commended Avila’s willingness to share her story, calling her “one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.”

A video of the encounter between Avila and ICE agents “was excruciating to watch and she has stood up in her community and told her story several times since then,” Buch said.

Commissioner Laurie Trieger commended county administrators for their response to the raids, which included making $100,000 available for emergency assistance to families impacted by federal immigration activity so they can get help with rent, utilities and other needs.

Trieger said the five commissioners are well-positioned to make public statements in support of community members.

The last public statement about immigration from the commission ended with a split vote.

In April, commissioners voted 3-2 to approve a statement reaffirming that the county upholds the Oregon Sanctuary Promise Act, which prevents law enforcement from aiding federal immigration enforcement actions. That statement also reaffirmed the county’s support for transgender community members.

At the time of that vote, commissioners Pat Farr, Buch and Trieger passed the statement, while Loveall and Vice Chair Ryan Ceniga voted against it.

At the time, the disagreement hinged in part on an amendment to the statement that called for the county to pursue policies that upheld the rights of immigrants and transgender people. In April, Loveall said the county needs to uphold the rights of “all people,” not just those two groups. Ceniga at the time said he wondered if the statement added to the tension amid uncertain times, stressing he supports and accepts immigrants.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251106Lookout_JuanitaIW_3-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:48.505628

President Trump has voiced support for U.S. attacks inside Mexico and Colombia.","While hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House yesterday, President Trump called for ABC’s broadcast license to be revoked, after ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce asked him why he had not released the Epstein files.

Mary Bruce: “Mr President, why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files? Why not just do it now?”

President Donald Trump: “You know, it’s not the question that I mind. It’s your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter. It’s the way you ask these questions. … I think the license should be taken away from ABC, because your news is so fake, and it’s so wrong. And we have a great commissioner, the chairman, who should look at that, because I think when you come in and when you’re 97% negative to Trump and then Trump wins the election in a landslide, that means obviously your news is not credible, and you’re not credible as a reporter.”

President Trump defended Prince Mohammed bin Salman when ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce asked about the Saudi crown prince’s involvement in the 2018 murder of Washington Post opinion columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Donald Trump: “As far as this gentleman is concerned, he’s done a phenomenal job. You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it. And we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”

Trump’s comments contradict a U.S. intelligence report which found that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s killing. Back in 2018, Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, where a 15-person team led by a close associate of Prince Mohammed drugged, murdered and dismembered Khashoggi with a bone saw. Following the press conference, Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, issued a statement saying, “Trump’s shameful and disgusting comments about the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi cannot be separated from Trump’s personal business interests with the Saudi regime. Trump and his family are receiving, at a minimum, tens of millions annually from branding deals with Saudi Arabia — payments for doing nothing more than permitting their name to be attached to Saudi projects.”

On Tuesday night, Trump held a black-tie dinner for MBS at the White House. Dozens of CEOs attended, including Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook.

Hamas and other factions inside Gaza are rejecting the U.S.-backed U.N. plan to place Gaza under the control of a U.S.-led board and an international stabilization force. In a statement, the Palestinian groups likened the plan to a “deep international partnership in the war of extermination waged by the [Israeli] occupation against our people.” This is Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem.

Hazem Qassem: “This resolution fully adopts the Israeli position and completely ignores the Palestinian position and the interests of our Palestinian people here in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu does not want to continue with the ceasefire agreement, but rather wants to impose his vision on the Gaza Strip and the entire region.”

This comes as Israel continues to carry out airstrikes in Gaza. Officials in Gaza say Israel has killed 279 Palestinians since the ceasefire came into effect in October.

In Lebanon, Israel launched an airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp Ein el-Hilweh, killing 13 people and wounding several others. Another Israeli attack targeted a vehicle in southern Lebanon, killing one person. Established in 1948, Ein el-Hilweh is the largest of 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and is home to at least 64,000 people. Tuesday’s attack is the latest violation of Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah, which went into effect a year ago. According to the U.N., Israel has been targeting Hezbollah in near-daily attacks since the ceasefire, resulting in at least 100 civilian deaths.

President Trump has voiced support for U.S. attacks inside Mexico and Colombia. This comes as Trump is refusing to rule out sending in ground troops to Venezuela. The New York Times reports Trump has also signed off on CIA plans for covert measures inside Venezuela, possibly to prepare the battlefield for a wider war. However, Trump has also reportedly reopened back-channel communications with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has recently amassed over 15,000 troops in the region and bombed over 20 boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific. The U.S. has claimed the boats were carrying drugs, but no proof has been offered. On Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Trump’s threats.

President Claudia Sheinbaum: “We’ve said this with the State Department, with Marco Rubio, and they have understood, so much so that the understanding we have with them is one of collaboration and coordination. And the first points make very clear the respect for sovereignty, respect for our territoriality, and that there is collaboration and coordination without subordination.”

A federal court ruled that Texas cannot use its recently passed congressional map for the 2026 midterm elections and will instead have to rely on a previous map from 2021. Texas Republican state legislators over the summer pushed for a new congressional map that could garner the GOP five additional House seats. In his ruling striking down the new congressional map, Trump-appointed Judge Jeffrey Brown wrote, “The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton vowed to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the ruling.

Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott declared Tuesday the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the country’s largest Muslim civil rights group, a foreign terrorist organization. In a statement, Governor Abbott said CAIR’s goal was “to forcibly impose Sharia law and establish Islam’s mastership of the world.” Abbott also designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization and prohibited both groups from acquiring property in the U.S. Robert McCaw, CAIR’s director of government affairs, responded to Abbott in a letter, saying, “You do not have the authority to unilaterally declare any Americans or American institutions terrorist groups. Nor is there any basis to level this smear against our organization.”

The Trump administration has taken more steps to dismantle the Department of Education by shifting several key programs to other federal agencies. In one move, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education will be transferred to the Labor Department. Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, criticized the moves. She said, “Donald Trump and his administration chose American Education Week, a time when our nation is celebrating students, public schools, and educators, to announce their illegal plan to further abandon students by dismantling the Department of Education.”

A federal judge has ruled in favor of Meta and against the Federal Trade Commission in an antitrust suit that claimed the social media giant was trying to establish a monopoly by buying up Instagram and WhatsApp. In his ruling, District Judge James Boasberg wrote, “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the FTC brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.” Earlier this year, President Trump called for the impeachment of Judge Boasberg after he ruled against President Trump’s ability to invoke wartime powers to deport migrants.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/66/79866/full_hd/hd1-Congress-Vote-Epstein-Files.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:33.754422

At 12:35 p.m. the OUSD sent an email alert to parents confirming that ICE agents were “seen near the intersection of 31st Street and Market Street,” two blocks away from Hoover Elementary.

“Your child is safe,” the email said.

According to OUSD officials, Hoover Elementary went into a “secure school protocol” because of the ICE enforcement activity nearby. Another school, Harriet Tubman CDC, “was on secure school protocol before regular dismissal for the day,” the district’s email said.

“Our other schools are following standard protocol for potential ICE activity in the community,” OUSD explained.

Neither OUSD nor Hoover Elementary officials responded to questions from The Oaklandside.

The Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership confirmed ICE was in the neighborhood around 8:40 a.m. The group said in a social media post it was “likely related to a targeted enforcement,” meaning the agents were searching for a specific person and not stopping individuals randomly. “At this time, we are not aware of any related ICE arrests in Oakland,” they wrote.

Councilmember Carroll Fife, who represents West Oakland, said in a social media post that the ICE agents may have been targeting a person who was dropping their child off as school, causing a collision.

“They were chased by masked men in an SUV that caused this collision,” Fife said.

The Oakland Police Department said in a press release they were not notified about the ICE operation. “Preliminary findings indicate that an outside law enforcement agency was conducting an investigation within the City of Oakland,” OPD said. “During their operation, officers attempted to contact the vehicle involved in their case. That vehicle later collided with an uninvolved vehicle.”

However, law enforcement officials note that in some investigations, disguise or plainclothes operations are necessary, especially considering an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against immigration law enforcement officials across the country.","While a woman from Ypsilanti, Michigan, was recently indicted for her role in an international smuggling operation that moved illegal aliens, including children, from Central America through Canada and into Michigan, a state senate committee held a hearing to consider three bills that would significantly limit state and local cooperation with federal immigration officers.

On November 6, the Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee held a hearing on three bills, Senate Bills (SB) 508, 509, and 510, that if passed, would act as a magnet for more illegal immigration and impose new burdens on state and local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal immigration officials. These bills would affect how officers interact with illegal aliens, what information government agencies can share, and which procedures officers must follow when conducting immigration-related actions.

SB 508 prohibits officers from conducting immigration enforcement actions in what the bill calls “sensitive locations.” The list of these locations includes schools, colleges, and other educational institutions, places of worship, hospitals, courthouses, and facilities assisting children, pregnant women, victims of crime, or individuals with significant physical or mental disabilities. The legislation does allow enforcement in these locations only if there is an imminent threat to public safety or a court order.

Such a broad definition of “sensitive locations” creates significant operational challenges for law enforcement. If a smuggling suspect works at a hospital, drops children at school, or regularly attends services at a place of worship, officers would be unable to apprehend them at these locations even with probable cause for arrest. Individuals with outstanding immigration violations could effectively shield themselves from consequences by remaining in these protected zones. These restrictions will make routine enforcement actions more difficult, and more dangerous for all involved.

SB 509 focuses on information sharing, prohibiting state and local agencies from providing data to federal authorities that could be used for immigration enforcement. This provision would fundamentally alter how Michigan law enforcement operates in cooperation with federal partners by barring state and local agencies from sharing basic identifying information, arrest records, or custody status if that information could be used for immigration enforcement purposes. Without access to crucial intelligence gathered by Michigan law enforcement, ICE and Border Patrol will be forced to operate blindly.

SB 510 is similar to a bill recently passed in California. It requires officers conducting immigration enforcement actions to wear uniforms and forbids masks or personal disguises. The stated goal is to increase transparency and accountability. However, law enforcement officials note that in some investigations, disguise or plainclothes operations are necessary, especially considering an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against immigration law enforcement officials across the country.

While supporters of SB 508, SB 509, and SB 510 argue that the bills protect vulnerable populations and ensure privacy, Michigan’s recent smuggling case highlights potential consequences of limiting enforcement authority. As criminal networks increasingly view northern border states as a target-rich environment for smuggling operations from Canada, now is the time to strengthen the tools law enforcement needs to protect public safety and secure the border, not weaken them.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Michigan-485947989.jpeg.webp?itok=fuAIVkFj,N,,2025-11-19 16:57:35.552046

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it.

Manuel, an undocumented immigrant in North Carolina, is still reeling from two close calls with immigration enforcement as President Donald Trump’s police state unfolds nationwide.

The first close call, on Nov. 16, was at a police checkpoint in Raeford, North Carolina, a rural area in Hoke County where the population is less than 5,000. In a state where more than two dozen law enforcement agencies have signed on to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of the federal agency’s 287(g) program, a seemingly innocuous driver’s license checkpoint can serve as a funnel into detention and deportation.

“Thank God, we managed to get through it,” Manuel told Prism over WhatsApp, noting that he was in a car with two labor organizers. He asked to use a pseudonym for fear of deportation. “I was very scared.”

The second close call came on Nov. 17 when Manuel was on his way to work. The former North Carolina farmworker now works in construction near Newton Grove in Sampson County, another rural region of the state home to a sizable immigrant population. A co-worker sent Manuel a photo of a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) truck parked at a nearby restaurant. Manuel immediately headed home and alerted other workers to do the same.

Deciding to miss work isn’t an easy decision as the holidays approach, but Manuel said he didn’t feel as if he had a choice. Many in North Carolina’s immigrant communities are choosing to remove themselves from public life until “things return to normal,” Manuel said.

But it’s hard to know when that will be. Since June, the Trump administration has bombarded American cities with large-scale, indiscriminate, and often unlawful immigration raids targeting Latino communities. With little more than racial profiling and disdain for Democrat-run cities guiding the way, unvetted, untrained, and trigger-happy federal agents have been hard at work terrorizing local communities and apprehending immigrants and citizens alike at workplaces, businesses, and locations once considered off limits, such as churches and schools.

Trump’s mass deportations began in Los Angeles and have expanded to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; and New York City. Beginning Nov. 15, Charlotte—North Carolina’s largest city that is home to the state’s most sizable immigrant population—became the first Southern locale targeted with widespread immigration raids.

But ICE and CBP agents have also been spotted in rural areas such as the one where Manuel lives and works. As the impacts of the widespread raids quickly ripple outward, North Carolinians are mobilizing to stem the flow of enforcement operations in their communities.

“Snatch people up and ask questions later”

In a statement Sunday night, the migrant justice organization Siembra NC reported that Nov. 16 was “the day the most immigrants were arrested in a single day in state history.” ICE and CBP have detained more than 130 people in Charlotte thus far, with enforcement in the city expected to continue.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools educator Mechelle Vaughn told Prism that this school week has been “extremely tough.” Vaughn, a member of Public School Strong, an organization that advocates for North Carolina public schools, told Prism that English-language learners make up a large percentage of her elementary school students. Almost 21,000 children in the district were absent from school this week, and those who came to class were clearly in emotional pain, the educator said.

“It is really, really difficult when students tell you how scared they are, and when one tells you that they know that their mommy’s not going to be home when they get there because ‘they are going to get her,’” Vaughn explained. “Today it was call after call after call to the office, with parents crying because they are scared. I was crying because I could hear the fear in their voices; some were afraid their children would be taken getting off the bus.”

Parents’ fears are not unfounded. During school hours on Tuesday, Vaughn received confirmation that ICE agents were at a nearby mobile home park where students lived. She contacted the Charlotte Mecklenburg Association of Educators and Public School Strong, which are helping support Siembra NC’s ICE watch and safety patrol rapid response. Educators and members of Siembra NC quickly arrived at the mobile home park to ensure that students getting off the school bus would be safe.

“The ICE agents had already left, but there was concern that they may be back, and we were also told that people were apprehended,” Vaughn explained. “We just kind of all knew we had to jump into action, and we came up with a plan for what we would do if ICE came back. We weren’t going to let our kids off the bus.”

The public school teacher told Prism that immigrant educators across the district are also afraid to report to work, including those who have permission to live and work in the U.S.

“It’s a very scary time. They snatch people up and ask questions later,” Vaughn said.

Axios reported that New Orleans was likely the Trump administration’s next Southern target. However, the North Carolina publication The Assembly confirmed that federal agents planned to descend on the state capital this week—and descend they did.

For locals tracking enforcement operations on the ground in the Raleigh area, ICE and CBP sightings began rolling in early on Nov. 18. Masked agents were seen carrying out enforcement at an apartment complex on Navaho Drive in midtown. Later in the afternoon, in nearby Durham, Siembra NC confirmed multiple detainments downtown and further north on Avondale Drive, an area beloved for its immigrant-owned businesses.

Local and state officials have been quick to condemn this week’s raids. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a video statement Nov. 16 that the raids are “not making us safer” and that they are “stoking fear and dividing our community.”

“We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks,” Stein said.

At a Durham City Council meeting this week, Mayor Leo Williams read a joint statement from his office, the Durham County Board of Commissioners, and the Durham Public Schools Board of Education decrying the raids.

“We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights, and compromises safety,” Williams said. “Our schools, neighborhoods, and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages, and experiences that define Durham.”

While Raleigh and Durham are often grouped as a single metro area, they have decidedly different cultures, with Durham housing a vast network of grassroots organizers focused on migrant justice. More broadly, the city serves as North Carolina’s progressive organizing hub—an effect of the region’s legacy of Black freedom struggles.

While locals such as Iván Almonte anticipated that wide-scale immigration enforcement was coming down the pike in Durham, the organizer with Respuesta Rápida de Durham told Prism that immigrant communities have been pummeled in recent years, making it difficult to build sustainable infrastructure for the effective rapid response network needed in moments like this.

“It’s one thing after another,” Almonte said in a phone interview. “The attacks against our communities are unfair.”

The organizer also told Prism that North Carolina’s current fight is “bigger than ICE”: Locals are also fighting a web of anti-immigrant laws, bills, and policies. Almonte’s organization now meets with local groups and leaders on a daily basis to coordinate how best to meet the needs of immigrant communities in the region, with legal aid emerging as a top priority.

Earlier this week, the community organizer conducted a Facebook Live event that was attended by hundreds of immigrant community members. Many of the attendees are longstanding Durham County residents, immigrant business owners, and homeowners who must now consider legal action to ensure their children in the U.S. will inherit their property if they are abruptly taken by ICE. Others who attended the Facebook Live wanted help navigating the power of attorney process so that they could decide who would care for their children if they were detained. Many were concerned that if they kept missing work to avoid immigration enforcement, they would also lose their housing, though there is no legal aid that can assist with this new reality.

“These are people established in the U.S. who are facing being torn apart from their families, and it’s devastating,” Almonte said. “Immigrants from Central America and other countries fled violence, and now they are being hunted by ICE and Border Patrol in their own communities. It’s traumatizing.”

This was echoed by Ilana Dubester, the founder and executive director of El Vínculo Hispano, a nonprofit organization in Siler City that serves Latino communities across Chatham, Alamance, Randolph, Lee, and Harnett counties.

“We know it’s just a matter of time until we’re hit with enforcement,” Dubester said. “We anticipate that they will target areas where Latinos work, where they shop, where they worship. I think the goal is to make it feel like nowhere is safe.”

Dubester is fielding reports of immigration enforcement in more rural areas of the state, including Mount Airy, near the Virginia border, where she heard confirmed reports on Nov. 18 that ICE was in the area.

Leticia Zavala, a former farmworker and current coordinator with the North Carolina farmworker organizing group El Futuro Es Nuestro, also has her eye on rural areas that are home to thousands of the state’s farmworkers. Advocates are on edge, given that a few months ago, immigration raids were carried out on California farms, leading to hundreds of detainments and one farmworker’s death during a particularly chaotic workplace raid.

Zavala told Prism that she hasn’t heard of any enforcement taking place on farms, but in recent weeks, she’s received an alarming number of reports from H-2A agricultural workers alleging harassment. These are primarily Mexican farmworkers who have temporary visas to perform agricultural work in North Carolina, and, according to Zavala, many are reporting that federal immigration agents are hassling them as they attempt to return to Mexico once their season is over.

“They are fingerprinting them, asking to see their documents, and taking pictures of them for no apparent reason,” Zavala said.

Dubester is also fielding calls from terrified and confused community members. As immigration enforcement plays out across North Carolina, the Brazilian immigrant’s overarching goal is to keep the community informed—even if that means having to confirm ICE sightings herself.

“Being a naturalized American citizen used to give me a huge amount of assurance of my rights in this country, but right now those rights don’t feel 100% guaranteed,” Dubester said, noting the dozens of American citizens who have been detained by ICE in recent weeks. This includes an incident in Charlotte in which federal agents stopped a U.S. citizen twice, shattering his car window and even briefly detaining him.

“There’s no longer a guarantee of safety, as a Latina doing this work,” Dubester said. “But it won’t stop me from doing what I need to do.”.

“We’re still showing up”

This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has carried out retaliatory immigration raids in North Carolina as apparent punishment for the state’s left-leaning policies.

During the first Trump administration, voters in the state elected a series of Black sheriffs who refused to cooperate with ICE, which led to a series of workplace raids and other enforcement actions mostly targeting undocumented workers. While local organizers and residents who spoke to Prism expressed feeling overwhelmed and saddened by the latest round of enforcement, they also said they remain committed to protecting their neighborhoods.

Across Durham and Mecklenburg counties, community patrols are forming—including some outside of formal organizing spaces. Locals are making plans to accompany immigrants to court hearings, and many are already shopping for immigrant families and picking up their children from school to reduce their risk of encountering federal immigration agents.

One local resident, an immigrant mother with children in Durham public schools who requested anonymity for safety reasons, told Prism that it’s important for North Carolinians to understand that they don’t have to wait for local organizations to take action. “If you see a need in your community, there’s nothing stopping you from meeting it,” she said.

The woman, who is now carrying her passport in case she’s stopped by federal agents, told Prism that attendance is down considerably this week across Durham public schools. She is hoping that community patrols will make parents feel safer sending their children to school with trusted community members.

Previously considered “sensitive locations,” schools, hospitals, and places of worship were once protected from immigration enforcement. But in January, Trump rescinded the policy that largely governed enforcement at these locations, replacing it with a directive “that gives ICE agents unbridled power to take enforcement actions in any of these spaces,” the National Immigration Law Center reported. Faith leaders across North Carolina are now on high alert, especially after reports from Siembra NC that immigrants were detained outside of two Charlotte churches. This includes a man who was volunteering to perform church cleanup.

Rev. Breana van Velzen is the executive director of Durham Congregations In Action (DCIA), a multifaith organizing network that includes hundreds of clergy members. Van Velzen told Prism that at the beginning of the year, DCIA was alerted that the Trump administration would likely prioritize Durham for immigration enforcement because of its status as a “sanctuary city.” Faith leaders immediately partnered with Siembra NC and the social justice organization Ready the Ground for Know Your Rights.

“We’ve been holding trainings for 10 months, including one on Saturday with almost 400 local residents,” van Velzen said. “Now these community members are putting what they learned into action, doing patrols and documenting ICE in the area. In some cases, we’ve been able to scare ICE agents away, and in others, we were able to film detentions so that we could at least alert families their loved one was taken. We’re as ready as we can be.”

In recent days, the reverend has told locals who are tracking immigration enforcement in the region that they can print out copies of the Department of Homeland Security’s Form G-28 in case they can get a person’s signature before immigration agents cart them away.

“The form can help people who are getting detained get a lawyer,” van Velzen explained. “If you can get the paper in front of them—even if they just sign an X for their name—you can send the form to a lawyer or organization so they have legal aid and someone who will advocate for them and make sure they don’t get disappeared.”

Churches, mosques, and synagogues across the state have a leg up when it comes to safety protocols and scenario planning because of the nature of the attacks they experience, according to the reverend, and because many of their members have also experienced persecution and state violence. But no amount of preparation will lessen the blow if ICE carries out enforcement inside places of worship, van Velzen said.

Under the first Trump administration, North Carolina led the country in the number of immigrants who lived in churches while fighting their deportations. The state was even home to a radical network of sanctuary leaders who organized against ICE together. Samuel Oliver-Bruno was one of those leaders, and his tragic fate remains a source of trauma for local organizers.

Oliver-Bruno was in sanctuary at CityWell United Methodist Church in Durham for 11 months when he left the church on Nov. 23, 2018, to attend what was supposed to be a routine biometrics appointment for deferred action. Instead, Oliver-Bruno was violently detained by plainclothes immigration agents. Members of the Durham community rallied around him and even attempted to stop ICE from taking Oliver-Bruno by surrounding agents’ cars. But it was to no avail. Oliver-Bruno was quickly deported to Mexico, where he died shortly after, separated from his wife and son. It was later found that federal immigration agencies monitored the sanctuary leader’s social media and colluded to detain him.

The anniversary of Oliver-Bruno’s detainment is approaching as federal immigration agents again descend on the state of North Carolina and threaten the lives of thousands of immigrant families.

“Many of us are really scared, but we’re still showing up,” van Velzen said. “I’m proud of our city, and I want people to know that clergy are ready to be called upon for whatever is needed. Tell us what you need and where to go, and we will show up.”

Gris.” She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego.
But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added.","Three teachers drove through a quiet neighborhood in southern San Diego, the sun not yet fully up over the horizon. They drank coffee and talked about their jobs. The start of the school day was still an hour or two away.

Suddenly, mid-conversation, they spotted something: what appeared to be an undercover Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, driving right past them.

To an untrained eye, the unmarked SUV didn’t look out of place among the dozens of other cars lining the residential street. But the educators saw what many might miss: the completely tinted windows of the unmarked Dodge Durango (a popular choice for law enforcement), the small strip of lights near the front of the car, the steel prisoner partition faintly visible inside (dividing the front seat from the back). Sure enough, the SUV’s driver picked up a handheld radio.

Watching this, high school teacher Marysol Duran clicked her own walkie talkie to life.

“We have identified a potential,” she reported to others in her unit, following closely behind. “He is on 39th and Gamma. We will keep close watch.”

Duran, and other members of her organization, are not just teachers. They’re also members of the Association of Raza Educators, a group of activists that regularly patrols southern California streets to keep an eye out for ICE. When they spot undercover agents, who may be in the area conducting surveillance or actively planning to arrest or detain someone, they alert the surrounding community: via social media, group chats – and sometimes a giant megaphone.

The fall morning they spotted the Dodge Durango, the teachers were patrolling a several-mile radius near half a dozen local schools. That choice of location was intentional. Only two months before, at least four parents were arrested or detained by immigration officials near schools in San Diego county alone. Outside one Chula Vista elementary school, an undocumented mother, who had allegedly overstayed her visa, was arrested during morning drop-offs as her children watched from the car.

ICE’s San Diego field office did not respond to several requests for comment regarding the suspected undercover vehicle or any other San Diego arrests near school sites.

In the US, children have the right to a free public education from kindergarten to 12th grade, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Although immigration officers were previously limited in their ability to make arrests in or near “sensitive locations”, like schools and churches, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded those Obama and Biden-era guidelines earlier this year.

So when the three teachers noticed the potential ICE agent in October, they turned their car around and followed. The Dodge parked and the teachers did, too. Juan Orozco, a high school counselor, watched from the driver’s seat. Duran sat next to him, and Aremi Lopez, an elementary school teacher, clutched a megaphone in the backseat.

After a few minutes, the Dodge sped away without warning. The teachers drove after it.

“Buenos días, compañeros,” Duran reported in a series of live social media updates. “Estamos en la comunidad de Shelltown. Estamos aquí reportando, parte de la Association de Raza Educadores y Unión del Barrio, y tenemos movimiento: un Dodge Durango. Gris.”

She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego. We have identified a Dodge Durango, grey, that has been surveilling our community.”

Fear among students and parents across southern California is at an all-time high, particularly after the supreme court ruled earlier this fall that federal agents can stop and detain residents in Los Angeles simply for speaking Spanish, appearing Latino or working certain types of jobs. Now, there have been instances where students don’t come to school because they, or their parents, are scared to leave the house, Orozco said.

“We live in a state of fear, [whether you’re a] citizen or not a citizen: plumber, professional, mother, grandma, everyone,” he said. “And we shouldn’t live like that.”

But teachers, and a handful of their students, are also quietly and consistently mobilizing in big and small ways: by hosting morning patrols near local schools, organizing know-your-rights seminars, and keeping each other informed about the presence of ICE.

“We said, ‘Hell no, we have to resist,’” Orozco said. “We have to stand for dignity and protect this safe place for us: schools.”

‘They’re coming after all of us’

In the small library of a nearby San Diego high school, 14-year-old Azda* sat across from her sister, 19-year-old Guadalupe*. Behind them, many of the books on the shelves and posters on the wall had activist themes; an illustration of Che Guevara peeked out from the top shelf. In the hallway outside the library, a hand-painted banner read “education not deportation”. The school is located only a few miles from where the suspected undercover ICE vehicle was spotted a week prior.

While Azda just started her freshman year of high school, and Guadalupe her second year of college, the sisters often have more on their minds than other teenagers might.

Because of where they were born, Azda is a citizen, but Guadalupe is undocumented. They’ve always worried that one day ICE may pick up their mother, who is also undocumented.

“I do fear for her,” Guadalupe said of her mother. “But not only just when she’s dropping off her kids at school, it’s every second of the day.”

Growing up, their family had a specific action plan in case of emergency, like other parents in California might prepare for earthquakes or wildfires. But instead, Azda and Guadalupe’s mother prepared them for ICE. If she was deported, their mother told them, they would need to immediately seek help from their aunt, or close friends who lived nearby. Then, to avoid breaking up the family, all of them would need to “flee together” back to Mexico.

Azda and Guadalupe have tried to explain this looming specter of ICE and deportation to their younger siblings, in ways they might be able to understand. When it comes to their little brother, who is four years old, they’ve chosen their words carefully.

“We have to simplify these big concepts to him,” Guadalupe said. “We just say, like, ‘Okay, la migra, they do bad things. They take families – se llevan a las mamás [they take mothers].’”

The language of ICE protests has even worked its way into the four-year-old’s budding vocabulary. He’ll sometimes walk around the house, they said, chanting: “La chota, la migra. ¿La migra, porque dia?” [Or: “Immigration, why are you here?”]

This year, as ICE agents have circled San Diego neighborhoods, businesses and school zones, Azda and Guadalupe have felt perpetually on edge. Everywhere they go, whether to school, or the grocery store, or to hang out with friends, they’ve learned to scan for signs of undercover ICE vehicles: Are those overly tinted windows? Does that SUV have a different kind of license plate?

That sense of unease follows Azda when she goes home, too. As she scrolls through Instagram, reels of dancing and cooking videos bleed into shaky footage of people from around the country being dragged away by ICE. Often, their spouses or children stand off to the side, screaming and crying. But recently, after seeing one of those videos, Azda got angry. She put down her phone and wrote a poem, titled La Migra.

“Todo lo que te digan es una mentira. ¿No saben que esta es nuestra tierra también?” [Or: “Everything they tell you is a lie. Don’t they know this is our land too?”]

Azda’s high school, which is uniquely involved in anti-ICE activism and patrolling, has encouraged her burgeoning sense of advocacy. A majority of the school’s students, if not all, are undocumented themselves or come from mixed-status families, according to staff members there. Azda has attended meetings about how to patrol around her school for ICE, and has walked around her own neighborhood with her aunt to look for “suspicious cars or suspicious people”.

She also recognizes that because she’s a US citizen, unlike her sister and mother, she has an added layer of security when it comes to protesting or being outspoken about immigration issues.

“I don’t feel like I have to do this, I feel like I want to be the one to do it,” Azda said. “Because if I’m not, then who is?”

Guadalupe attends monthly Association of Raza Educators meetings, but thinks her school in particular – San Diego City College – could do more than just hosting a few know-your-rights sessions.

“It’s something that we have to keep actively engaging with. It can’t just be a one-time workshop,” she said. “You can’t just do things by yourself. If something happens to you, you need to have this group of people backing you up.”

As a kid, Guadalupe sometimes felt a gulf between her and her siblings when it came to their differing legal statuses. Now, though, it feels as if they’re all under threat.

“La migra [immigration] and the state are attacking anyone that’s brown. They’re attacking anyone, even US citizens,” she said. “So I don’t feel that division no more. It’s like they’re coming after all of us.”

‘The right to an education’

The three educators on the early-morning ICE patrol agreed: students across different age groups, from high schoolers to younger elementary school students, have had similar responses to the immigration crackdown. Fear, they said, is an equalizing force.

“They’re all stressed, scared,” Orozco remarked from the driver’s seat, before they spotted the undercover ICE vehicle. “They don’t know what this means.”

San Diego has seen far more immigration activity in 2025 than in years past; three times as many people were arrested by ICE in just the first half of this year compared to all of 2024, NBC reported. More than 50% of the 2025 arrests involved people with no criminal convictions.

But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added. Unión del Barrio, the southern California-based political organization that founded the Association of Raza Educators, first started conducting community patrols to scan for law enforcement more than three decades ago. And the recent supreme court ruling merely formalized the racial profiling that’s been happening behind the scenes for years, he said.

When he was 12 years old, in the early 1980s, Orozco remembers waiting at a bus stop in downtown San Diego. An unmarked white van – with the telltale metal prisoner partition inside – pulled up unexpectedly in front of him. What he believed to be immigration agents got out and threw Orozco in the back.

“And I started kicking and screaming, kicking and screaming,” he said. “Then they pulled off to the side and the two officers said: ‘Say the Pledge of Allegiance.’ I started saying it and they let me go.”

Orozco walked shakily back to the bus. Bystanders were shocked. “It looked like a kidnapping,” he said.

One of the goals of the early-morning teacher patrols is to prevent similar situations from happening – or to at least alert people when they do.

But after the three educators followed the undercover Dodge down a few streets, they eventually lost track of it. At an intersection, Duran and Orozco looked left to right, and examined the parked cars in driveways for signs of recent movement. But the Dodge was gone.

“There’s the relief that although we did lose [the vehicle], we did at least change their plans,” Duran said. “And they might not have had the luck to execute whatever they were expecting to.”

On a policy level, there is some hope on the horizon: in late October, the San Diego city council voted to move forward with an ordinance that, once passed, would require federal law enforcement to obtain a judicial warrant in order to access any non-public area of city-controlled property, which would include the inside of city-run public schools. The ordinance would not apply to the outside of schools, or to surrounding neighborhoods.

Another similar law was passed at the state level in September, although some immigration experts say it may be too soon to tell what kind of impact the new legislation will truly have on ICE operations. The Association of Raza Educators and other groups are also preparing for the eventual fallout from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocated billions to be spent hiring as many as 10,000 new immigration officers across the US.

As the teachers ended their morning patrol and headed back to their original meeting point, the neighborhood began to fill with families. Parents walked hand-in-hand with their children to an elementary school nearby.

“You see the beauty of our community,” Duran said, watching the scene unfold from the passenger seat. “Just doing what any other human being would do in the United States: taking their children to school because they have the right to a free education.”

With the patrol over, Duran, Orozco and the other educators and volunteers quickly packed up their gear: their mounted car cameras, their walkie talkies, their megaphones.

It was 7am, and they needed to make their way to their real jobs – the school day was starting soon.

Agents seen near Hoover Elementary

What we know:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were in the area of 31st and Market streets, close to Hoover Elementary School.

The Oakland Unified School District told KTVU, ""We have confirmed ICE activity in the West Oakland community.""

Parents notified

Dig deeper:

Parents received an alert on the ParentSquare platform notifying them of the activity.

""We got confirmation that there is ICE activity in the neighborhood. They are on 31st and Market Street knocking on doors. The kids are safe and secure at school. Please do no come to the school. We will alert you when things are quiet in the neighborhood again,"" the notification read.

Despite the district’s request to stay away, a group of parents and community advocates gathered in the area and were posted at every corner.

Jeff Ernstfriedman, whose daughter is a second-grader at Hoover Elementary, said he went to the school after receiving the alert and was told the campus was on lockdown.

""I personally saw camouflage individuals going door to door. I didn’t see them take anyone out. I did see the community was able to raise enough of an issue for them, and they stopped,"" Ernstfriedman said.

He described the situation as alarming but said he believed students were safe.

""I feel they are safe here. This is the safest place to be if they’re already here. It’s unfortunate that it happens, but it’s scary,"" he said.

Community vows to keep watch

While school officials urged parents not to come to campus until the situation calmed down, advocates said they planned to stay put to monitor for any potential federal activity.

Ernstfriedman said when community members asked agents to leave, one reportedly replied that they were ""there to protect the homeland,"" and then thanked the residents for doing their part, but asked them to let agents do theirs.

Unclear why agents in the area

District officials said the agents did not enter the school but were seen in the surrounding neighborhood.

(WTVD) -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have shifted their immigration enforcement focus away from Raleigh and stay in Charlotte, according to a source familiar with operations. This comes after sparking fear and protests across the Triangle.

Reports from the Triangle included federal agents apprehending people in Cary and North Raleigh.

Businesses across the Triangle also closed for the day out of caution. Several chose not to open on Wednesday. Some shops along Chatham Street in Cary were shuttered, and others in downtown Raleigh, like El Toro Loco Taqueria, posted online that they were closing for the safety of the Latino community.

Durham Public Schools (DPS) reported low attendance numbers Tuesday among Latino students district wide.

""They are fearful of walking to school and getting detained or questions. Somebody putting a gun in their face,"" Carmon Ramon, a counselor with DPS, said. ""They are fearful of their parents going to work.""

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said in a statement on Monday that federal agents were expected to continue their operations in her city on Tuesday after they fanned across nearby Charlotte over the weekend.

Cowell, a Democrat, said the federal action was not requested.

""As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays, and learns in Raleigh feels safe,"" Cowell said. ""We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh. While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law.""

The immigration enforcement surge in the Charlotte area has led to the arrests of over 250 illegal immigrants as of Monday, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told ABC11 in a statement.

Greg Bovino, the commander-at-large of CBP, is blaming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein for what he said was an increase in violent rhetoric that federal agents are facing in their immigration enforcement blitz in the state.

Bovino took to social media on Tuesday to slam Stein, a Democrat who released a statement over the weekend asking residents of the Tar Heel State to report any ""inappropriate behavior"" they witness from federal agents.

""If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe after these federal agents leave,"" Stein said.

In a social media post, Bovino told Stein, ""You need to check yourself,"" and cited an online video of a woman threatening to use a screwdriver to stab U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents if they pull her over.

""Governor Stein, you caused this,"" Bovino said in the post. ""Let me say that again, Governor. When you spout lies about a lawful law enforcement operation, you spark something in weaker-minded people like this who may act upon your direction.""

Bovino did not specifically say what statements from Stein prompted his social media response.

On Sunday, Stein issued a statement, saying, ""We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks.""

Bovino's warning to Stein came after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cited two incidents this week in Charlotte in which people allegedly rammed the vehicles of federal agents or drove directly at the agents.

Federal agents are expected to stay in North Carolina until Friday, according to preliminary information from federal authorities. By the end of the week, about 200 agents are expected to be redeployed to New Orleans to begin ""Operation Catahoula Crunch"" in the Big Easy, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

November 19, 2025

Dear Majority Leader Thune, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker Johnson, Minority Leader Jeffries, Chair Collins, Vice Chair Murray, Chair Cole, and Ranking Member DeLauro:

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the rights of all persons in the United States; our Census Task Force co-chairs, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC and NALEO Educational Fund; and the 48 undersigned organizations, we write to highlight several essential issues affecting the success of the 2030 Census and availability of useful, accurate Census Bureau data to guide policymaking, as you finalize the Fiscal Year 2026 Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill (as a stand-alone measure or part of an omnibus package):

We urge funding for the Census Bureau at or above the amount requested in the president’s budget and allocated in the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark: $1.6765 billion.

Conferees must exclude section 556 of the House CJS bill. The directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base would violate the U.S. Constitution and dash any chance for an accurate census in all states.

Conferees must also exclude section 605 of the House CJS bill. This provision would limit attempts to collect data from households for the census and surveys to two inquiries. The effect on data quality and accuracy would be catastrophic.

I . Full funding for the Census Bureau is essential to keep robust 2030 Census planning on track.

Sound investments now will help to ensure the future success and cost efficiency of the 2030 Census. An insufficient funding level for the Census Bureau will disrupt census planning at a pivotal point in the decade, undermining a carefully developed research and testing agenda that will significantly increase costs later in the decade and put accuracy at risk. It also would diminish efforts to strengthen other vital Census Bureau surveys that produce data on which public and private sector decisionmakers (including members of Congress) rely every day. For example, the American Community Survey (ACS), the ongoing part of the decennial census, is a trusted source of accurate and regularly updated demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data used by governments, businesses, and the nonprofit sector nationwide. Failure to fund even modest improvements to the ACS will continue to erode data quality, even as Congress itself relies on ACS data to allocate trillions of federal assistance dollars annually to states, localities, and families.

FY 2026 is particularly pivotal in the ramp-up to the 2030 Census, as the Census Bureau prepares to conduct the 2026 Census Test, the only large-scale field test of outreach, methodological, and operational improvements for the next census before the dress rehearsal in 2028. A robust 2026 Census Test is essential to ensuring the accuracy of the 2030 Census and containing overall costs, goals that Congress supports on a bipartisan basis. The window of opportunity to research methods to reach groups at risk of being missed, including renters and young children, as well as increasingly distrustful population groups in rural areas and low-income neighborhoods, on American Indian reservations, and in Black, Hispanic, and other historically undercounted communities, will close soon.

II. The U.S. Constitution requires a count of all persons living in the U.S, for apportionment purposes.

Section 556 of the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark cannot remain in a final FY 2026 bill. Every census since the first enumeration in 1790 has included citizens and non-citizens for the purpose of congressional apportionment. Section 556 would require the Census Bureau to exclude undocumented persons living in the United States from the tabulation of state population used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after each census. Throughout the nation’s history, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have concluded that excluding undocumented immigrants or all non-citizens from the apportionment base would be unconstitutional and contrary to the 14th Amendment’s clear command to count the “whole number of persons in each State” for apportionment. While the constitutional infirmity of section 556 cannot be overcome, it is worth noting that asking about immigration status on the census questionnaire — which would be required to meet such a directive — is unnecessary and would raise concerns among all respondents, both native-born and immigrant, about the confidentiality and privacy of information provided to the government. This will have a chilling effect on participation and keep many residents from responding, jeopardizing the accuracy of the census used for many non-apportionment purposes in every state and community. We strongly urge you to remove section 556 from the final FY 2026 CJS appropriations bill.

III. Limiting household contacts in the census and surveys would result in unreliable and unusable data that guides critical decision-making in all sectors.

Section 605 of the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark limits contact with households to two “inquiries,” significantly restricting the Census Bureau’s ability to collect information from households and businesses that do not respond quickly to censuses and other surveys. If enacted, section 605 would fundamentally transform how the Census Bureau conducts virtually every census and associated survey. Particularly alarming, the proposal could shut down counting efforts in the decennial census after only a third of households have responded, based on the 2020 Census experience. Equally alarming, incomplete follow-up for the ACS could deprive towns, rural communities, and tribal areas of any useful data, while Economic Census data that serve as a baseline for Gross Domestic Product and other key economic indicators could be compromised. Valuable socio-economic data for smaller population groups, such as people with disabilities and veterans, also could be curtailed. In short, section 605 would force the Census Bureau to stop contacting households and businesses after two attempts to secure a response in every census and survey, no matter how low the initial response rate. The enactment of section 605 would result in lower response rates for Census Bureau surveys, thereby disrupting the collection of foundational statistics that support our democratic institutions and economy. Without sufficiently high response rates in many areas, the Census Bureau will not be able to publish demographic and economic data of acceptable quality and reliability, threatening informed private sector decision-making and the prudent allocation of federal program funds to every state, county and city, and community in the country.

For these reasons, we strongly urge any final Fiscal Year 2026 CJS package to ensure Census Bureau funding that matches or exceeds the president’s budget request and the House mark of $1.6765 billion and excludes sections 556 and 605 of the House CJS appropriations mark. Thank you for considering our views as Congress moves towards completing the FY 2026 appropriations cycle.

Sincerely,

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights

Tens of thousands of public school students have been reported absent. And businesses in immigrant communities shuttered as border agents patrolled the streets.

North Carolina has become the latest focus of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, as federal agents surge into Charlotte and spread out across other Democratic-led cities in the notorious swing state, including Durham and Raleigh.

Located hundreds of miles from the southern and northern borders, North Carolina doesn't often generate national attention for immigration related issues, leading residents and local officials to question why the state that voted for Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections is being targeted.

The Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

But Charlotte is not considered a sanctuary city, and the state has some of the strictest immigration provisions in the country, experts said, including a mandate passed last year requiring local jails to hold arrested immigrants for a limited time so they can be picked up by federal authorities.

“No cities in the state have sanctuary policies, if they did they would be violating state law,” said Rick Su, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina who specializes in immigration and local government.

Su also noted that no city in North Carolina was included on the Justice Department’s list of ""sanctuary jurisdictions,"" which the agency defines as areas with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Over the weekend, federal agents arrested over 130 undocumented immigrants in Charlotte, including several dozen with previous charges ranging from driving under the influence to aggravated assault, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USA TODAY is unable to independently verify those figures as the agency has not released the names of those arrested, or their exact charges.

After the weekend raids, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein criticized the operation as inducing “widespread fear” and said it is “not about public safety.”

“They’re driving around Charlotte in unmarked cars wearing paramilitary garb, masks, stopping people on the street randomly based on the color of their skin,” Stein said. “This is not promoting safety in our communities. The people of North Carolina deserve to be safe.”

Charlotte reeling from immigration sweeps as enforcement expands

Federal agents began surging into Charlotte neighborhoods on Saturday, Nov. 15, spurring business closures across immigrant communities as protesters took to the streets to decry the operations.

Homeland Security officials have not said how many agents have been sent to the state or how long the heightened enforcement will last.

The operations are being led by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who coordinated immigration raids in Chicago that triggered lawsuits and fierce backlash over what many described as agents' aggressive enforcement tactics.

Bovino, who, according to a federal judge, admitted to lying about a rock-throwing incident used to justify the deployment tear gas on protesters, is from western North Carolina.

Since the enforcement began in Charlotte, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District said over 30,000 students – about 20% of the student population – were absent on Monday, Nov. 17, according to preliminary data. Officials have not tied the low attendance numbers directly to the immigration enforcement. According to data from the school district, 31% of the student population identifies as Hispanic.

Videos of border agents conducting arrests have drawn scrutiny, including one of masked agents smashing the window of a U.S. citizen and pulling him to the ground. The man, Willy Aceituno, was brought into a Border Patrol vehicle and released after he showed agents documentation proving his citizenship, he told the Associated Press.

“I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I’ve seen,” said Mayor Vi Lyles in a statement on X. She added that her office is working to determine “what more we can do to support our community while working within complicated legal boundaries.”

At a city council meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 18, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said immigration authorities were spotted in Wake and Durham counties. She urged people to call the Raleigh Police Department if they feel unsafe or see something illegal.

In Durham, local officials held a news conference and spoke out against the federal intervention. Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said border agents were in the city to stoke fear, not fight crime.

“Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border,” Allam said. “None of this was about securing our borders, none of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.”

Charlotte, a recent flashpoint in the debate around crime in US cities

This is not the first time Charlotte has found itself at the center of national debates around public safety.

In August, the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a public train in Charlotte drew national headlines and the attention of the White House. Trump seized on the incident as an example of rampant violent crime in Democratic-led cities, pointing to the suspect’s lengthy criminal history.

In Charlotte, rates of violent crime have fallen sharply this year, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. The agency said through the first nine months of 2025, Charlotte saw a 20% reduction in violent crimes including as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

So far this year, Durham and Raleigh have seen rates of violent crime either stay level or dip when compared with 2024, according to their respective police departments.

In its recent statements, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to tie its immigration enforcement in North Carolina to public safety and policies that they say allow criminals to roam the streets.

Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.

""Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

In a statement posted to its website, DHS also accused local law enforcement in North Carolina of refusing to comply with almost 1,400 detainer requests by immigration officials to hold arrested suspects for 48 hours.

It is true that for years, Mecklenburg County, which encompasses Charlotte, did not honor such detainers. But that changed last year when the majority-Republican legislature overcame a veto and passed a measure forcing sheriff's offices to hold arrested immigrants temporarily for federal authorities.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has publicly feuded with immigration authorities over enforcement but he has maintained that his office is complying with detainer requirements.

In recent months, he said he has sought to improve communication with federal immigration officials. In late October, McFadden called a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement's regional leaders.

""I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,"" McFadden said after the meeting, according to local media reports.

Last week, McFadden announced publicly that two federal officials told him Border Patrol agents would soon be arriving in Charlotte. He added, “specific details regarding the federal operation have not been disclosed.”

Brad Schneider, released the following statement in response to the current status of permitting reform negotiations in Congress:

“The members of our respective caucuses hold diverse views of how Congress should improve the energy infrastructure permitting process; however, as leaders of these caucuses, we are unified in our belief that the current actions of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are blocking us from engaging in good-faith, bipartisan permitting reform negotiations.

“Any serious permitting reform package must address—as a threshold matter—the Trump Administration’s active undermining of America’s clean energy industry by using every tool it can find to slow or block projects. The Administration regularly does not follow existing law, including revoking duly issued permits, rescinding previously awarded grants, and issuing stop-work orders on projects well under construction. Over the past 10 months, we have heard outcries over the Administration’s actions from state governments, businesses, and workers responsible for building critical clean energy projects to address growing electricity demand while improving the reliability and affordability of our energy system, but our Republican colleagues in Congress have remained largely silent in the face of the Trump Administration’s abuses.

“Ensuring that clean energy projects are treated fairly and can move forward where appropriate is the prerequisite for serious, practical negotiations on a reform package capable of meeting the nation’s energy needs. Additionally, to be comfortable with any sort of agreement, we need to be able to trust that this Administration is going to follow the law that we write.

The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, argues that USCIS’s August 2025 “voter registration ban” violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment by discriminating against speech promoting voting rights for naturalized citizens.​​

For decades, the League has been a trusted partner at naturalization ceremonies, registering hundreds of thousands of newly sworn-in Americans to vote. In 2024 alone, League volunteers attended 2,789 naturalization ceremonies and helped 122,141 new citizens register—roughly 8 percent of all people naturalized that year.​

But on August 29, 2025, USCIS announced without notice or public comment that only state and local election officials—not nonpartisan civic groups—would be permitted to provide voter registration services at administrative naturalization ceremonies.​​

“Purposely excluding groups like the League from administrative naturalization ceremonies is a deliberate move by this administration to deny new citizens access to the democratic process,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States.​

The lawsuit names USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as defendants, along with their respective agencies.​

Pattern of Sexual Violence in Immigration Detention

The legal challenge comes amid mounting evidence of systemic sexual abuse of women detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection—abuses that advocacy groups say often go uninvestigated and unpunished.

Between 2010 and 2017, migrant women filed more than 1,224 complaints of sexual assault by ICE officials covering nearly all states with immigration detention facilities. Recent data obtained by investigative journalists reveals 308 sexual assault and abuse complaints filed by immigrants detained in ICE facilities nationwide between 2015 and 2021. More than half of all abuse allegations were directed against staff members.​

In one harrowing 2020 case at an El Paso detention center, guards systematically sexually assaulted detained women in security camera “blind spots,” forcibly kissing them and touching their intimate parts. When one 35-year-old Mexican woman reported the abuse to a captain, he dismissed her. Guards told her “no one would believe her” because the assaults occurred where no footage existed.​

That woman was deported while investigations were ongoing, effectively silencing a key witness.​

At Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, five women accused a male nurse of sexually assaulting them during medical examinations between 2021 and early 2022. The women alleged the nurse exploited his position to force them to expose themselves and inappropriately touched them without medical justification. When two women reported the abuse while still detained, they faced aggressive interrogations, threats of extended imprisonment, and food being withheld.​

A year after their complaint was filed, the nurse remained employed at the facility.​

In Florida’s Glades County Detention Center, seven immigrant women filed a federal lawsuit in 2021 alleging that male guards would watch them shower or enter living areas unannounced for sexual voyeurism. One woman also reported sexual harassment by the facility’s psychiatrist.​

A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that sexual assault allegations in ICE facilities were stable between 2018 and 2022, though allegations against facility staff significantly increased. The research revealed that sexual assault occurred in ICE detention at a rate up to 3.5 times higher than in the general U.S. population.​

Only 2.4 percent of sexual abuse complaints filed with the DHS Office of Inspector General between 2010 and 2016 were investigated.​

Border Patrol Agents Accused of Abuse

Border Patrol agents have also faced allegations of sexual misconduct and violence against migrant women.

Internal Department of Homeland Security documents obtained by Human Rights Watch in 2021 detailed over 160 reports of misconduct and abuse of asylum seekers by CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and ICE officials, primarily between 2016 and 2021. The reports included allegations of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse.​

In one instance, an asylum officer reported that a young girl was “forced to undress and touched inappropriately by a guard in the Ice Box wearing green,” referring to a border holding cell. The documents do not indicate how DHS responded to the allegation.​

In August 2024, Border Patrol agent Shane Millan, 53, was arrested and charged with violating women’s constitutional rights after allegedly coercing several women to reveal their chests during virtual processing for entry into the United States. Prosecutors said Millan instructed women on at least three occasions to remove their clothing and display their bare chests via webcam, claiming it was standard procedure when it was actually “driven by his own personal gratification”.​

And in February 2025, former CBP officer Aaron Thomas Mitchell was convicted of kidnapping and civil rights offenses after abducting and sexually assaulting a teenage girl while identifying himself as law enforcement.​

A report analyzing Border Patrol complaint outcomes found that most allegations of sexual misconduct resulted in “no action taken,” including cases where agents allegedly solicited sexual favors in exchange for entrance to the U.S. or made minors remove their clothing.​

“They Treat You Like You Are Worthless”

The American Civil Liberties Union has documented nearly 200 allegations of sexual abuse from immigration detainees since 2007 alone. Yet the Department of Justice explicitly excluded immigration detention facilities from coverage under the Prison Rape Elimination Act in proposed regulations.​

“Without PREA’s protection, immigrants in detention remain vulnerable to abuse,” the ACLU warned.​

The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission found that immigrant women in detention are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. Despite this, in April 2025, the Department of Justice terminated all funding for the National Prison Rape Elimination Act Resource Center, which trained auditors and provided resources to sexual assault victims. The funding was restored only after a preliminary injunction in litigation.​

Whistleblowers revealed that the closure of DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties resulted in the abandonment of at least 25 sexual abuse complaints.​

Human Rights Watch researcher Clara Long described the conduct reported in internal government documents as “jaw-dropping,” adding: “These internal government documents make clear that reports of grievous abuses—assaults, sexual abuse, and discriminatory treatment by US agents—are an open secret within DHS”.​

League Calls Ban Unconstitutional

The League’s lawsuit argues that USCIS issued the voter registration ban without following the Administrative Procedure Act’s required notice-and-comment process and without providing any reasoned justification. The ban also violates the First Amendment by restricting core political speech and discriminating based on viewpoint, content, and speaker identity, the complaint alleges.​

“The ban discriminates—based on viewpoint, content, and the identity of the speaker—against speech promoting the right to vote for new citizens, and tramples on the League’s freedom of association,” the lawsuit states.​​

USCIS claimed the change was necessary to ensure “nonpartisanship” and reduce administrative burdens, but the complaint notes that state and local election officials in numerous states are themselves partisan actors elected on a partisan basis. The ban also identifies no existing problems with the nonpartisanship of groups like the League.​

Since the ban took effect, state and local League chapters have been forced to cancel at least 166 planned voter registration events where volunteers expected to register approximately 10,000 new voters.​​

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the ban unconstitutional, set it aside as unlawful, and enjoin DHS and USCIS from enforcing it.​

The League is represented by Campaign Legal Center, which has previously litigated to protect nonpartisan voter registration work in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri and Montana.​","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z-NW!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6b66552-35b1-465a-a5a3-6ea5efaeee15_300x168.jpeg",N,,2025-11-19 13:58:21.967084

The Immigration Defense Network (IDN) gathered at Bro-Tex Inc., a paper and textile company located at 830 Hampden Ave., at 9 a.m. The organization is asking authorities for clarity on Tuesday morning's raid, which ICE says involved conducting a search warrant connected to an ongoing criminal investigation. IDN wants to know how many people were detained in the Tuesday morning raid, and what type of property was confiscated.

Among the speakers at the gathering was Mayor-elect Kaohly Her, who said she was not speaking from a political platform but as someone who has lived the immigrant experience.

""I want you all to know I am standing with you, not as somebody who is in government but as somebody who is in an impacted community who has watched people from my own community who are American citizens get detained by ICE for days until they can prove that they were American citizens,"" Her told the gathered crowd of more than 200.

""When that happens to our community it is not just that they were detained and released, that they lose jobs from not being able to go to them, that their families that relied on them cannot, the children that need their parents to be there to give them transportation to school do not have them, that there are huge ripple effects when our families are targeted in this way,"" Her said.

Marco Hernandez, outreach coordinator for the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, spoke of tactics used by federal agents and the Trump administration to strip away the civil rights of those seeking status.

""The conduct we've seen around the country is disturbing. Masked ICE agents have been tearing families apart and terrorizing communities,"" Hernandez stated. ""Here in Minnesota, more than 200 people have been detained outside the immigration court at Fort Snelling this year. People making use of one of their very few legal pathways that people have to acquire status, only to be arrested by ICE when their cases are prematurely canceled and they walk out of the courtroom.""

Armed agents wearing vests from ICE and the FBI descended on the building that houses Bro-Tex LLC early Tuesday, and were seen moving in and out of the building. Witnesses said they saw people being detained.

While ICE would not comment on people being taken into custody, a man who identified himself as Jesus Trejo told a KARE 11 photojournalist that his father, Isaias Villagrana Flores, and uncle were taken into custody after agents entered the business.

""They took my dad, he comes to work, he supports his family. A good guy, no criminal,"" Trejo said, fighting to hold back tears. Trejo said his dad called his mother and said agents ""stormed"" the building.

""They'll see the outcome of what they've done, what they've taken away,"" Trejo said. He said his father has worked at Bro-Tex for years.

It did not take long for messages to get out via text and social media platforms, and a crowd of hundreds swarmed the scene, blowing whistles and screaming at the federal agents. Some activists challenged a line set up by agents, which led to some nose-to-nose confrontations, pushing and shoving. Eventually, one agent pulled a can of pepper spray and doused multiple protestors in the face.

The operation was one of several by ICE in recent months that have community organizers concerned. A raid at a Minneapolis restaurant in June led to similar hostilities between activists and agents. In October, a Latino roofer was pulled off a job site by ICE, and one month later in Northfield, a man was taken from a vehicle.

A New York federal judge struck down a Justice Department lawsuit this week that sought to end a law that prevents immigration officials from arresting individuals in New York State courthouses.

U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino dismissed the lawsuit from the Trump administration lawsuit that argued the 2020 Protect Our Courts Act and two state executive orders that limit state employees' cooperation with the federal government were unconstitutional. The decision marks a major setback for the president’s efforts to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in the city and state.

The 41-page ruling released on late Monday evening flatly rejected the Trump administration’s arguments that POCA and the executive orders were unconstitutional and went against the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, referred to as INA.

Core to the Justice Department’s argument was that federal law supersedes any conflicting state law, and state officials were required to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

But D'Agostino, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, saw otherwise and ruled that the state’s sovereignty in these matters is protected by the 10th Amendment.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the decision reads. “The Executive Orders and POCA reflect Defendants' decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law – a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted by the INA.”

The decision for now puts to rest the question of whether federal immigration authorities will appear in New York’s state and local courts. D'Agostino’s ruling will have no effect on ICE operations at 26 Federal Plaza, which is under federal jurisdiction.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was listed as a defendant iin the lawsuit, celebrated the decision.

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York’s state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

The decision was also applauded by numerous legal aid organizations, including the Legal Aid Society, The Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Service and the New York Civil Liberties Union.

“Today’s decision confirms what we’ve said for months: courthouses are no place for ICE agents to arrest people,” Amy Belsher, director of Immigrants’ Rights Litigation at the NYCLU, told the Eagle in a statement. “This is a significant victory, but the work doesn't end here: the NYCLU is fighting in the courts to ensure ICE is also prohibited from conducting arrests in immigration courts.”

Other advocacy groups, like the New York Immigration Coalition, said Monday’s ruling was a significant win but called for lawmakers to continue advocating for further legislation prohibiting local law enforcement from working with federal immigration agents.

“When ICE arrests people who show up for their court cases, it disincentivizes people from following the legal processes set forth in our country,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said. “Judge D'Agostino’s ruling is an important step towards maintaining the integrity of local and state courts in New York.”

“New York must further its commitment to the safety of all New Yorkers by passing the New York For All Act, and the federal government must stop its unlawful detentions of New Yorkers at federal immigration courts throughout the state,” Awawdeh added.

New York State does not have a specific immigrant sanctuary law, but does have laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials.

POCA was signed into law by former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in December 2020. The law prohibits arrests in and around New York State courthouses without a judicial warrant, with a specific intent towards migrants. The law does not pertain to federal courts or immigration courts.

The two Executive Orders named in the suit, 170 and 170.1, were also signed by Cuomo in 2017 and 2018 respectively. They restrict warrantless civil arrests in New York State buildings and limit state employee cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The Justice Department filed the 17-page lawsuit against the state, the attorney general and Governor Kathy Hochul in June 2025.

""Governor Hochul has been clear: You don't make New York State safer by targeting families, children and hardworking individuals,” a spokesperson for the governor told the Eagle in a statement. “The court made the right decision in upholding New York’s sovereignty, and the state will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement in cracking down on violent offenders while keeping our communities safe and enforcing our laws.""

Legal advocates and immigration attorneys have said ICE arrests during immigration hearings have had a chilling effect on immigrants seeking to obtain citizenship through the proper channels. Preventing federal agents from making arrests in state and local courthouses, advocates argue, will likewise prevent that same chilling effect for local criminal and civil cases.

“As public defenders, we are bolstered by the Court’s dismissal of the federal government’s lawsuit challenging New York’s Protect Our Courts Act,” Lucas Marquez, director of Civil Rights and Law Reform at Brooklyn Defender Services, said in a statement. “POCA ensures that New Yorkers who attend court to address critical issues in their lives can do so safely without interference from federal immigration agents, and codifies the long-standing privilege against civil arrests in courthouses.”

The Office of Court Administration did not respond to the Eagle’s request for a comment.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b9ffe0f1137a680c2c08250/5ba02661cd8366eb6ec50772/691e08b6d6504d1ed8887b73/1763576112086/POCA+Lawsuit1.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-19 13:58:42.209175

On the same day, Irgi was arrested by the Philadelphia Police Department and charged with strangulation, simple assault and recklessly endangering.

While conducting a targeted operation in Tonawanda Nov. 5, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations officers observed a target driving a vehicle away from a residence. The officers followed and activated their emergency lights when it was safe to do so. During a consensual encounter, ICE officers confirmed the driver was Saim Irgi, an illegal alien from Turkey without authorization to be in the U.S. Officers asked Irgi to exit the vehicle multiple times, but he consistently refused and actively resisted when officers attempted to remove him. Officers were eventually able to remove the alien from the vehicle and escort him to the ground where he continued to resist the officers. Officers drew their tasers and informed Irgi multiple times that if he did not stop resisting, he would be tased. While attempting to place Irgi in custody, he grabbed onto an officer's taser while screaming “Allahu Akbar,” at which point another officer deployed their taser to gain control of Irgi. The illegal alien was subsequently placed in restraints, taken into custody, and transported to Buffalo Federal Detention Facility for processing and detention. Upon arrival at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, Irgi was evaluated by the medical staff and deemed medically fit for detention.

If the judge later rules that Bojerski’s current deportation order is no longer valid — as his attorney argues — the department will issue a new one and seek deportation to a third country, she said.

Sanford grandfather, born in refugee camp, nabbed by ICE after 70 years in U.S.","A 79-year-old retired Sanford optician who faces deportation for his criminal past after living in the United States since he was five will remain in federal custody while an immigration judge decides whether she can rule on his request to be released on bond.

“There is a legal issue in your case that is a little complicated that I am going to have to think about, so I won’t be making a decision on your bond today,” Judge Romy Lerner told Paul John Bojerski at a bond hearing Tuesday at the Krome Detention Center in Miami.

“Unfortunately, no matter what I decide, the government may appeal my decision, which may involve you remaining in detention even if I were to grant the bond,” she added.

A lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security at the hearing confirmed that she would appeal a decision made in Bojerski’s favor. If the judge grants bond, the government will appeal. If the judge later rules that Bojerski’s current deportation order is no longer valid — as his attorney argues — the department will issue a new one and seek deportation to a third country, she said.

Gayle Bojerski, 82, said she talked to her husband after the hearing. “He sounded good. and he can handle it,” she said. “That’s all we can do.”

Bojerski, born to Polish parents in a displacement camp in war-torn Germany in 1946, came to the U.S. with his family in 1952 where they were granted lawful permanent residency.

He was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Oct. 30 and sent to Alligator Alcatraz, based on a deportation order issued over 50 years ago that U.S. immigration authorities failed to act on. The order was issued after Bojerski’s conviction for larceny and accepting stolen goods in the 1960s. Several years after the deportation order, he was convicted of rape, in 1972.

The US revoked his permanent residency status but couldn’t execute the deportation order because the countries where he and his parents were born — Germany and Poland — refused to accept him. Immigration authorities allowed him to stay in the U.S. on a supervisory order that requires him to check in with officials whenever asked.

His lawyer, David Stoller of Orlando, argued that the deportation order is no longer valid because in 1988 Bojerski and his wife, Gayle, went to Canada for their honeymoon and reentered the US successfully — essentially fulfilling the obligations of the order. They were not questioned or held by immigration officials at that time.

DHS officials argued that Bojerski had no proof that he re-entered the country legally, and therefore was here illegally.

Sanford grandfather, born in refugee camp, nabbed by ICE after 70 years in U.S.

But Stoller argued that the burden is on the government to prove that Bojerski attempted or succeeded to enter the country without inspection by immigration officials.

“The government just can’t say ‘you’re here, we’ll agree that you left and came back, you don’t have proof you reentered legally so we’ll just assume that you didn’t’.” Stoller said. “And to the extent that the assumption would be made, we have affidavits explaining exactly how he came back to the states … lawfully.”

Stoller said Bojerski posed no danger to the community because the “last time this gentleman had any trouble I was two years old.”

Despite his criminal history, Lerner questioned the need to detain an elderly man. “At this age, stage and health situation. I have concerns about that,” the judge said.

Bojerski has severe back problems and vascular stenosis and requires pain medications and blood thinners, which his family said he has not received regularly since he was sent to Alligator Alcatraz on Oct. 30. At Krome, he fell out of his wheelchair, Stoller said.

Bojerski is not a flight risk, Stoller added, noting that when ICE dug up his file in 2008, it was able to reach him at the phone number and address in his file.

“They asked him to come in, which he did, and he has done every single time in the subsequent 16-17 years.” Stoller said. “He knew that the possibility existed on Oct. 30 that he might be detained and he went there knowing what he was facing and knowing he had an obligation to show up when and as required and he will continue to do so.”

Bojerski tried to gain permanent residency as a spouse of a U.S.-born citizen in 2009, but the application was denied. He has never applied for citizenship, Stoller said.

The DHS lawyer said his rape conviction from 1972 made him a danger to the community but agreed he was not a flight risk.

The rape charge stemmed from an incident at a fraternity party, where several other students sexually abused a young woman, his wife said. Bojerski said he didn’t participate but was arrested along with the others, who took plea deals. He didn’t take a plea deal because he believed he did nothing wrong, she said.",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOS-L-Bojerski-bond-hearing-01-e1763495120770.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-19 14:57:21.755834

""The City of Hillsboro calls on all elected officials, including members of Congress from Oregon, to publicly denounce these unconstitutional actions, demand immediate oversight and transparency from immigration enforcement agencies, and work to ensure the rights of all individuals—regardless of immigration status—are fully protected under the Constitution,"" the resolution reads in part.

The declaration comes after the arrest of Victor Cruz, a local grandfather who family says has work authorization and is present legally, last month.

Cruz was arrested in what family said was a case of mistaken identity and was released from custody earlier in November.

City Hall was packed during the last council meeting by people who came to share comments on the negative impact that ICE has had on their community.

""We, like you, do not want ICE to be operating in the city of Hillsboro,"" Mayor Beach Pace said during Tuesday night's meeting. ""We are in this together and we felt it important to publicly publicly acknowledge the challenging time we're in via the resolution we're about to consider[...]""

In early November, Washington County Board of Commissioners declared a state of emergency after seeing a rise in ICE activity in their communities. As part of the declaration, the county pulled $200,000 from its reserves to support immigration-related services. The funds go toward organizations that assist families in connecting with detained family members, as well as, be used to help document detainments, and ensure due process is followed.

(AP) — A federal judge in Florida is pushing for a resolution in a lawsuit over whether detainees at an immigration center in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz” are getting adequate access to attorneys.

U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell last Friday ordered a two-day conference to be held next month in her Fort Myers courtroom, with attorneys present who have the authority to settle. The judge asked for an update at a hearing next Monday.

“The court will not entertain excuses regarding leaving early for flights or other meetings,” the judge wrote about next month's conference.

The lawsuit filed by detainees against the federal and state governments over legal access is one of three federal cases challenging practices at the immigration detention center that was built this summer at a remote airstrip in the Florida Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

In a separate environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering the facility to wind down by the end of October. The appeal was put on hold during the government shutdown but resumed last week.

A third lawsuit claims immigration is a federal issue and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. While the facility was built and operated by the state and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing Florida for $608 million.

In the legal access case, attorneys representing detainees at the Everglades facility are seeking a preliminary injunction that will make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with their individual attorneys.

They claim that detainees' attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where the lawyers can just show up during visiting hours; that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them; and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Florida officials said in a motion to dismiss that the case is now moot since the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed. Any delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure, they said.

“In other words, there is no longer a live controversy,” Florida officials said in their court filing.

As the Trump administration spearheaded a surge in what many human rights advocates describe as unlawful and discriminatory raids, detentions and deportations, more immigrant families report avoiding activities outside their homes, such as taking children to school, going to work, or receiving health care, compared to two years ago.

“Immigrants’ avoidance of activities outside the home are likely driven in part by heightened immigration enforcement activities,” wrote the report’s authors, “as well as policy changes that have allowed immigration enforcement activity in previously protected areas, including places of worship, schools, and health care facilities and to allow ICE to pursue arrests without a warrant.”

Four in 10 immigrants, including 7 in 10 undocumented immigrants, said they personally worry they or a family member could be detained or deported, compared to about 2 in 10 in 2023. About 4 in 10 immigrants also said they were worried about their immigration status being revoked and being separated from children or family members.

These fears extended to children in immigrant families, with about a quarter of immigrant parents saying their children have expressed worries or concerns about something bad happening to someone in their family because they are an immigrant. The share rose to 6 in 10 among likely undocumented immigrant parents and to about 4 in 10 among Hispanic immigrant parents.

“My family, friends, and colleagues are worried, stressed, and scared every single time we step out of our homes as we don’t want to be the next family to be deported,” said a 40-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant woman in Illinois who was quoted in the survey.

More immigrant families are also struggling financially since Donald Trump took office. About half of immigrants say they have had problems paying for essentials like housing, food and health care, as well as earning a living, in the past year — up from 3 in 10 who said the same in 2023.

Texas’ map that adds five Republican pickup opportunities is now blocked unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Judges will convene Wednesday to consider blocking North Carolina’s new map that could give Republicans another seat. And a similar hearing is two weeks away in California, where voters passed a new map that adds as many as five pickup opportunities for Democrats.

In each state, lawmakers contend they redrew the maps for partisan advantage. Federal courts have no authority to strike down partisan gerrymanders.

But the challengers insist the changes were really about race.

In Texas, a 2-1 ruling Tuesday that the state’s new map is a likely racial gerrymander moves the ball to the Supreme Court.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) vowed to “swiftly appeal” to the justices.

“The Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans’ conservative voting preferences – and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearing,” Abbott said in a statement.

Texas’s candidate filing deadline is fast approaching on Dec. 8, less than three weeks away. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) confirmed the state will bring an emergency appeal asking the high court to immediately revive the map.

The justices’ consideration will come as they work behind the scenes on drafting their decision on Louisiana’s congressional map, a long-running battle that predates the recent redistricting blitz.

Louisiana’s case raises far-reaching questions about the future of race in redistricting that could impact the new challenges.

As Texas heads to the Supreme Court, the battle over North Carolina’s newly minted congressional map is headed into the spotlight. A hearing will unfold in Winston-Salem, N.C., Wednesday afternoon.

Passed last month, the map redraws the state’s First Congressional District, currently represented by North Carolina Democratic Rep. Don Davis, to be more conservative.

The district has elected a Black representative for more than 30 years, and the case focuses on how the new design decreases the Black voting-age population by 8 percentage points. The map is challenged by two groups.

The first comprises Black and Latino voters represented by Elias Law Group, a powerful Democratic election law firm led by Marc Elias. They argue North Carolina unconstitutionally used race and failed to account for population deviations since the five-year-old census data.

“The racial effects of the 2025 redraw cannot be explained by partisanship,” they wrote in court filings.

The second group comprises voters, the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and watchdog Common Cause. They argue the map violates the First Amendment because it frustrated the groups’ right to petition and was passed as retaliation for the groups’ existing challenge to North Carolina’s previous map.

“Redistricting does not occur in a First Amendment-free zone,” they wrote in court filings.

The hearing is before a three-judge panel all appointed by Republican presidents: U.S. Circuit Judge Allison Rushing and U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, both Trump appointees, and U.S District Judge Thomas Schroeder, an appointee of the second former President Bush.

As Democratic lawyers attempt to strike down North Carolina’s map for unconstitutionally diluting Black voting power, Republican lawyers will attempt to strike down California’s map for unconstitutionally boosting Hispanic voting power.

The Trump administration and the state GOP will attempt to topple the map championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that could provide Democrats with as many as five additional House seats.

“They’re trying to create seats based on race,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week. “And they can’t do it, and we’re going to hold them accountable just like any other state.”

The panel overseeing the California case comprises U.S. Circuit Judge Kenneth Lee, a Trump appointee, U.S. District Judge Wesley Hsu, an appointee of former President Biden, and U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton, an appointee of former President Obama.

And just remember: We’re only about four years away from the next census, when the whole process will start anew.

IN FOCUS

Reagan judges emerge as Trump’s fiercest judicial critics

An unexpected class of jurists have emerged as the fiercest critics of President Trump’s assault on the legal system: appointees of former President Reagan.

Often the seniormost judges on their courts, Reagan judges have wielded their experience as a weapon in impassioned opinions striking down the president’s policies and in once rare public remarks.

One such jurist, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf, resigned from his senior position on the federal bench in Massachusetts earlier this month to dedicate his time to fighting back against the president.

He wrote in The Atlantic that his public service began in 1974, a “time of dishonor” for the Justice Department at the end of President Nixon’s term. But what Nixon once did “episodically and covertly,” Trump now does “routinely and overtly,” the former judge said.

“My reason is simple: I no longer can bear to be restrained by what judges can say publicly or do outside the courtroom,” Wolf wrote, calling Trump’s conduct “contrary to everything that I have stood for” in his time as a prosecutor and judge.

“The White House’s assault on the rule of law is so deeply disturbing to me that I feel compelled to speak out,” he added. “Silence, for me, is now intolerable.”

He’s not the only fed-up Reagan-appointed judge.

U.S. District Judge William Young made headlines in September with his blistering rebuke of Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists, the effect of which is to “unconstitutionally chill freedom of speech.”

The judge quoted a portion of Reagan’s Inauguration speech in the ruling that says, “freedom is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction.” He contended that Trump understands the importance of the message but draws from it a “darker, more cynical” meaning.

“I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,” Young wrote. “Is he correct?”

Similarly, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour wrote in a decision striking down Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order that, to Trump, “the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals.”

Coughenour took a rare step in July to speak out publicly alongside another judge overseeing Trump cases against threats they’ve faced as a result.

“It’s just been stunning to me how much damage has been done to the reputation of our judiciary because some political actors think that they can gain some advantage by attacking the independence of the judiciary and threatening the rule of law,” the judge said.

Their outspokenness has drawn some criticism.

Mike Davis, a Trump ally and head of the conservative Article III Project, wrote in a Fox News op-ed that Wolf, the judge who stepped down to speak out against Trump, is a “wolf in wolf’s clothing” — a callback to the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s famous dissent in a case about the separation of powers.

Davis claimed that Wolf is “no judicial conservative,” pointing to the Senate blue slips practice that lets home-state senators weigh in on a president’s nominations to district courts and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Both senators from Massachusetts at the time Wolf was appointed to the bench were Democrats, he said.

Rob Luther, a law professor at George Mason University, wrote in posts to X about Wolf that any federal judge who gives up “actual power” to join Trump’s crowd of critics “severely misunderstands power.” He joked that Wolf’s status as a retired Reagan-appointee with the backing of those Democratic senators is “likely at peak market value.”

“I hope more federal judges follow now-retired Judge Mark Wolf’s lead and take their anti-Trump activism off the bench so that (Trump) can replace them,” he said in another post.

“Step right up, please!”

A mystery in the Supreme Court’s passive voice

Did Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson continue her independent streak in the Supreme Court’s recent handling of the food stamp lapse during the government shutdown?

When the full court extended a pause on an order requiring the Trump administration to pay full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown, Jackson publicly dissented.

That in itself made the junior liberal justice’s disagreement clear. But a language change elsewhere in the court’s order suggests the division may have gone deeper. We’ll add an underline to the important part:

“The application for stay presented to Justice Jackson is referred to the Court.”

It’s subtle, but that passive voice is highly unusual. It may give away the inner workings of the court’s deliberations.

To explain why, let’s walk through the emergency appeal process:

When someone files one at the Supreme Court (formally called an “application”), by default, it goes to the justice assigned to the area of the country where the case originated.

The divisions align with the boundaries of the federal circuit courts, so they are known as the “circuit justice.” Chief Justice John Roberts handles three circuits, Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh have two and the others each have one.

Read the full assignments here.

The circuit justice can act on an emergency appeal alone, and they often do for ministerial and low-profile ones. If they deny it, the applicant can then try another justice, and another one, until they fail with all nine. (In practice, the full court will vote to cut off anyone who tries to start going down the line.)

Or, the circuit justice can refer the appeal to the full court. That’s the general practice for any filed by the sitting presidential administration.

When the Trump administration filed its SNAP emergency appeal, the case came from Rhode Island. Jackson was the circuit justice.

At first, Jackson acted alone. She paused the order for a few days so a mid-level appeals panel could weigh in.

Just before Jackson’s pause was set to expire, a funding deal in Congress appeared in

sight. This time, the full court took a vote. It extended the SNAP pause a few more days — and over Jackson’s dissent.

That’s the order that included passive voice indicating the application “is referred to the Court.”

We checked, and in every other application brought by the second Trump administration, the order has read “by her referred to the court” (or “by him” when the circuit justice is male).

The dynamic did appear in one other recent high-profile case, though it wasn’t brought by the administration.

When the American Civil Liberties Union sought to block a round of imminent deportations under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act this spring, the case arose from Texas and went to Alito. The full court voted to temporarily block the deportations over Alito’s dissent.

“There is before the Court an application,” the order began.

Jackson’s shift suggests the possibility that she wanted to act alone and did not agree to send it to the full court for a vote, only for her colleagues to overrule her.

Was it a meaningless edit, or does it reveal the internal deliberations? Neither the majority nor Jackson explained their reasoning.

‘Fake elector’ cases get new life

A few weeks ago, the 2020 election subversion cases were on their last legs.

We wrote in October that the state cases against Trump’s allies and the so-called “fake electors” had faced sharp blows, leaving prosecutors with big decisions about how — and whether — to proceed.

Well, now, we’ve got some answers.

By Friday, Georgia’s Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council (PAC) had to pick a new prosecutor to oversee the state’s case against Trump, his allies and the alternate electors or see it potentially dismissed, thanks to the disqualification of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D).

Pete Skandalakis, PAC’s executive director, announced that he himself would take on the prosecution after the search was fruitless.

“Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment,” he said in a statement.

So, the prosecution’s future is in Skandalakis’s hands, from picking up where Willis left off to dismissing the charges altogether.

It’s not the first time that’s been the case.

After Willis was disqualified from charging Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones (R) for headlining a fundraiser for his political rival, Skandalakis similarly appointed himself. He ultimately declined to bring charges.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee set a hearing for Dec. 1 to discuss next steps in the case, including whether Skandalakis intends to pursue a superseding indictment on the state’s behalf.

A day prior, Nevada’s top court revived the state’s criminal case against its six “fake electors” after a venue fight put the prosecution in purgatory for more than a year.

The original case was filed by Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford (D) in Clark County, a Democratic-leaning division that includes Las Vegas. However, a state judge dismissed it last year after finding that the charges should have been brought in Carson City, where the sham Electoral College votes were cast.

The Nevada Supreme Court reversed that decision and sided with Ford, ruling that Clark County is the proper venue because the fake electors’ alleged offenses were complete when the federal court there received the certificates, not when they were mailed.

A status conference is set for Dec. 10 before the state judge to discuss the top court’s order.

And soon, more pivotal decisions will be made.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) faces a Friday deadline to appeal to the state’s top court a ruling ordering her office to return its case against the state’s pro-Trump electors to a grand jury or see it dismissed, after a mid-level appeals court declined to weigh in.

Local outlets took comments Mayes made earlier this month, which referred to the case in past tense, to suggest she’s leaning toward letting the prosecution fizzle out.

“I certainly don’t want to give it up,” the Arizona attorney general told 12 News when reminded how she once fiercely defended the case. “It is certainly not something that I want to do.”

However, Mayes told a local radio station she would “caution folks against reading into my comments.”

Asked about her remarks and planned next steps, her office declined to comment.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Asylum ‘metering’

The high court took up one new case at its recent conference, Noem v. Al Otro Lado. We previewed in last week’s edition.

The justices will decide the legality of a now-rescinded immigration policy called “metering.”

From 2016 to 2021 (started under Obama, used during Trump 1.0, rescinded by Biden), immigration officials managed an influx of migrants by turning people away without considering their asylum claims.

But federal law guarantees that a migrant who “arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and must be inspected.

So, how did the policy work? Immigration officials turned the noncitizens away while they were still on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Justice Department argues an individual doesn’t “arrive” in the United States until actually crossing the border. It appealed to the justices after a legal challenge succeeded in a lower court.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged the Supreme Court’s decision won’t have an immediate impact, but he cited a likelihood “metering” could return as an immigration policy in the future.

OUT: New Orleans prison

As the Supreme Court term kicked off, we previewed Hutson v. United States, an appeal of a court order requiring Louisiana and New Orleans to construct an 89-bed prison facility to improve inadequate housing for inmates with mental health needs.

In nearly two months since, the court kept punting whether it would take the case. On Monday, the suspense ended.

Only three justices voted to hear the New Orleans sheriff’s appeal, one short of what’s required.

Those three votes came from the court’s conservative wing: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.

Alito called the court-ordered construction “illegal from the beginning.” Additionally, Alito wrote the lower court got “the inquiry backwards” when Louisiana years later sought to dissolve the order under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a 1995 law that curbs prisoner lawsuits.

“This case cried out for our review. By failing to intervene, we leave New Orleans to pay for the Fifth Circuit’s serious errors,” wrote Alito, joined by Thomas.

Gorsuch didn’t join the dissent and did not publicly explain his reasoning.

MAYBE: Water rights

The Supreme Court wants the Trump administration’s views on whether to take up Nebraska v. Colorado, a battle between the two states over water rights.

Nebraska officials accuse Colorado of unlawfully threatening Nebraska’s water supply along the South Platte River.

The Constitution and federal law give the Supreme Court “original jurisdiction” (meaning the power to decide a case first) over lawsuits between states.

These days, the high court maintains a policy that it has discretion to take up those cases. The Trump administration’s opinion on what to do is likely to carry serious weight in most justices’ consideration.

That is, except for two. Thomas and Alito believe the court is required to take up lawsuits between two states (see examples from 2025, 2021, 2020 and 2016). So regardless of how they feel about the water dispute, expect them to dissent again if their colleagues refuse the case.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

The Supreme Court will consider roughly 180 petitions to take up cases at this week’s conference, the final one before Thanksgiving.

Let’s start with several petitions the court weighed last week that are “relisted” again this week. It is a potential signal the court will take up the case, or a justice is drafting a dissent and needs more time to finish it:

Eminent domain: In Hoffmann v. WBI Energy Transmission, a group of North Dakota ranch owners are seeking to collect nearly $400,000 in attorneys’ fees incurred during their legal fight with a natural gas company. The company used its eminent domain authority to take some of the ranch owners’ land for a pipeline. Everyone agrees the owners are entitled to compensation, but a lower court ruled that does not include legal fees.

Aquatherapy: In Doe v. Dynamic Physical Therapy, an anonymous man is seeking to revive his damages lawsuit against a Louisiana provider that during the pandemic allegedly refused his request for aquatic physical therapy because he is HIV positive. Under Louisiana law, claims against providers during a health emergency must clear a higher legal bar, so lower courts dismissed the man’s lawsuit. He says it improperly overrode his claims under federal disability laws.

Title IX: Crowther v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia raises whether school employees can sue under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education. MaChelle Joseph, a longtime Georgia Tech women’s basketball head coach fired over emotional abuse accusations, and a fired Augusta University professor are seeking to revive their sex-discrimination lawsuits under Title IX. But a lower court ruled they instead must bring claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which more generally protects against employment discrimination.

Some notable first-time listings:

Trump’s bid to uphold his birthright citizenship restrictions, Cameroonian journalist Simon Ateba’s challenge to the Biden administration revoking his White House hard pass, Alliance Defending Freedom’s challenge to a school district’s policy that doesn’t inform parents’ when their child uses different pronouns at school, Alabama’s defense of its congressional map and whether private parties can enforce a key Voting Rights Act provision.

ON THE DOCKET

Don’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:

Today:

Former FBI Director James Comey’s motion to dismiss his charges for selective and vindictive prosecution is set to be argued before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is set to consider relief for a group of migrants deported to the El Salvadoran mega-prison CECOT under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, in addition to next steps in his contempt inquiry. They migrants have since been moved to Venezuela.

Another D.C. judge is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing in a challenge brought by four migrants who live in the nation’s capital and were arrested by immigration authorities without warrants.

A federal judge in California is set to hold a summary judgment hearing in a challenge brought by Stanford’s student newspaper and two anonymous students who allege the administration is unconstitutionally deporting students for their pro-Palestinian advocacy.

Federal judges in North Carolina are set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing over North Carolina’s new congressional map that could give Republicans an additional seat.

A federal judge in Chicago is set to hold a hearing about revealing a government informant in the case against Juan Espinoza Martinez, an alleged Latin Kings member accused of putting a bounty on the head of a top immigration enforcement official.

Thursday:

A federal judge in Maryland is set to hold an evidentiary hearing in the case of mistakenly deported man Kilmar Abrego Garcia as she weighs whether to dissolve a preliminary injunction that would allow the government to deport him again.

Anibal Hernandez Santana, a retired lobbyist accused of firing a gun into an ABC affiliate office in Sacramento, Calif., the day after activists protested the network’s removal of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing, is set to be arraigned on state charges.

Friday:

Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton is set to appear before a federal judge in Greenbelt, Md. for the first hearing since he entered his not guilty plea.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) faces a deadline to appeal to the state’s top court a ruling that ordered her to return her case against the state’s so-called “fake electors” to a grand jury or see it dismissed.

Monday:

The Supreme Court will announce orders.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of a district judge’s finding that the administration may not exclude journalists based on their opinions, stemming from its efforts to block the Associated Press’s access over its decision not to abide by the president’s change of the Gulf of Mexico’s name to the “Gulf of America.”

Please note that the views of outside contributors do not reflect the official opinions of SCOTUSblog or its staff.

In its defense of President Donald Trump’s executive order limiting access to birthright citizenship, the Justice Department claims that the government’s policy would bring the United States in line with the modern global trend. It is true that most countries do not grant citizenship at birth to people born within their borders with as few restrictions as the United States. But that isn’t new: The United States has been a global outlier since the 14th Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1868.

Understanding which countries grant citizenship primarily based on the location of birth, and which don’t, helps make sense of the 127-year-old approach that the Justice Department is asking the court to reconsider. This also reveals the troubling history of why certain countries have chosen not to recognize birthright citizenship in the first place.

***

Trump’s birthright citizenship order, which denies U.S. citizenship to some children born in the United States based on the citizenship or immigration status of their parents, has faced legal challenges since shortly after the president signed it in January. In June, the court weighed in on the administration’s side regarding a technical – albeit important – procedural issue, and over the past five months courts considering a new round of lawsuits have uniformly concluded that the executive order is likely illegal. In its petition asking the court to review decisions from two federal courts – the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire – the Justice Department argues that broad access to citizenship at birth “degrades” and “dilutes” U.S. citizenship. “Presumably for those reasons, hardly any developed country retains a theory of citizenship similar to the United States’ current approach,” the U.S Solicitor General, D. John Sauer, writes in the government’s petition.

The solicitor general’s claim isn’t so much incorrect as it is misleading. Sauer doesn’t cite any source or give any examples, so it is impossible to be sure which countries he considers “developed.” Germany, Japan, and most Nordic countries, for example, historically relied on biological relationships to determine citizenship. In practice, a citizen’s child would obtain citizenship at birth based on the parent-child relationship even if the child was born outside the country of citizenship. Called jus sanguinis – a Latin term meaning “right of blood” – what matters most under these citizenship practices, which remain common, is a child’s genetic inheritance. Current law in the United States features jus sanguinis options for some children born abroad to U.S. citizens.

By contrast, the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause, which ties citizenship to the place of birth, is an example of a jus soli citizenship law – a Latin phrase that means “right of the soil.” Since at least 1898, when the Supreme Court issued its decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, courts and executive branch agencies have interpreted the citizenship clause as granting U.S. citizenship to everyone born in the United States except for the children of foreign diplomats, invading military forces, and Native Americans.

Like in the United States, jus soli citizenship laws are common throughout the Western Hemisphere. Canada and Mexico both extend citizenship to children born within their borders. Alongside Argentina and Brazil, South America’s two largest economies, the five wealthiest countries in the Americas recognize a broad jus soli citizenship right. Except Mexico, each of these countries exempts children born to diplomats.

Despite being far from unusual in the Americas, jus soli citizenship originated in the United Kingdom. In 1608, Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke announced that Robert Calvin, who was born in Scotland, was a citizen of the king’s entire realm rather than simply of Scotland. “Whosoever is born within the King’s power or protection, is no alien; but Calvin was born under the King’s power and protection; ergo he is no alien,” Coke wrote in Calvin’s Case. Importantly, Coke qualified this broad recognition of citizenship through birthplace by excluding children born to invading enemies. A child born to someone who successfully attacks “any castle or fort” isn’t treated as a citizen “though he be born within his dominions, for that he was not born under the King’s ligeance or obedience,” Coke added.

The immediate impact of Coke’s decision in Calvin’s Case was that Robert Calvin could claim property in England on the same terms as any English male. Over the long run, the theory of citizenship based on the location of birth that Coke announced in 1608 also proved convenient to a country that would go on to spread its reach across the world. The U.K.’s broad jus soli policy ensured that its own emigrants could count on their children receiving U.K. citizenship no matter where in the kingdom they lived.

Nevertheless, almost 400 years after Calvin’s Case, the United Kingdom narrowed its citizenship law. As Sauer notes in his petition to the court, “[e]ven the United Kingdom, which pioneered near-automatic birthright citizenship, abandoned that approach in 1983.” By the last decades of the 20th century, the U.K. had stopped invading new territories, subduing their populations, and stretching its global reach through generation after generation of emigrants. Rather than send its own native-born residents abroad, residents of the remaining Commonwealth countries, as well as residents of the U.K.’s former colonies, began heading to the U.K. To limit who acquired citizenship, in 1981 Parliament enacted a law, the British Nationality Act of 1981, that tied a child’s citizenship to birth in the U.K. and the citizenship or immigration status of their parents. That law, which combines jus soli and jus sanguinis principles, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1983 and remains in effect today.

Indeed, the division between countries that rely primarily on jus soli citizenship and those that use jus sanguinis reflects their histories of colonization. Most countries that default to jus soli citizenship share a common history of European colonization, including displacement and near annihilation of native populations. The United States, like the rest of the Americas, fits this description. By contrast, few countries that prioritize jus sanguinis citizenship were colonized by European powers.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-19 13:58:51.801605

Comey's lawyers argue that Trump's public comments prove case is a personal attack

Lawyers for James Comey are arguing that the case against the former FBI director is nothing more than a personal attack, born out of Donald Trump’s desire to prosecute his political adversary.

“This is an extraordinary case and it merits an extraordinary remedy,” Comey’s defense lawyer, Michael Dreeben, said today at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Dreeben added that the president’s public comments about Comey are “effectively an admission that this is a political prosecution and not based on evidence”.

A reminder that Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020, and has pleaded not guilty.

On Monday, another federal judge found evidence of “government misconduct” in how Lindsey Halligan, the interim US attorney general for the eastern district of Virginia, secured criminal charges against the former FBI director, and ordered that grand jury materials be turned over to Comey’s defense team.

House set to repeal funding bill provision to allow senators to sue government over phone records

Later today, we’re expecting a vote in the House that would repeal a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed last week (which ended the record-breaking government shutdown) that allows senators to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Most Republicans in the House have derided the measure, while the Senate majority leader, John Thune, remained convinced it was necessary. “The House is going to do what they’re going to do with it,” he said of the lower chamber lawmakers. “It doesn’t apply to them.” However, a number of GOP senators have indicated they’re happy to do away with the provision. This even includes some of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained as part of Jack Smith’s investigation.

That vote is currently scheduled for 8:15pm ET.

Exclusive: State department to cut 38 universities from research program over DEI policies

Joseph Gedeon

The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.

The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.

Elite institutions including Stanford University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University and the University of Southern California are among those marked for suspension, effective 1 January 2026. Other targeted schools include American University, George Washington University, Syracuse University and several University of California campuses.

An accompanying spreadsheet, reviewed by the Guardian, uses a color-coded system to evaluate 75 universities on a four-point scale, with institutions showing “clear DEI hiring policy” marked in red for suspension and those with “merit-based hiring with no evidence of DEI” marked in green to maintain partnerships.

The suspensions follow Trump’s near year-long campaign against DEI in higher education. In January, he declared diversity programs “illegal” and ordered agencies to force universities receiving federal grants to certify compliance or lose funding, with a 21 April deadline. In April, he moved to terminate accreditors that require DEI practices, threatening universities’ ability to access federal student aid.

Trump administration crafting plan with Russia to end war in Ukraine - report

The Trump administration is working with Russia to craft a plan to end the war in Ukraine, according to a report by Axios.

Citing unnamed US and Russian officials, a 28-point peace plan is inspired by Trump’s deal to end the war in Gaza. According to Axios’ sources, the plan’s 28 points fall into four general buckets: peace in Ukraine, security guarantees, security in Europe, and future U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is leading the drafting of the plan Trump’s envoy and has discussed it extensively with top Russian diplomat, Kirill Dmitriev. The aim, according to Dmitriev is to produce a written document along those lines before Trump and Putin next meet, according to Dmitriev.

According to Axios’ Barak Ravid, Witkoff also met with Ukraine’s national security adviser, Rustem Umerov, in a meeting earlier this week in Miami, Florida.

This comes as an overnight strike by Russia on western Ukraine killed 25 people and left 73 people injured, according to Ukrainian interior ministry

Larry Summers steps down from OpenAI board following release of Epstein emails - report

Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary and Harvard professor, told Axios on Wednesday that he was resigning from the OpenAI board following the publication of a series of email exchanges he had with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

His resignation comes one day after Charlie Stadtlander, the New York Times’ executive director for media relations and communications, said the publication was cutting ties with him amid new revelations about his relationship with Epstein from documents released by members of the House last week.

The documents revealed that Summers maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008, and continued to correspond with him until 5 July 2019, the day before Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges.

“In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,” Summers said in a statement to Axios. “I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress.”

The Senate is expected to formally vote on Wednesday on a bill that would force the full release of the investigative files related to Epstein. Some of the documents that have already been released appear to suggest that Donald Trump “knew about the girls” procured for Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring and that he had once Trump “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.

Former FBI director James Comey to appear in court

Former FBI director James Comey is set to return to court on Wednesday, where his lawyers will argue that Donald Trump unlawfully directed the Justice Department to prosecute as a form of malicious retribution.

Comey was charged with lying to Congress in 2020 just days after Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, with his attorneys arguing that the charges are an example of vindictive prosecution.

On Monday, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ruled that the justice department engaged in a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” on its way to indicting Comey and directed prosecutors to produce to defense lawyers all grand jury materials from the case.

Mike Pence says 'I did my duty' in UK talk touching on January 6, tariffs and MBS visit

Former Vice President Mike Pence is speaking at Chatham House in London, reflecting on the US and its place in the world today.

He was diplomatic when discussing Donald Trump, saying he remained proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration, though “it didn’t end the way I wanted it to” – Pence split from Trump when he refused to block certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 as rioters incited by Trump chanted “hang Mike Pence”.

“I will always believe, by god’s grace, that I did my duty that day in January 2021,” Pence said to loud applause.

However, Pence said he disagreed on Trump’s statements on Tuesday during a White House visit with Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump brushed off questions from a reporter about a US intelligence assessment that the prince had approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US green-card holder and Washington Post columnist, saying “things happen” and that bin Salman “knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that”.

“I would not have made that statement,” he said without much more detail, adding that the visit would have gone much differently had he been in the Oval Office.

Pence also distanced himself from Trump’s global tariffs, saying he believes that while tariffs “have a use as a means of facilitating negotiation…I believe in free trade with free nations.”

“The simple truth is at the American founding, taxes on tea were kind of an issue,” he said as the crowd laughed. “Those were tariffs. By the time they got around to that second draft of an American government in 1787 that we call the constitution of the United States, the one thing they wanted to make clear was that no one person could impose import tariffs and taxes on the American people, that it would be done by the elected representatives of the American people. I’m hopeful that our supreme court will draw the same conclusion.”

Democrats and Republicans celebrate passage of bill to release Epstein files

Hello and thank you for joining us on the US politics live blog. I’m Vivian Ho and I will be bringing you the latest news over the next few hours.

The Senate agreed on Tuesday by unanimous consent to approve legislation that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The move came mere hours after a 427-1 vote in the US House to pass the bipartisan measure that Donald Trump had been fighting for months.

“Americans are done being lied to. These survivors deserve full transparency. Every document, every truth, every name,” Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump ally who split from the president over the Epstein files, posted on X on Tuesday.

The scandal over the Epstein files has dogged Trump since his return to the White House. For months, the president has dismissed the uproar over the government’s handling of the Epstein case as a “Democrat hoax”. Over the weekend, he relented and urged Republican lawmakers to vote for the measure that many of their constituents demanded they support.

“I don’t care when the Senate passes the House Bill, whether tonight, or at some other time in the near future, I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the victories that we’ve had,” the president posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, told CNN that the bipartisan bill will likely be sent to Trump’s desk for signing on Wednesday, after the House formally transmits the bill and the Senate officially approves it. Trump told reporters on Monday that he would sign the bill.

Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat who sponsored the bill alongside Republican congressman Thomas Massie, posted on X that Trump “should have the survivors who made this possible at the bill’s signing.”

Backlash related to the Epstein files, some of which have already been made public by members of the House, has begun: the New York Times said it will be cutting ties with the former treasury secretary Larry Summers after documents revealed that Summers maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.

Trump is set to speak at a US-Saudi forum focused on investment on Wednesday. After a White House visit on Tuesday from Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, Trump said that the US and Saudi Arabia have entered into a security agreement that would ease weapons transfers between the two countries and elevate Saudi Arabia to a “major non-Nato ally,” Politico reports.

This came after Trump brushed off questions from a reporter about a US intelligence assessment that the prince had approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US green-card holder and Washington Post columnist. Marty Baron, the former executive editor of the Washington Post, called Trump’s remarks “a disgrace”. “‘Things happen,’ he said. Actually, someone made them happen. And that was the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He had Jamal Khashoggi assassinated, and then he and his government lied about what happened.”

Federal judges are set to hear arguments on Wednesday afternoon to determine a preliminary injunction request in two consolidated challenges to North Carolina’s congressional map, which was redrawn with the aim of adding more Republicans to Congress. On Tuesday, a panel of federal judges ruled that Texas cannot use 2025 congressional maps, which added five Republican districts, for the 2026 midterms and must use the 2021 boundaries. Judge Jeffrey Brown wrote: “Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”

A new Marquette Law School survey finds more people are favoring Democrats than Republicans in the anticipated 2026 vote for Congress.

The Trump drag on the GOP A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular.
Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.","Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.

The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found:

Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today;

President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol;

A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown; and

Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close.

""I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,"" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. ""You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.""

From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions.

""I feel lost,"" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a ""lapsed Democrat."" ""The parties don't speak to me anymore.""

He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now.

The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is ""dishonest"" and ""closed-minded"" about politics.

All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections.

Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress

Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today.

It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018.

What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot.

Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms.

Consider:

In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They lost nine House seats;

In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats;

In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats.

All that said, with redistricting, the number of competitive seats has shrunk significantly, so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting.

Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point.

The Trump drag on the GOP

A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well.

Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021.

The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the economy and foreign policy, and people think he's gone too far on immigration.

Trump has said on more than one occasion in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority.

Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%).

Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing.

Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus.

But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.

""They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,"" Stokes said. ""I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.""

It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks

Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency.

But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%).

This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have ""quite a lot"" or a ""great deal"" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party.

Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters.

""They don't interact with working people,"" he said, ""regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.""

And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans.

Democrats and Republicans see each other as ""dishonest"" and ""closed-minded""

It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from.

The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as ""closed-minded""; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as ""dishonest"" when talking about politics.

Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were ""mostly dishonest"" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were ""mostly honest"" when it came to politics.

Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F75%2F027c0c3046f9bd50f8d3ffc63f00%2Fgettyimages-2245835281.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:15.415056

The decision comes after the Department of Homeland Security released a list last week identifying 610 people still in custody after arrests by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June and Oct. 7.

The list was required by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who ordered the release of everyone on it on a $1,500 bond unless they were deemed a public safety risk by ICE or if they had a prior removal order.

Homeland Security attempted to block or delay the releases while the federal government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Cummings denied the request, stating in his late Tuesday order that ICE didn’t show irreparable harm nor that it could win on appeal. The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs faced concrete harm if the releases were delayed.

The release will apply to 442 people detained by ICE between June and Oct. 7 who have not yet been deported and not deemed a public safety threat, according to court documents.

ICE identified 57 people who were deemed “high public safety risk” and are therefore to remain in detention, Cummings ruled.

The list provided by Homeland Security includes a Risk Classification Assessment for each person, which reviews a person’s criminal history, immigration record and community ties to recommend whether they should be detained or released while their case moves forward, according to a 2012 report from the department. But questions around how risk is calculated by the government remain, as the rubric has changed several times since its inception.

The system assigns separate ratings for public-safety risk and flight risk — each ranging from low to high — and then issues a final overall score, also from low to high. Department of Homeland Security officials did not answer questions about how these ratings are determined.

Of the 610 people on the list, ICE assigned final risk assessments as follows: 21 high, 58 medium/high, 39 medium/low and 488 low. Separately, ICE assigned the following public safety risk as follows: 42 high, 87 medium and 473 low.

Homeland Security initially identified 16 people on the list to remain in custody after receiving a “high public safety risk” designation from ICE. The list states those people were arrested for criminal charges ranging from driving under the influence to assault with a gun. But the government later deemed all but one of them to be low or medium threats to public safety.

On Friday, Homeland Security expanded its list to include 39 additional people it labeled as posing a high public safety risk, but it offered no explanation for those designations. In a response, attorneys for the National Immigrant Justice Center noted Saturday that ICE’s own risk assessment rated several of those people as low or medium-low risk overall and asked the judge to require the Department of Homeland Security to justify each of the added cases.

Attorneys for the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU of Illinois, who are plaintiffs in the case, have repeatedly criticized ICE’s risk rating system as unclear and inconsistent.

Researchers have also raised concerns. A 2022 study published in the Columbia Human Rights Law Review found that between 2012-2015, ICE changed how the tool scored people, including what counted as a higher-risk offense, which pushed more people into detention categories instead of release.

A 2020 study meanwhile found the tool routinely failed to follow its own risk logic. A review of three major risk-scoring revisions showed Homeland Security rewrote scoring rules so more people were labeled “medium” or “high” risk. The study also found the risk assessment hid key information from judges and misclassified some people, resulting in the detention of many medically vulnerable migrants.

Block Club was unable to verify most of the government’s allegations of criminal conduct through searching publicly available court records and arrest databases. Even when Block Club found criminal cases involving people flagged in the immigration data, the charges were often different from those listed by the government.

For example, an individual listed as a high “national security” risk was charged in February with causing a traffic crash and lacking a valid driver’s license. Another person accused by the government of assault with a gun was charged with a misdemeanor domestic violence offense after threatening to stab a man this year.

Block Club found records showing some of the people deemed high risk had been arrested on felony charges, including sexual abuse and home invasion. In other cases, neither public records nor government information explained why they were considered threats to public safety.

However, arrests highlighted by the government could have happened in other areas or might not be readily found by the public.

By Wednesday, Homeland Security is mandated to produce an expanded list of more than 3,000 people arrested and detained by Border Patrol in the Chicago area.

The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.
In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.
Separation centres, which currently house 12 prisoners, according to the judgment, have come under increased scrutiny this year.","Shabana Mahmood and David Lammy have been found to have breached a prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment with respect to a prisoner who spent months segregated from other inmates, in what is believed to be a legal first.

Sahayb Abu was confined to his cell at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, for 22 hours a day and prevented from associating with other prisoners for more than four months after Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, allegedly attacked prison officers at HMP Frankland.

Abu, a convicted terrorist serving a life sentence, was already being held in a separation centre for prisoners believed to be at risk or radicalising others, which has also been described as small group isolation, but was moved to even more restrictive conditions following the attack by Abedi in April.

In what is believed to the the first instance of ministers being found in breach of article 3 of the European convention on human rights, Mr Justice Sheldon found that Lammy, the justice secretary, and Mahmood, his predecessor, should have considered Abu’s existing mental health issues before he was moved.

In his written judgment, the judge said: “In the context of a prisoner who has a history of trauma and where there was a failure to obtain an assessment of his needs even though he was known to have mental health issues, and a failure to provide him with any therapeutic treatment to address his trauma, a contravention of article 3 is made out, notwithstanding the importance of the aim behind the segregation regime.

“The suffering that the claimant has experienced goes way beyond the inevitable element of suffering that is connected with segregation: an otherwise legitimate form of treatment. An individual who is segregated from others and deprived of the usual activities available to prisoners (education, work, communal prayer) will inevitably suffer isolation and an element of distress and anxiety. What the claimant experienced was much more severe than that: he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, brought on (at least in part) by the segregation.”

He said that his judgment did not mean that the same segregation regime would contravene article 3 in the case of a prisoner with an ordinary level of resilience, but the “claimant was not such a prisoner, given his history of trauma and associated mental health needs”.

The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.

In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.

Separation centres, which currently house 12 prisoners, according to the judgment, have come under increased scrutiny this year.

In another judgment, handed down in January, the high court found that the decision to place Denny De Silva, who was serving a life sentence for a gangland murder, in a separation centre was unlawful as it had relied on allegations of radicalisation activities in prison by De Silva, without establishing whether or not they were true. In comments that were also referred to in the Abu case, Mrs Justice Hill said: “Research indicates that small group isolation regimes can produce serious and adverse psychological effects similar to solitary confinement.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e2b45c6d8beb717aa8f9655cbac592d6749896/512_0_2560_2048/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b43a73608ff5348c2d5f8efb2edc5704",N,,2025-11-19 11:59:44.949990

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests.
The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.
New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.

In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.

“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.

Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.

They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.

The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.

In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.

Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.

“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.

But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.

“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.

Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.

Knowing where a target will be

Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.

Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.

“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.

In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.

“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”

An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.

Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.

Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.

Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.

Trump administration court actions

But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.

The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.

U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.

In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.

Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses

Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.

Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.

“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.

Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”

Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.

“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.

Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.

“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

“It is absolutely unacceptable that the Trump administration is dragging its feet on the awarding of these vital security grants,” said Congresswoman Pou. “As domestic extremism and terrorist threats to synagogues and other religious and community centers explode, Congress appropriated these grant funds to help support readiness. Americans have an unshakeable right to worship in peace and security. Congress deserves answers and our nation deserves action from this administration.”

In their letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the recently resigned former head of FEMA, Pou and her colleagues demand transparency and answers from the Trump government.

“We are alarmed that the administration has not awarded the $275 million that Congress made available for NSGP in fiscal year 2025 given the escalating threats that nonprofit organizations – including synagogues, churches, and mosques – continue to experience,” the Members wrote. “Further, FEMA continues to disregard the congressionally mandated outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to advise nonprofits on how to apply for NSGP.”

Members expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s refusal to share basic program information with Congress: “In further departure from precedent, the administration has yet to share with Congress which nonprofits received NSGP awards from the National Security Supplemental funding, despite awards having been made months ago and repeated bipartisan requests. Congress has invested historic levels in NSGP and the administration’s refusal to share information with Congress hurts the ability of Congress to properly assess resource needs.”

Congresswoman Pou is also the top Democrat on the House panel tasked with overseeing the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the 2028 Summer Olympics, and celebrations of America’s upcoming 250th birthday. Throughout 2025, she has helped lead efforts to ensure security for these events and that they receive full support from the federal government.

A copy of the letter signed by Congresswoman Pou and 33 House Democrats is available here. The text is below.

Dear Secretary Noem and Mr. Richardson:

We write to you out of shared concern about the status of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) awards.

FEMA was required by law to publish the FY 2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for NSGP by May 14, 2025, but chose not to comply. The administration finally released the FY 2025 NSGP NOFO on July 28, but it lacked basic information necessary to move the application process forward and to fruition, such as when FEMA planned to administer the application process, make award decisions, and release funding to nonprofit organizations. To date, FEMA still has not shared this information with States or nonprofit organizations, nor has FEMA indicated whether the period of performance for awarded projects has already begun. States have repeatedly asked FEMA for this information, and they have received no response. This has also created a chilling effect on faith-based and nonprofit organizations that are hesitant to participate in an opaque application process.

We understand that FEMA plans to continue to withhold the $275 million in FY 2025 NSGP funds and, prior to the government shutdown, awards for nonprofit organizations were scheduled to take several months. Further, FEMA continues to disregard the congressionally mandated outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to advise nonprofits on how to apply for NSGP. As of the date of this letter, FEMA has not held a single webinar to advise nonprofits on how to apply for these needed funds. Because of FEMA’s delays and lack of coordination and communication with States, many States have already opened and closed the application period for nonprofit organizations, meaning that any outreach from FEMA at this point would be too late. Other States have not opened the application process and have not communicated with faith-based and nonprofit stakeholders, leaving the process and the potential applicants in limbo.

In addition, FEMA’s FY 2025 NOFO introduced vague, new requirements and conditions that have created confusion among States and nonprofits, leaving applicants uncertain about whether their proposals would be qualified or disqualified for funding and what constituted compliance in order to receive payments from FEMA. For example, the NOFO includes language implying that eligibility for funding could depend on cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement efforts—a significant departure from past practice. FEMA also now requires States to collect and submit additional information about each nonprofit organization before awards can be made and each time nonprofits need to be reimbursed—steps that could significantly slow the process for both States and nonprofits and add undue administrative costs and burden. Such provisions have created concern that faith-based and community organizations might not be able to receive timely reimbursements from FEMA, if they receive any reimbursement at all, discouraging them further from applying for funds.

We are also deeply concerned by reports that DHS may be discriminating against Muslim organizations. In August 2025, DHS reportedly cancelled NSGP funding that had been awarded to over 40 Muslim organizations and banned their eligibility for future funding, citing “alleged affiliations with terrorist activities.” More recent reporting indicates that these cancellations may have been part of a broader attempt by DHS leadership to ban FEMA funding for all Muslim organizations. DHS has not presented evidence sufficient to justify disqualifying these organizations from receiving grant funding.

We are alarmed that the administration has not awarded the $275 million that Congress made available for NSGP in FY 2025 given the escalating threats that nonprofit organizations—including synagogues, churches, and mosques—continue to experience. This delay comes at a time when our Nation continues to see nonprofits targeted by bad actors, which the NOFO itself acknowledges. In August, a Minneapolis Catholic Church was the site of a mass shooting that left 2 children dead and injured 21 other people.6 In September, a man opened fire and set ablaze a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, killing 4 people and wounding 8.7 The U.S. has also seen a rise in violent antisemitic attacks, including the hostage taking incident at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas in 2022, and the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. Now is not the time for NSGP resources to be withheld from communities, nor the NOFO and grant guidance to continue to remain incomplete.

In further departure from precedent, the administration has yet to share with Congress which nonprofits received NSGP awards from the National Security Supplemental funding, despite awards having been made months ago and repeated bipartisan requests. Congress has invested historic levels in NSGP and the administration’s refusal to share information with Congress hurts the ability of Congress to properly assess resource needs.

Therefore, we urge DHS and FEMA to take the following actions:

Immediately clarify the timeline for the FY 2025 NSGP applications, address all other open issues or incomplete grant guidance to the State Administrative Agencies and nonprofit sub-applicants, and expedite application completion and awards to nonprofits.

Immediately remove the vague NOFO requirements that unduly burden States and nonprofit organizations and may ultimately prevent nonprofits from accessing funds.

Immediately provide Congress with the full list of nonprofits that received NSGP awards this year and continue to provide this information each time awards are made in the future.

Immediately begin outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to nonprofits to share essential information about the NSGP application process.

Immediately rescind any guidance or directives that have resulted, or could result, in violations of anti-discrimination laws within NSGP.

FEMA must take immediate steps to get the FY 2025 NSGP back on track so that FY 2026 can proceed without the present delays, inconsistencies and uncertainties, and lack of uniformity and predictability that have previously been the hallmarks and guardrails for a program serving several thousand faith-based and nonprofit applicants each grant cycle. The Administration’s own budget for FY 2026 endorsed continued NSGP funding, reflecting a shared commitment to keeping communities safe and ensuring funds reach those who need them most.

Sincerely,

If family life is strictly limited to parents and children, as the Home Secretary suggests, then this would be in conflict with Article 8 ECHR.","Backlash against the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) is heavily driven by immigration and is often a direct reaction to it. This is not a new phenomenon, but the politics are escalating, both domestically and internationally. On the international plane nine states issued a joint letter earlier this year challenging the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) migration jurisprudence and it is reported that further discussions about potential reform of the ECHR are ongoing. On the domestic plane, both the Conservative Party and Reform have announced that if they win the next election they intend to tackle immigration by withdrawing from the ECHR. Against this political backdrop, the Labour Government has announced its proposals. In Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government’s asylum and returns policy it proposes to reform the asylum system; limit the right to respect for private and family life in Article 8 ECHR in domestic law; reexamine the interpretation of ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’ for the purposes of Article 3 ECHR as part of international initiatives; and bring forward legislation on modern slavery. There is, and will be in the coming months, much to discuss, but what is clear is that change is afoot.

In the midst of this political maelstrom, it is imperative that debate and analysis is premised on a clear understanding of the legal issues. In an excellent report for the Bonavero Institute, Victoria Adelmant, Alice Donald and Basak Çali highlighted the problematic ways in which immigration law and human rights are presented in media coverage. Alan Greene has also recently suggested that the way in which politicians discuss human rights is a form of ‘kayfabe’, a staged performance which ‘allows politicians to ground reality in a fictional story of their own creation rather than objective truth’. He points to various statements by politicians about immigration as exemplary of this but concludes that ‘when stepping from the kayfabe to the real world, these arguments must come into contact with reality’ and that ‘it is here where the technocratic defences of human rights come into their own.’ This blog post might therefore be seen as part of that technocratic examination, or to quote Greene again, to be ‘bringing facts to a vibes fight’.

The Government’s proposals have grave implications for many aspects of immigration law, and I will explore some of these issues elsewhere; some insights into the constitutional implications can also be found in Mark Elliott’s blogpost. In the space accorded for this blog post I will focus on Article 8 ECHR. In particular, the Government’s proposal to limit the right by: (i) strengthening the public interest test; and (ii) defining ‘family’ for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. I will argue (i) that domestic law already defines the public interest test, and it is difficult to see how this can be strengthened in ways that are compatible with the Convention; and (ii) that the Government’s definition of ‘family’ is neither necessary, nor will it inevitably lead to the desired result. In respect of Article 3 ECHR, readers would be well advised to read Natasa Mavronicola’s earlier analysis on the prospect of losing this right.

Strengthening the public interest test

The Government’s first proposal is to bring forth legislation setting out ‘to Home Office decision makers, and the courts, how to properly balance the public interest against’ Article 8 ECHR. One might legitimately ask, however, whether this is not already provided for in domestic law. Since 2012, Immigration Rules have set out how Article 8 ECHR should be balanced and these provisions were inserted into the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (NIIA) by s.19 of the Immigration Act 2014. There is therefore already domestic law which establishes how Article 8 ECHR is to be balanced against the public interest. In particular, s.117A NIAA provides that a court or tribunal must have regard to s.117B NIAA in all cases, which states, amongst other things, that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest. Section 117A also provides that a court or tribunal must have regard to s.117C NIAA in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals. Section 117C NIAA states that deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest unless one of three exceptions applies. Those exceptions require, in respect of sentences of less than four years, that there are either ‘very significant obstacles to integration’ or that the effect of deportation on a partner or child would be ‘unduly harsh’. Moreover, in cases where someone has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, only ‘very compelling circumstances over and above’ those other two exceptions will suffice. The severity of these thresholds has been addressed in the case law. See, for example, the observation in SSHD v Treebhawon and Others, at [37], that very significant obstacles to integration ‘is a self-evidently elevated threshold, such that mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere hurdles and mere upheaval or inconvenience, even where multiplied, will generally be insufficient in this context’. As well as the Supreme Court’s confirmation in HA (Iraq), at [41-45], that

‘unduly harsh’ does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold. ‘Harsh’ in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb ‘unduly’ raises an already elevated standard still higher.

These provisions (albeit in the form of Immigration Rules at the time) were accepted by the ECtHR in Unuane v United Kingdom as not in themselves incompatible with Article 8 ECHR on the basis that they do not preclude the domestic courts and tribunals from employing the criteria set out in the Convention case law for assessing whether an expulsion is necessary and proportionate. Importantly, however, in Unuane the ECtHR stated (at [79]), that

where the domestic courts do not carefully examine the facts, apply the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and the Court’s case-law, and adequately balance the interests of the applicant against those of the general public, the Court remains empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8.

Consequently, it will be necessary to see whether the Government’s proposal for a ‘fundamental reset’ which ‘narrows the circumstances in which an individual’s Article 8 rights would outweigh the public interest in removing them’ is consistent with the human rights standards established in the ECtHR’s case law.

In contemplating what the Government’s proposals might look like it is helpful to recall that the Labour Government is not the first to suggest curtailing Article 8 ECHR. Indeed, this was a core part of the former Conservative Government’s proposals for repealing the HRA and replacing it with a Bill of Rights. Some insight into the issues that the Labour Government might now face may thus be found in responses to the former Conservative Government’s proposals. In 2021-2022 in my role as Director of the Centre for Public Law at the University of Cambridge, I and twenty-nine other members of our centre produced an extensive response to that consultation in which we observed, amongst other things, that it was unlikely that the proposals could require the courts to do anything other than what they were doing under the existing legal framework. We suggested that anything more restrictive was likely to lead to the ECtHR finding violations of Article 8 ECHR.

Defining family

The Government is also proposing to bring forth primary legislation stating that ‘[f]amily, for the purposes of Article 8, should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. Some insight into what is driving this proposal might be found in Lord Wolfson’s legal advice for the leader of the Conservative Party, which was published by the Conservative Party as the Wolfson Report in September 2025. The advice in that report is structured around a series of tests promulgated by Kemi Badenoch in June 2025 as the means of deciding whether the UK should remain a signatory to the ECHR. The choice of tests, the framing of those tests, and the interpretation of the outcomes of those tests is, of course, political.

One of the five tests presented and used in the Wolfson Report is the ‘sovereign borders test’. In respect of which the Report states at [16-17] that the UK could, free from the purported constraints of the ECHR, ‘adopt more robust policies in this area and still maintain compliance with other international instruments to which the UK is signatory, principally the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture’ (emphasis added). The report cites Australia in support of this contention. Stevie Martin, Stephanie Palmer and I have written in our forthcoming editorial for the December 2025 issue of the European Human Rights Law Review that any suggestion that Australia’s immigration laws, policies and/or practices comply with international rights instruments including the Convention Against Torture is plainly incorrect. Consequently, it is troubling from a rule of law perspective to read statements such as the following, at [73], that: ‘where there is no body capable of providing a definitive conclusion on the interpretation of an instrument, the UK will be in a better position to argue that its actions and policies are compatible with the instrument in question, provided it has bona fide opinion as to the meaning of the instrument’. Particularly when observing that the Report immediately goes on to state that ‘[t]his in part explains how the Australian Government maintains that its border policy is compliant with international law: while it is signed up to the Refugee Convention, it is not a member of the ECHR. As a result, its position cannot be authoritatively second-guessed in any competent international court’ (emphasis added). These repeated references to ‘maintaining compliance’ as opposed to ‘being compliant’, as well as avoiding legal scrutiny, run the risk of venturing into the world of Humpty Dumpty- enabling states to maintain that words (laws) mean just what they say they mean. This was arguably the underlying ethos of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024.

Returning, however, to the question of family life, the Wolfson Report states (at [45]) that ‘courts have given an extremely broad interpretation to the scope of the concept of “family life” to include relationships between siblings (including adult siblings); aunts or uncles and nephews or nieces; and grandparents and grandchildren.’ Yet any suggestion that the ECtHR accords a broad interpretation to family life in the immigration context is untenable. This is evident if one looks at the ECtHR’s case law and compares it with the three cases cited in the Wolfson report, namely Boughanemi v France; Boyle v United Kingdom; and Marckx v Belgium. None are recent cases and two of the three cases are not even immigration cases (Boyle was a child custody case, while Marckx was about state recognition of the relationship between a mother and her child). It is true that Boughanemi concerned deportation but the ECtHR has clarified in subsequent case law that adult children only have ties with their parents where there is the requisite level of dependency. In fact the ECtHR’s threshold for establishing family life beyond the core or nuclear family (spouses and children that have not yet come of age) is very high and is centred around the concept of dependency (a concept that does not feature in the Wolfson report).

This concept can, however, be seen in Kumari v. the Netherlands and Martinez Alvarado v. the Netherlands. Those judgments were handed down some nine months prior to the Wolfson report, but they were by no means the first occasion on which the Court has stated that: ‘there can be no family life between parents and their adult children or adult siblings unless they could demonstrate “additional elements of dependence, involving more than normal emotional ties”’. Moreover, the severity of the threshold for dependency was already evident in cases such as Savran v Denmark, where an applicant who was receiving treatment for paranoid schizophrenia could not rely upon his close ties with his mother and siblings in order to establish family life. It can also be seen in Senchishak v Finland, where family ties could not be established between an elderly mother who had suffered a stroke and her daughter who was her only surviving relative.

As for the interpretation given by our domestic courts, the single case cited by the Wolfson Report (at [45] fn.75) in support of the claim that a broad approach to family life operates is IA v SSHD, a case which concerned a family from Gaza that sought reunification with a family member in the UK. This case received considerable political attention after it was embroiled in a back-and-forth in Parliament between Kemi Badenoch and the Prime Minister. The application in IA was rejected by the Home Office, following which the First Tier Tribunal found that, although there was family life, this could not outweigh the weight to be attached to the public interest. This was subsequently overturned by the Upper Tribunal, which found flaws in the way in which the judge assessed the significance to be accorded to family life when carrying out the balancing exercise. Given Kemi Badenoch’s views on IA it is not surprising that it made its way into the Wolfson Report. What is surprising, however, is that the Wolfson Report did not mention that permission to appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal in May 2025, precisely in order to enable the court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family. The appeal was heard in the Court of Appeal in November and a judgment is pending.

This is the political backdrop to the Government’s proposal, and it will be interesting to see how it develops in the coming months. In particular, we will need to look closely at precisely how the Government intends to define family life. When the Home Secretary made her statement in Parliament announcing the policy she stated that the Government will define ‘what, exactly, a family is – narrowing it down to parents and their children’. This, however, is a narrower approach to family life than that stated in the policy document which provides that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. If family life is strictly limited to parents and children, as the Home Secretary suggests, then this would be in conflict with Article 8 ECHR. If, however, the Government proceeds with the model set out in its policy document then this could align with what the ECtHR currently provides (namely, additional elements of dependence, involving more than normal emotional ties) in which case there is arguably no change at all other than putting this interpretation on a legislative footing. Alternatively, the Government’s notion of an ‘exceptionally close link’ could bring into play different values from ‘dependency’. I have written in my chapter on immigration in a book that I recently co-authored with Stevie Martin and Stephanie Palmer that the ECtHR’s approach suggests that family ties are ‘only established where there is extensive physical and financial dependency. Indicating that the ECtHR approaches dependency as if something akin to an infantile relationship within a stable family set-up is required.’ Dependency for the ECtHR thus suggests a hierarchical relationship based on vulnerability and need, whereas the Government’s concept of ‘exceptionally close link’ may place the emphasis on strong emotional ties without the need for dependency. In this respect the Government’s proposed definition could in fact encompass a different, and potentially broader category of persons than those recognised by the ECtHR. This is clearly not what is intended.

We thus await further details in respect of these proposals, draft legislation and a section 19 HRA statement in respect of such legislation. These proposals will be subject to immense scrutiny, and clarity will be demanded as to precisely how the proposed changes are going to operate in ways that ensure that domestic law remains, as this Government intends, compatible with the ECHR.

The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.
Erin Foote, a union board member for California State Employees Union: “I am mad.","A San Francisco state senator unveiled legislation Tuesday that aims to give Californians the right to seek damages from federal agents, as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement across the U.S.

The bill authored by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat and congressional hopeful, would enable people to file a lawsuit or seek redress against local, state and federal officers for violating their constitutional rights.

Wiener, at a press conference: “This (federal) administration is attempting to wield unchecked power to illegally kidnap and deport people, to punish the administration’s political opponents using government resources, to freeze university funding and to fire thousands of federal workers en masse.”

The measure works to promote what’re known as Bivens lawsuits, a precedent established by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1971, which permits individuals to sue federal officers for violating their constitutional rights. But in the years since, the high court has curtailed Bivens actions, making it difficult for people to bring forth claims and recover damages.

In October ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained during immigration sweeps — some of whom were reportedly beaten and shot. Little recourse is available for victims, though in a rare case, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department arrested a federal immigration enforcement officer last week after he held a teenage boy at gunpoint and detained him.

Wiener’s proposal comes a day after the Trump administration filed a lawsuit to block a new California law written by Wiener that bans law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned other agencies that criminals have posed as immigration agents to carry out crimes, but the U.S. Department of Justice said California’s law threatens the safety of federal officers.

The California State University’s board of trustees plans to vote today on whether to change the university system’s executive pay structure in a way that would boost their wages — a potential overhaul that has drawn blowback from Cal State’s unionized staff and faculty, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.

Currently, Cal State caps the base pay of its 22 campus presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made. Raises for sitting presidents are also no higher than 10%. The average base pay for presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000.

But Cal State says the policy leads to uncompetitive compensation. Trustees are deciding on a plan that would raise the executive base pay (along with overall wage increases for other Cal State workers), and add a 15% incentive-based pay bump that executives would be eligible for.

The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.

Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund manager, said today that he is running to be California’s next governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.

Steyer kicked off his campaign with a video where he pledges to preserve the state as a place for business and innovation, while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share.”

Steyer: “The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. Californians deserve a life they can afford.”

The mega-donor for California Democrats spent more than $12.8 million in support of Proposition 50, making him the second-largest independent ad buyer in state history. As an outspoken critic of Trump, Steyer poured millions in a national ad campaign that advocated for the president’s impeachment during his first term. Steyer also ran for president in 2020 before ultimately dropping out of the race.

Federal authorities are denying more of certain work visas and green cards, vetting professionals’ social media platforms, and applying enhanced scrutiny to foreign employees’ credentials and work plans in the United States, according to interviews with 15 immigration attorneys, a federal official and three policy analysts. Visa holders also have been subject to more searches, interrogations and denials of entry at airports and border crossings, as well as deportation proceedings and visits to their employers by federal agents, the attorneys and experts said.

The administration this year rolled out a travel ban on 19 countries, a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, and mandatory in-person interviews for most business and temporary work visa applicants at U.S. consulates in their home countries - a policy change that lawyers say could lead to longer wait times.

Officials also announced a “continuous vetting” policy aimed at all 55 million U.S. visa holders.

For foreign professionals, the crackdown has meant new levels of anguish and fear - indefinite separation from partners and children living in the United States, termination of employment offers, lost income and dashed opportunities.

“My patients are also suffering, and I’m suffering,” said Mustafa Alawad, a 27-year-old Sudanese doctor in Cairo, who was denied a visa after receiving a job offer from an internal medicine residency program at a community hospital in Huntsville, Alabama. The Trump administration denied him a visa because of a ban on visitors from Sudan. So Alawad has been unable to join his fiancée, a dentist, who is already in the United States.

Apple, Accenture, Lyft, Snapchat, Advanced Micro Devices, Pinterest, Silicon Laboratories, Rambus and Datadog have all warned for the first time in recent weeks that the new immigration and visa policies imperil their corporate performance, a review of earnings calls and quarterly reports by The Washington Post found. None of the companies responded to requests for comment.

“Laws and regulations, including immigration,” could “materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled, global workforce,” Apple told investors on Oct. 31. Hospitality and biotechnology firms issued similar alerts.

The State Department has not released data on visa issuances since May, and the latest data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which tracks visa applications and denials, is from June. The available data does not show any notable shift in the number of work visa applications and denials compared with last year, but attorneys say some of the crackdown began more recently.

Major groups representing U.S. employers, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Society for Human Resource Management, declined to comment or did not respond to questions. But the chamber sued the Trump administration last month over its $100,000 H-1B visa fee, in its first lawsuit against this administration.

“This stringent enforcement and stringent examination of what has always been perfectly legal visa categories is new,” said Jeff Joseph, president of American Immigration Lawyers Association. “But companies are too afraid to go out there and say, ‘Look what’s happening.’ … Companies are relying on litigation from the chamber and trade orgs to avoid retaliation.”

Kimberley Best Robidoux, a lawyer at WR Immigration in San Diego, said that after President Donald Trump took office this year, there was an uptick in deportation proceedings against foreign professionals on work visas during what had typically been a 60-day grace period for those switching employers or changing their immigration status.

“We have definitely seen the administration turn the benefits-based visa programs into enforcement tools,” Robidoux said. “This administration is using all the tools in their toolbox in a way where previously the prior administrations may have been using more discretion.”

The administration says these changes are intentional.

“Since day one, President Trump has been clear that he will put Americans first by tightening our immigration laws to ensure that our workers are not displaced, companies are not offshoring labor, and our national security is not compromised,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to The Post. “The heightened scrutiny in the visa approval process is an administration-wide effort to implement President Trump’s America First agenda, a mandate from nearly 80 million Americans who were tired of being sidelined by the Democrats.”

The State Department is applying more scrutiny across the board rather than cracking down on specific work visa types and regions, a senior department official told The Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity to brief the media. The official said the administration is taking security and public safety seriously, including looking at things like drunken driving and assault charges. Authorities are using social media vetting and other tools in new ways to catch these issues, the official said.

“We don’t see scrutiny as a bad word. … Compared to previous administrations, we do have more scrutiny. National security is more of a priority than ever,” the official said.

The State Department is also scouring for visa fraud because some companies or individuals have applied for business visas, known as B-1s, instead of H-1Bs, even when that was not appropriate. Business visas are unlimited, while H-1Bs are capped.

Despite the new scrutiny, the official told The Post, interview wait times were down in many nations and 80 percent of countries had wait times of 60 days or less for a visa appointment.

Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement to The Post that the agency conducts deportation proceedings and unannounced worksite visits “to restore integrity and ensure the security of our nation’s immigration system.” It added: “The agency is committed to using its [Notices to Appear] authorities against removable aliens and denying or revoking H-1B petitions of those who refuse to comply with site visits.”

Immigration lawyers said professional visa categories appear to be receiving more scrutiny and denials than others, including temporary nonimmigrant visas for high-skilled professionals, such as H-1Bs, J-1s, L-1s and O-1s. The latter is nicknamed the “genius visa” and is designated for individuals of “extraordinary ability” in the sciences, arts, athletics, business and other areas.

The crackdown - heightened denials and enhanced vetting and questioning - has also hit employment-based green cards, including EB-1s, a category for foreigners with extraordinary abilities, three lawyers told The Post, affecting top scientists and engineers working in artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, payment systems, defense and cybersecurity.

“We’re seeing cases denied for people who build the systems our economy runs on,” said Sameer Khedekar, an immigration lawyer in Silicon Valley. “These are the people who are building the products that hundreds of millions of users use.”

Immigration officials denied one top software engineer at Capital One an EB-1 visa in August, according to a copy of his lawsuit against the government, which was reviewed by The Post. The engineer, an Indian national, had lived in the United States for years, performing “a critical role” in “the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI-driven financial technologies,” the suit said. He had also written articles for scientific journals, peer-reviewed research and judged prestigious contests in his field. Capital One declined to comment.

Applicants from countries identified by the State Department as national security threats, including China, Iran and Venezuela, also are seeing heightened vetting, lawyers said.

For companies, the scrutiny has resulted in delays in project development and hiring, and increased costs associated with managing visa uncertainties, said Alexander Jovy, a lawyer at Global Immigration Partners, who specializes in business visas. Some firms have shifted their hiring plans as a result. Meanwhile, foreign professionals working in the United States have expressed reluctance to travel internationally because of fears about being barred from reentry into the country.

“The United States is the market where people want to start businesses and want to be innovative and be pushing the envelope,” said Cecilia Esterline, immigration analyst at the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank in Washington. “And if we lose the people who are able to do that, I think we risk our stature internationally, our competitiveness.”

Jeremy Beck, co-president of NumbersUSA, a group that lobbies for restricting immigration, supports the Trump administration’s narrowing of legal immigration programs, especially amid a souring economy and mounting layoffs.

“The case for large-scale guest worker programs, temporary work visas and permanent work visas is as weak now as it’s been since at least the Great Recession,” Beck said. “They are restoring credibility to the system, increasing the public’s trust that the system is working as it should. Those are good things. But it’s not clear that it’s going to radically change the numbers.”

Still, the administration has sent mixed messages. Last week Trump partially defended the H-1B program in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, saying, “You also do have to bring in talent.”

“You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory, we’re going to make missiles,’” Trump said. “It doesn’t work that way.”

Sharadha Kodem, an immigration lawyer in Irving, Texas, who files work visa petitions mostly for Indian and Southeast Asian nationals, said three of her clients on valid H-1B visas were denied entry by U.S. customs agents after they had been temporarily working remotely in their home country to deal with a family or medical emergency. They have been unable to return to the United States, where they have spouses and children and own homes.

“This didn’t happen under Biden,” Kodem said. “We came out of the first term of the Trump administration going through hell and beyond for our clients. Then it was much more relaxed during the Biden administration, and now the crackdown has started again.”

The resolution follows weeks of residents voicing concerns about police actions and involvement with federal immigration enforcement activities.

“This isn't the finish line. This is the starting line,” Mayor Jim Schwantz assured the crowd in the council chambers. “We're going to continue to build on this going forward.”

In addition to the resolution, Village Manager Reid Ottesen announced several steps the village is taking to rebuild trust with its immigrant community.

He said officers will now ask federal agents for identification and verification of which agency they represent.

The village also launched a bilingual webpage (English and Spanish) with information about immigration rights, resources and frequently asked questions.

Deputy Police Chief David Brandwein will lead efforts to meet with community members to explore ways the village can nurture its relationship with the entire community.

Council Member Joe Falkenberg addressed perceptions of inaction by the council by saying he has reached out to residents who spoke up at recent meetings.

Schwantz said some will think the resolution doesn’t go far enough, while others will think it goes too far.

That was reflected in the public comment at Monday’s meeting.

Palatine area resident Valeria Delgado, a daughter of immigrants, a graduate of Fremd High School and Harper College with a master’s degree from Loyola University, illustrated the climate of fear generated by the presence of federal agents.

She said one father of three, whose 3-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with autism, now shops for groceries only after 11 p.m.

She also mentioned the plight of a woman whose daughter is completing her confirmation at a local Catholic church. She said they have had to miss Mass due to reports of federal agents in the area.

“Their human right to go to church has been currently violated,” she said. “Just let that sink in a little bit.”

Palatine resident Laura Hernandez called the resolution a good first step but said she wants to see more engagement with the Hispanic community.

“Passing a resolution is just a paper,” she said. “We need more doing and less talking.”

But Palatine resident Frank Skorski argued that illegal means illegal.

“For some reason, the federal government and the state of Illinois has decided that people who come here illegally deserve certain rights. I disagree. They don’t deserve any rights,” he said.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=068ed642-00da-5e29-b20e-05b298b79cb6&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-11-19 12:57:19.794947

Impact of fee increases New fees for asylum applications or increases to already established fees have become a fixture of immigrant policy in Trump’s second term.
Citizenship and Immigration Service reported it had 1,446,908 pending affirmative asylum applications at the end of 2024.","When President Donald Trump signed “The Big Beautiful Bill” into law in July, the massive legislation included an overhaul of several immigration-related fees for applications and forms commonly used to seek asylum, appeal court decisions and apply for work permits.

The fee increases and the establishment of new ones are part of the Trump administration’s sweeping changes to the immigration system.

The cost of appealing an immigration judge decision rose from $110 to $900, while the fee for people seeking temporary protected status jumped from $50 to $500.

To some Indiana immigration attorneys, the immigration-related fee increases or new fees came with seemingly no warning and appeared to be more of a deterrent to immigration than a way to cover agency costs.

John Broyles, a partner with Indianapolis-based Broyles & Ricafort, PC, said he had several questions and concerns regarding the fee increases.

“What was wrong with the original fees? Were they not covering the costs?” Broyles said.

Broyles said there was no analysis provided or any explanation he had seen as to why there needed to be fee increases, something he believes is being done to disincentivize people from applying for asylum or filing other immigration-related applications.

Some fees are five times higher than before, he noted.

Sarah Burrow, director at Lewis & Kappes, called the fee increases “devastating” and “terrible,” with an impact felt by the most vulnerable population.

Burrow said her firm has clients in court that have been in federal custody and not able to work, with their families hit with as much as $1,500 in additional fees.

For someone filing an asylum application fee, the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill changed the application from being free to carrying a $100 cost.

“$100 is a lot of money, especially for someone who may be a new arrival,” Burrow said, adding, “there is nothing beautiful about what this administration is doing in the context of immigration, not a single thing.”

In late October, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued an order in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al. temporarily staying the annual asylum fee, according to the USCIS.

Impact of fee increases

New fees for asylum applications or increases to already established fees have become a fixture of immigrant policy in Trump’s second term.

Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation included imposing a $100,000 annual fee on new H-1B visas and rolled out a $1 million “gold card” visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.

Like the asylum fee, the H-1B visa fee drew its own legal challenge.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration, alleging that Trump’s new $100,000 visa fees for the H-1B program, widely used by Silicon Valley, violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C..

About 85,000 new H-1B visas have been available each year, although Congress exempts universities from that cap, with the government receiving about 425,000 H-1B visa petitions in 2024.

By comparison, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service reported it had 1,446,908 pending affirmative asylum applications at the end of 2024.

Burrow said the rise in asylum application fees are most often mentioned by clients.

She said she didn’t think anyone could have anticipated such large fee increases or the imposition of fees for applications that previously had no cost attached.

The Lewis & Kappes attorney also noted that USCIS announced it was phasing out check and money order payments.

USCIS announced in August it would accept only ACH debit transactions or credit card payments after Oct. 28.

“We have a responsibility to the American people to operate as efficiently and securely as possible,” said USCIS Spokesman Matthew Tragesser in a news release. “Over 90% of our payments come from checks and money orders, causing processing delays and increasing the risk of fraud and lost payments. America deserves better, and we intend to deliver.”

Broyles said he had a client in a non-lawful permanent resident cancellation case who paid a $130 filling fee prior to the Big Beautiful Bill’s passage.

He said if the client, who won her case, filed the case today, she would have to pay $1,630.

“I’m not sure my client could afford that,” Broyles said.

Broyles stressed that he has been practicing for 27 years and has seen periodic fee adjustments, but not something as dramatic as fee disparities with the aforementioned case.

“They’re a lot. It’s all just the overall plan of this administration to discourage people at any means to remain here,” Broyles said.•",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/immigration-law.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:21.954016

In her morning news conference on Tuesday, Sheinbaum was asked about Trump’s statements a day prior, when he expressed displeasure with Mexico and mused about taking forceful action.

“It’s not going to happen,” Sheinbaum replied in Spanish.

She proceeded to explain that she had made her position clear “many times” in telephone conversations with Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio.

“He has suggested on several occasions or has said, ‘We offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico or whatever you need to combat criminal groups,'” she explained.

While she said she would accept collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the US military, she repeated her stance that no outside intervention would be allowed on Mexican soil.

“We do not accept an intervention by any foreign government,” Sheinbaum continued. “I’ve told him on the phone. I’ve said it with the State Department, with Marco Rubio.”

A response to Trump

Her comments come on the heels of an Oval Office meeting between Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Monday. The Republican president used the public appearance to address his expanding military campaign against drug cartels and criminal networks in Latin America.

When a reporter asked if he was considering “potentially launching strikes in Mexico”, Trump answered in the affirmative.

“To stop drugs? It’s OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said. “I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. This is some big problems over there.”

He then made a reference to the US bombing campaign that began on September 2.

At least 21 deadly missile strikes have been conducted against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing 83 people.

United Nations officials and other legal experts have denounced the military campaign as an illegal form of extrajudicial killing.

Trump, however, suggested the campaign could eventually include strikes on land-based targets in Mexico.

“ If we had to, would we do there what we’ve done to the waterways? You know, there’s almost no drugs coming into our waterways any more,” Trump continued.

“ Would I do that on the land corridors? I would absolutely. Look, every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives, not to mention the destruction of families.”

While Trump has repeatedly used that number — 25,000 — to justify the boat bombing campaign, there is no factual basis for that figure.

Provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that fatal drug overdoses have declined in recent years, with 73,960 deaths recorded during the 12-month period ending in April.

The Trump administration has also provided no definitive evidence to prove who was on board the bombed vessels, nor that they were linked to drug trafficking.

The identities of the victims remain largely unknown, though families in countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have asserted that their loved ones disappeared after the attacks. Some have claimed their relatives were only fishermen.

Two survivors were repatriated in October, one to Colombia and another to Ecuador, the latter of which released the man without charging him with a crime.

Trump has long threatened to broaden his bombing campaign to include land-based targets. But he declined to say whether he would ask permission before striking Mexico, should he choose to do so.

“ I wouldn’t answer that question,” he told a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday. “I’ve been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand.”

He later added, “ Let me just put it this way. I am not happy with Mexico.”

Framing cartels as ‘enemy combatants’

Since taking office for a second term, Trump has claimed extraordinary powers to justify his increasingly aggressive actions against drug cartels, going so far as to claim the US is in a state of war with traffickers.

Only Congress can formally declare war in the US. But in August, Trump reportedly signed a secret order allowing the military to take action against the cartels, leading to renewed fears in Mexico.

Sheinbaum, at the time, told her constituents there would be “no invasion”.

Then, on October 2, Trump issued a memo to Congress asserting that Latin American cartels were “enemy combatants” in a “non-international armed conflict”, laying out his administration’s legal argument for the ongoing attacks in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump has also categorised various drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” throughout his second term, though that designation alone does not justify military action under international and domestic law.

In Monday’s Oval Office remarks, Trump reiterated his position that he viewed the US as being in an armed conflict.

“ We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They’re killing our people. That’s like a war,” Trump said.

The US has a long and controversial history of military intervention in Latin America, and in recent years, there has been renewed interest on the US right to send armed forces into Mexico.

In 2023, for example, then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, a prominent Republican leader, said he would deploy US special forces across the border to Mexico to fight drug-trafficking cartels.

“And I will do it on day one,” DeSantis told Fox News at the time, musing on his plans for the presidency.

Fears that Trump could spearhead such an action stretch back to his first term, from 2017 to 2021, when he first considered using the “foreign terrorist organisation” designation.

In November, DHS fast-tracked new policy giving federal officers greater authority to arrest protesters both on and off federal property.","PORTLAND, Ore. — Clouds of smoke. Tear gas. Pepper spray. For months, federal officers have used less-than-lethal weapons and tactics against protesters outside the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, facility in Portland.

Demonstrators accuse the officers of using excessive force and instigating confrontation. The federal government says it’s simply protecting its property.

But a closer look reveals something deeper — a little-known federal agency with broad authority and a system that allows the Department of Homeland Security to pull in elite, specially trained tactical teams to help police protesters.

At the center of the response is the Federal Protective Service, or FPS. The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for guarding federal buildings and ensuring the safety of employees and visitors.

In Portland, that means protecting the ICE facility. The government-leased building in the South Waterfront neighborhood has been the focal point of anti-ICE protests since early June.

Normally, there are four FPS inspectors, along with an undisclosed number of private security officers assigned to the Portland ICE office, according to the agency’s deputy regional director.

But over the past few months, the number of federal officers protecting the ICE building has surged to as many as 197 officers in a single 24-hour period, according to court records.

And the officers protecting the ICE building aren’t all FPS employees. Many came from other parts of DHS through what’s known as cross-designation. The mechanism allows FPS to bring in officers from other DHS agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Bureau of Prisons, and the Secret Service.

Video evidence indicates specially trained units such as U.S. Border Patrol BORTAC and a special response team from ICE have been on the ground in Portland.

Critics explain that many of these specially trained officers, who normally rely on military tactics, aren’t used to facing off with protesters.

“It actually creates a lot of danger and conflict, and that results in the various sorts of civil rights abuses and aggressive policing that we're seeing,” said Spencer Reynolds, formerly senior counsel in the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law and a former DHS intelligence attorney.

“These agents are not trained for crowd control,” Reynolds said. “They’re trained to go and do remote interdictions and the like.”

To better understand the crowd dynamics and interaction between protesters and federal officers, KGW reviewed dozens of video clips and social media posts. We spoke with eyewitnesses, listened to trial testimony and got a guided tour of the ICE facility — although access was limited.

Many nights outside the ICE facility in Portland follow a familiar pattern. Officers emerge from the front gate, then push out in a U shape or wedge formation, clearing the way for vehicles to enter or exit the ICE building.

Although protesters are sometimes antagonistic, video appears to show officers, at times, responding with disproportionate force.

On October 2, Leilani Payne stood in front of officers on the street after they cleared the exit, allowing a car to leave the property. She complied.

But after the 19-year-old allegedly shouted insults and swore at the officers, one of them blasted her with chemical spray in the face. Payne said she had trouble breathing and suffered burning in her eyes, ears and throat.

In some instances, federal officers appeared to attack when there was no apparent threat.

Videos show protesters who crossed the blue line marked “US Government, Do Not Block” being tackled by a team of officers.

On August 13, protester Daryn Herzberg was standing outside the driveway, when a federal officer tackled him from behind. His body slammed into the pavement from the unexpected shove. Smoke was deployed. Herzberg said he was taken into custody and cited for failure to comply.

In 2023, DHS updated to its use-of-force policy. It allows officers to use force “only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative” exists, and they can only use a level of force that is objectively reasonable.

On several nights, the policy appeared to be tested.

Officers blanketed the street with smoke and tear gas, used flash-bangs, pepper balls and other less-than-lethal munitions. Their actions often seemed to make the situation worse instead of calming it down.

On October 18, a large crowd of peaceful protesters gathered outside the ICE facility following a ""No Kings"" rally. KGW zoomed in and slowed down the video.

It showed a federal officer who fired a less-than-lethal round into the ground, ricocheting toward the ICE building. That triggered federal officers to deploy tear gas on the crowd. The intent of tear gas is dispersal, but misuse or abuse can cause injuries or inflame tensions even more.

KGW sent the Department of Homeland Security videos of the incidents described in this story. In response, a spokesperson issued a written statement.

“ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” the statement said. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”

As of mid-November, court records indicate federal prosecutors have charged 36 people with crimes related to the ICE facility in Portland since June. Some of those cases involved assaults on federal officers, arson and property damage.

Federal law gives U.S. Homeland Security broad authority to protect federal buildings, with no clear limit on how far off-site officers can operate.

On Sept. 30, video showed a team of 20 federal officers spread out on the street away from the building’s entrance. One protester was arrested, then dragged back toward the building. Later, that same video showed another large group of federal officers walking toward the ICE building. They too had made an arrest.

The video went on to show federal officers returning to the street and marching more than a block from the ICE building and out of camera view.

At the same time, Homeland Security has used helicopters and drones to circle overhead, frustrating neighbors and inflaming tensions.

The conflict over immigration policy and attempts by President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops helped mobilize a new strategy among protesters: inflatable costumes. But even those in costume have faced off with federal officers.

On Oct. 2, Seth Todd said he was peacefully protesting in a frog suit when an officer aimed chemical spray directly at his costume’s air vent.

Protesters and local officials accuse the federal government of abusing its authority.

On October 6, Portland city attorney Robert Taylor wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice. “In Portland, we appear to be witnessing the federal government engaging in unconstitutional uses of force in violation of the Fourth Amendment against otherwise peaceful demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights,” Taylor wrote.

Similar complaints were made during the 2020 racial justice protests in Portland, which centered around the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse.

A government audit by the DHS inspector general found that many of those federal officers deployed to Portland in 2020 were not sufficiently trained or prepared for the operation. Many of the same border and security forces have returned to Portland — this time to protect the ICE building.

“We can tell by the activities that are happening today that really not a lot has changed,” said Reynolds.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.
Executive order targeted benefits In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""
In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as public charge that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits.

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.

In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.

“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.

Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.

They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.

The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.

In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.

Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.

“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.

But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.

“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.

Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.

Knowing where a target will be

Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.

Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.

“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.

In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.

“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”

An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.

Trump’s National Guard deployments raise worries about state sovereignty

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.

Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.

Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.

Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.

Trump administration court actions

But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.

The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.

U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.

In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.

Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses

Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.

Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.

“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.

Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”

Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.

“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.

Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.

“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ice-courthouses1763546780.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=zzbtpd_2,N,,2025-11-19 14:58:11.380741

The University of Wisconsin-Madison Police are investigating stickers that appeared on campus encouraging violence against federal immigration agents.

Republicans are pointing to the imagery as another example of the hostile climate conservatives face on college campuses.

UW-Madison is removing the stickers and condemns violence of any kind, university spokesperson John Lucas said. He said he was aware of two or three stickers being removed.

One of the stickers showed a man wearing a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shirt and face mask, with red streaks that appear to be blood near his head. ""The only good fascist is a dead one,"" the text read.

Freshman William Hong spotted a sticker on a lamp post outside Memorial Library on Nov. 13. He said he was disgusted because he believed ICE in most cases is just trying to keep America safe. He ripped the sticker off but chalked it up as protected speech.

Hong is a board member of the UW-Madison chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September. He said the campus climate since then has been mixed, with some progressive students celebrating Kirk's death in chalk messages left around campus and others who were more respectful. He said most instructors have created an unwelcome environment in his classes, but many students are open to civil conversations.

Howard Schweber, a UW-Madison professor who is an expert in free speech, said the stickers were unlikely to be constitutionally protected expression. The question of criminal charges would hinge on whether the person putting up the stickers either intended for the work to be perceived as a threat or acted recklessly by taking the chance that it would be perceived that way.

""Ask yourself whether it is likely that an ICE agent seeing this sticker would feel threatened,"" he said. ""If that is likely, then it is not hard to say that the person putting up the sticker was at least reckless about the possibility that a threat would be perceived.""

Schweber said the state would have a strong case for a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge. He was less sure about a new law adopted in February making it a felony to threaten judges or law enforcement officers because it seemed to need to be directed at a specific individual or group.

""That might be a question Wisconsin courts have to figure out,"" he said.

There’s a chance the stickers could reach a criminal level if they cause extensive damage to property, UW-Madison Police spokesperson Marc Lovicott said, but the incidents reported so far appear to be misdemeanor vandalism cases.

The imagery was first reported by the Madison Federalist, a new student newspaper.

Both Republicans running for governor condemned the sticker on X, formerly Twitter. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said UW-Madison ""cannot keep quiet and pretend it's normal"" Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann said he wasn't surprised by the rhetoric and said it degraded the state flagship's reputation.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged an arrest detainer for Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez, a twice deported criminal illegal alien from Honduras and repeat sex offender, convicted of indecent exposure in 2018 and now facing charges of cruelty toward a child and lewd or lascivious acts with a minor.

Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez

Local investigators caught Velasquez Gomez on a Medford, New York TJ Maxx surveillance camera system, groping multiple young girls between the ages of 7 and 11, and touching his genitals in the store over the course of several months. During the three separate recorded incidents, child victims were allegedly touched and squeezed on their buttocks by the pedophile when they stepped a short way from their parents while in the store.

The 7-year-old victim asked permission to look around the toy aisle to which her mother agreed. As she stood in the aisle, Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez walked toward her and allegedly touched and squeezed her buttocks with his hand.

The 11-year-old victim was with her parents in the store and walked a short distance away to look for a gift for a friend. She observed a man holding his genitals through his clothes. A short time later, the illegal alien allegedly walked toward her and grabbed her buttocks with his hand as he passed.

The 9-year-old victim was shopping with her mother and asked permission to look around the toy aisle while her mother was at the end of that same aisle looking at clothes. Jimmy Harry Velasquez Gomez allegedly approached the child, pulling up the bottom of her sweatshirt, and squeezing her buttocks.

“The accounts of these child victims are sickening-- this serial child molester stole the innocence of his child victims and terrorized families,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This is exactly who we mean when we say we’re targeting the WORST OF THE WORST criminal illegal aliens terrorizing our communities. President Trump’s administration removed this pedophile in 2019. Following his illegal reentry into the country and recent arrest for sex crimes against children, ICE lodged an arrest detainer with local authorities to ensure he is never released onto American streets to prey on more innocent children. Secretary Noem will not allow pedophiles to victimize innocent children.”

Velasquez Gomez was initially encountered by U.S. Border Patrol in April of 2005 near Cotulla, Texas, and was removed from the United States on May 12, 2005. He committed a felony by illegally reentering the U.S. and was removed by the Trump administration in 2019. He has since committed another felony by illegally re-entering the U.S. for a third time at an unknown time and location.

DHS law enforcement is committed to protecting American communities every day from another senseless tragedy like this taking place in another town, to another family.

But for both of these U.S. citizens, the trauma lingers.","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

As President Trump expands his aggressive immigration crackdown to more cities across the country, dozens if not hundreds of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents had been detained or arrested and sometimes held for days. NPR's Adrian Florido recently spoke with two of them about their experience.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: It's been five months since Javier Ramirez, a U.S. citizen, was tackled and arrested by immigration agents, but he still wakes up in the middle of the night gasping for breath, pumping his fists into the air as if he's fighting off an attacker.

JAVIER RAMIREZ: Panic attacks. I still feel that fear, you know, that it might happen again just for looking Mexican or, you know, Latino. They could again come up to me and just start questioning me.

FLORIDO: On June 12, masked Border Patrol agents out patrolling for immigrants to arrest walked into the auto junkyard east of Los Angeles where Ramirez was working. He saw them from the other side of the junkyard and walked through rows of broken cars to get to them.

RAMIREZ: I actually didn't see the guns or anything like that until literally I was literally close to them. That's when I'm like, oh, OK. Wow, people with guns? That means no, you know? Don't get close. You know, raise your hands.

FLORIDO: A security camera captured what Ramirez says is an agent telling him, in vulgar Spanish, don't be an idiot. Do you all have papers?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Spanish).

FLORIDO: Then he alleges he heard one of the agents say to another one...

RAMIREZ: I just hear him, like, hey, just get him. He's Mexican. And that's when they threw me down to the ground.

FLORIDO: Ramirez struggled and pleaded to be let go. The agents moved him and other workers out to the sidewalk as a crowd gathered. His brother heard the commotion from his own tow truck yard down the street and came over and started to film.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He's a USA citizen, my man.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, he's a U.S. citizen.

RAMIREZ: We're all U.S. citizens.

FLORIDO: The agents loaded Ramirez into a van. He recalls how he managed to use his cellphone to call local police despite being handcuffed.

RAMIREZ: I'm calling 911. Hey, what's your emergency? Like, hey, I'm being kidnapped. I'm in a black van.

FLORIDO: He says the dispatcher told him police had already been called about this but couldn't help because these were federal agents.

RAMIREZ: I'm like, if they are, I'm a U.S. citizen. Why would they take a U.S. citizen?

FLORIDO: Ramirez was held in a downtown LA prison for more than four days. He was charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer. But the charge was later dropped. Ramirez believes agents fabricated it to cover up for racially profiling him.

RAMIREZ: They pretty much seem like - you know what? - he's a U.S. citizen. We messed up. So in order for them to not look bad, they amended these accusations.

FLORIDO: Ramirez's lawyer is Michael Carrillo. He's also representing 10 other U.S. citizens or green card holders who've been arrested or detained by immigration agents. They're each seeking a million dollars in damages from the federal government.

MICHAEL CARRILLO: What's happening is that the Latino community - especially those with darker skin like myself, maybe that speak Spanish, listen to Spanish music - we are being racially profiled. What we've seen in these cases is that they stop, they detain people, sometimes arrest them, detain them for days and then ask questions later. That's not right.

FLORIDO: In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said allegations that its agents racially profile are, quote, ""disgusting, reckless and categorically false."" The department does not release data on how many U.S. citizens it has detained or arrested. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem recently denied that any have been rounded up.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KRISTI NOEM: There's no American citizens have been arrested or detained. We focus on those that are here illegally. And anything that you would hear or report that would be different than that is simply not true and false reporting.

CARRILLO: Totally false. It's just wrong. If she were to call my office and talk to these 10, 11 citizens that we represent, they would say, hey, I've been detained. I've been arrested. I've been thrown in custody for five days. So, to me, it was an outrage to hear that.

FLORIDO: Last month, reporting by ProPublica found at least 170 U.S. citizens who'd been detained or arrested, though it was likely an undercount. Since then, there's been reports of others. Many have been let go within minutes or hours. Others have been arrested and held for days. Lawsuits alleging racial profiling and rights violations are piling up. Carrillo says he's outraged by the racism he says he sees - ICE and Border Patrol agents raiding places like car washes and Home Depots because they assume they'll find immigrants working there, using the fact that someone speaks Spanish to justify their suspicion that someone is here illegally.

CARRILLO: It's just like Andrea. They detained her and immediately started speaking Spanish to her.

FLORIDO: He's talking about Andrea Velez. In late June, her mother dropped her off at her job at a shoe company in downtown Los Angeles, just as immigration agents were raiding street vendors nearby. She looked up and saw a masked agent wearing a Hawaiian shirt running toward her as he chased someone.

ANDREA VELEZ: And that's when he grabbed me and he slammed me to the sidewalk. I just remember the impact of how hard it was because it took me a while to get up.

FLORIDO: The agent arrested her. As he restrained her, she says a bystander began recording.

VELEZ: He was filming, and he says, I'm going live. So that's when I proceeded to say my name and that I was a U.S. citizen. And then I even said my mother's name because I knew that maybe she was wondering - I was probably not going to come home that night.

FLORIDO: The agent who arrested her, and another one, drove Velez to the same downtown prison that Javier Ramirez had been taken to.

VELEZ: Once we got into the parking structure, they started talking to me in Spanish like they had not heard me before speak English. And I was like, I speak English, too.

FLORIDO: Velez was charged with assault on a federal officer and held for two days. Like Ramirez, the charge against her was eventually dropped. But for both of these U.S. citizens, the trauma lingers.

VELEZ: I still have a little bit of trouble just going outside by myself. Like, they could come, like, at any moment and just attack you again. And just trying to cope with, like, the anger of why? Why did it happen? Because it's not supposed to happen here.

FLORIDO: She started seeing a therapist to cope. Javier Ramirez did, too. He says his family's humor is also helping.

RAMIREZ: I have one of my cousins right now, and he's like, every time, hey, I brought you your soda just how you like it, without ice. So, you know, it's (laughter) - now they...

FLORIDO: But Ramirez is angry. He says his rights were violated.

RAMIREZ: ...You know, as U.S. citizens. And that's what actually makes me mad, you know, 'cause what's the whole point of the Constitution if they're not gonna go by it?

FLORIDO: He knows it'll be hard to hold federal agents accountable through claims for damages or lawsuits, but he says he has to try. Adrian Florido, NPR News, Los Angeles.

ICE leads interior investigations and removals; Border Patrol stops illegal entry.

Border Patrol sits inside CBP; ICE operates as a separate DHS agency nationwide.

Both agencies can detain and arrest; uniforms can appear similar.

Immigration operations are on their fourth day in Charlotte, with more than 100 arrests reported so far, and they’re expected in Raleigh on Tuesday, Nov. 18.

While current activities have been attributed to both U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) interchangeably, the two agencies differ in a few key ways.

However, both are federal immigration-enforcement agencies under the Department of Homeland Security, they both have the authority to detain and arrest people for immigration violations and they wear similar uniforms, which can make it difficult for the public to distinguish between them.

But how are they different? Here’s what you need to know.

Are Border Patrol and ICE in Charlotte, Raleigh?

Yes, though ICE agents have been in Charlotte since earlier this year, The Charlotte Observer reported.

However, only Border Patrol has been linked to current immigration crackdown efforts in Charlotte. Border Patrol is also expected in Raleigh this week.

How is ICE different from Border Patrol?

There are three main ways ICE and Border Patrol differ:

Mission: ICE’s mission centers on criminal investigations, immigration enforcement and removal operations inside the U.S. rather than just at the border, according to the agency’s website. U.S. Border Patrol is specifically tasked with preventing illegal entry between ports of entry, intercepting people crossing the border and stopping smuggling of contraband.

Structure: Border Patrol is a subset of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which handles both customs and immigration at the border. ICE, on the other hand, is its own agency under the Department of Homeland Security.

Enforcement: Border Patrol agents are mainly involved in apprehending people as they attempt to cross the border or at checkpoints, whereas ICE’s role is more investigative and long-term, according to the Migration Policy Institute. They probe for document fraud, conduct I-9 audits of workplaces, detain people in interior facilities and carry out removals.

How is Border Patrol in NC if it’s not near a border?

Although North Carolina isn’t near an international border, customs and Border Patrol agents are still legally authorized to operate well inside the U.S., the Observer previously reported.

“Their ability to operate nationwide ensures border patrol can enforce immigration laws, combat smuggling and address national security threats anywhere in the United States,” Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman told the New York Times. “And that immigration enforcement is not limited to border regions when individuals who evade detection at the border can still be apprehended.”

They are scheduled to return toward the end of the month, with the full sweep beginning in early December.","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown dubbed “Swamp Sweep” that aims to arrest roughly 5,000 people across southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

The deployment, which is expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1, marks the latest escalation in a series of rapid-fire immigration crackdowns unfolding nationwide — from Chicago to Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina — as the Trump administration moves aggressively to fulfill the president’s campaign promise of mass deportations.

In Louisiana, the operation is unfolding on the home turf of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House’s enforcement agenda. But, as seen in other blue cities situated in Republican-led states, increased federal enforcement presence could set up a collision with officials in liberal New Orleans who have long resisted federal sweeps.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to run the Louisiana sweep, has become the administration’s go-to architect for large-scale immigration crackdowns — and a magnet for criticism over the tactics used in them. His selection to oversee “Swamp Sweep” signals that the administration views Louisiana as a major enforcement priority for the Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the operation. “For the safety and security of law enforcement we’re not going to telegraph potential operations,” spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.

In Chicago, Bovino drew a rare public rebuke from a federal judge who said he misled the court about the threats posed by protesters and deployed tear gas and pepper balls without justification during a chaotic confrontation downtown. His teams also oversaw aggressive arrest operations in Los Angeles and more recently in Charlotte, where Border Patrol officials have touted dozens of arrests across North Carolina this week after a surging immigration crackdown that has included federal agents scouring churches, grocery stores and apartment complexes.

Planning documents reviewed by the AP show Border Patrol teams preparing to fan out across neighborhoods and commercial hubs throughout southeast Louisiana, stretching from New Orleans through Jefferson, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes and as far north as Baton Rouge, with additional activity planned in southeastern Mississippi.

Agents are expected to arrive in New Orleans on Friday to begin staging equipment and vehicles before the Thanksgiving holiday, according to the people familiar with the operation. They are scheduled to return toward the end of the month, with the full sweep beginning in early December. The people familiar with the matter could not publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

To support an operation of that scale, federal officials are securing a network of staging sites: A portion of the FBI’s New Orleans field office has been designated as a command post, while a naval base five miles south of the city will store vehicles, equipment and thousands of pounds of “less lethal” munitions like tear gas and pepper balls, the people said. Homeland Security has also asked to use the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans for up to 90 days beginning this weekend, according to documents reviewed by the AP.

Once “Swamp Sweep” begins, Louisiana will become a major testing ground for the administration’s expanding deportation strategy, and a focal point in the widening rift between federal authorities intent on carrying out large-scale arrests and city officials who have long resisted them.

“The amici” are united by a shared goal which is to promote the welfare and safety of children and youth affected by immigration detention.
They include Children’s Defense Fund, the Kairos Center for Religion, Rights, and Social Justice, EdTrust–New York, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, and Children’s Rights.
Children’s Defense Fund-New York Director Khin Mai Aung said, “Immigration detention is no place for children and youth.","Five leading child advocacy organizations have filed an amicus brief in federal court supporting a Bronx teen from Ecuador who is currently being held by the United States Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). His case was heard at a White Plains federal court on Monday, Nov. 17. We’ve reached out to the advocates for an update on the latest court proceedings and will share any updates we receive.

Established as a part of the Refugee Act of 1980, ORR initially supported refugees, asylees, unaccompanied refugee minors, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. However, over time, as designated by Congress, ORR’s mission grew to serve many different populations from around the world.

In 2003, Congress expanded ORR’s role to serve unaccompanied alien children. Through the Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau, ORR provides for the care and custody of unaccompanied alien children who enter the United States from other countries without an adult guardian. ORR is legally required to provide for their care until they are placed with a vetted sponsor, usually a parent or relative, while their immigration cases proceed.

ORR also offers longer-term resettlement benefits and services to support arrivals’ successful transition to life in the U.S.

An amicus brief is a legal document submitted by a third party who is not involved in a lawsuit but has a strong interest in the case’s outcome. These “friend of the court” briefs typically provide additional legal arguments, and technical information or perspectives to help the court make a decision on a matter before it.

On October 23, according to advocates for the student, immigration officers detained the 16-year-old during a scheduled immigration check-in at 26 Federal Plaza, which he attended with his lawyer. They said he had been living in the Bronx with extended family following his mother’s decision to self-deport earlier this year.

The New York public high school student, an 11th grade English language learner, had previously been granted “Special Immigrant Juvenile” status by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in April, which provides a path to permanent residency.

EJCC v. Joyce, submitted by Children’s Defense Fund, the Kairos Center for Religion, Rights, and Social Justice, EdTrust–New York, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, and Children’s Rights, urges the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to grant the teen’s request for release from an ORR congregate care facility in The Bronx without restrictions on his liberty.

Attorneys Katherine Rosenfeld and Nick Bourland of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP filed the brief on behalf of the five organizations (“the amici”).

“The amici” are united by a shared goal which is to promote the welfare and safety of children and youth affected by immigration detention. Their work focuses on protecting minors from the serious harms of detention and safeguarding their educational rights. They include Children’s Defense Fund, the Kairos Center for Religion, Rights, and Social Justice, EdTrust–New York, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, and Children’s Rights.

The amicus brief and the teen’s attorneys, The Door’s Legal Services Center and the New York Civil Liberties Union, argue that the student’s unnecessary detention threatens to harm his mental health and education.

They said the teen is currently enrolled in classes at ReStart Academy, an alternative education program that partners with ORR. According to the academy’s website, it serves “the most vulnerable students” that “have become disengaged from school.” However, before his detention, they said the teen was performing at grade level, actively participating in school, and on track to graduate on time.

The organizations that filed the brief argue that, given his strong academic record, placing him in an alternative education program is inappropriate for his learning needs. “When children and young people are detained, including in ORR congregate facilities, and separated from their communities and schools, empirical research shows that such detention is deeply traumatizing and has long-term negative impacts on brain development and on that child’s trajectory through life,” the brief reads.

The five organizations share a common goal of promoting the welfare and safety of children affected by immigration detention say they bring decades of experience advocating for youth in these settings, and added that the purpose of the brief is to provide the court with accurate information about the harms suffered by detained children, including those held in ORR facilities.

They said that in a March letter to the Trump administration, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other national medical organizations concluded that “even short periods of detention can cause psychological trauma and long-term mental health risks” for children.

Children’s Defense Fund-New York Director Khin Mai Aung said, “Immigration detention is no place for children and youth. EJCC’s detention is especially harmful, as he is missing out on a critical part of junior year despite performing at grade level, and should be at home attending his community high school.”

Meanwhile, Children’s Rights Deputy Litigation Director Leecia Welch, said, “Children torn from their parents and communities and confined in isolating, dehumanizing facilities endure unspeakable trauma. The confinement of EJCC, who has a loving home waiting for him, is particularly cruel and must come to an end. Every minute children spend in these institutions is a minute too long, stealing vital time from their lives and futures.”

As Northwest Bronx Indivisible and some independent supporters recently participated in the “No Kings” Day rally in Midtown Manhattan on Oct. 18, in part protest at the handling of immigration policy by the Trump administration.

Daniel Guenzburger, one of the members spoke to Norwood News about the group’s opposition to deporting immigrants without due process and their active support for another young Bronx detained local student and immigrant, Dylan, a Marble Hill high school student at ELLIS Preparatory Academy who was taken into custody by law enforcement in May and held, as reported, despite public outcry.

Another female member of the group had also talked about the importance of solidarity with Dylan, saying, “Dylan, himself, continues to sit in that GO center in Moshannon in Pennsylvania.

Some protestors at the No Kings Day rally in Manhattan alleged the Trump administration quota for immigrants was getting smaller, compounding the difficulty for those applying for a visa.

See attached graph further below of immigration numbers under different administrations since 1850. It had been widely reported at one point that more deportations took place under the Obama administration than under the first Trump administration though this may change by the end of the second Trump administration. Click here for some further analysis of the topic.

As reported, the president, by way of another executive order, recently cracked down on future H1B visa applications, visas typically obtained by “alien nonimmigrant workers” sponsored by an employer in a niche industry sector like, for example, healthcare.

U.S. Customs and Border Control agents have been deployed in Wake and Durham counties.

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell confirmed multiple sightings of immigration enforcement agents in Raleigh and Durham at a city council meeting Tuesday afternoon.

Durham County Commissioner Nida Allam posted a video on social media that showed a confrontation with Border Patrol agents who were taking people into custody at a shopping center on Avondale Drive in Durham.

"" What I saw was painful and infuriating,"" Allam said at a press conference later that evening. ""Customs and Border Patrol agents were heavily armed, masks covering their faces, kidnapping three men right here in Durham, refusing to show a warrant, refusing to explain anything. They acted like they were in a war zone — not in a neighborhood where families were shopping and working. Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border. None of this was about securing our borders. None of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.""

Members of Siembra NC, an immigrant worker rights group, said there have been at least a dozen arrests made in the Triangle Tuesday. The group hosted a press conference with various community leaders at the All My Children child care center in Durham, where Border Patrol officials had been sighted in the parking lot, said Elisha Muhammad, the center's program director.

Muhammad said they told parents not to pick up their children and had the building under lockdown until 5 p.m.

""The school that we run — they're preschool, they're younger than preschool,"" she said. ""It's really sad they have to live in fear of attending school to be with their friends, to get their education.""

The actions in the Triangle follow immigration enforcement agents arresting more than 130 individuals in Charlotte last weekend. In an operation it calls ""Charlotte's Web,"" Department of Homeland Security claimed that 44 of them had criminal records.

As WFAE reported Monday, it is unclear how long the immigration enforcement operation surge will last in the Charlotte area and it's had a chilling effect in immigrant communities, prompting businesses to lock their doors and folks to stay home instead of going to school or work. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system reported nearly 21,000 absences on Monday.

""While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law. I can confirm that RPD has not participated in any immigration planning activities,"" Cowell said in a statement Monday night. ""Above all, Raleigh is a safe city, with crime down year-over-year. Public safety is a priority for me and this City Council.""

The Triangle branch of the Party for Socialism and Liberation announced Tuesday morning that they are organizing a rally at Moore Square in Raleigh at 5 p.m. to protest the presence of immigration enforcement activity in the area.

Gov. Josh Stein also released a statement that his office is aware of border control agents coming to Raleigh.

""Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,"" Stein posted on Facebook. ""Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.""

Other NC Democrats have released statements decrying immigration enforcement tactics, while state Republican leaders have expressed support for them.

The North Carolina Association of Educators, along with its Wake chapter, also called on state leaders to protect students and their families.

""We also must be clear about what is happening: the Trump Administration is intentionally stoking racial fear to push a billionaire-backed political agenda,"" the organization wrote in a statement Tuesday morning. ""Fear is being used as a tool to fracture working-class communities — to pit Black, Brown, and white families against one another. In Wake County, we refuse to let that strategy succeed. We are committed to building a multiracial working-class coalition that stands united to protect public school families and defend our community. When we stand together across race and background, fear loses its power.""

Emilin Gaona was behind the counter at La Zacatecana, a small, tidy, family-owned bodega. She said her family almost hadn’t opened the store this morning. A lot of their workers were too afraid to come in, she said, because of the news that the Border Patrol would be active in Raleigh.

Gaona said she and her mother decided to open anyway because many people in the community rely on the small store to pay bills and send money internationally. But she said they had had almost no business as of midday.

Gaona was born in the United States, but she’s still nervous about the federal agents.

“I was kind of scared to even drive over here because, like, they see you, they see brown, they’re stopping you,” Gaona told NC Newsline. “They don’t let you show your papers. They don’t really care about that. They just take you.”

Gaona’s 12-year-old sister is a U.S. citizen, too. She said her sister had seen what was happening on her phone and didn’t want to go to her Garner school this morning.

“She was crying because she was scared. She was afraid. And I get it, I understand,” Gaona said. “But we can’t really stop our lives either, and we just have to keep going.”

Next door, the Elvia hair salon was closed. Two doors down, the Tres Hermanos grocery store was open, but there wasn’t a single customer browsing its aisles or ordering at the meat counter. The manager declined to be interviewed, but said business was very, very slow.

It was the same story all across Garner, a working-class suburb of Raleigh with a sizable Latino population.

At the Home Depot, the contractor parking area – usually packed – was nearly empty. Most of the shops at the International Foods plaza, a major Latino shopping center, were closed at midday. A taekwondo studio had a sign in its window: “No class today and tomorrow due to the situation ongoing in our cities.”

NC Newsline asked Gov. Josh Stein Tuesday why he believes North Carolina is being targeted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Stein said he doesn’t know.

“We’ve reached out to the White House. We haven’t gotten any word,” Stein said after an event in Benson on Tuesday. “We’re not hearing directly from [U.S.] Customs and Border Patrol, so we don’t know for sure where they’re going, how long they’ll be here, where else they’re going.”

Stein, a Democrat, accused Border Patrol agents of “operating in the shadows” in the recent sweep in Charlotte.

“If this were targeted to going after known people who are criminals or known people who are drug traffickers who are engaged in violent crime, that would be a good thing,” Stein said. “But they’re just sweeping sidewalks. They’re sweeping parking lots. They’re going into stores and churches.”

“This is causing widespread fear, widespread uncertainty,” Stein added. “This is not about public safety.”

NC Newsline also asked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol why they’re targeting North Carolina. The agency did not immediately respond.

However, Greg Bovino, the commanding CBP agent who has led operations in Chicago and now Charlotte, has instead targeted Stein through social media posts and TV hits.

He accused the governor of using “heated rhetoric” in a Fox News appearance Tuesday. And he later reposted a video of a woman threatening agents with a screwdriver on X, writing: “Governor Stein, you caused this.”

“I put a lot of the blame on our elected leadership,” Bovino told Fox News.

Both the House and Senate acted decisively today to pass a bill forcing the Justice Department to release its files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The House approved the bill in a near-unanimous vote of 427-1. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was the lone “no” vote. Hours later, the Senate agreed with unanimous consent to pass the measure.

Lander was arrested with 10 state lawmakers on Sept. 18 by Department of Homeland Security Police after an hour-long standoff in the elevator bank of the 10th floor of the building, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement has several holding cells for recently detained immigrants.

Following an appearance in federal court Tuesday morning, federal prosecutors offered Lander and the other elected officials a deal to drop the obstruction charges against them if they avoid being arrested inside a federal building for six months, the lawmakers said.

While the state lawmakers agreed to the deal, Lander refused it.

“I believe the crime is not what we were doing. The crime on that day was on the other side of the 10th floor door, where ICE agents are keeping our neighbors in cruel detention conditions,” he said, speaking to a gaggle of reporters outside the federal courthouse after the appearance Tuesday. “That’s why we were there. That’s what we wanted to see.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately return a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Southern District of New York declined to comment.

Among those who agreed to the deal were left-leaning members of the legislature, including state senators Jabari Brisport, Gustavo Rivera and Julia Salazar and assemblymembers Emily Gallagher, Jessica Gonzalez Rojas, Marcela Mitaynes, Tony Simone and Claire Valdez.

“We were afforded due process today, but so many have been robbed of that right,” Valdez said, referring to ICE’s arrests of immigrants that have been spiking since May.

On the day of their arrests, Lander and the state lawmakers were demanding to inspect conditions of ICE’s holding cells, where THE CITY had reported on rampant overcrowding where detainees were described in one video as being held “like dogs in here.”

A federal judge’s order in August, however, appears to have improved conditions for detainees and restricted the number of people ICE can keep there at once.

“New York City’s more than three million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality, and success.
Meanwhile, other New York elected officials vowed not to be intimidated by Homan or the Trump administration.
“It’s just a continuation of absolutely draconian immigration enforcement from this federal administration.
“New Yorkers are not going to allow Tom Homan and his brown shirted ICE agents to occupy our city with impunity,” said the outgoing comptroller.","Tom Homan, President Trump’s border czar, said on Tuesday that he will be ramping up ICE’s operations in New York “soon” beyond the courtroom hallways of 26 Federal Plaza.

Homan made the ominous statement during a Nov. 18 appearance on Fox News, during which he said that he himself would be coming to the Big Apple in the “near future.”

“I plan on being in New York City in the near future. We are going to do operations in New York City,” Homan said. “We will be coming to New York City; we are already there now, but we will increase the enforcement presence in New York City again because they are a sanctuary city, and we know that we have an issue there.”

The Trump administration has long opposed New York City’s sanctuary status because it limits local agency cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts.

This comes on the heels of last month’s ICE raid along Canal Street in Chinatown that saw a slew of vendors arrested along with four American citizens who were cuffed by federal agents as a spontaneous protest erupted over the detainments.

Residents have also reported an increased sightings of masked men, presumably ICE agents, dragging people off the street and shoving them into unmarked vehicles.

Mamdani team pushes back on Homan’s ICE threat

A spokesperson for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani stated that the incoming administration will do everything in its power to protect those it will soon serve.

“New York City’s more than three million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality, and success. The Mayor-elect remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of every single New Yorker and upholding our sanctuary laws,” Dora Pekec, Mamdani’s spokesperson, said.

Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams’ office did not immediately respond to amNewYork’s request for comment. Adams and Homan have met multiple times since President Trump’s re-election last year to discuss ways the city government could cooperate with the federal government on stopping illegal immigration.

Meanwhile, other New York elected officials vowed not to be intimidated by Homan or the Trump administration.

“It’s just a continuation of absolutely draconian immigration enforcement from this federal administration. We won’t be intimidated. We have a responsibility more than ever to protect New Yorkers from threats like this from the federal government,” Senator Julia Salazar told amNewYork.

City Comptroller Brad Lander also spoke to amNewYork, adding that people can aid layers of protections against ICE by placing “employee only” signs on doors at places of work, something that will force the Feds to obtain warrants in order to enter portions of the premises. Still, he also echoed Salazar’s comments, adding that locals will not be intimidated either.

“New Yorkers are not going to allow Tom Homan and his brown shirted ICE agents to occupy our city with impunity,” said the outgoing comptroller. “We’re not going to let them violate the rule of law, abduct our neighbors without judicial warrants, without identifying themselves, while wearing masks without due process, grabbing people into cars, taking parents while their kids are in school. We’re not going to let that happen. And you can see New Yorkers rising up in that way all over the place.

A representative for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools tells PEOPLE that 30,339 students were reported absent from their schools on Monday, Nov. 17.

CMS, who originally reported the number as being close to 21,000, added that this reporting remains unofficial as a variety of factors go into the official count, such as whether or not this includes preschool-aged children, whether students doing virtual learning are counted and more.

WBTV noted that 31% of the student population in the area identifies as Hispanic, per data from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.

The sudden fall in student participation on Monday followed a recent increase in ICE raids in the area under a plan announced as “Operation Charlotte’s Web” by The Department of Homeland Security on Saturday, Nov.15.

NBC News reported that multiple businesses shuttered during the raids as ICE agents moved into the area to ""target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State,"" per the DHS release.

The announcement of the ICE operation prompted the CMS school district to publicly share on Sunday Nov, 16, that schools would continue in person this week.

“Please know there has been no immigration enforcement activity on CMS property, and we have not received any notice that such actions are planned,” CMS Assistant Communications Officer Tom Miner said in a Facebook video. “Therefore, schools will operate on a normal, in-person schedule tomorrow. We will continue to closely monitor immigration enforcement activity in Mecklenburg county.”

Miner added that if there was “an emergency situation” at any of the district’s campuses, the authorities would “reconsider remote instruction at that time.” He added that the school district “does not ask about immigration or citizenship status during enrollment,” and does not “share student information unless required by law.”

Miner also stated that, “Immigration officials cannot access staff, students, or private areas without a valid warrant or subpoena.”

The reported drop in student numbers comes after many were detained by ICE in restaurants, grocery stores, Home Depot parking lots and an east Charlotte church, reported The Charlotte Observer.

The Department of Homeland Security tells PEOPLE that more than 200 people were detained in the first three days of ""Operation Charlotte's Web.""

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles spoke out in a Monday press conference, and directly addressed Donald Trump over the raids.

“The city of Charlotte is one where we believe in fairness and dignity, and we are one of the largest cities in the country and we work very hard to do it right,” Lyles said, per WCNC. “If I were to talk to the president, I would say to him, ‘Look at our city, look at our people,’ and make sure that he has the understanding that all of you and I have.”

The latest bust happened in Kansas. Agents arrested 31-year-old Akhror Bozorov, a criminal illegal alien from Uzbekistan wanted for belonging to a terrorist organization, according to a Department of Homeland Security news release.

An arrest warrant was issued by Uzbekistan for Bozorov in 2022 for being a member of a terrorist organization. He is accused of distributing terrorist propaganda calling for jihad online and recruiting terrorists to join the jihad movement, according to the release.

He was arrested Nov. 9 while working as a commercial truck driver in Kansas.

“Not only was Akhror Bozorov – a wanted terrorist – released into the country by the Biden administration, but he was also given a commercial driver’s license by Governor Shapiro’s Pennsylvania. This should go without saying, but terrorist illegal aliens should not be operating 18-wheelers on America’s highways,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

“Biden and Mayorkas allowed countless terrorists to come into our country. President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target these national security threats.”

DHS’s news release says that Bozorov entered the U.S. illegally in February 2023. After being arrested by U.S. Border Patrol, he was released by the Biden administration and granted “work authorization” in January 2024. Bozorov was issued a commercial driver’s license on July 25, 2025, in Pennsylvania.

Oklahoma, in particular, has been a hotbed of activity for ICE arresting truckers.

According to a news release from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spent a week in late September arresting 130 truck drivers for various violations at the Beckham County Port of Entry.

“Oklahomans deserve safe highways,” Corporation Commission Chair Kim David said. “We appreciate the opportunity to assist ICE and DPS Troop S by removing non-compliant and dangerous drivers from our roads. By working together as law enforcement partners, we’re reducing risks for every driver.”

The operation, dubbed Operation Guardian, fired back up in early November.

ICE announced that a two-day operation in Oklahoma that yielded 70 arrests, including 34 truck drivers. According to ICE, 26 truck drivers had been improperly issued CDLs, and the other eight were operating a commercial motor vehicle without a license.

Targeting illegal CDL holders, companies that hire them

The candidly named No CDLs for Illegals Act was introduced by Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., on Oct. 28.

Both the House and Senate acted decisively today to pass a bill forcing the Justice Department to release its files on the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The House approved the bill in a near-unanimous vote of 427-1. Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., was the lone “no” vote. Hours later, the Senate agreed with unanimous consent to pass the measure.

Amid mounting pressure from his base, President Donald Trump reversed course and said he would sign the legislation if it passed both chambers, and encouraged House Republicans to vote in favor.

In his first visit to the White House since the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Mohammed bin Salman received a warm welcome from Trump, who contradicted U.S. intelligence and said the Saudi crown prince “knew nothing” about the killing.

Speaking on Fox News, the official, Thomas Homan, said that he was targeting New York City because of its so-called sanctuary policies, which prevent local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration authorities on most matters.

“We know we have an issue there with public safety,” Mr. Homan said of New York. “If they don’t want to assist and they want to keep pushing back and impeding our efforts, then we’re going to just send more teams there. We’re going to flood the zone.”

The city’s sanctuary laws, most of which were passed in 2014 when Bill de Blasio was mayor, strictly limit communication and cooperation between the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and city departments.

Mr. Homan’s warning came as New York’s leaders have been preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump will deploy the National Guard or more immigration agents to New York after Mr. Mamdani’s victory on Nov. 4.

Mr. Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist, ran for mayor arguing that only he could stand up to Mr. Trump, whom he described as a threat to democracy. Mr. Trump has belittled Mr. Mamdani for months, calling him a danger to New York. (Mr. Mamdani reached out to the White House recently to set up a meeting with the president.)

Gov. Kathy Hochul, who met with Mr. Mamdani last week to discuss Mr. Trump’s threats, said on Monday that state officials had been conducting exercises ahead of a potential federal deployment, adding that the city’s business leaders, some of whom have ties to Mr. Trump, would have a “very important” role to play.

“I’ve had conversations with a lot of business leaders and saying, ‘When the time comes, make sure that you also convey your concerns about what this would do to destabilize New York City and the outsize impact that this would have across America,’” she said in Albany on Monday.

New York officials have held phone calls with their counterparts in Chicago and Los Angeles to learn from their experiences confronting a surge in federal agents. Those discussions have focused, in part, on ensuring that any protests remain peaceful, to avoid the scenes of violence that could give Mr. Trump a pretext for deploying troops.

“They highlighted how important it is to get ahead of the narrative,” said Ana María Archila, a co-director of the progressive Working Families Party, who has participated in some of the calls. “Trump is looking for a fight. He wants the images of the fight in the streets.”

Since the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown started, much of the enforcement in New York City has taken place at federal immigration courts. But agents have also arrested people in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods and towns across the state, including on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley.

This month, Border Patrol agents conducted an operation targeting commercial truck drivers on Interstate 90 near Buffalo. They arrested 37 men who they said were undocumented and had been issued commercial driver’s licenses, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The federal government buttressed its deportation campaign with an infusion of billions of dollars for immigration enforcement efforts as part of Mr. Trump’s domestic policy law. Shortly after it passed in July, Mr. Homan visited New York City with Kristi Noem, the U.S. homeland security secretary, to blame Mayor Eric Adams and the city’s sanctuary laws for the shooting of an off-duty customs officer in Manhattan during an attempted robbery.

As New York City officials prepared for the potential arrival of the National Guard, county clerks in other parts of the state expressed dismay that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had abruptly canceled naturalization ceremonies, probably complicating the process for some immigrants.

At least seven counties were affected, said Timothy C. Idoni, the Westchester County clerk. The clerk’s office there has held such ceremonies for more than 40 years. On Friday, Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican whose district includes parts of Westchester, wrote a letter to Joseph B. Edlow, the director of the citizenship agency, seeking to reverse the decision.

Matthew J. Tragesser, a spokesman for the agency, said that the county courts did not meet federal requirements to conduct naturalization ceremonies. Applicants scheduled to take part in ceremonies would receive new appointments, and their naturalization processes would continue, Mr. Tragesser said.

Mr. Idoni said that applicants would now probably have to travel to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan to complete the final citizenship requirements and to receive naturalization certificates instead of participating in celebratory events arranged by their communities. The building in Manhattan has offices for the citizenship agency as well as for ICE, and it has become the epicenter of immigration arrests in the city.

“Heaven knows what they face down there, with all the things that are going on with immigration issues,” Mr. Idoni said. “We’re all very upset.”

Trump's reversal on the Epstein files Trump has said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, but tried for months to move past the demands for disclosure.
After winning a special election on Sept. 23, Grijalva had pledged to provide the crucial 218th vote to the petition for the Epstein files bill.
It quickly became obvious the bill would pass, and both Johnson and Trump began to fold.","Both the House and Senate acted decisively Tuesday to pass a bill to force the Justice Department to publicly release its files on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a remarkable display of approval for an effort that had struggled for months to overcome opposition from President Donald Trump and Republican leadership.

When a small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced a petition in July to maneuver around Speaker Mike Johnson's control of the House floor, it appeared a longshot effort - especially as Trump urged his supporters to dismiss the matter as a ""hoax.""

But both Trump and Johnson failed to prevent the vote. The president in recent days bowed to political reality, saying he would sign the bill. And just hours after the House vote, senators agreed to approve it unanimously, skipping a formal roll call.

The decisive, bipartisan work in Congress Tuesday further showed the pressure mounting on lawmakers and the Trump administration to meet long-held demands that the Justice Department release its case files on Epstein, a well-connected financier who killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges he sexually abused and trafficked underage girls.

MORE | Epstein survivors speak out ahead of House vote, take aim at Trump

For survivors of Epstein's abuse, passage of the bill was a watershed moment in a years-long quest for accountability.

""These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight. And they did it by banding together and never giving up,"" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene as she stood with some of the abuse survivors outside the Capitol Tuesday morning.

""That's what we did by fighting so hard against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, in order to make this vote happen today,"" added Greene, a Georgia Republican.

In the end, only one lawmaker in Congress opposed the bill. Rep. Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican who is a fervent supporter of Trump, was the only ""nay"" vote in the House's 427-1 tally. He said he worried the legislation could lead to the release of information on innocent people mentioned in the federal investigation.

The bill forces the release within 30 days of all files and communications related to Epstein, as well as any information about the investigation into his death in federal prison. It would allow the Justice Department to redact information about Epstein's victims or continuing federal investigations, but not information due to ""embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.""

Even before the bill's passage Tuesday, thousands of pages of emails and other documents from Epstein's estate have been released from an investigation by the House Oversight Committee.

Those documents show Epstein's connections to global leaders, Wall Street powerbrokers, influential political figures and Trump himself. In the United Kingdom, King Charles III stripped his disgraced brother Prince Andrew of his remaining titles and evicted him from his royal residence after pressure to act over his relationship with Epstein.

Trump's reversal on the Epstein files

Trump has said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, but tried for months to move past the demands for disclosure.

Still, many in the Republican base continued to demand the release of the files. Adding to that pressure, survivors of Epstein's abuse rallied outside the Capitol Tuesday morning. Bundled in jackets against the November chill and holding photos of themselves as teenagers, they recounted their stories of abuse.

""We are exhausted from surviving the trauma and then surviving the politics that swirl around it,"" said one of the survivors.

Another, Jena-Lisa Jones, said she had voted for Trump and had a message for the president: ""I beg you Donald Trump, please stop making this political.""

The group of women also met with Johnson and rallied outside the Capitol in September, but have had to wait months for the vote.

That's because Johnson kept the House closed for legislative business for nearly two months and refused to swear-in Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona during the government shutdown. After winning a special election on Sept. 23, Grijalva had pledged to provide the crucial 218th vote to the petition for the Epstein files bill. But only after she was sworn into office last week could she sign her name to the discharge petition to give it majority support in the 435-member House.

It quickly became obvious the bill would pass, and both Johnson and Trump began to fold. Trump on Sunday said Republicans should vote for the bill.

Yet Greene told reporters that Trump's decision to fight the bill had betrayed his Make America Great Again political movement.

""Watching this turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,"" she said.

How Johnson handled the bill

Rather than waiting until next week for the discharge position to officially take effect, Johnson held the vote under a procedure that requires a two-thirds majority.

But Johnson also spent a morning news conference listing off problems that he sees with the legislation. He argued that the bill could have unintended consequences by disclosing parts of federal investigations that are usually kept private, including information on victims.

""This is a raw and obvious political exercise,"" Johnson said.

Still, he voted for the bill. ""None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,"" he explained.

Meanwhile, the bipartisan pair who sponsored the bill, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., warned senators against doing anything that would ""muck it up,"" saying they would face the same public uproar that forced both Trump and Johnson to back down.

""We've needlessly dragged this out for four months,"" Massie said, adding that those raising problems with the bill ""are afraid that people will be embarrassed. Well, that's the whole point here.""

Senate acts quickly

Even as the bill cleared his chamber, Johnson pressed for the Senate to amend it to protect the information of ""victims and whistleblowers."" But Senate Majority Leader John Thune quickly shut down that notion.

As senators gathered in the chamber Tuesday evening for the first votes of the week, it became clear no one would object to passing the bill as written.

Just before Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called to pass the bill by unanimous consent, Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican who is close to Trump, walked in the chamber and gave Schumer a thumbs-up. He then walked over to Schumer and shook his hand.

""This is about giving the American people the transparency they've been crying for,"" said Schumer, D-N.Y. ""This is about holding accountable all the people in Jeffrey Epstein's circle who raped, groom, targeted and enabled the abuse of hundreds of girls for years and years.""

“At thirteen years old, in 2016, Petitioner arrived in the United States as an unaccompanied minor from El Salvador. He has lived in this country ever since and, in 2019, was granted Special Immigrant Juvenile (‘SIJ’) status, making him eligible for Lawful Permanent Residency. In recognition of that fact, and in recognition of Petitioner’s entitlement to an adjudication of his asylum application (still pending), an immigration judge closed Petitioner’s removal proceedings in 2021, so that Petitioner could wait out the years-long backlog on his claims.

“Notwithstanding, on July 3, 2025, Petitioner was detained by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (‘ICE’). Despite his living in this country for more than nine years, and despite the special process he received as a minor, and despite being a ‘hair’s breadth from being able to adjust [his] status,’ … Respondents argue that they are required to detain Petitioner, without bond, indefinitely, because he is somehow still an ‘arriving alien,’ subject to mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. §1225 (‘section 1225′). …

“Petitioner is not an ‘arriving alien.’ He has not been ‘arriving’ in this country for almost a decade. Respondents make no cogent argument to the contrary. Accordingly, section 1225 cannot apply. To the extent Respondents have any lawful authority to detain Petitioner, it is under 8 U.S.C. §1226 (‘section 1226′), which entitles him to a bond hearing. That is exactly what an immigration judge concluded on July 21, 2025, when that court ordered Petitioner released on bond of $10,000. The BIA has now stayed that release order, however, leading to Petitioner’s re-detention.

“… Respondents now seek to move the goalpost in a new way, by redefining ‘arriving alien.’ But words have meaning, and there is no sense in which Petitioner has been ‘arriving’ since 2016.

“… Petitioner certainly was not ‘coming or attempting to come into the United States’ or ‘seeking transit through the United States’ or ‘interdicted in international or United States waters’ when ICE encountered him near his home in Lynn, Massachusetts. The merits of this case are truly just that simple — Petitioner was not an ‘arriving alien’ at the time of his detention. Therefore, section 1225(b)(1) does not apply. …

“… The simple fact is that Petitioner was already present in the United States at the time of his detention — not ‘arriving.’ Thus, section 1225 cannot apply. …

“In sum, the Court concludes that Petitioner was not an ‘arriving alien’ at the time of his detention. Thus, his detention is governed not by section 1225(b)(1) but rather by section 1226. …

Homeland Security said that Edward York, a constituent outreach coordinator of Duckworth’s Metro East office, identified himself as an attorney at the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement office in St. Louis last month when he was seeking to speak with a Macoupin County man recently been detained by ICE.

“Upon reviewing the matter, I can confirm that neither I nor my leadership team was aware of, authorized or directed what your letter describes as the employee’s conduct,” Duckworth wrote in a letter sent on Monday. “My office has terminated the employment of said employee, effective November 17, 2025.”

Duckworth’s office could not be immediately reached for a comment on Tuesday, and an attorney for York declined to comment.

ICE detained Ismael Ayuzo Sandoval last month for violating four prior deportations and having been convicted in a 2008 DUI case. His detention prompted a rally in the small community of Staunton. Residents described Sandoval, 41, as a prominent member of the community and a successful restaurant owner. Sandoval has been held in ICE custody in Ste. Genevieve.

“On October 29, 2025, ICE arrested Ayuzo in Staunton, IL,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement last week. “He was transferred to ICE St. Louis for processing where a Duckworth staffer allegedly tried to remove him from ICE custody by claiming to be his attorney.”

In its letter sent last week, Homeland Security said York requested a G-28 form, which is used to authorize a licensed attorney or an accredited representative to act on behalf of a client, and asked that Sandoval sign it. Sandoval completed the form, and York then left, according to DHS.

Clay Higgins (R-La.)
“These are your average Americans, and you want to know what the Epstein files represent?
She later said she was referring to the Epstein files more generally.
The Epstein files have been a hugely divisive congressional fight in recent months, with Democrats pushing for the release and Republican congressional leaders largely refusing to take the votes.
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said the Trump administration will be forced to release the files with an act of Congress.","The long-standing fight to demand the Justice Department release all documents tied to its investigation into late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein shifted to President Trump on Tuesday after the House and Senate, within hours of each other, voted overwhelmingly to publicize the files.

Trump, who tried to thwart the release of the records for several months, reversed course Sunday night and indicated that he plans to sign the measure when it reaches his desk. For that to happen, the Senate and House needed to approve the measure — and on Tuesday that happened with near-unanimous support in both chambers, at the urging of Epstein survivors.

The action, however, did not come without some tension.

Hours before the House vote, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he would support the measure even though he believed it did not do enough to protect the privacy of the victims. Calling the bill “flawed,” Johnson then called on Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) to fix the bill in the upper chamber before sending it to the president’s desk.

But amending the bill would have further delayed passage of the measure, prolonging a hugely divisive congressional fight. The Senate ultimately decided to quickly pass the bill without making any changes — or a recorded vote — after a successful procedural maneuver led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

“Epstein victim groups have made clear that they support this bill as written, without amendments,” Schumer said. “We should listen to them and pass this bill quickly.”

The House vote was 427 to 1, with Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) the only nay vote.

The votes were the culmination of a months-long fight that began when House Democrats, joined by a small group of Republicans, forced a vote on the transparency bill over the objection of Trump and Republican legislative leaders.

The effort underscored how the Epstein saga and the Trump administration’s handling of the files were fueling a rift within Trump’s political base, which in the end was strong enough to force top Republicans to cave.

In an emotional speech on the House floor, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, argued the Epstein scandal is unlikely to end anytime soon because it has resonated deeply with many Americans — including those in the MAGA movement — who feel disenfranchised from the powerful people who control the government.

“These American women aren’t rich powerful elites,” Greene said in her speech. “These are your average Americans, and you want to know what the Epstein files represent? It represents the failures of the federal government and Congress.”

Speaking with reporters in the morning outside the Capitol, Greene also said, “The real test will be, will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?”

Ahead of the votes, several Epstein abuse survivors urged lawmakers to support the release of the records. They gathered outside the Capitol as they made their emotional plea.

“It’s time that we put the political agendas and party affiliations to the side. This is a human issue, this is about children,” said one survivor, Haley Robson. “There is no place in society for exploitation, sexual crimes or exploitation of women in society.”

Republicans follow Trump’s lead

Republicans for months balked at calling for the release of the Epstein files, joining Trump in claiming the issue was being brought up by Democrats as a way to distract from Republicans’ legislative successes. Some Republican lawmakers repeated those claims when debating the measure Tuesday, saying the vote was a “political show” led by Democrats who wanted tarnish Trump’s reputation.

Although Trump urged Republicans to support the measure ahead of the vote, his administration could have released the files without an act of Congress. At an Oval Office event Tuesday, Trump did not answer when a reporter asked him why he hadn’t done so yet. The president instead called the ABC News reporter “terrible” and for her network’s broadcast license to be revoked.

Trump’s tirade highlighted how the president is feeling about the Epstein scandal, which he says is a “Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics” to distract from his legislative agenda. His remarks came after he had a drastic reversal and urged Republicans to vote to release the documents, saying there was “nothing to hide.”

Trump’s reversal came days after 20,000 documents from Epstein’s private estate were released by lawmakers in the House Oversight Committee. The files referenced Trump more than 1,000 times.

In private emails, Epstein wrote that Trump had “spent hours” at his house and “knew about the girls,” a revelation that reignited the push in Congress for further disclosures.

Trump has continued to deny wrongdoing in the Epstein saga despite initially opposing the release of files from the federal inquiry into the conduct of his former friend, a convicted sex offender and alleged sex trafficker. Epstein died by suicide while in federal custody in 2019.

Many members of Trump’s MAGA base have demanded the files be released, convinced they contain revelations about powerful people involved in Epstein’s abuse of what is believed to be more than 200 women and girls. Tension among his base spiked when Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said in July that an “Epstein client list” did not exist, after saying in February that the list was sitting on her desk awaiting review. She later said she was referring to the Epstein files more generally.

Trump’s call to release the files now highlights how he is trying to prevent an embarrassing defeat as a growing number of Republicans in the House have joined Democrats to vote for the legislation in recent days.

The Epstein files have been a hugely divisive congressional fight in recent months, with Democrats pushing for the release and Republican congressional leaders largely refusing to take the votes. The issue even led to a rift within the MAGA movement.

Democrats have accused Johnson of delaying the swearing-in of Rep. Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, because she promised to cast the final vote needed to move a so-called discharge petition, which would force a vote on the floor. The speaker has denied those claims.

Robson, one of the survivors, questioned Trump’s about-face on the vote.

“While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I’m grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can’t help [but] be skeptical of what the agenda is,” Robson said.

The bill would prohibit the attorney general, Bondi, from withholding, delaying or redacting “any record, document, communication, or investigative material on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”

But caveats in the bill could provide Trump and Bondi with loopholes to keep records related to the president concealed.

In the spring, FBI Director Kash Patel directed a Freedom of Information Act team to comb through the entire trove of files from the investigation, and ordered it to redact references to Trump, citing his status as a private citizen with privacy protections when the inquiry first launched in 2006, Bloomberg reported at the time.

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said the Trump administration will be forced to release the files with an act of Congress.

“They will be breaking the law if they do not release these files,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f6374c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5818x3054+0+412/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F11%2F272b5d7548248fe026cf521564a1%2F2247291743.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 19:57:01.844719

ECHR: an instrument of peace causing discord All EU nations as well as non-EU member United Kingdom are signatories to the ECHR, which is not directly related to the European Union.","Several EU members in recent months have repeatedly voiced a desire to change — or at the very least — reinterpret certain guidelines pertaining to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) so they can adapt their own national laws in ways that would allow them to further restrict asylum and implement related immigration controls.

Earlier this year, nine EU member states came together to issue a call to the bloc to change its interpretation of the ECHR, which governs many fundamentals relating to asylum law for those countries signatories to the convention — especially in all matters relating to the human rights of migrants and refugees.

Italy, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland joined forces and demanded that the EU streamlines its laws to expel foreign criminals — even if this means that guidelines issued under the ECHR have to be reexamined and adapted accordingly. Great Britain is also beginning to think along those lines, although it is no longer and EU member state.

The nine nations in particular want the European Court of Human Rights, which is the final instance for ruling on ECHR-related matters, to revise and relax its guidelines on the deportation of such criminals to countries, which are not deemed safe.

In their view, an asylum seeker forfeits their right to protection if they significantly break the law of the country which hosts and protects them.

Examples of clashes between EU and ECHR

Some EU nations, such as France, have faced frustrations when trying to further tighten their asylum laws, as constitutional and legal experts rejected tabled bills, which were incompatible with the ECHR.

Other members of the bloc, like Greece, have faced criticism for using emergency measures to stop the processing of asylum applications earlier this year in Crete amid a sudden rise in arrival numbers, with the European Court of Human Rights reminding the Mediterranean nation that it can only suspend such asylum procedures for a limited window of time.

Italy, meanwhile, has repeatedly run into legal trouble at multiple levels — mainly national — with its plan to proactively intercept some migrants in international waters in the Mediterranean and then take them to two purpose-built facilities in Albania for remote processing; those deemed ineligible for asylum could then be returned directly from non-EU member Albania with far less red tape than is involved in Italy.

Many of the legal hold-ups relating to the Albania process ultimately have to do with what the ECHR does and does not allow — or rather, the interpretation of various Italian judges thereof.

UK: push for even greater ECHR changes

Separate to this development, Britain has also repeatedly voiced staunch demands to change certain ECHR fundamentals or be allowed to change its interpretation of the laws — with some politicians even threatening to exit the treaty altogether.

This week, the UK's government once again announced it hoped to introduce sweeping changes to its asylum law, some of which may at the current time not entirely be in line with some legal ECHR basics.

Among several new restrictions tabled to be introduced, the UK hopes to introduce a system whereby asylum seekers pegged to be deported can always be sent back to their country of origin; if the country of origin refuses to accept their own people back, the British government might go as far as banning anyone from that country from being issued with visas, as part of a proposed tit-for-tat policy, according to UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

This blanket refusal, among other proposed changes, might however be in breach of ECHR guidelines, at least at the present moment.

Among EU nations, Denmark has recently expressed the view that it would be happy to join forces with Britain to push for a re-examination of how the ECHR is applied.

ECHR Article 3: What qualifies as 'torture'?

Details on concrete proposed changes to the ECHR are currently only known from UK lawmakers and not from European ones, although it is likely that they will overlap.

British authorities want in particular to see changes, amendments or legally binding reinterpretations to Article 3 of the treaty, which deals with the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and Article 8, which governs the right to family life.

Multiple deportations of criminal asylum seekers have been blocked due to an interpretation of Article 3, whereby sending someone back to a country from which they have escaped would constitute a form of torture; Britain argues that it is in its own public's best interest to allow such deportations to prevent future crimes and to serve as a deterrent to other foreigners who might consider engaging in criminal activities.

ECHR Article 8: A family affair

Article 8 of the ECHR meanwhile has been used to justify family reunifications, which Britain and other countries currently critical of the ECHR do not want to ban altogether but to make considerably more difficult, for example by introducing certain income thresholds to qualify applicants to send for immediate family members.

In the past, some attempts at limiting family reunification rights have been halted by citing Article 8; the same law has also been cited in the past — in connection with other laws — to prevent the deportation of entire families to safe countries or countries which have been deemed safe once again.

The Home Office says, for example, that currently in Britain, ""there are around 700 Albanian families whose asylum claims have been rejected, yet their removal is not currently being enforced by the Home Office, despite Albania having a gold-standard of cooperation with the UK on returns and being a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).""

""Article 8 rights are currently leading to high numbers of arrivals from those who would not otherwise have the right to live in the UK,"" a press release by the Home Office earlier this week further highlights.

The definition of a 'safe country'

The definition of safe countries in general is also a thorn in the side of many European nations that are hoping to tighten their asylum laws, as squaring that with their membership of the ECHR has repeatedly proven problematic.

Many individual governments across Europe, as well as the EU itself, have designated lists of countries they consider 'safe' and are therefore destinations for possible deportations of nationals from that country, who have been refused protection by the host country.

In April 2025, the European Commission proposed to formalize this, including Bangladesh, Kosovo, Egypt, Morocco, Colombia, India and Tunisia on the list of safe countries.

This broadening of safe nations has been justified in legal documents from the European Commission by stressing that it would not interfere with individual assessments of asylum, as a country might not be safe for all inhabitants of a certain country, depending on their individual circumstances and experiences, which may have led them to claim protection elsewhere.

However, the EU also tried to argue as an extension to those changes that any country could be considered 'safe' if 20 percent or fewer applicants from that country generally were granted protection in the EU, which the human rights organization Amnesty criticized as a loophole of the proposed regulation.

A statement from Amnesty in July 2025 underlined: ""The fact that up to 20 percent of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all.""

CJEU ruling and Italy's Albania plans

Another example for the ongoing debate on safe countries of origin is a judgment from August this year by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) regarding Italy's attempts to designate certain countries 'safe' — such as Bangladesh and Egypt.

The judgement underlined that migrants should always have the right to challenge such designations in court, and that countries must make accessible the information they used to reach the designation of 'safe' for each individual case, according to a statement from the International Bar Association (IBA), which is the global voice of the legal profession.

The new EU Pact on Asylum and Migration, which is due to come into effect next year, sets out to strengthen the right of designation of 'safe' countries, but the CJEU judgement, according to some legal experts quoted by the IBA, might still strengthen challenges to the pact in the future.

""The buried treasure in the [CJEU judgment] is the effectiveness of a challenge, and access to documents,"" says Steve Peers, a professor of EU and human rights law at Royal Holloway, University of London, who commented in the IBA article on the issue.

""With the new EU Pact, it might be easier to say a country is safe but it will [also] be easier to challenge this in individual cases.""

Changes to ECHR possible — but at what cost?

The Council of Europe (CoE), which oversees the application and implementation of the ECHR, has responded to these recent developments by declaring that it is ""absolutely ready"" to consider discussing changes to the treaty.

Its secretary general, Alain Berset, said that it might be time for the organization ""to change and adapt,"" while firmly stressing, however, that this could also weaken the international organization, which was formed in the wake of World War II to stop future conflict.

""These are complex challenges, and democracies must always remain open to reflection through the appropriate institutional avenues,"" Berset said earlier in the year.

The ECHR can be — and has in the past been — amended by adding new so-called protocols.

With different member states having varying migrant population and native population rates, there is also a risk that a ""one size fits all"" approach to these challenges would not leave all signatory states equally satisfied.

ECHR: an instrument of peace causing discord

All EU nations as well as non-EU member United Kingdom are signatories to the ECHR, which is not directly related to the European Union.

The ECHR is a treaty dating back to the early 1950s, which provides a loose but binding framework to protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people, whose governments are part of the Council of Europe (CoE), which is headquartered in Strasbourg, France.

The Council of Europe has 46 member states, and its main body, the European Court of Human Rights, which is also based in Strasbourg, is in charge of making sure that all its signatory states comply with the legal framework set by the ECHR.

All 27 EU nations have to be signatories to the Council of Europe; however beyond the UK, non-EU members include such nations as Turkey, Armenia and Montenegro.

Until its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia was also a member; it has been suspended since.

Sen. John Thune defends airdropped provision allowing senators to sue the government

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., defended including a provision in the government funding bill that would allow senators to sue the federal government if their phone data was accessed without their being notified, saying he doesn’t know what he would do if the House were to pass a bill to rescind the provision.

""The House isn’t implicated in what we did. It just simply applies to the Senate,"" Thune said. ""What this does is enables people who are harmed, in this case, United States senators, to have a private right of action against the weaponization of the ... by the Justice Department.""

Pressed on the fact that many senators who could use the new ability to sue have said they support rescinding it and won’t use it to sue, Thune said: “I think the penalty is in place to ensure that in the future, if you get a Justice Department who did what Jack Smith did and weaponized the federal government against the Article I branch of the government — members the Article I branch the government — there is a remedy in place. There’s a recourse in place.”

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., who is on the Appropriations Committee and whose bill included the provision, said he didn’t know it was in there until after he voted for it.

“I support repealing it. I didn’t support the provision that was put in there,” Mullin said. “It shouldn’t be retroactive. But I think now it maybe — may repeal the whole thing and have to put different language in it and not make it retroactive.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., admitted he worked with Thune to include the provision but said he would support rescinding it.

“Look, the bottom line is Thune wanted the provision, and we wanted to make sure that at least Democratic senators were protected from [Attorney General Pam] Bondi and others who might go after them,” Schumer said. “So we made it go prospective, not just retroactive, but I’d be for repealing all the provision, all of it, and I hope that happens.”

Obamacare tax credits look likely to expire as Trump rules out an extension

Inside a closed-door meeting of House Republicans today, Rep. Jen Kiggans, of Virginia, a swing district member who is a linchpin of the party’s narrow majority, stood up and made a plea.

“Doing nothing on health care is not the right answer,” she later told NBC News, summing up her message to colleagues. “I would really appreciate if we could have a timeline because we know that the end of the calendar year is coming, and I don’t want to see people’s premiums go up. I don’t want to see people lose their health insurance.”

The remarks drew an unspectacular reception.

“Average,” Kiggans replied when she was asked how it was received. “We line up, we have our one minute to state our case. Usual reaction.”

Republicans are careening to a health care cliff with no solution in hand. An estimated 22 million people in the United States are about to see their health insurance premiums soar by, in some cases, thousands of dollars per month, as billions in funding for the Affordable Care Act expires Dec. 31. The expiring funds, costing about $35 billion per year, were first passed during the pandemic to subsidize insurance payments, capping premiums for a “benchmark” ACA, or “Obamacare,” plan at 8.5% of income.

Indiana governor says he'll back Trump's endorsing primary challengers against state senators who oppose redistricting

Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement today that he will back an effort by Trump to endorse primary challenges against state lawmakers who don't support GOP-led redistricting efforts in the state.

“I will support President Trump’s efforts to recruit, endorse, and finance primary challengers for Indiana’s senators who refuse to support fair maps,"" Braun said.

Trump criticized Republican state lawmakers on social media Sunday for not pressing ahead with redistricting efforts and urged that Republicans who opposed new congressional maps lose their seats.

In his statement today, Braun praised state House Speaker Todd Huston and GOP state representatives who supported redistricting under pressure from Trump and said he would “explore all options” to compel a vote in the Senate to approve new maps. Sen. Rod Bray said last week that the Senate was shy of the votes needed to advance redistricting efforts.

Bray did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Braun's statement.

Trump also took direct aim at Bray yesterday, posting on social media: ""A RINO State Senator, Rodric Bray, who doesn’t care about keeping the Majority in the House in D.C., is the primary problem. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity.""

Sherrill resigns House seat following gubernatorial win

Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., announced her resignation from her House seat today after she won the New Jersey governorship this month.

Sherrill opted to step down effective 11:59 p.m. Thursday, rather than wait until closer to her inauguration as governor in January. The move is expected to trigger a special election for her seat.

“It has been an honor to serve the residents of the 11th Congressional District since 2019,” Sherrill wrote.

“Public service is a public trust. I look forward to continuing to serve the residents of the 11th District and all New Jerseyans as Governor next year,” she added.

Senate unanimously agrees to send Epstein bill to Trump's desk

The Senate unanimously agreed to pass the Epstein files bill and will send it to Trump once it receives the legislation from the House, which approved it earlier in the day.

No more voting action by Congress is needed for it to go to Trump’s desk.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put forward a unanimous consent motion, which passed with no objections.

Democrats target federal officials accused of civil rights violations in new legislation

Seizing on allegations that federal law enforcement officials committed constitutional violations as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, Democrats have launched an effort to allow civil rights claims against rogue agents.

Lawmakers today reintroduced legislation that would ensure federal officials, including immigration agents and other law enforcement officers, can be sued individually for constitutional violations.

The bill, introduced in the House and the Senate by Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., would amend a post-Civil War-era law that allows such claims against state and local officials to make it clear that federal officials are covered, too.

Education Department takes a major step forward in the Trump administration’s plans to dismantle it

The Education Department is handing off some of its biggest grant programs to other federal agencies as the Trump administration accelerates its plan to shut down the department.

It is a major step forward for the administration’s dismantling of the department, which has mainly involved cutting jobs since Trump called for its elimination with an executive action in March.

Six new agreements signed by the Education Department will effectively move billions of dollars in grant programs to other agencies. Most notable is one that will put the Labor Department over some of the largest federal funding streams for K-12 schools, including Title I money for schools serving low-income communities.

National Press Club denounces Trump's remarks about Jamal Khashoggi

The National Press Club rebuked Trump in a statement this afternoon after he claimed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had nothing to do with the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi even though U.S. intelligence reached that conclusion.

""For reporters around the world — and for those who risk their lives to report on powerful figures, governments, and global events — statements that appear to minimize or excuse the killing of a journalist have real-world consequences,"" the National Press Club said. ""They can embolden those who wish to silence reporters, and they can undermine the essential principle that journalists must be able to work without fear of violence or retribution.""

Asked about Khashoggi's murder earlier, Trump told reporters: ""You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen, but he knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that,"" referring to Crown Prince Mohammed.

Trump was responding to ABC News reporter Mary Bruce, who asked about the crown prince's alleged involvement in Khashoggi's killing. Trump initially responded by saying, ""Fake news."" When Bruce later asked Trump about Epstein, he derided her as a ""terrible person and a terrible reporter"" and said she couldn't ask any more questions.

House rebukes Chuy Garcia's re-election move

The House has voted to formally disapprove of Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., for his ploy to handpick his successor.

The measure passed by a vote of 236-183, with four members registering as ""present.""

Fellow Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, of Washington, offered the resolution. It took aim at Garcia’s actions this fall, which set up his chief of staff as the sole Democrat on the primary ballot to replace him in a deep-blue district.

Garcia had filed paperwork to run for re-election in 2026, then announced he was retiring after the filing deadline. His chief of staff, Patty Garcia, had filed her own paperwork to run for the seat just hours before the same Nov. 3 deadline. The two are not related.

House Democratic leadership, led by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York, backed Garcia and opposed the disapproval resolution.

Sen. Gallego to read part of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre's memoir on the floor

Now that the House has voted to compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, Senate Democrats aren’t wasting any time in their chamber.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he'll move to unanimously pass the Epstein resolution on the Senate floor, though any one senator can object to that.

And soon, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., is expected to take to the floor to bring attention to one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre.

Gallego will read excerpts of Giuffre’s memoir, ""Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice."" The book was released in October, months after she died by suicide in April. Her publisher released an email from Giuffre saying that it was her “heartfelt wish” that the book be released ""regardless” of her circumstances.

Gallego will quote this excerpt, according to plans shared first with NBC News:

Lone 'no' on Epstein measure explains his vote

Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., the lone “no” vote out of the 428 votes cast on the Epstein bill, posted a message on X explaining his decision.

""I have been a principled 'NO' on this bill from the beginning. What was wrong with the bill three months ago is still wrong today,"" wrote Higgins, a former police officer.

""As written, this bill reveals and injures thousands of innocent people — witnesses, people who provided alibis, family members, etc. If enacted in its current form, this type of broad reveal of criminal investigative files, released to a rabid media, will absolutely result in innocent people being hurt. Not by my vote,"" he added.

The bill's co-authors, Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have said the legislation already has protections for the victims, who've supported the measure.

House overwhelmingly passes Epstein transparency bill

The House passed the Epstein measure by an almost unanimous bipartisan vote of 427-1.

The bill would compel the Justice Department to release all its records related to the late convicted sex offender.

The House Oversight Committee had subpoenaed the files earlier this year, but the Justice Department has not yet turned all the documents over.

The measure will now move on to the Senate, where House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has called on his colleagues to make some changes to the bill, including increasing protections for victims. Democrats have blasted that suggestion as a stalling tactic and called on the Senate to pass it as is.

If it is signed into law, the bill would require the Justice Department to release in a searchable and downloadable format “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” related to Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell within 30 days.

Khashoggi's widow says Saudi crown prince should 'apologize' to her for husband's death

Responding to Trump's defense of Mohammed bin Salman today on X, Khashoggi’s widow said the crown prince should meet directly with her and apologize for her husband's death.

""There is no justification to murder my husband. While Jamal was a good transparent and brave man many people may not have agreed with his opinions and desire for freedom of the press,"" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi said. ""The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband.""

The CIA determined that the crown prince ordered Khashoggi’s murder. The crown prince has said he took responsibility for the death in his role as Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader but has denied that he directed it.

House vote to release Epstein files has begun

The House has started voting on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.

The measure seemed ready to pass by a voice vote when Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., asked that the votes be recorded. The process is expected to last 15 minutes, and a two-thirds majority is needed to pass it.

Trump praises Saudi crown prince during White House visit

A a meeting in the Oval Office, Trump praised Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and claimed that the crown prince “knew nothing” about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed in 2018. The meeting displayed a deepening alliance between the two leaders, with the crown prince announcing that his country plans to invest $1 trillion in the United States, up from an expected $600 billion.

New international student enrollments at U.S. colleges fall 17% amid Trump visa restrictions

The number of international students newly enrolled at U.S. colleges and universities fell 17% this fall amid new visa restrictions by the Trump administration, a report found.

U.S. colleges and universities reporting declines in new enrollments cited multiple contributing factors, including visa application concerns (96%) and travel restrictions (68%), according to the report released yesterday by the nonprofit Institute of International Education, which surveyed 825 U.S. higher education institutions.

India remains the largest source of international students after overtaking China last year, with more than 363,000 students in the 2024-25 school year. There were almost 266,000 students from China, while South Korea was the third-largest source with more than 42,000, according to the IIE report, which is sponsored by the State Department.

The Trump administration has been sending mixed messages on visa policies for international students. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would “aggressively revoke” visas for Chinese students, but in August Trump said he planned to allow 600,000 Chinese students into the country — a figure more than double the number in the U.S. now, sparking uproar among some conservatives.

In a surprise announcement in September, Trump also said he was raising the fee for H-1B skilled worker visas to $100,000, prompting concern in countries such as India, which accounts for more than 70% of H-1B visa recipients including students who use them to stay in the U.S. after graduation. Trump later defended the H-1B visa, arguing this month that foreign labor is sometimes needed because the U.S. lacks “certain talents.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment sent outside business hours. A spokesperson told Reuters that Trump is “strengthening our country’s visa programs to put American national security first.”

The U.S. had almost 1.2 million international students from more than 200 places of origin in the 2024-25 school year, the report said, making up about 6% of the total student population of more than 19 million. International students, who often pay full tuition, are considered an important source of revenue for universities facing government budget cuts.

Federal court blocks Texas Republicans’ redrawn congressional map

A panel of federal judges has barred Texas from using its redrawn congressional map, which Republicans enacted earlier this year in an effort to shore up the party’s narrow House majority in next year’s midterm elections.

The court ordered Texas to use its previous map that was drawn in 2021 instead. The ruling, signed by Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, is likely to be appealed.

An appeal would go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to the ruling, teeing up a legal fight that could decide control of of the House.

The decision is a major blow for Trump, who called on Texas Republicans over the summer to draw a new map that could result in the party gaining up to five seats, triggering a nationwide redistricting battle across the country.

Democrats introduce bill to limit donations for White House ballroom construction

Two Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to impose donation restrictions on the controversial $300 million ballroom project that resulted in the demolition of the East Wing of the White House.

The legislation was introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif.

If passed, the bill would bar donations from companies or people ""that present a conflict of interest"" and impose a two-year pause before a donor can lobby the federal government, among other restrictions, their news release said.

The bill would also require the National Park Service to publish donor names. Currently, ballroom donors can be anonymous.

In a statement, Warren said that the bill would ""put an end to what looks like bribery in plain sight."" Garcia also slammed the White House for not revealing all donors, saying in a statement that ""the people’s house could be funded by shady figures, corrupt money, and bad actors.""

The White House didn't immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on the legislation.

NBC News has previously reported how the donations are being funneled through the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that typically takes on uncontroversial projects.

Comcast Corp., the parent company of NBCUniversal, was included on a White House list of ballroom donors.

Trump attacks ABC reporter after Epstein questioning

Trump lashed out at ABC News' chief White House correspondent in response to a question asking why he wouldn't release the Epstein files immediately.

""You start off with a [Mohammed bin Salman], who is highly respected, asking him a horrible, insubordinate and just a terrible question,"" the president said, referring to correspondent Mary Bruce's initial question about the Saudi crown prince's alleged involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The crown prince has denied ordering the killing, but has said he took responsibility for the death as Saudi Arabia's de facto leader.

The president then answered that he had ""nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,"" repeating that he ""threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.""

Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1980s, '90s and early 2000s before he said he barred Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for recruiting young female employees away from the resort.

""You just keep going on the Epstein files,"" Trump said, claiming the sex abuse scandal is ""a Democrat hoax."" The president then said the network's license should be revoked.

""I think the license should be taken away from ABC, because your news is so fake and it's so wrong,"" Trump said. ""And we have a great [FCC] commissioner, the chairman, who should look at that.""

NBC News has reached out to ABC News for comment on Trump's attacks on the network and its reporter.

Last December, ABC agrees to pay $15 million in a settlement with Trump following a legal dispute over an interview in which the president alleged anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him.

Trump says he has 'nothing to do' with family business in Saudi Arabia

Trump denied any conflicts of interest between his family businesses and Saudi investments in the U.S., saying that ""what my family does is fine"" when asked about the issue by a reporter at the White House.

""I have nothing to do with the family business,"" the president said. ""What my family does is fine. They do business all over. They've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually. I'm sure they could do a lot, and anything they've done has been very good.""

The Trump Organization, run by the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump has multiple active projects in the Middle Eastern country, including plans for Trump Towers in both Jeddah and Riyadh. The president has also hosted tournaments for LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed competitor to the PGA, at his golf courses.

Saudi crown prince says Iran wants to make a deal with the U.S., Trump says he's 'open to it'

The Saudi crown prince said during his bilateral meeting with Trump that he believes Iran wants to make a deal with the U.S., an apparent reference to a Iranian denuclearization agreement.

""We will do our best to help to reach a deal between the rest of America and Iran,"" he said. ""By the way, Iran does want to make a deal. I can say, I think they very badly want to make a deal.""

Trump said he would be ""open to it,"" adding, ""It would be a nice thing to have a deal with Iran, and we could have done it before the war, but that didn’t work out ... but they would very much like, I mean, they may say something else, but they would very much like to have a deal.""

Trump says Saudi crown prince 'knew nothing' about murdered journalist

Trump said that Crown Prince Mohammed knew ""nothing"" about journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in Saudi Arabia in 2018, despite the CIA's determination that the crown prince directly ordered Khashoggi's death in 2018.

""You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial,"" Trump said, referring to Khashoggi. ""A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen, but [bin Salman] knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that.""

The crown prince called Khashoggi's death ""painful for us in Saudi Arabia"" and said the country has taken ""all the right steps"" in investigating the journalist's death.

The crown prince said that his country has ""improved our system to be sure that nothing happened like that, and it’s painful and it’s a huge mistake"" and that they are ""doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.""

Bin Salman has denied ordering the killing, but has said he took responsibility for the death as Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader.

Crown prince says Saudi Arabia will invest $1 trillion in the U.S.

The Saudi crown prince said in the Oval Office with Trump that his country plans to invest $1 trillion in the U.S., up from an expected $600 billion.

""We’re going to announce that we are going to increase that $600 billion to almost $1 trillion for investment, real investment and real opportunity,"" he said, adding that it would involve investment in technology, AI and other areas.

Trump responded, ""We appreciate it very much.""

Appeals court upholds dismissal of Trump's CNN defamation suit

A federal appeals court today upheld a lower court's dismissal of Trump's $475 million defamation suit against CNN for referring to his false 2020 stolen election claims as ""the big lie.""

""Trump has not adequately alleged the falsity of CNN’s statements. Therefore, he has failed to state a defamation claim,"" the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling.

""Trump’s argument hinges on the fact that his own interpretation of his conduct — i.e., that he was exercising a constitutional right to identify his concerns with the integrity of elections — is true and that CNN’s interpretation — i.e., that Trump was peddling his 'Big Lie' — is false. However, his conduct is susceptible to multiple subjective interpretations, including CNN’s,"" the three-judge panel ruled.

Trump had contended in his suit that linking him with the phrase was essentially comparing him to the Nazis and Adolf Hitler, who's credited with coining the term. U.S. District Judge Raag Singhal disagreed in a 2023 ruling in which he dismissed the suit.

“CNN’s use of the phrase ‘the Big Lie’ in connection with Trump’s election challenges does not give rise to a plausible inference that Trump advocates the persecution and genocide of Jews or any other group of people,” the judge wrote.

A spokesman for Trump's legal team said in a statement that “there is no doubt that Fake News CNN defamed President Trump,"" and that he will ""continue to hold the mainstream media accountable and will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson says he wants the Senate to amend the Epstein files bill

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said this morning that while he plans to vote in favor of the bill that would compel the Justice Department to release the files on Jeffrey Epstein, he wants the Senate to amend the legislation.

At a GOP leadership press conference, Johnson argued that the legislation the House is voting on this afternoon ""fails to fully protect victim privacy.""

""I’m going to read you an excerpt out of our legal document we put together to explain: Congress should give the attorney general broader authority to redact all the victim information. The discharge doesn’t do that,"" Johnson said.

One of the bill's sponsors, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., this morning called Johnson's claim is a ""red herring,"" saying that survivors of Epstein's abuse ""have always been in favor of this legislation."" He said that if the Senate wants to strengthen the bill's protections, ""that's fine with us.""

The current measure says that the attorney general ""may withhold or redact the segregable portions of records"" including those that contain ""personally identifiable information of victims,"" but it's not technically required.

Johnson also said the bill doesn't prohibit the release of child sexual abuse materials. ""We can't go for that,"" he said.

The speaker rejected the notion that his sudden support of the legislation is a reversal for him.

""No, it’s not a reversal,"" he said, adding that he had issues with the bill's language since the beginning of the process. ""I’ve been for maximum transparency, but again, there’s a reason you have rules and processes here to ensure that this is not done haphazardly, and I was not satisfied.""

Top Trump super PAC to start TV ads in Tennessee special election

The top outside group aligned with Trump’s political operation is starting TV ads in a deep-red House special election in Tennessee to boost the Republican contender there.

The super PAC MAGA Inc. has placed more than $200,000 of TV and radio ads so far to support Republican Matt Van Epps in the special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, according to ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Trump carried the district by 22 points in 2024. Then-GOP Rep. Mark Green resigned earlier this year, triggering the special election.

MAGA Inc. jumped into the race last week with more than $15,000 in phone-banking, its first spending on any election so far this year. That expense has grown to more than $100,000 so far, according to FEC filings.

Also last week, Trump held a tele-rally for Van Epps to energize Republicans as early voting began. Van Epps faces Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the Dec. 2 special general election.

What to expect from Trump's meeting with Saudi crown prince

As Trump meets with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman today at the White House, a senior White House official says the two leaders are expected to discuss deals on America’s AI infrastructure, nuclear energy, and defense sales, as well as Saudi Arabia's commitment of $600 billion in investments.

Additionally, Trump has said the U.S. would sell Saudi Arabia F-35 fighter jets. The president also “hopes” that Saudi Arabia will join the Abraham Accords, the official said.

Saudi crown prince arrives at the White House

Upon his arrival at the White House, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was greeted with a ceremony that included much more pomp and circumstance than that given other world leaders so far this term.

The ceremony included a red carpet, a color guard on horseback carrying Saudi and U.S. flags, and the Marine band playing live from the Truman Balcony.

The crown prince's visit marks the first time he has returned to the White House since 2018, after the CIA concluded that he directly ordered the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Trump greeted him outside the South Portico of the White House, where Vice President JD Vance and Secretaries Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick, Chris Wright and chief of staff Susie Wiles were also present.

After a flyover of F-35s, the two leaders entered the White House and went to the West Colonnade, where Trump could be seen showing off the newly installed Presidential Walk of Fame — a display of presidential portraits — to the crown prince.

The leaders then posed for a photo in front of U.S. and Saudi flags before entering the Oval Office.

Working Families Party to support primary challenger to Sen. John Fetterman

Pennsylvania’s Working Families Party is making plans to support a primary challenge to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman when he is up for re-election.

The state party announced today that it plans to start recruiting “working class leaders into a candidate pipeline” as well as volunteers and raise money for a challenge in 2028.

“We deserve real working class leadership in the U.S. Senate. Senator Fetterman has sold us out, and that’s why the Pennsylvania Working Families Party is committed to recruiting and supporting a primary challenge to him in 2028,” Shoshanna Israel, the mid-Atlantic political director of the Working Families Party, said in a statement.

Israel also wrote that Pennsylvanians “deserve a Senator who won’t enable Trump or vote with Republicans to rip health care away from over 400,000 of our neighbors.”

NBC10 reached out Fetterman’s office for a comment and has not yet received a response.

Trump’s Gaza peace plan wins global backing. Now comes the hard part.

To hear Trump tell it, this was “one of the biggest approvals in the history of the United Nations,” a “moment of true historic proportion” that would “ lead to further peace all over the world.” But the gravity of the United Nations Security Council’s endorsement of the U.S. Gaza plan raised renewed questions today over how it will actually work.

Most pressingly, it is not clear whether those at the heart of this conflict — the Palestinians and the Israelis themselves — actually support its end goals.

Hamas, which still controls around half of the strip, outright rejected the resolution and said it robs Palestinians of their own agency, effectively allowing Trump free reign over the Gaza Strip for the next two years. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed its passage, but previously said he rejects its talk of “Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”

On a practical level, the proposal says it will require the creation of several as-yet-non-existent bodies, including the “Board of Peace” headed by Trump, and the International Stabilization Force, or ISF, whose troops could be drawn from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and as far away as Indonesia.

House could vote today on a resolution of disapproval for Rep. Chuy Garcia

The House could vote today on a resolution by Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., to disapprove of Rep. Chuy Garcia, D-Ill., over his ploy to handpick the successor for his congressional seat.

Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the Democratic whip, offered a motion to table Gluesenkamp Perez’s resolution, which would have effectively killed the effort. But the tabling motion was defeated 206-211, with Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, joining Gluesenkamp Perez in voting against it.

After the tabling vote, Gluesenkamp Perez debated Democrats who support Garcia.

“And the question at hand is, do we condone a subversion of an election because it is playing by the rules?” she said on the House floor. “That’s not what we’re here to do.”

Garcia rose to speak, saying he “wasn’t expecting to stand here to debate my retirement.” He said he “decided that it was time to dedicate more of my time to the people who have sacrificed the most,” listing his wife, children and grandchildren. He said he wanted to focus on helping his wife manage her multiple sclerosis, as well as take care of his grandson whom he and his wife adopted following the death of their daughter.

Gluesenkamp Perez responded: “I feel deeply for the sacrifice that it’s taken him to serve his community. That does not legitimize the way in which he left his seat and choosing his successor and refusing to be forthright with his constituents.”

Massie warns Senate not to 'muck' up Epstein bill

Massie warned the Senate to not ""muck"" up the Epstein bill after it passes the House.

“It may be tempting for them to get cute and to do things that will limit the release of these documents,” Massie said. “They are afraid that people will be embarrassed. Well, that’s the whole point here. They need to be brought to justice, and embarrassment is no reason to stop it.”

Massie also criticized the nearly two-month delay in newly elected Rep. Adelita Grijalva's swearing-in, which prevented him and other supporters of the bill from getting enough signatures to force the chamber to vote on it. He added that he thought in holding the vote on the bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ""wants to save face.""

Virginia Giuffre's brother calls her 'a beacon of hope' in emotional remarks

Sky Roberts, the brother of Epstein survivor Virginia Giuffre, delivered emotional remarks about his late sister, saying that she became ""a beacon of hope"" for other survivors of sexual assault and that tactics to silence his sister ""did not work.""

""Virginia's story is one that should have been filled with promise,"" Roberts said. ""But instead, it became a harrowing tale of exploitation and survival.""

Giuffre, who by suicide earlier this year, was one of the most prominent survivors of Epstein’s abuse. Since her death, her brother has become an advocate for his sister's legacy.

""The most destructive wound they inflicted was that of forced complicity, a betrayal of self that was crafted by her abusers,"" Roberts said, who paused at times during his remarks to hold back tears. ""But I stand here today declare that their tactics of fear and intimidation did not work.""

""Virginia’s spirit could not be broken,"" Roberts said. ""She became a beacon of hope, a warrior, fighting not just for herself, but for every survivor who suffered in silence.""

Epstein survivor criticizes Trump's focus on Democrats' relationships with Epstein, calls his actions 'a national embarrassment'

Epstein survivor Jena-Lisa Jones strongly criticized Trump for directing the Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s connections to prominent Democrats and others.

“I beg you, President Trump: Please stop making this political,” Jones said. “It is not about you, President Trump. You are our president. Please start acting like it. Show some class, show some real leadership, show that you actually care about the people other than yourself.”

Jones said she voted for Trump, but added “your behavior on this issue has been a national embarrassment.”

“It is time to take the honest, moral ground and support the release of these files, not to weaponize pieces of the files against random political enemies that did nothing wrong, but to understand who Epstein’s friends were, who covered for him, what financial institutions allowed his trafficking to continue, who knew what he was doing but was too much of a coward to do anything about it,” she said.

Reached for comment on the speakers' criticisms of Trump, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson repeated the president's claim that “Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.”

But before his dramatic reversal on the release of the files last weekend, Trump had called the push to release the files a ""hoax"" and criticized those who continued to focus on Epstein. Survivors and a group of lawmakers are also still pushing for the release of private Epstein files held by the administration.

Epstein survivor delivers message to Trump: 'I am traumatized, I am not stupid'

Haley Robson, a survivor of Epstein, began her remarks by noting that while people see the survivors as adults, she emphasized they were fighting for themselves and other victims as the children who were left behind, showing a picture of herself as a child.

Robson thanked the lawmakers championing the effort, saying that to watch Republicans going against their party and risking their careers was ""unbelievable to watch.""

Robson said that if Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who supported the vote to release the Justice Department's Epstein case files, decided to read names of people connected to Epstein on the House floor, she would stand next to her.

Robson delivered a message to Trump, saying she was ""skeptical"" of his ""agenda,"" even though he flipped his stance on the House vote.

""I am traumatized, I am not stupid,"" she said in her message to Trump. She said he had put them through ""so much stress.""Reached for comment on speakers’ criticisms of Trump, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson provided a statement repeating Trump's claim that “Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.”

Survivors and a group of lawmakers are also still pushing for the release of private Epstein files held by the administration.

Epstein survivors press conference begins

Reps. Ro Khanna, Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene each thanked Epstein survivors and lawmakers who supported efforts to release the Epstein files.

Greene, who had a public rift with Trump over the files, talked about being called a ""traitor"" by the president. She emphasized that a traitor is someone who serves foreign countries and themselves, but a patriot serves the country and people like ""the women standing behind me.""

She predicted a unanimous vote in the House to release the files, but said ""the real test will be will the Department of Justice release the files,"" or would the files be ""tied up"" in investigations.

Trump says he won’t rule out sending troops into Venezuela

Trump says he has not ruled out putting American forces on the ground in Venezuela, but he’s also holding out the possibility he’d speak with the country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, whom the administration accuses of running a cartel, an allegation Maduro denies.

House is expected to vote on the Epstein files bill around 2 p.m.

The House is set to vote around 2 p.m. on the bill that would compel the Justice Department to release files related to the Epstein case.

The bill needs the support of two-thirds of the House members because the legislation is being considered under suspension of the rules, an expedited process typically used when a measure is expected to have enough votes to advance. Typically, a discharge petition like the one a majority of House members used to force the vote on the bill would require seven legislative days of waiting.

“Almost everybody” will vote for the legislation, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told NBC News last night, adding that leaders aren’t telling members how to vote.

If passed, the bill would head next to the Senate.

Immigration arrests in Charlotte have sparked fears, leading businesses to close

Jonathan Ocampo has called this Southern city home for six years, but, after immigration enforcement descended here over the weekend, the American citizen of Colombian descent said he doesn’t leave the house without his U.S. passport.

“I’m carrying it here right now, which is sad,” he told NBC News. Ocampo said he worries that his father, a citizen who has been in the country for 40 years, could be targeted because of being Hispanic-looking and speaking what he described as very broken English.

“It’s just scary,” he said.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, more than 130 people have been arrested since Border Patrol began an immigration enforcement push it calls “Operation Charlotte’s Web” on Saturday, putting many residents and business owners of the state’s largest city on edge. A popular Latino bakery was closed Monday over fears of Border Patrol activity. Several small businesses in a shopping center also shut their doors Monday after immigration authorities were seen smashing the car window of a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, Willy Aceituno, over the weekend.

Rep. Thomas Massie warns new DOJ investigations could prevent the release of more Epstein docs

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who spearheaded the Epstein discharge petition, suggested last evening that new Justice Department probes Trump directed to explore Epstein’s ties to other high-profile figures could block the release of more documents.

“I’m concerned that now he’s opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That’s my concern,” Massie told reporters outside the Capitol.

“I’m afraid they’re going to try to use a provision of the law that allows you not to release these materials if they’re subject of an ongoing investigation and would harm, the release of which would harm the ongoing investigation,” he added.

Trump directed the Justice Department on Friday to investigate Epstein’s ties to notable Democrats.

Asked about Trump encouraging Republicans to vote for Massie’s measure — a sudden reversal of his position on releasing the Epstein files — Massie said it’s because “for four months, [Trump] thought the best thing for him was to keep the file secret, and somebody convinced him that the best thing for him was to release the files.”

“If they’re serious about it, they should release them right now. It’s that simple,” he said.

Trump encouraged House Republicans over the weekend to pass the measure, saying, “We have nothing to hide.”

As for how the vote today will go, Massie predicted his bill will pass with a veto-proof majority.

Zelenskyy, U.S. envoy will visit Turkey in a new bid to end the Russia-Ukraine war

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that he will travel to Turkey this week in an attempt to jump-start negotiations on ending Russia’s invasion, which began nearly four years ago.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff will join him in Turkey, a senior Turkish official told The Associated Press, but the Kremlin said that Russia won’t be sending anyone.

Turkey provided a setting for low-level talks between Ukraine and Russia earlier this year, though the only significant progress in Istanbul was on exchanging prisoners of war. U.S.-led international peace efforts have brought no breakthrough, either.

Zelenskyy said that he would be in Turkey tomorrow, a day after visiting Spain, where he hoped for pledges of new support today.

“We are preparing to reinvigorate negotiations, and we have developed solutions that we will propose to our partners,” Zelenskyy said on social media, without providing details. “Doing everything possible to bring the end of the war closer is Ukraine’s top priority.”

Heavy new American sanctions on Russia’s all-important oil industry, devised to push Putin to the negotiating table, are due to take effect Friday. The sanctions against oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil seek to starve Putin’s war machine of cash and halt its grinding war of attrition, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Ukraine.

‘I am deeply ashamed’: Larry Summers to step back from public commitments after new Epstein emails

Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, said yesterday that he will be stepping back from public commitments following the recent publication of his correspondence with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,” Summers said in a statement.

The House Oversight Committee last week released more than 20,000 emails from Epstein’s estate, which included extensive correspondence between the disgraced financier and Summers. The most recent one was from the day before Epstein was arrested in 2019.

“While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me,” Summers added in his statement.

Hundreds of federalized National Guard members are set to leave Illinois and Oregon

Hundreds of federalized National Guard members sent to Illinois and Oregon will return to their home states as early as this week, a defense official told NBC News yesterday.

The official said that 200 California National Guard members activated for the greater Portland area will head back home, leaving 100 members of the Oregon National Guard in place. In Illinois, 200 Texas National Guard members will depart the state, leaving 300 Illinois Guard members there.

The remaining guards will be conducting training, but are not on mission to protect federal property or personnel.

Saudi crown prince returns to U.S. for first time after diplomatic isolation

Whether viewed as a visionary reformist or a murderous despot, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, will be taking a huge step toward rejoining the international community when he meets with Trump at the White House today.

Crown Prince Mohammed, 40, became an international pariah after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government, in 2018, though Trump defended the Saudi government even after the CIA concluded that the crown prince himself ordered the killing.

Then-President Joe Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2022 and controversially fist-bumped him, an image that went viral, at a time when most leaders had shunned the crown prince. The crown prince said in 2019 that he took “full responsibility” for the Khashoggi killing since it happened on his watch, but denied ordering it.

But it is the crown prince’s trip today, his first during Trump’s second term, that will be seen more broadly as a move toward acceptance back into the diplomatic fold.

House poised to pass a bill to force the release of the Epstein files in a bipartisan vote

The House is poised to vote overwhelmingly today for legislation to compel the Justice Department to release all its records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a major victory for the lawmakers in both parties who’ve been leading the push for months.

The measure, which last week secured enough bipartisan support to head straight to the House floor, got another boost over the weekend, when Trump reversed his position and urged Republicans to support it.

The bipartisan duo who co-authored the legislation — Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif. — are working to secure a veto-proof majority in the House, and they predict that as many as 100 Republicans could vote for it. The number could climb even higher now that Trump has given his blessing.

“Almost everybody” will vote for it, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told NBC News, adding that leaders aren’t telling members how to vote.

In his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.","For at least five days, a blind Ecuadorean man who was arrested this month in New York City by U.S. immigration authorities was held in isolation at a county jail, locked in his cell for 24 hours a day and deprived of his cane.

“I feel so terrible I cannot see and that I cannot walk, read or do things on my own,” Carlos Anibal Chalco Chango, 40, said last week in a declaration prepared by his lawyers based on their conversations with him.

On Monday night, after days of pressure from the lawyers, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency relented: Mr. Chalco Chango was released from the Orange County jail in upstate New York. It was a surprising move by an agency that rarely releases detainees under President Trump.

The two-week effort by his lawyers to free him came amid pitched legal battles playing out across the United States, as lawyers file emergency motions to have ICE release migrants who are being subjected to mandatory detention.

Unlike Mr. Chalco Chango, many of the more than 60,000 immigrants in detention don’t have lawyers. Most are forced to fight deportation alone, leaving many to consider the Trump administration’s offers to leave the country voluntarily to avoid months in jail.

What distinguished the Ecuadorean man’s case was his disability.

ICE agents arrested Mr. Chalco Chango on Nov. 4 as he was leaving his home in Corona, Queens, an immigrant-rich neighborhood where advocates and local officials have documented an increase in arrests of mostly Hispanic men this month.

The federal immigration agents were seeking to arrest Mr. Chalco Chango’s 20-year-old son, and they approached the older man to show him a picture of their “intended target” on a cellphone, according to government filings.

Mr. Chalco Chango told them that he was blind and could not see the image, according to his lawyers, who said the agents pushed him against a wall, handcuffed him and put him inside a car. An agent told him in Spanish to call his son and tell him to turn himself in, his lawyers said. Then, the agent said, Mr. Chalco Chango would be free to go.

But when Mr. Chalco Chango’s son showed up, the agents arrested him, too. Both men were whisked away to 26 Federal Plaza, the ICE offices in Lower Manhattan, setting off the legal saga to release him.

The federal government said in filings that the agents had “engaged in a consensual conversation” with Mr. Chalco Chango, who they said “freely admitted to the officers” that he had no legal status.

Mr. Chalco Chango crossed the southern border into the United States with his son in 2023. Border Patrol agents who encountered them released them to seek asylum, according to filings.

After his Nov. 4 arrest, Mr. Chalco Chango was placed in a holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza, where he was barred from having his cane or using a text-to-audio phone app that could help him read legal documents.

After a judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr. of Manhattan federal court, ruled that Mr. Chalco Chango could not be removed from the country, ICE moved him on Nov. 8 to the Orange County jail.

There, officials said they had “serious concerns” about safely accommodating him in the jail’s general population because of his blindness, according to a court filing by the office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

In a letter on Monday informing Judge Carter of Mr. Chalco Chango’s release, the government said it considered the case moot, a suggestion that no further proceedings over his detention were necessary. The judge directed the parties to send him a joint letter by Thursday addressing whether they agreed that the case was moot, though Mr. Chalco Chango’s separate immigration case still appears unresolved.

Paige Austin and Harold A. Solis, lawyers at Make the Road New York, an advocacy group representing Mr. Chalco Chango, said in an interview on Tuesday that they wanted assurances from ICE that their client would not be detained in the future.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In his declaration to the court, Mr. Chalco Chango described, in vivid detail, feeling helpless while in isolation in the jail.

He thought his cell might have a clock, he said, but he could not see it. He could, however, detect when people were outside the cell by the shadows they cast.

So when he saw shadows, he added, “I try to ask through the door — what time is it?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/18/multimedia/18met-immigrant-blind-pzqf/18met-immigrant-blind-pzqf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 18:58:06.598598

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.

Topline:

The man accused of igniting a fire that led to the deadly and destructive Palisades Fire in January will remain in custody without bond, U.S. Judge Rozella Oliver decided Tuesday in Los Angeles. Jonathan Rinderknecht has been in custody since his arrest in Florida on Oct. 7.

Where things stand: Rinderknecht was indicted by a federal grand jury in October and is charged with one count of arson, one count of timber set afire and one count of destruction of property by means of fire. Rinderknecht pleaded not guilty in mid-October and faces anywhere from five to 45 years in federal prison if convicted. His trial is set to begin April 21, 2026. His lawyers recently asked the court to allow him out of custody as he awaits trial.

Argument against release: In a filing on Monday, prosecutors said Rinderknecht is a flight risk because of his familial ties to France, as well as a danger to the community. The filing states that Rinderknecht threatened to burn down his sister’s home and that he purchased a gun and threatened to kill his brother-in-law. Prosecutors also raised the fact that a judge determined in October that the suspect’s mental health had declined.

The allegations: Authorities allege Rinderknecht set fire to brush near the Skull Rock Trailhead in the Santa Monica Mountains at around midnight Jan. 1, starting the Lachman Fire. Though the fire was held to just 8 acres and was believed to have been extinguished, authorities say it flared up once again amid strong, dry winds a week later. That fire grew into the Palisades Fire, which killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,800 structures.

Go deeper: How could the Palisades Fire have reignited after a week? Experts explain

California law requires banks to let homeowners delay their mortgage payments for up to one year as they recover from the January fires. But that period rapidly is coming to a close, and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass says the timeline should be much longer.

On Tuesday, Bass asked mortgage companies to voluntarily extend relief for another three years, which would bring the total forbearance period to four years after the Palisades and Eaton fires destroyed thousands of homes.

“Many impacted residents remain in temporary housing and face mounting financial strain,” Bass said in a news release. “They're piecing life together while having to negotiate with contractors and wait for insurance claims to come through.

""Asking them to shoulder mortgage payments on top of all that would force them into an impossible — and unacceptable — choice.”

How mortgage relief currently works

Under Assembly Bill 238, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in September, homeowners affected by the Palisades or Eaton fires can request mortgage forbearance for up to 12 months. The law extended a previous 90-day forbearance period that banks agreed to honor after the fires.

Bass’ office said she wants the banks to agree to let homeowners take another three years of deferred payments and put them on the back end of their mortgage.

The mayor also is requesting that banks refrain from charging fees or penalties and leave mortgage holders’ credit scores unaffected by the extended relief period.

‘This is not like a free lunch’

Richard Green, director of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, said he’s not sure Bass will convince banks to agree to these terms. And he said homeowners would need to closely scrutinize any relief plan.

Depending on the details around interest payments, he said, some homeowners could exit the forbearance period owing more on their mortgage than their property is worth.

“Consumers would have to understand that this is not like a free lunch,” Green said.

He compared Bass’ proposal to President Donald Trump’s recent suggestion about creating a 50-year mortgage to address nationwide housing affordability concerns. Both plans adjust financing terms without tackling the fundamental reason housing costs so much, he said.

“It's not a great deal,” Green said. “We need to be able to build more housing faster, whether it's in the aftermath of a disaster or not.”

Temporary relocation money is running out

Last month, a nonprofit group called Department of Angels released a survey of thousands of fire survivors that found about 80% of residents displaced by the Eaton Fire and about 90% of those displaced by the Palisades Fire still have not returned to their previous homes.

Many now are paying rent for temporary housing in addition to their regular mortgage payment. The survey found that within the next year, 23% of Altadena residents and 29% of Pacific Palisades residents will run out of insurance payments that cover the cost of that new rent.

The Trump administration unveiled a sweeping plan Tuesday to sidestep Congress and outsource large pieces of the U.S. Department of Education, telling lawmakers and staff that it would shift work dedicated to, among other things, elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education and Indian education to other federal agencies.

All three of those offices were originally placed at the department by Congress when it created the agency in 1979, and these moves are being made without Congress' consent.

According to two people who were briefed on the plan by the Trump administration, and who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, the administration has forged six new agreements between the Education Department and other agencies, offloading day-to-day operations of congressionally-required programs while retaining a small contingent of staff at the department.

For example, under these new agreements, much of the work of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, which includes managing Title I, a key federal funding stream that helps schools support low-income students, would shift to the U.S. Department of Labor, as would much of the work of the Office of Postsecondary Education.

The U.S. Department of the Interior would take on much of the work of the department's Office of Indian Education.

The U.S. Department of State would take on international education and foreign language studies programming.

Responsibility for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School (CCAMPIS) program, which offers childcare on college campuses to low-income student-parents, would move to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

In a USA Today op-ed published Sunday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote of this kind of agreement: ""We'll peel back the layers of federal bureaucracy by partnering with agencies that are better suited to manage programs and empowering states and local leaders to oversee the rest. These partnerships are commonplace across the federal government to improve service delivery and increase efficiency.""

In July, the Education Department announced one such agreement with the Labor Department, in which Labor took on responsibility for adult education and family literacy programs previously administered by the Education Department, though an Education Department release insisted, ""The programs will be managed alongside [Education Department] staff, with continued leadership and oversight by [the Education Department].""

Tuesday's agreements do not include a handful of the department's signature responsibilities, including special education, student civil rights enforcement and student loans.

Opponents of the administration's move say, given that Congress created these offices and explicitly located them inside the Education Department, the White House cannot legally move their work without Congress' approval.

U.S. Senator Patty Murray, D-Wash., a senior member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement, ""This is an outright illegal effort to continue dismantling the Department of Education, and it is students and families who will suffer the consequences as key programs that help students learn to read or that strengthen ties between schools and families are spun off to agencies with little to no relevant expertise and are gravely weakened—or even completely broken—in the process.""

In briefing lawmakers and staff, the department insisted that these programs' statutory responsibilities would remain at the department, even if the work would be done elsewhere.

It's unclear if retaining a modicum of department staff, in partnership with other agencies, will be enough to convince the courts the administration is following federal law.

According to NPR's two sources, the briefing was led by Lindsey Burke, now deputy chief of staff for policy and programs at the department, who also co-authored the education section of the conservative government blueprint, Project 2025, outlining how to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.

""The federal Department of Education should be eliminated. When power is exercised, it should empower students and families, not government,"" Burke wrote.

There will likely be legal challenges opposing Tuesday's moves.

That’s what more than 40 of my brothers and sisters in arms will tell Congress today. The ACLU, Common Defense, and the Chamberlain Network join these veterans on Capitol Hill, where they’re urging all our elected representatives to stop the Trump administration’s misuse of the military. We know that putting troops in our communities for political purposes breaks public trust and is disrespectful to their service.

Guided By Service

This mobilization on Capitol Hill is a seminal moment for those pushing back on the Trump administration’s abuses of power -- and it’s one I relate to. My family has served this country for multiple generations. I’m a veteran myself, a former U.S. Army captain, and someone who feels strongly that we need to go to congresspeople, not wait for them to come to us.

When I was commissioned in 2000, it was uncommon for women to be assigned to combat arms branches, and I was one of only a handful of women assigned to the Field Artillery, a combat arms branch. Although other women officers were sent to work in training units, I fought for and won an assignment with a forces command (FORSCOM) unit, joined my unit shortly before September 11, 2001 and subsequently deployed in 2003. While most soldiers carried religious items on them, as a young Army officer deployed overseas, I had a pocket U.S. Constitution in the lining of my helmet because I believed so deeply in the values I swore an oath to defend.

""I had a pocket U.S. Constitution in the lining of my helmet because I believed so deeply in the values I swore an oath to defend.""

This year marks the 250th birthday of the Army, Marines, and Navy. We can’t let our armed forces, which were created to defend our liberties, devolve into an arm of someone’s political pursuits. But that’s what we have seen take place this year. President Donald Trump and his administration have sent troops into our communities and enacted policies that roll back civil rights progress.

Already we’ve seen President Trump federalize National Guard troops and other service members to cities under the guise of keeping communities safe. Often, this is happening without the consent of state governors and officials. As a veteran, I am working every day to stop this abuse of power.

Military Troops Do Not Belong on Our Streets

I’m joining the dozens of veterans on Capitol Hill for the same reason I first joined the military years ago: to protect and defend the Constitution. The oath didn’t end when I took off my uniform, and as commander in chief, President Trump also took an oath to protect the Constitution.

In the United States, the federal military should not be used for domestic law enforcement. That is a fundamental principle embodied in the Posse Comitatus Act, one that helps separate our democracy from dictatorships abroad. History shows what happens when we cross that line. The tragedy at Ohio’s Kent State University in 1970, when National Guard troops shot at student demonstrators, proves that putting military troops in our communities can result in disastrous consequences. National Guard troops should be reserved for genuine emergencies, not deployed to our cities to serve the president’s political whims. Kent State continues to serve as a reminder of what happens when we comingle military troops and policing of civilians.

President Trump’s ongoing use of militarized force is not about safety; it’s about asserting power. Over the summer, his administration sent troops and armed federal agents into Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. His administration continues to threaten to send them to Chicago, and Portland despite objections from city and state leaders.

Military troops -- and armed federal agents in masks who appropriate military uniforms -- do not make our communities safer or safeguard our rights. These deployments erode the public’s trust in a non-partisan military when our neighbors struggle to understand why troops are patrolling their communities, or to distinguish between National Guard and federal agents. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents often wear military-style uniforms or gear, creating confusion that further erodes public trust. True safety comes from strong and supported communities, not from local militarization. That’s why so many veterans, active-duty service members, and military families have joined the ACLU and others in condemning these dangerous and escalatory actions.

The Politicization of the Military Must Stop

Time and again, we’ve seen how, when the military crosses the line to civilian law enforcement, the fabric of our democracy decays. The Trump administration’s dangerous misuse of the military does not begin or end with troops deployed to our cities. It extends to the politicization of the military itself.

In September, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth summoned hundreds of senior military leaders to Quantico and delivered remarks attacking the principles of equity and accountability. President Trump followed with a disturbing address urging troops to use U.S. cities as “training grounds” to fight the “enemy within.” These are not the words of leaders strengthening national defense; this is a weaponization of the military that threatens our Constitution.

Secretary Hegseth’s agenda goes further. He has moved to weaken service members’ ability to report assault, harassment, and discrimination. He also called for combat standards to “return to the highest male standard,” even though all combat roles have been gender-neutral since 2016. He spent his first months in office purging the highest levels of the military of women leaders and Black senior officers, as well as axing the Women, Peace, and Security Program that was started in the president’s first term.

As one of the few women who served in a combat arms role before it officially opened up, these attempts to dismantle progress towards the military becoming more welcoming are barbaric. The strength of our military has always come from its professionalism and unity of purpose, not from political loyalty. When leaders use the armed forces to promote a partisan political agenda, they betray the values our service members swear to defend.

When we plague the military with politics, we reduce the effectiveness of a force that is supposed to be ready for real emergencies. Our troops deserve leadership that values service to the Constitution over service to any specific president. It’s what we took an oath to do.

How We Can Act

America must be a place where everyone is safe in their neighborhoods and free to speak their minds. When troops are on our streets, we make one of our founders’ biggest fears – that a leader will send his army to police the people – a dangerous reality. Congress must act now to protect our freedoms by pulling troops out of our cities. It has the power to restrict any future deployments into our cities.

I stand with the veterans on Capitol Hill. We must lawfully protest troops on our streets and end the politicization of the military. I know my fellow veterans are not alone in asking our government to do right by our troops. All Americans must join together, on Capitol Hill and beyond, to urge the Trump administration to withdraw federal troops from our neighborhoods now.

Today, we sent a message to Congress in person doing exactly that. We urged them to co-sponsor the Military in Law Enforcement Accountability Act in the Senate and the National Guard Proper Use Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. These are vital steps to curbing the president’s ability to deploy National Guard troops for improper domestic law enforcement.

I am proud of my service to this country. Most of all, I want to ensure our military remains a respected institution in service to the people, not a single president, for the next 250 years.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/11/veteran-op-ed-social.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 17:56:44.116627

Then, on November 16, he told House Republicans to vote in favour of the release.

His shift came after lawmakers cleared a significant hurdle on November 12, netting 218 signatures on a petition to force a vote on a bill to release the files within 30 days. The House is expected to vote on that bill this week. Previously, it was considered unlikely the legislation would pass in the Senate; it remains to be seen whether Trump’s latest statement will cause senators to reconsider.

Epstein moved in the same social circles as Trump in the 1990s, including attending parties at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private Palm Beach, Florida, club. The two were photographed together in social settings multiple times. They later had a falling out, a rift that some reporters dated to late 2007.

Palm Beach County prosecutors investigated Epstein after reports that a 14-year-old girl was molested at his mansion. In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges related to soliciting prostitution from someone under 18. He received preferential treatment during the criminal investigation and served about a year in jail, largely on work release.

In 2018, The Miami Herald published an extensive investigation into the case, and the next year, Epstein was arrested on federal charges for recruiting dozens of underage girls to his New York City mansion and Palm Beach estate from 2002 to 2005 to engage in sex acts for money. He was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, and investigators concluded he died by suicide.

We asked the White House why Trump changed his stance on releasing the files. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, “President Trump has been consistently calling for transparency related to the Epstein files for years – by releasing tens of thousands of pages of documents, cooperating with the House Oversight Committee’s subpoena request” and calling for investigations into “Epstein’s Democrat friends”.

Here’s what Trump has said in 2024 and 2025 about releasing the Epstein files.

In June 2024, Fox and Friends co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy asked Trump if he would declassify various files, including those related to 9/11 and former President John F Kennedy.

“Would you declassify the Epstein files?” Campos-Duffy said.

“Yeah, yeah, I would,” Trump said.

The clip spread on social media, and Trump’s campaign account also shared it.

During the same interview, Trump also said, “I guess I would.” He added, “You don’t want to affect people’s lives if it’s phoney stuff in there because there is a lot of phoney stuff with that whole world, but I think I would.”

On a September 2024 episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, during a discussion about releasing some of the Epstein documents, Trump said, “Yeah, I’d certainly take a look at it.” He added that he’d be “inclined” to do it and said, “I’d have no problem with it.”

In 2025, Trump was dismissive of the Epstein files

Early in the second Trump administration, Trump officials – including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, who became the FBI director – said they supported releasing the files.

In late February at a White House event, Bondi released what she called the “first phase” of “declassified Epstein files” to conservative influencers. It largely consisted of documents that had already been made public.

In a July 12 Truth Social post, Trump expressed frustration about the Epstein files. Speaking to reporters on July 15 on the White House lawn, Trump said the files “were made up by Comey. They were made up by Obama. They were made up by Biden.” We rated that claim Pants on Fire.

Trump said the FBI should focus on investigating other issues, such as voter fraud, and that his administration should “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about”.

In a July 16 interview with Real America’s Voice, a conservative outlet, Trump said, “I think in the case of Epstein, they’ve already looked at it and they are looking at it and I think all they have to do is put out anything credible. But you know, that was run by the Biden administration for four years.”

On August 22, a reporter asked Trump if he was in favour of releasing the files.

“I’m in support of keeping it open,” he said. “Innocent people shouldn’t be hurt, but I’m in support of keeping it totally open. I couldn’t care less. You got a lot of people that could be mentioned in those files that don’t deserve to be, people – because he knew everybody in Palm Beach. I don’t know anything about that, but I have said to Pam (Bondi) and everybody else, give them everything you can give them because it’s a Democrat hoax.”

On September 3, a reporter asked Trump a question about efforts to release the Epstein files and if the Justice Department was protecting any friends or donors.

Trump said it was a “Democrat hoax that never ends” and “we’ve given thousands of pages of files”.

This month, Trump called for releasing the files

Trump came out in support of releasing the files after it became clear the House was headed in that direction.

The House Oversight Committee, on November 12, released about 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein’s estate.

Trump directed prosecutors to investigate Democrats and told Republicans to vote in favour of releasing the files.

Trump has often noted Epstein’s ties to former President Bill Clinton. In a November 14 Truth Social post, Trump asked the Justice Department to investigate Epstein’s involvement with Clinton.

Typically, prosecutors do not release files during an ongoing investigation, so Trump’s announcement raised questions about whether the Justice Department will withhold certain files even if Congress votes to release them.

When a reporter asked Trump on November 14 about releasing the files, he said, “I don’t care about it, released or not.”

Two days later, in a November 16 post, Trump said, “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide, and it’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown.’’",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25198369121958-1-1763447150.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-11-18 19:57:19.705409

Tuesday’s ruling restores the 2021 map of Texas congressional districts.","A panel of federal judges has ruled that Texas’s newly redrawn congressional districts cannot be used in next year’s 2026 midterm elections, striking a blow to Republican efforts to tilt races in their favour.

On Tuesday, a two-to-one majority at the US District Court for western Texas blocked the map, on the basis that there was “substantial evidence” to show “that Texas racially gerrymandered” the districts.

Partisan gerrymandering has generally been considered legal under court precedent, but dividing congressional maps along racial lines is considered a violation of the US Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

“The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics,” the court’s majority wrote in the opening of its 160-page opinion.

The ruling marked a major setback to efforts to redraw congressional districts ahead of the critically important midterms, which decide the composition of the US Congress.

All 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs in that election. With Republicans holding a narrow 219-seat majority, analysts speculate that control of the chamber could potentially switch parties.

Texas, a Republican stronghold, had kicked off a nationwide race to redesign congressional districts in favour of one party or the other.

In June, news reports emerged that the administration of President Donald Trump had reached out to state officials to redraw the red state’s map, in order to gain five additional House seats for Republicans.

Despite hesitations and a walkout by state Democrats, the Texas legislature passed a new, gerrymandered map in August.

That inspired other right-leaning states, notably North Carolina and Missouri, to similarly redraw their districts. North Carolina and Missouri each passed a map that would gain Republicans one additional House seat.

Texas’s actions also sparked a Democratic backlash. California Governor Gavin Newsom spearheaded a ballot campaign in his heavily blue state to pass a proposition in November that would suspend an independent districting commission and instead pass a partisan map, skewed in favour of Democrats.

Voters passed the ballot initiative overwhelmingly in November, teeing up Democrats to gain five extra seats in California next year.

The state redistricting battle has sparked myriad legal challenges, including the one decided in Texas on Tuesday.

In that case, civil rights groups accused the Texas government of attempting to dilute the power of Black and Hispanic voters.

Judges David Guaderrama, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Jeffrey V Brown, a Trump appointee, wrote the majority decision in favour of the plaintiffs.

A third judge — Jerry Smith, appointed under Ronald Reagan — dissented from their decision.

Writing for the majority, Brown said that Trump official Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, made the “legally incorrect assertion” that four congressional districts in the state were “unconstitutional” because they had non-white majorities.

The letter Dhillon sent containing that assertion helped prompt the Texas redistricting fight, Brown argued.

The judge also pointed to statements Texas Governor Greg Abbott made, seeming to reference the racial composition of the districts. If the new map’s aims were purely partisan and not racial, Brown indicated that it was curious no majority-white districts were targeted.

Tuesday’s ruling restores the 2021 map of Texas congressional districts. Currently, the state is represented by 25 Republicans and 12 Democrats in the US House.

Already, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has pledged to appeal the ruling before the US Supreme Court.

“The radical left is once again trying to undermine the will of the people. The Big Beautiful Map was entirely legal and passed for partisan purposes to better represent the political affiliations of Texas,” Paxton wrote in a statement posted to social media.

He expressed optimism about his odds before the conservative-leaning Supreme Court. “I fully expect the Court to uphold Texas’s sovereign right to engage in partisan redistricting.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25322660177919-1763495102.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-18 21:57:01.864931

Immigration officials respond to Bro-Tex in St. Paul

What we know:

According to reports from the scene from Pioneer Press reporter Frederick Melo, at least one person was removed from a building by federal agents, and a chemical irritant was deployed as protesters ""swarmed"" authorities outside Bro-Tex Inc. in St. Paul.

Video from the scene shared by 50501 Minnesota and Women's March Minnesota on social media features a lot of screaming and yelling, and as federal officials try to leave, protesters try to stop them. Officials physical interacted with protesters, and at least one protester threw an item at a departing vehicle.

A St. Paul City Council staffer confirmed to FOX 9 that federal agents on scene included the FBI, ICE, DEA and HSI (Homeland Security Investigations). St. Paul and Ramsey County were not there nor involved.

Federal agents had cleared the scene prior to noon on Tuesday. A spokesperson for ICE confirmed their investigation to FOX 9 Tuesday afternoon:

""Today in St. Paul, ICE HSI and law enforcement partners conducted court authorized law enforcement activity and served a search warrant in furtherance of a federal criminal investigation. There is no threat to public safety, and the investigation remains ongoing at this time.""

Mayor Carter statement on ICE operations

What they're saying:

Mayor Carter released a statement on Tuesday afternoon calling the federal response ""ICE operations."" The mayor is in ""close communication"" with the city attorney's office and St. Paul Police Department.

""Though we don't have many details right now, I share the concern and fear this raises for our workers, families and entire community,"" Carter said in the statement. ""Remember you have rights.""

At the scene of the ICE operations earlier on Tuesday, Mayor Carter, giving an example of similar raids around the country, said federal agents ""grab a roofing crew"" and are doing so without warrants. It's unclear what happened in Tuesday morning's incident.

The City of St. Paul has immigration resources available on its website.

St. Paul council member demands transparency

What they're saying:

Molly Coleman is on the St. Paul City Council and represents Ward 4, where Tuesday's raid involving federal agents took place. She joined FOX 9's All Day to give her account of the events, and is seeking transparency. She says city officials started to hear about a large federal enforcement mobilization early in the morning. Their initial information suggested it was not an ICE raid, but a lawful, permissible enforcement.

Coleman says the scene escalated due to the size of the law enforcement response and the force they used. The injuries suffered by community members and protesters were largely due to chemical irritants. Some people were shoved to the ground by agents. Coleman says she doesn't know where some community members are, and why others have been detained. She said at least three were placed in a vehicle and detained.

Coleman says they want transparency on what happened, and why.

""As a St. Paul City Council member, if I call the federal government and say tell me where you took our people, they’re not answering, they’re not calling me back. That’s true for elected officials throughout the state at all levels of government,"" Coleman said. ""I think it’s immensely concerning we have a federal government that is so uninterested in telling the truth to the people of St. Paul. It’s a very difficult and troubling situation.""

MN lawmakers react to ICE raid

Local perspective:

The Minnesota House's St. Paul delegation released the following statement following Tuesday's federal response in St. Paul:

""This morning, we have been monitoring incidents with federal agents in our city. We have been in contact with local law enforcement and elected leaders, and we will continue to work with them to protect our community.

""To all our constituents in St. Paul, we want to say: be a good neighbor, take precautions, know your constitutional and civil rights, document any incidents with federal law enforcement, and make sure you protect yourself. If you find yourself in need of assistance, please contact local law enforcement or get in touch with community organizations. Always remember that you have rights.""

Immigration Defense Network to hold vigil on Wednesday

What's next:

In a press release on Tuesday, the Immigration Defense Network said it will hold an ""urgent community vigil"" and press availability at 9 a.m. on Wednesday outside Bro-Tex in response to what happened Tuesday morning.

The Immigrant Defense Network on Tuesday afternoon said federal agents ""stormed"" a workplace, ""detained workers, deployed chemical irritants,"" adding that Tuesday's ""escalation was unacceptable"" because workers were taken from their jobs.

""What happened today is not law enforcement — it is an assault on our community,"" said a representative from the Immigrant Defense Network on Tuesday. ""No one should fear that simply going to work, providing for their family, or standing up for their neighbors will result in federal agents storming a workplace, detaining people en masse, and deploying chemical weapons against Minnesotans.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/11/1280/720/st-paul-protest-ice.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-11-18 16:57:33.396084

And rightfully so.” Some of Ms. Greene’s colleagues were more interested in simply falling in line, as usual, with Mr. Trump.","Attention now turns to the Senate, which had been keeping the Epstein issue at arm’s length but now plans to take up and pass the bill this week, clearing it for Mr. Trump’s signature. The president, who toiled for months to derail the bill but reversed himself once it was clear it would pass overwhelmingly, has said he would sign it.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said his chamber would move quickly — and probably unanimously — on the bill without considering any changes.

“When a bill passes 427 to 1, and the president says he’ll sign it into law, I’m not sure there’s going to be a need or desire for an amendment process,” he said.

In the House, the sole lawmaker to vote “no” was Representative Clay Higgins, a far-right Republican from Louisiana.

Even as all of them voted to demand the release of the files, Republican leaders dismissed the measure as a “political show vote” driven by Democrats who were only feigning interest in the Epstein saga in the hopes of inflicting political damage on Mr. Trump. And even though the president has said he would sign the bill if it were to reach his desk, its proponents raised questions about whether the Justice Department would ultimately release the files.

“I’ve been opposed to it all along,” Speaker Mike Johnson said at a morning news conference before the vote, standing next to a poster board with five bullet points citing the “dangers” of a measure that he ultimately supported, along with his entire conference.

Acknowledging the reason he had tried for months to keep the bill off the floor, Mr. Johnson said he had no choice but to support a piece of legislation he considered deeply flawed because of the political blowback he would receive for voting no.

“None of us want to go on record and in any way be accused of not being for maximum transparency,” he said.

Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who cosponsored the measure and led the charge to force a vote on it, said the vote was overdue.

“The speaker was dragged to it kicking and screaming, but here we are,” he said. “It’s not necessarily a rebalancing of the branches of government, but a rebalancing of the people against the executive branch.”

The top Senate Democrat said he would push for immediate consideration of the bill Mr. Thune failed to do so in short order.

“The American people have waited long enough,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters, saying the action could come as soon as later on Tuesday. “They want to see what’s in it.”

Proponents of the measure worked to keep pressure on Mr. Trump to follow through and release the files, something that does not require an act of Congress but that he has chosen not to do.

“The real test will be, will the Department of Justice release the files, or will it all remain tied up in investigations?” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who broke hard with Mr. Trump on the Epstein matter, said at a morning news conference outside the Capitol.

There, she was joined by some of the victims of Mr. Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in prison in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges. Standing outside the Capitol, some of the survivors directed their remarks at Mr. Trump.

“While I do understand that your position has changed on the Epstein files, and I’m grateful that you have pledged to sign this bill, I can’t help to be skeptical of what the agenda is,” said Haley Robson, who met Mr. Epstein when she was 16 and has said she recruited friends to his sex-trafficking ring after being abused herself.

The vote capped a monthslong effort by Republicans to make sure that this day never came to pass. Mr. Trump leaned aggressively on three Republicans who signed a petition that made it possible for the proponents to circumvent leadership and force the floor vote to happen.

He called the holdouts personally and had White House officials issue warnings to the rank-and-file that support for the discharge petition would be viewed as a “hostile act” by the administration.

But the pressure campaign backfired. In the case of the three hard-right Republicans — all women — who refused to remove their names, people familiar with their thinking said, it only caused them to dig in more.

In the House, Mr. Johnson vociferously opposed the petition. He claimed that the bill did not do enough to protect victims’ privacy, even though it included language that did so. He said it was unnecessary given that a House committee was investigating the handling of the Epstein case. And for weeks after her special election victory in Arizona, Mr. Johnson refused to seat Representative Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, who had said she would provide the final signature needed to force the vote on the floor as soon as she was sworn in.

Mr. Johnson finally did so last week and Ms. Grijalva signed, putting the petition at the 218-signature threshold to represent a House majority and guarantee a floor vote.

Unwilling to take what was certain to be a humiliating loss on the House floor, Mr. Trump then reversed himself on the matter and called on his party to back the bill.

Many Republicans in Congress followed suit, embracing a bill they claimed to have supported all along.

In their upside-down telling, Mr. Trump had consistently fought for the release of the Epstein files. And so had they.

Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, said the action was “an important vote to continue to show the transparency that we’ve delivered.”

On the House floor on Tuesday before the vote, Democrats noted that Mr. Trump did not need a vote in Congress at all to release the files and accused Republicans of having tried to hide behind procedure to block the vote.

“Donald Trump could release these files on his own,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. He accused Republican leaders of trying to block the vote “for months and months and months.”

Republicans, in turn, highlighted the fact that their own Oversight Committee investigation led to the release of a trove of documents from Mr. Epstein — though they did not mention that it was Democrats who had forced them to begin the inquiry. They claimed that they had opposed the vote because they wanted more justice for Mr. Epstein’s victims.

“We now know that Epstein himself hated President Trump,” said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, referring to emails Mr. Epstein wrote to his associates regarding the president. “It’s in black and white.”

But the fight has left lasting rifts and grudges within Mr. Trump’s coalition. On Tuesday morning, Ms. Greene defended herself against Mr. Trump’s charge that she was a “traitor” for backing the release of the Epstein files.

“A traitor is an American that serves foreign countries and themselves,” she said, standing in front of Mr. Epstein’s victims. “A patriot is an American that serves the United States of America, and Americans like the women standing behind me.”

Later on the House floor, she laid out why the Epstein episode had resonated so strongly with Mr. Trump’s populist base even as the president has sought to change the subject.

“These American women aren’t rich, powerful elites,” Ms. Greene said, speaking from the Democratic side of the chamber. She added, “These are your average Americans.”

She said the Epstein files represented the “failures” of the government and Congress to their citizens. “For far too long, Americans have been put last, and they’re sick and tired of it,” she said. “This is why they don’t trust Congress. This is why they don’t trust the government.”

Ms. Greene noted that she and the three other House Republicans who forced the vote endured attempts at intimidation for months. “This is what the American people are sick of. And rightfully so.”

Some of Ms. Greene’s colleagues were more interested in simply falling in line, as usual, with Mr. Trump. And they were not ashamed to hide it.

Representative Troy Nehls, Republican of Texas, who had staked out a firm “no” position on the release of the files just days ago, dismissing it all as the “Epstein hoax” devised by Democrats to “distract us from the winning of President Trump and his administration,” was unapologetic about his about-face. He conceded that he was merely doing what Mr. Trump had said to.

“It is a hoax by the Democrats against Trump,” Mr. Nehls said on Monday evening, lighting a cigar on the steps of the Capitol.

So then why support it?

“Why not?” he replied. “Trump said just release the damn files. He said do it — release the damn files.”

Megan Mineiro and Robert Jimison contributed reporting.

Additional changes include moving a child care grant program for college students and foreign medical school accreditation to the Health and Human Services Department, and transferring Fulbright programs and international education grants to the State Department. The Interior Department will take over the Indian Education Office.

Shifting duties away from the Education Department aligns with President Trump’s goal of eventually closing the agency, a move opposed by teachers’ unions and student rights groups and one that can only be accomplished with an act of Congress.

Less clear was how moving programs to other agencies aligned with Mr. Trump’s reason for closing the Education Department, which he has said was to give states more power in shaping school policies. A senior official at the Education Department said the changes would streamline bureaucracy so that more dollars would go to classrooms.

“Cutting through layers of red tape in Washington is one essential piece of our final mission,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement, adding that the changes were an attempt to “refocus education on students, families and schools.”

The plan drew some immediate blowback from Republicans, including Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, who said in a statement that the “department’s core offices are not discretionary functions.”

“They are foundational,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. “They safeguard civil rights, expand opportunity, and ensure that every child, in every community, has the chance to learn, grow and succeed on equal footing.”

Kevin Carey, the vice president for education and work at New America, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, said the changes were “wasteful, wrong and illegal.”

“Secretary McMahon is creating a bureaucratic Rube Goldberg machine that will waste millions of taxpayer dollars by outsourcing vital programs to other agencies,” Mr. Carey said. “It’s like paying a contractor double to mow your lawn and then claiming you’ve cut the home maintenance budget. It makes no sense.”

Administration officials have pointed to the recent federal shutdown to justify the moves, noting that schools remained open and students continued to be taught despite nearly all of the Education Department’s staff having been furloughed.

The department has posted several social media memes making such a point. In an X post last week, the department announced that federal workers were returning to the office, adding, “But let’s be honest: did you really miss us at all?”

Liz Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was committed to shrinking the agency “while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs.”

“The Democrat shutdown made one thing unmistakably clear: Students and teachers don’t need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms,” Ms. Huston said.

Republicans in charge of the House and Senate in Washington have signaled little enthusiasm for voting on a bill to close the department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979.

Mr. Trump has also shown little interest in collaborating with Congress in his bid to reshape the federal government, and his administration has continued to seek ways to diminish the Education Department.

“We’re going to shut it down, and shut it down as quickly as possible,” Mr. Trump said in March after signing an executive order that directed Ms. McMahon to start razing the department.

Ms. McMahon’s first act after joining Mr. Trump’s cabinet this year was to instruct the department’s staff to prepare for its “final mission” of shuttering the agency. The following week, Ms. McMahon fired 1,315 of those workers.

The layoffs decimated the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which was created to enforce Congress’s promise of equal educational opportunity for all students, and eliminated the agency’s research arm dedicated to tracking U.S. student achievement, which for many students is at three-decade lows.

In July, after the Supreme Court cleared the way for mass layoffs at the department, the administration moved adult education, family literacy programs and career and technical education to the Labor Department.

The secretaries follow with a list of questions demanding further information from both departments. They ask whether the Justice Department had “shared, or does it intend to share, information from voter files” with any other federal agency, and whether the Homeland Security Department had received information about voters from other sources.

The Justice Department has embarked on an effort to compile the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, to essentially establish a national voting database. The push, which is meant in part to bolster unsubstantiated claims by President Trump and his allies that large numbers of undocumented immigrants have voted illegally, has worried election officials and voting rights experts who say the data could be used to try to discredit future election results.

Nearly every request for the private data was initially rebuffed by top state election officials, who said they needed more information on how the list would be used, leading the Justice Department to sue at least eight states this year.

In the letter, the election officials cite what they view as potentially contradictory information. They state that Heather Honey, a top election official at the Homeland Security Department and previously a leader of the right-wing election activist movement, told a private gathering of secretaries of state that the department “had not received voter data or requested it” and “had no intention of using voter data.”

The letter continues, “The same day, D.H.S. publicly contradicted her representation and confirmed that they had received this data” and would put it through a program the agency developed that checks immigration status.

The secretaries of state also recounted a meeting in August with a top Justice Department official, who told them that the department “intended to use voter information to assess compliance” with the rules for maintaining federal voter lists.

“The first step to repair any relationship with the federal government is clear and transparent communication,” Jena Griswold, the Democratic secretary of state in Colorado and one of the officials who signed the letter, said in an interview. She criticized many of the administration’s actions regarding elections, arguing that they “make our elections less secure and decrease the level of confidence and trust from Democratic secretaries of state with federal counterparts who used to be trusted partners.”

“We’ll have to see what they say,” she said. “At this point, we want answers.”

Representatives for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Since Mr. Trump’s return to office, secretaries of state and other top election officials have confronted significant changes to the relationship between the federal government and states regarding elections.

Beginning in February, as part of sweeping federal cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration eliminated programs that had helped election officials coordinate cybersecurity plans and communicate regarding potential threats. The administration has also placed right-wing election activists like Ms. Honey in critical election positions in the federal government.

At the same time, both the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security have made repeated attempts to obtain the private information of voters kept by states on their voter rolls. This information includes partial social security numbers and driver’s license numbers, information not available on publicly available voter rolls.

Last month, Densho’s Courtney Wai, Caitlin Oiye Coon, and Executive Director Naomi Ostwald Kawamura joined survivors, descendants, and community members at the 2025 Crystal City Pilgrimage in San Antonio, Texas. The gathering honored those imprisoned at Crystal City, a Department of Justice (DOJ) and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) facility, including Japanese Latin Americans who were forcibly taken from their homes and who, to this day, have not received redress.

Traveling through Uvalde, Texas on our way south—a region shaped by migration and memory—we were reminded of how the histories of incarceration and immigration intertwine. Under the theme “Neighbors Not Enemies,” speakers at the 2025 Crystal City Pilgrimage reflected on the enduring power of xenophobia disguised as “national security,” tracing its roots from the Alien Enemies Act to the present. Pilgrimage Committee member Karissa Tom grounded the weekend with a powerful reminder: “We know what is legal is not always just,” connecting the experiences of Japanese Americans to broader struggles for justice today, including solidarity with Palestine.

The first day of the pilgrimage began in San Antonio, where Bexar County Judge Peter Sakai—whose family was incarcerated in Poston—opened the program with remarks affirming his commitment to justice for Japanese Peruvians, whose stories often remain overlooked.

San Antonio Mayor Gina Ortiz Jones reflected on the lessons of incarceration, cautioning against the use of “national security” to excuse violations of civil liberties, a warning that deeply resonates in the current national climate.

Pilgrimage co-chairs Hiroshi Shimizu, Brian Shibayama, and Gabi Nakashima—representing three generations of the Crystal City experience—opened the program with remarks reflecting on family and legacy. Shimizu, a former incarceree who was a child at Crystal City, was joined by Shibayama, son of Art Shibayama, and Nakashima, granddaughter of a former incarceree.

Archives Director Caitlin Oiye Coon works with a pilgrim to scan their family’s photographs as part of Densho’s Community Scanning Program—the first held outside of Washington. The program invites community members to preserve family collections and ensure their stories become part of the historical record.

On Day 2 of the pilgrimage, participants visited the former site of the swimming pool at the Crystal City Internment Camp, which also has a marker honoring two Japanese Peruvian girls, Sachiko Tanabe and Aiko Oyakawa, who drowned in 1944. A rusted tank, painted for the 2002 Crystal City Pilgrimage, still stands with the words “And justice for all” and “United we stand,” reminders of ongoing efforts to honor this history.

At the morning ceremony in Crystal City, pilgrims honored those once imprisoned, and remembered those who passed during their internment. Framed by the pilgrimage’s theme “Neighbors Not Enemies,” the gathering reflected on parallels between WWII incarceration and today’s anti-immigrant climate. Monarch butterflies—symbols of migration and hope—appeared during the ceremony.

Pilgrims view the Crystal City Internment Camp exhibit at the My Story Museum—the first permanent history museum in Crystal City, Texas. The museum features exhibits on the 1969 student walkouts and the Chicano Movement, local veterans, and on the camp. During the pilgrimage, the Crystal City Pilgrimage Committee unveiled an expansion of the camp exhibit, America’s Last WWII Concentration Camp, deepening public understanding of this history and its lasting impact.

In addition to viewing local historical markers, pilgrims heard from local activists who spoke about the hyper-militarization of the border and the ongoing struggle for human rights—drawing connections between present-day injustices and the history of incarceration at Crystal City.

On the final day of the pilgrimage, Natalie A. Sanchez-Lopez of the Latino Texas Policy Center reflected on the psychological connections between the U.S.–Mexico border and the Crystal City high school, noting how beliefs like “If there’s a wall, it’ll keep me safe” echo and amplify racism and xenophobia. She emphasized the ongoing need for solidarity and collective responsibility.

The pilgrimage was also, ultimately, a time of learning for us at Densho. We were able to try out our Community Scanning Program outside of Washington for the first time, meeting families who brought forward photographs, letters, and documents to add to the Densho Digital Repository. We were also reminded that our work is rooted in relationships across generations and borders, and within ongoing struggles for justice.

President Trump has sought to deploy National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas to the city, too, but that effort remains tied up in the courts.
Last weekend, the federal government said it was sending 200 Texas National Guard troops back home who had yet to be deployed on Chicago streets.
About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.
At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.","The Trump administration’s strategy of using federal agents and troops to enforce immigration laws and what it says is a bid to reduce crime in U.S. cities has extended to North Carolina. Border Patrol agents made scores of arrests in Charlotte over the weekend and then moved into the Raleigh area on Tuesday.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been heavily involved in many of the cities. National Guard troops have been called in to help in a few of them. In other cities, the federal intervention has involved agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

Here is how federal forces have been used in cities:

Charlotte: How long will federal forces be there?

Border Patrol agents made more than 130 arrests in the city over the weekend. The agents are led by Gregory Bovino, a senior official in the agency who is from western North Carolina and who has directed similar operations in Chicago and Los Angeles this year.

The use of the Border Patrol, an arm of Customs and Border Protection that has focused primarily on the nation’s southern border in recent years, is an example of how the Trump administration has expanded the scope of some of its agencies. In the past, the Border Patrol has operated mostly near a land or maritime border, whereas ICE typically operates inside the United States. (The Border Patrol and ICE are each part of the Department of Homeland Security.)

But the Border Patrol’s stated mission is to detect and prevent the illegal entry of people into the United States, so it can make arrests anywhere in the nation, though some of its powers — like the ability to stop and search people — are more limited outside a zone of 100 miles near a border.

Raleigh: Broadening operations in North Carolina

Border Patrol agents expanded their operations in North Carolina on Tuesday by deploying agents to the state’s heavily Democratic Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. The full scope of the operation was not immediately clear. But North Carolina is the first state to be targeted that is considered a political battleground state.

The federal crackdown on illegal immigration that began in the Chicago area in early September goes on, though it has been tamped down somewhat by the courts. Before he departed, Mr. Bovino and federal agents that included Border Patrol personnel had in recent weeks taken some of the most aggressive actions yet.

A federal judge condemned agents for using unnecessary force that included using tear gas and pepper spray against Chicago residents without giving them proper warning, and for pointing guns at civilians who were not a physical threat. The judge also said Mr. Bovino had lied to her about his tactics. The Justice Department argued that the tactics were justified because some protesters had become violent.

President Trump has sought to deploy National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas to the city, too, but that effort remains tied up in the courts. Last weekend, the federal government said it was sending 200 Texas National Guard troops back home who had yet to be deployed on Chicago streets.

Overall, the federal operation in the region has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests. But the sweeps have rounded up American citizens and legal residents, too.

Memphis: Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, welcomes intervention

Memphis is the only Democratic-led city in a state with a Republican governor that has seen federal forces move in. On Monday night, a judge in Tennessee temporarily blocked the National Guard from participating in federal actions in the operation, which Mr. Trump and state officials have said has focused on combating serious crime. (The state is expected to appeal the ruling before the pause takes effect.)

But the use of the Guard was just one part of a broad federal task force, which is otherwise unaffected by the ruling. More than a dozen agencies have taken part since it began in late September, including the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, resulting in more than 2,600 arrests. Some of those arrested have been undocumented immigrants, and residents have reported seeing immigration agents throughout the city.

Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, has welcomed the federal effort and agreed to deploy the Guard. But many local Democratic officials in Memphis, while acknowledging that crime has been a longstanding issue, have said that serious crime was already on the decline and that using the Guard was unnecessary. Still, many have made a point of working with the extra federal resources.

Protests in Memphis have been far more muted than in other cities in part because many groups have focused their efforts more on informing residents, hoping to lower the number of arrests or stops by federal agents.

Los Angeles: After raids in June, immigration sweeps go on

Nowhere has the presence of federal forces been more apparent than in Los Angeles, home to the country’s largest population of undocumented immigrants. Raids across Southern California in June led to huge protests that prompted President Trump to send 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to the city. Mr. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw that operation, left the Los Angeles area in September to lead operations in Chicago and then Charlotte. But federal agents have remained in the area and continue to conduct immigration sweeps.

County and city officials have said that they have received almost-daily reports from residents of immigration sweeps from South Los Angeles to the Inland Empire region east of the city. Since June, federal agents have made nearly 9,000 immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Local leaders have said that the arrests and continued presence of federal immigration agents in the area have instilled fear among immigrant communities.

Portland, Ore.: Modest protests continue outside ICE facility

The Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement in the city around June, and a small but persistent group of protesters has held daily demonstrations outside Portland’s ICE building ever since. Skirmishes with the authorities led to the closing of that building for more than three weeks at one point, according to the Department of Homeland Security, but protests had largely fizzled by September. Late that month, however, Mr. Trump tried to send National Guard troops to the city, saying that the ICE building and federal workers there needed to be protected from “war-ravaged Portland.”

Portland and Oregon sued, and a federal judge this month issued a permanent block on the deployment. The administration is appealing. Over the weekend, the Pentagon said that it was going to send home about 200 California National Guard troops who had been sent to Portland but never deployed on the streets. About 100 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control and on standby.

Mr. Trump began a takeover of the nation’s capital in August after claiming that crime had gotten out of control (though data suggested crime has dropped in the district). At the forefront of the order was the deployment to D.C. of about 2,300 National Guard troops.

They have also been directed to help efforts to beautify the city, and they have spent parts of the last few months picking up leaves and depositing mulch at parks. The troops are expected to remain well into 2026. The District of Columbia has sued, arguing that the Trump administration has exceeded its authority by ordering in the troops without the consent of Mayor Muriel Bowser, and by using those troops to conduct law enforcement. The judge has not yet ruled on the case.

But Ms. Bowser has welcomed assistance from other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who have coordinated with the D.C. police to get guns and drugs off the street. The Department of Justice said last week that in the 100 days since the federal takeover, more than two dozen federal and local agencies had made more than 6,000 arrests and seized more than 600 illegal guns.

(CN) — Four Portland-area counties will turn over information regarding immigrants — including lawful permanent residents — who were convicted of violent crimes, a federal judge ruled on Monday.

The ruling follows a petition filed by the federal government in October, in which it accused the counties of refusing to comply with administrative subpoenas issued by Homeland Security Investigations in July.

Under Oregon’s sanctuary laws, state bodies are required to decline any request from a federal agency that relates to immigration enforcement, unless ordered to do so by a judicial subpoena.

“We’re obligated to follow state law,” said Andy Jones with the Multnomah County Attorney’s Office, explaining in a Monday hearing that the court must authorize a subpoena before the county can comply with it in this instance.

Dave Lewis, Washington County attorney, noted that some of the subpoenas request information that isn’t under the county’s control, but rather resides in a state-managed database.

The federal government argued that if the counties don’t have the requested information, they can still comply by simply submitting a declaration saying as much, Susanne Luse with the United States Attorney’s Office said.

“If they’re not in possession, we simply want a statement,” Luse said.

U.S. District Judge Michael McShane, a Barack Obama appointee, noted that the parties appeared to generally agree and remarked that he thought the case might be “more hotly contested.”

Rather, the proceedings largely centered on administrative logistics. If the federal government intends to submit more petitions to the court — which it must to require that state entities comply with the subpoenas — McShane said the process should be streamlined.

“Certainly I don’t want to referee every document request,” McShane said.

McShane granted the federal government’s petition, authorizing the counties — which also include Clackamas and Marion — to turn over the requested information if they have it.

“The scope of enforcement is narrow, and we’re going to keep it narrow,” McShane said.

The information sought by the federal government is specific and “not all that remarkable,” McShane noted.

The federal government originally sought to enforce 10 administrative subpoenas, but the number fell to nine after one of the individuals was arrested. In its petition, the federal government said the information is necessary to locate “dangerous, criminal aliens who are subject to removal from the United States pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act.”

The counties reportedly released violent criminal offenders who may be subject to removal from the country between 2022 and 2023, according to the federal government.

While the counties largely appeared to be on the same page, Marion County — where county seat and state capital Salem is located — presented a separate legal question to the court.

In August, after Marion County received the ICE subpoenas, the county sued Oregon Governor Tina Kotek in federal court seeking guidance on how it should proceed. Specifically, Marion County asked whether it could release the records it gathered in response to the subpoenas, noting that the documents are public records that would be available to anyone who made a public records request.

It raised those arguments again when the federal government filed its petition in October, then asked the court to settle its issues of state law by moving for partial summary judgment in the multicounty case.

The state filed an amicus brief opposing Marion County’s motion, explaining that the state public records law issues raised by the county have nothing to do with the issues raised in the federal government’s petition.

McShane said he would issue a written ruling soon.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/courthousenews.com/2025/10/immigration-ice-police-jacket.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-18 16:57:43.480664

President Donald Trump, in a social media post on Friday, said he would order Bondi and the FBI to investigate any alleged links between Epstein and Trump’s perceived Democratic foes. Bondi announced that the effort would be helmed by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton and prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

Durham officials are on alert after Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said Border Patrol agents will be in the capital city on Tuesday.

Durham Mayor Leo Williams began Monday’s meeting by reading a joint statement by him; Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners; and Bettina Umstead, the chair of the Durham Public Schools Board of Education.

“We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety,” Williams said. “Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.

“We stand together in our commitment to protect, uplift and care for every resident who calls Durham home and reject any policy that threatens that trust and unity that we have built in our community,” he said.

Councilman Nate Baker had stronger words about the arrests, saying immigrants have been used as “pawns in this game that the fascist federal government is playing right now in this country.”

“They are being terrorized,” he said. “What we see on television is only a fraction of the terror that is happening in homes across this country and in cities where action is being taken in clear violation of human rights and undermining safety, as our governor spoke earlier.”

Baker said that the City Council would do “everything we can.”

“Our immigrant friends and neighbors are the backbone of our city and of our country,” Baker said. “They are so important for our industries, they are so important for our culture and for our society, and they bring so much, and they have the same hopes and aspirations as everyone else, and they have been thrust into the shadows.”

Councilwoman Javiera Caballero, an immigrant from Chile, said immigrant rights has been an issue she has fought “long and hard for my entire time on Council.”

“I have no doubt that Durham will step up and help protect its residents,” she said. “We’ve done it before. We’ll do it again. I think the risks are a lot harder now, more challenging.”

Councilman Carl Rist, the son of a German immigrant, thanked Caballero for keeping the issue at the forefront for the City Council.

“We’re always stronger on this council and in our public bodies in Durham when we speak with one voice,” he said.

In February, the Border Patrol confirmed the arrests of 11 people, including three young Indian immigrant men, in a Durham neighborhood, The News & Observer previously reported. Neighbors who witnessed the event said they saw tactical gear and masked agents in cars with tinted windows. Details about the arrests, including the men’s identities, were not released.

In July, Caballero and Rist joined other Durham officials and grassroots organization Siembra NC in front of the Durham County Courthouse to alert the community after four plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen, frightening some residents.

Months later, the Durham City Council passed a resolution declaring the city a Fourth Amendment Workplace to protect city workers from potential ICE arrests.

On Friday, Durham County Sheriff Clarence Birkhead said the Sheriff’s Office was unaware of any planned operations in Durham.

“I want to reiterate that Durham County does not participate in the 287(g) program, and we do not participate in any [Customs and Border Protection] or ICE ‘roundup’” operations,” Birkhead said. “Unfortunately, we are also not informed prior to any such CBP or ICE operations being initiated in local jurisdictions. CBP and ICE agents are federal law enforcement, therefore, they are acting under a federal mandate.”

In the Spotlight designates ongoing topics of high interest that are driven by The News & Observer’s focus on accountability reporting.

In a motion to dismiss the case filed Monday, city attorneys wrote that the Trust Act, which limits the Boston Police Department’s ability to work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on non-criminal matters, was both permissible under federal law and an important way to protect residents.

“Boston is safer when residents, regardless of immigration status, know they can call the Boston Police Department to report crime, participate in the economy, and utilize City services — basic functions of civic life that promote the prosperity and stability on which public safety relies,"" they wrote. “Boston has built this trust through decades of community policing and cooperative work with local leaders. The Trust Act protects that success.”

President Donald Trump’s administration filed the lawsuit in September, saying the Trust Act undermined law enforcement and public safety.

On Aug. 5, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi published a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” places where local regulations limit police cooperation with ICE, that included the city of Boston and “vowed to bring litigation to end these policies nationwide.” The federal justice department filed a similar suit against New York City in July.

The September lawsuit was not the first time the federal government had attacked the Trust Act since Trump took office in January. In March, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu was called to testify before Congress to defend it alongside the leaders of other so-called “sanctuary cities.”

As Wu said during her Congressional hearing, attorneys emphasized in their motion this week that the Trust Act still allows police to work with ICE on criminal investigations such as in drug or human trafficking cases. While the federal government had argued in its lawsuit that the law violates the federal Immigration and Naturalization Act, city attorneys disagreed, saying that law only permits cooperation, but doesn’t require it.

Any requirement to work with federal immigration enforcement, they wrote, would be a violation of Boston’s rights under the 10th Amendment, which gives state governments large powers of self-governance.

“Municipalities retain the authority not to participate in immigration enforcement,” they wrote. “Boston has declined the INA’s invitation, and the Tenth Amendment protects the City’s authority to do so.”

A Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll from July found that, by and large, Bostonians support the Trust Act’s limitations on Boston Police’s cooperation with ICE. The Trust Act is also in line with a 2017 ruling by Massachusetts’ highest court that found that, under state law, local officials cannot detain a person based on civil immigration law violations alone.

Letitia James, the New York State attorney general and a Democrat, celebrated the ruling.","A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit that the Trump administration filed against New York State in hopes of enabling immigration agents to conduct arrests in state and local courthouses.

The judge, Mae A. D’Agostino, ruled late Monday in favor of New York, finding that a 2020 state law and two executive orders that limit civil arrests near local courts and in state facilities were not unconstitutional, as the Department of Justice had argued in June.

The 41-page ruling marked another defeat for President Trump’s efforts to strike down laws passed by cities and states that limit cooperation between localities and the federal government on immigration matters.

In July, a federal judge in Illinois dismissed a lawsuit that had argued that state and local officials there were violating the Constitution by enforcing so-called sanctuary measures. The Justice Department filed a similar lawsuit against New York City’s sanctuary laws in late July that is ongoing.

The ruling on Monday night has no effect on the arrests that federal officers have been conducting in immigration courthouses in New York City, which are federal property. Scores of migrants showing up for routine court hearings have been arrested this year.

“The court made the right decision in upholding New York’s sovereignty, and the state will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement in cracking down on violent offenders while keeping our communities safe and enforcing our laws,” Jess D’Amelia, a spokeswoman for Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement.

New York lawmakers passed the 2020 state law, known as the Protect Our Courts Act, during Mr. Trump’s first term, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began arresting undocumented immigrants at state and local courts. Other states, including California and Washington, have similar policies barring ICE agents from courthouses.

The New York law allows agents to arrest people at or near courthouses only if they have a court order or criminal warrant signed by a judge — provisions that make it much harder for ICE to conduct arrests at the courthouses.

In June, Pam Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Albany that argued that the state law shielded criminals while endangering public safety, saying that the state was helping “prevent illegal aliens from apprehension.”

The lawsuit argued that the state law violated the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which says that the Constitution and federal statutes take priority over any conflicting state laws.

But Judge D’Agostino, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2011, ruled that the state policies were not pre-empted by federal law and that New York was within its rights in deciding not to help the federal government with immigration enforcement.

She wrote that the state’s measures reflected New York’s “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted” by federal immigration laws.

Letitia James, the New York State attorney general and a Democrat, celebrated the ruling.

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” Ms. James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York’s state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

ICE officials have previously argued that arresting people in courthouses is easier and safer for its officers and the public, in part because people who enter courthouses have been screened for weapons.

The decline in population comes as federal immigration agents sent to the area as part of the Trump Administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement efforts have begun leaving Chicago ahead of a possible return in the spring.
But its intensity has begun to subside as Homeland Security officials have confirmed that a new immigration enforcement surge has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Broadview facility — which serves as a processing facility where detainees are supposed to be held for only a few hours before being moved to a detention facility elsewhere — has drawn widespread protests in recent months.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Johnson in a hearing Tuesday said there are currently only four people being held at the Broadview facility, a drastic reduction that comes weeks after detainees there testified they had been crammed into rooms filled with more than 100 people for multiple days.

The decline in population comes as federal immigration agents sent to the area as part of the Trump Administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement efforts have begun leaving Chicago ahead of a possible return in the spring.

“I guess they just can’t take our winters,” U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said Tuesday. “I don’t blame them.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested in and around Chicago during the operation. But its intensity has begun to subside as Homeland Security officials have confirmed that a new immigration enforcement surge has begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Broadview facility — which serves as a processing facility where detainees are supposed to be held for only a few hours before being moved to a detention facility elsewhere — has drawn widespread protests in recent months.

Tuesday’s hearing was part of a class-action lawsuit brought last month by the MacArthur Justice Center and the ACLU of Illinois, who sought a temporary restraining order to address what advocates claim are “inhumane and unlawful conditions” at the Broadview facility.

Gettleman granted that order following a daylong hearing earlier this month in which several former Broadview detainees testified that they were crammed into overstuffed holding rooms with dozens of others, had difficulty contacting their families or attorneys and weren’t able to shower or change their clothes sometimes for multiple days.

Some detainees also said they were coerced into signing voluntary deportation forms after being lied to or threatened by federal agents.

Since then, government prosecutors said ICE has made significant strides toward improving those conditions, though attorneys for the plaintiffs say they’ve still had trouble contacting clients inside Broadview.

Last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura McNally and attorneys in the case performed a site visit at the controversial immigration facility.

Attorneys representing the detainees on Tuesday said there were around 20 people held at the facility during that visit, and they mentioned some issues regarding food quality and attorney access still remained.

Johnson told the court though that aside from “a few tweaks outstanding,” ICE is currently complying with Gettleman’s temporary order.

Attorneys for the detainees are now seeking a preliminary injunction which would turn Gettleman’s temporary order into a more permanent one. A hearing on that issue is scheduled for December.

Texas cannot use its new congressional map for the 2026 election and will instead need to stick with the lines passed in 2021, a three-judge panel ruled Tuesday.

The decision is a major blow for Republicans, in Texas and nationally, who pushed through this unusual mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump. They were hoping the new map would yield control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts — up from the 25 they currently hold — and help protect the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House.

The map cleared the GOP-controlled Legislature in August and was quickly signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. Several advocacy groups sued over the new district lines, saying lawmakers intentionally diluted the voting power of Black and Hispanic Texans and drew racially gerrymandered maps. Over the course of a nine-day hearing in El Paso earlier this month, they aimed to convince the judges that it was in voters’ best interest to shelve the new map until a full trial could be held.

It was not immediately clear if the state still has a legal path to restoring the new map in time for 2026. Unlike most federal lawsuits, which are heard by a single district judge and then appealed to a circuit court, voting rights lawsuits are initially heard by two district judges and one circuit judge, and their ruling can only be appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The decision comes 10 days into the monthlong period when candidates can sign up for the March primary. The filing deadline is Dec. 8.

This is just the opening gambit in what promises to be a yearslong legal battle over Texas’ congressional map. A lawsuit over the state’s 2021 redistricting — including its state legislative and education board seats — went to trial earlier this summer and remains pending before the same three-judge panel. The judges have indicated they may want to see how the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a major voting rights case before issuing their full ruling on Texas’ maps.

Gavin Newsom, challenging a California law he recently signed that prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks, a practice that became common this year amid the president’s immigration crackdown.

The suit claims that the mask ban, and a companion measure requiring federal agents to wear identification, are unconstitutional because states do not have the power to regulate federal agencies. It says federal law enforcement agencies will not comply with the pair of state laws, which take effect on Jan. 1, and asks the court to strike them down.

“California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.

Several states have introduced measures to ban masking by immigration agents, but California was the first to pass one into law.

The lawsuit comes as little surprise. Mr. Newsom himself said in July that he was “looking at the constitutionality” of the bill, months before signing it in September. Legal experts predicted it would be challenged in court, where numerous conflicts between California and the Trump administration are now playing out.

“If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people’s rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,” Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, said in a statement.

Supporters have argued that the measure is constitutional because state and local governments can require federal agencies to follow general laws, such as speed limits. The mask law applies to both federal and local law enforcement agents in California.

Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who wrote the bill, vowed to fight to defend it.

“We see I.C.E. and other federal agents going into communities with these ski masks, just terrorizing communities, where you don’t even know if someone is an actual agent or not,” Mr. Wiener said in a video posted on social media.

“It causes fear, and it’s unacceptable in a democracy.”

The lawsuit claims that officers must have the option to shield their identities because of the threats and violence they face on the job. It cites a huge increase in assaults and death threats against officers, and says websites publish agents’ personal information “to harass and threaten them and their families.”

“Now is an extraordinarily dangerous time to serve in federal law enforcement,” the lawsuit said.

It contends that the California laws prohibiting officers from wearing masks and requiring that they display identification “would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.”

Because federal agencies will not comply with the laws, officers are at risk of criminal prosecution if the laws are not struck down, the suit says.

In July, CBS News’s parent company settled a high-profile lawsuit Trump brought over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Harris.","A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused President Trump’s attempt to revive his dismissed defamation lawsuit against CNN for describing his baseless claims of mass election fraud in 2020 as the “Big Lie.”

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel agreed with a lower judge in rejecting Trump’s arguments that the network falsely associated him with Adolf Hitler.

“Trump has not adequately alleged the falsity of CNN’s statements. Therefore, he has failed to state a defamation claim,” the three-judge panel wrote in its unsigned ruling.

The panel included two of Trump’s own appointees, U.S. Circuit Judges Kevin Newsom and Elizabeth Branch. The unanimous ruling was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Adalberto Jordan, an appointee of former President Obama.

Trump filed the lawsuit against CNN in 2022 for $475 million in punitive damages, pointing to online opinion pieces and on-air comments that used the phrase “Big Lie” to describe Trump’s baseless fraud claims after the 2020 election.

CNN has maintained the lawsuit is meritless. A network spokesperson declined to comment on the appeals ruling.

“There is no doubt that Fake News CNN defamed President Trump and all of the tens of millions of Americans who have rightly stated that the 2020 Presidential Election was rigged and stolen by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers,” a spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement.

“President Trump will continue to hold the mainstream media accountable and will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion,” the spokesman continued.

Tuesday’s ruling affirms a ruling from U.S. District Judge Raag Singhal, a Trump appointee, who dismissed the president’s lawsuit after finding CNN’s statements were opinion.

It is one of several lawsuits Trump has brought against media outlets and journalists he views as unfriendly.

SCOTUS Quick Hits

In its Monday order list, the court announced that it will hear argument in Noem v. Al Otro Lado, a case on federal immigration law and the government’s authority to prevent asylum seekers from entering the United States. For more on the order list, see the On Site section below.

Also on Monday, the Trump administration and lawyers for Illinois and Chicago filed what are expected to be their final briefs on President Donald Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard to Illinois.

Former Justice Stephen Breyer is scheduled to speak to students at Suffolk University in Boston on Thursday morning. The event is closed to the public.

Morning Reads

Fed Governor Lisa Cook Offers First Defense of Mortgage Records (Nick Timiraos, The Wall Street Journal)(Paywall) — In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, “Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook’s lawyer on Monday provided the first detailed defense of her mortgage applications, arguing that apparent discrepancies in loan documents were either accurate at the time or an ‘inadvertent notation’ that couldn’t constitute fraud given other disclosures to her lenders,” according to The Wall Street Journal. “President Trump has sought to fire cook from the Fed over alleged fraud involving her mortgage applications,” but the “Supreme Court has for now blocked Trump’s attempt to remove her and will hear arguments in January.”

Texas National Guard troops expected to leave Chicago and return home, source says (Dalia Faheid, CNN) — As the Supreme Court weighs Trump’s authority to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, some of the troops that have been there awaiting the justices’ decision are heading home, according to CNN. “Two hundred federalized [Texas National Guard] troops had arrived in the city over a month ago with a mission from the Trump administration to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other US Government personnel – but instead stayed waiting at training bases for weeks” because of the legal battle over the deployment. The changes to the deployment are not expected to affect the 300 troops federalized from the Illinois National Guard.

Supreme Court not ready to tackle prayers at football games again (Maureen Groppe, USA Today) — In its Monday order list, the court announced that it had “rejected an appeal from a Christian high school that was blocked from leading a communal prayer before a state championship football game,” according to USA Today. “The court’s decision not to get involved doesn’t have a practical effect on Cambridge Christian School, which sued the Florida High School Athletic Association in 2015 after its request to pray over the loudspeaker was denied. Since then, Florida passed legislation requiring the athletic association to allow schools to make opening remarks at games it oversees, and the FHSAA has said that includes communal prayers.” However, it does mean that the court at this time will not further clarify what types of public prayers violate the establishment clause; the school had contended that such clarification was needed to ensure that public programs did not needlessly prevent expressions of faith.

US Supreme Court won’t hear patent appeal against Apple, Google, LG (Blake Brittain, Reuters) — Monday’s order list also showed that the court won’t weigh in on a dispute “involving the right to challenge expired patents, leaving in place a win for Apple, Google, and LG Electronics,” according to Reuters. Gesture Technology Partners, which had challenged “a decision to invalidate a patent that it had accused the technology companies of infringing,” had contended that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board does not have the authority to review expired patents and that the case should have been “reviewed by federal courts” instead.

Gupta Wessler Nabs High Court Veteran From Justice Department (Alex Ebert, Bloomberg Law)(Paywall) — A seasoned Justice Department lawyer “with thirteen US Supreme Court arguments on his resume” is moving to “plaintiff-side Washington appellate boutique Gupta Wessler,” according to Bloomberg Law. “Matt Guarnieri is joining as a principal, adding another oral advocate to a practice that is already a routine high court player. In a social media post announcing the hire, the firm said its lawyers have now argued 33 cases before the high court—the most in recent years among plaintiff-side groups.”

A Closer Look: A Brief History of Supreme Court Clerkships

In his latest Empirical SCOTUS column for SCOTUSblog, Adam Feldman explored the idea that a Supreme Court justice’s most lasting legacy is the clerks he or she mentors, because former clerks often go on to exert a significant influence on the federal judiciary, such as by serving as judges (or justices) themselves.

But what you may not have realized when reading that column is that this avenue of influence wasn’t available to the justices until the late 19th century, nearly a century after the court began its work. Until then, there was no budget for justices to have a law clerk. Instead, they each had only a messenger, someone who could run opinion drafts or other dispatches back and forth from their home to the homes of the other justices. (There was no Supreme Court building until 1935 – the court would meet in different locations, although principally within the U.S. Capitol building.)

The Supreme Court’s clerk situation began to change in the 1880s, when Justice Horace Gray joined the court. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett outlined in her book, Listening to the Law, Gray had gotten used to working with a clerk while serving as a Massachusetts state court judge, and he paid out of pocket to continue having one after he was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1882.

Four years later, in 1886, Congress appropriated the funds necessary for not just Gray but for every justice to hire a clerk or stenography assistant. The court’s docket was rapidly expanding, and U.S. Attorney General Augustus Garland had advised lawmakers to offer funds for additional court employees, “emphasizing that cabinet officials and senators had comparable assistants,” Barrett wrote.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the work of these clerks or assistants varied widely depending on which justice they served. Some were more like professional typists, while others did in-depth legal research. All, however, took on some unusual tasks, including running personal errands.

In the 1920s, Congress authorized each justice to hire a second law clerk, and in the 1940s, Congress gave each justice a third. It was around this time that all the justices began relying on their clerks to do more substantive work, such as reviewing cert petitions, a task that is still core to clerks’ work today.

Congress allocated even more money to the court in the 1970s, making it possible for each justice to hire up to four clerks. Four is still the magic number on the court today, although the chief justice is allowed up to five.

In Listening to the Law, Barrett wrote that it would be “impossible” to describe the work of the Supreme Court without describing the contributions made by clerks. In addition to screening potential cases, they help their justice prepare for oral argument, draft opinions, and review opinion drafts from other chambers.

And after their Supreme Court clerkship is done, former clerks often go on to have impressive legal careers, as Feldman wrote. Six of the current justices previously served as Supreme Court clerks (all but Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor.)

Court to Hear Case on Border Crossings

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to review a ruling by a federal appeals court that, the Trump administration contends, “has already caused—and, if left in place, will continue to cause—‘untold interference with the Executive Branch’s ability to manage the southern border.’” The immigrant rights group and asylum seekers who filed the lawsuit had urged the justices to leave the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in place, telling them that the government’s argument “would empower border officials to render” federal law governing the processing of asylum seekers “wholly inoperable at ports of entry.” For more on Noem v. Al Otro Lado, read Amy’s analysis.

Court Won’t Hear Appeals Regarding Prison Construction and School Prayer

Also on Monday, the court, over the objections of three justices, turned down an appeal from the sheriff of New Orleans in a dispute over the city’s obligation to build a new facility for inmates with mental health issues. Sheriff Susan Hutson had sought to end the city’s obligation by turning the court’s attention to a provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a federal law that was intended to reduce frivolous lawsuits by inmates, which provides for the cut-off of future-oriented relief after two years.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents will be deployed in the Raleigh area on Tuesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell and Democratic legislative sources briefed by Gov. Josh Stein’s office told The Assembly and INDY on Monday.

“It is the city of Raleigh’s understanding that the Border Patrol and ICE are already in Raleigh and that they will be active tomorrow,” Cowell told The Assembly and INDY. “We have not been informed of nor are we coordinating or helping plan any of this, so we don’t know what activities they’ll be undertaking tomorrow, or really a lot of other details.”

In a statement, Stein said his office “is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh.”

Stein, a Democrat, asked immigration agents “to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte.

“To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement,” Stein added. “Let’s keep each other safe.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, said in a statement that the department does not “discuss future or potential operations.”

“We will not stop enforcing the laws of our nation until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country,” McLaughlin said.

Like Cowell, the legislative sources said they were short on details.

“I do know that they are bringing people here,” said one state senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We don’t know how long they plan to be here. But they certainly are making their presence known tomorrow.”

The sources also did not know how many agents CBP would send, or whether their intended target—“Raleigh”—meant the city, Wake County, or the entire Triangle. Durham officials said on Monday that they are planning a press conference for Tuesday morning. (The press conference was canceled as of Tuesday morning; officials said they would release a statement instead.)

The Durham County Sheriff’s Office responded to an inquiry by re-sending a statement it originally provided last week that said the office was not aware of any CBP operations. The sheriff’s office has not responded to follow-up inquiries.

A Durham Police Department spokesperson said he had not heard of immigration officials “coming to Durham to conduct an operation like they are in Charlotte.” Federal agencies are not required to notify local law enforcement about their plans, the spokesperson said.

During Monday night’s Durham City Council meeting, Mayor Leonardo Williams read a statement that affirmed the city’s commitment to protecting immigrants but did not address whether Durham would be targeted.

About 200 CBP agents were deployed to Charlotte on Saturday as part of what the Department of Homeland Security is calling “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Greg Bovino, the North Carolina-raised head of CBP, vowed to “hit Charlotte like a storm.” At least 130 people were arrested in the first 48 hours, according to CBP.

ABC News has reported that CBP agents stationed in Charlotte will be sent to New Orleans this Friday.

Like other cities that immigration officials have targeted this year, Charlotte is led mostly by Democrats. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, blamed the city’s “soft-on-crime” approach for the high-profile killing of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska this summer.

Earlier this month, three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation asked Stein to deploy the National Guard to fight what they called the city’s “increasingly dire” crime problem.

“The men and women who wear the badge in Charlotte have sounded an unmistakable cry for help,” wrote U.S. Reps. Mark Harris, Pat Harrigan, and Chuck Edwards. “Yet you have rejected their cry. The people of North Carolina deserve to know why their governor has refused help while the officers sworn to protect them plead for immediate assistance.”

Stein has not deployed the National Guard.

Violent crime in Charlotte has dropped by 20 percent over the last year, according to the city’s police department. Violent crime has dropped as well in Raleigh and Durham, also Democratic strongholds.

As federal agents moved into Charlotte this weekend, the Trump administration also accused the city’s “sanctuary politicians” of allowing “criminal illegal aliens” to “roam free.” Like Durham and Raleigh’s police departments, Charlotte’s police do not participate in a federal program that authorizes them to enforce immigration laws.

And until recently, the Mecklenburg County jail did not honor “detainers,” or requests to hold immigrants who would otherwise be released for up to 48 hours so that immigration officials can take them into custody. That changed after the Republican-led General Assembly passed laws in 2024 and 2025 requiring sheriffs to honor detainers and notify immigration officials before releasing immigrants held on felony and other charges.

The Trump administration said that North Carolina jails failed to honor nearly 1,400 detainers, which Republicans say put residents at risk.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has argued that partnering with immigration authorities erodes trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement.

McFadden was one of five Black Democrats who were elected in urban counties in 2018 after pledging not to cooperate with immigration authorities. Also in that group were the new sheriffs of Durham and Wake counties. Those offices—as well as the police departments in Durham and Raleigh—have taken similar approaches to immigration enforcement.

“Border Patrol is in Charlotte for one reason: the need is real,” Kyle Kirby, chair of the Mecklenburg County GOP, said in a statement. “When local Democrats—who control all aspects of local government—refuse to enforce the law, federal agencies have no choice but to step in and protect this community.”

Democrats argue that the immigration agents’ aggressive tactics have terrorized and intimidated Latino residents.

“Everyone wants to be safe in their communities,” Stein said in a video posted on X this weekend. “But the actions of too many federal agents are doing the exact opposite in Charlotte. We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off our sidewalks. This is not making us safer.”

Cowell said she wanted Raleigh residents to know that the city’s police are on their side.

“If citizens see things that they think are not lawful, feel threatened—any of those—they can call the police as normal tomorrow,” Cowell said. “And we do have First Amendment rights. We are just trying to encourage nonviolent, peaceful sort of activity tomorrow.”

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as public charge that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits.

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5027x2828+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb4%2Ff1%2F483a0fc4495aa8af954582280111%2Fgettyimages-1229220583.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:43.584121

November 5: CAC President Elizabeth Wydra joined Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to discuss Learning Resources v. Trump.","This month, the Supreme Court is considering two major challenges to Trump overreach—one on its merits docket and one on its shadow docket—and CAC has been involved in both.

At the beginning of November, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the challenge to President Trump’s unlawful tariffs. Our amicus brief ex

plained that President Trump doesn’t have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to single-handedly set global tariffs. As CAC Legal Fellow Simon Chin explained after oral argument, “The Government argues that when Congress passed IEEPA, in 1977, it carried forward authority over tariffs from an older law called the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA). But as Neal Katyal, counsel for the private challengers, emphasized at oral argument when citing our brief, a 1933 amendment to TWEA severed that law from its original war powers foundations.”

The stakes of this case are high, as CAC President Elizabeth Wydra emphasized in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Elizabeth explained, the Court has “so far, in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs. This will be a test of whether they will actually be the check that the Constitution envisions on the Executive.”

Among Trump’s many other disturbing power grabs has been his deployment of the National Guard in American cities. CAC is fighting back in courts from coast to coast, filing amicus briefs against Trump’s unlawful use of the National Guard in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

Most recently, CAC filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining why it should deny the government’s request to stay a district court injunction blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. Our brief explains that Martin v. Mott, a case arising out of the War of 1812, doesn’t insulate the President’s deployment decision from judicial review.

Because the Trump administration relies on Mott in claiming that courts can’t review its decision to deploy the Guard, CAC’s historical research has been a helpful resource in setting the record straight. Our brief was cited as providing a valuable perspective in Slate magazine and the One First newsletter. And when Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, seemingly claimed that Trump had unreviewable “plenary power,” CAC’s Deputy Chief Counsel Brian Frazelle was quick to explain that he was “flat wrong.”

With both the Los Angeles National guard case and the consolidated tariffs cases before the Supreme Court, CAC’s historical research provides key context and insight for the Justices. As Elizabeth suggested, now is the Supreme Court’s chance to show it can serve as a check on the Trump administration’s lawless actions.

Appalachian Voices v. Environmental Protection Agency — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally terminate an entire mandatory grant program created by Congress. Our brief argues that the Constitution’s separation of powers prohibits the President from unilaterally withholding federal funds based on disagreement with congressional policy, and because the Trump administration unilaterally terminated a mandatory grant program, the executive branch violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. C. Circuit Court of Appeals, brief filed November 3.

League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President — WIN — The D.C. District Court held that President Trump’s executive order requiring proof of citizenship on the Federal Form for registering voters violated the separation of powers. Echoing our brief, the court observed that the Elections Clause “provides that Congress—not the President—is the check on States’ authority to regulate federal elections.” C. District Court, decision rendered October 31.

Learning Resources v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections — The Supreme Court is considering whether President Trump has the legal authority to single-handedly impose tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs—namely, that the relevant federal law incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA)—explaining why this narrative is unsound at every step. Supreme Court, brief filed October 24.

Illinois v. Trump— WIN — In October 2025, the Seventh Circuit denied the administration’s motion for a stay, leaving in place a district court order that prevents troops from deploying in Chicago. In doing so, the Seventh Circuit adopted the reasoning of CAC’s amicus brief to conclude that Martin v. Mott does not foreclose judicial review. The Trump administration subsequently asked the Supreme Court to stay the district court’s order, and CAC filed an amicus brief opposing the administration’s application, reiterating our arguments about why courts can review the President’s decisions to mobilize the National Guard. That application is currently pending. Seventh Circuit, brief filed October 12, decision rendered October 16, brief filed in Supreme Court October 20.

Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS — WIN — In a case challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful decision to cut off funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, the Ninth Circuit denied the government’s petition for rehearing en banc. The Court addressed—and rejected—the government’s jurisdictional argument. Echoing our brief, the Court understood the Plaintiffs to challenge the government’s failure to comply with the TVPRA’s mandate, rather than raise a breach-of-contract claim. Ninth Circuit, decision rendered October 10.

Grundmann v. Trump — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether Donald Trump’s attempted firing of the Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority was illegal.

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.
Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.
There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.
Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".","The government's plans to fast-track the deportation of illegal migrants and a major overhaul of human rights law have been described as ""inhumane"".

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood detailed sweeping reforms of the UK's immigration policy, meaning anyone granted asylum will be returned home if their country is deemed safe in the future.

Addressing the House of Commons, the minister said she had a ""moral duty"" to fix the ""broken asylum system"" and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Chowns responded: ""The right to seek asylum for someone fleeing violence in their home country... is a basic principle of international law and it's also a basic principle of our shared humanity.

""And it appears what the government is trying to do is really lean into this whole narrative that all of the problems in the country are to do with people coming over in small boats.

""It's completely false and it's deeply, deeply concerning.""

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

It would mean only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, would be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will also join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9b0f/live/617f15c0-c3de-11f0-bbb8-f506e20a7d44.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 12:59:55.254946

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented.
Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.
The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn’t be used for citizenship purposes.
For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change.","Last week, the Social Security Administration (SSA) quietly updated a public notice to reveal that the agency would be sharing “citizenship and immigration information” with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This data sharing was already happening: WIRED reported in April that the Trump administration had already started pooling sensitive data from across the government for the purpose of immigration enforcement.

This public notice issued by SSA makes that official, months after the fact. The notice is known as a system of record notice (SORN), a document that outlines how an agency will share the data it has, with whom, and for what purpose. This notice is required under the Privacy Act of 1974. Normally, SORNs are issued before any data is shared between agencies, giving the public and government officials sufficient time to offer comment. But WIRED found that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was pulling in data from across DHS, SSA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and state voter data, among other sources, based largely on the US Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database.

“There are laws that require the government to inform the public about their use of various kinds of databases and other surveillance technologies,” says Adam Schwartz, privacy litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy and free speech. “If the government starts using the database and does not put out the appropriate disclosure and then later does put out that appropriate disclosure, they still have violated the law.”

The Trump administration has gone to drastic lengths to remake the government in its image. A core component of this has been an effort to vacuum up large swathes of data from across federal agencies, many of which were never meant to be comingled. This has frequently happened regardless of the laws, norms, or procedures that normally govern the access and sharing of sensitive data. The SORN from SSA is just the latest confirmation of exactly how much data is being shared in ways experts tell WIRED is “unprecedented.”

Much of this data sharing begins with misinformation about the data at hand. In the early days of the Trump administration, Elon Musk seized on a misunderstanding of SSA’s data to spread the claim that 150-year-old people were receiving benefits. They weren’t, but DOGE capitalized on the idea that the SSA’s systems were inefficient and fraudulent to burrow into the agency’s data and technology systems. In April, reporting from The New York Times found that in an effort to force immigrants to self-deport, the administration was adding them to the SSA’s database of dead people, effectively meaning that their Social Security numbers could not be used to get jobs or access government services. As part of the effort to combine disparate data across the government to verify citizenship and surveil immigrants, DHS recently published a different but related SORN that effectively transforms SAVE into a voter verification system, which experts also warned could be bypassing the requirements of the Privacy Act.

Leland Dudek, who served as acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration between February and May 2025, led the agency when members of DOGE first appeared. Dudek says he was initially supportive of DOGE and acted as a bridge between SSA staff and members of the DOGE team before becoming disillusioned.

Dudek tells WIRED that though there had been agreements to share data with DHS before—mostly Social Security numbers—the scope of the recent SORN seems unprecedented. Normally, says Dudek, DHS is able to check certain Social Security numbers against SSA data, within a limited scope.

But he says that the SSA does not have a way to deactivate a Social Security number, meaning that it can’t be used to allow someone to work or collect government payments, unless that person has died. Dudek says what appears to have changed within the new SORN is that there is now “a special indicator code that identifies types of questionable data or special circumstances concerning an application for an SSN.” This, he says, appears to mean that there would now be a way to essentially flag a Social Security number and take it out of use, without marking them as deceased.

“You can literally cut off anyone's financial life you want, and you don't need to use the death master file,” he says.

President Donald Trump has focused heavily on cracking down on immigration since his return to office. The administration has canceled Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from countries in Africa and Latin America; deployed the National Guard to assist with immigration enforcement; and claims to have deported more than 500,000 undocumented immigrants. The administration has also sought to collect more data on immigrants, particularly those using government services like housing assistance or food benefits, and Republicans have renewed an effort to add a citizenship question to the US Census. Part of this effort also appears to be the creation of a national citizenship database.

“It seems that DHS was dead set on creating a national citizenship data bank, and for whatever reason, they determined that the Social Security Administration had the largest set of citizenship data across any agency in the government,” says Nikhel Sus, deputy counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). “The American people had no opportunity to weigh in on this dramatic new expansion of the SAVE system before the government illegally repurposed Social Security Administration data.”

CREW is part of a group of organizations currently suing the US government, claiming that the Trump administration is unlawfully consolidating sensitive data across agencies. “These belated systems of records notices only confirm after the fact that the government has run roughshod over the law,” says Sus.

The government also previously held that Social Security data shouldn’t be used for citizenship purposes. In a 2023 letter from the SSA to the Fair Elections Center, a nonprofit focused on voting rights, SSA lawyer Jessica Vollmer wrote that “while SSA records provide an indication of citizenship, they do not provide definitive information on U.S. citizenship,” and that “SSA does not have citizenship information for all individuals who have been issued an SSN.” That authority lies with DHS.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin tells WIRED that “USCIS remains dedicated to securing the nation’s electoral process—by allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens. We encourage all federal, state, and local agencies to use the SAVE program.”

SSA did not respond to a request for comment.

“[I am] not aware of something happening on this scale, where there was a total disregard for the required procedures of the Privacy Act,” says John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), which is also part of the suit against the government.

Davisson also says that the legal statute that the SORN cites as justification—one that dates back to when immigration was handled by the now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)—does not actually support unrestricted data sharing with DHS. In a 1999 opinion, the Department of Justice limited the kinds of restrictions agencies could put on sharing data with law enforcement. “It essentially says you cannot obstruct an otherwise lawful disclosure of citizenship- or immigration-related information. It does not actually give the Social Security Administration an affirmative grant of authority to disclose information outside of the strictures of the Privacy Act,” says Davisson.

But Davisson says that doesn’t mean there are no restrictions at all. “This administration has attempted to subvert that reading of the statute and to claim that it has carte blanche to obtain from any agency, anywhere in government, whatever immigration or citizenship information it wants.”

Experts tell WIRED that because Social Security data was never collected with the goal of being used for citizenship or immigration purposes, it is also likely to include inaccuracies.

For instance, if someone receives a Social Security number and later becomes a naturalized citizen, Social Security data would not necessarily reflect that change. “There are a lot of reliability concerns when you match disparate data sets across agencies, especially when the data was collected for different purposes,” says Sus. “You could have mismatches. You could have the wrong people's records being incorrectly linked together.” This could mean that people who are legally in or are citizens of the United States could lose their ability to vote or work due to data matching errors.

Dudek, like Sus, says that SSA data is not a reliable way to determine citizenship and could risk disenfranchising people. Dudek says that in order to combine data responsibly, experts would need to clean and cross-match it across other data sources to reduce the risk of false negatives or positives, and agencies would need to disclose risks or biases within the data itself.

“Is that being done?” says Dudek. “I'm not aware of it being done, and that concerns me.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/69138e7642f0d7fe529d4a38/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Social-Security-Data-Officially-Being-Shared-with-DHS-to-Target-Immigrants-Politics-2215825808.jpg",N,,2025-11-18 11:00:06.522831

“This is yet another breach of trust that will push families back into the shadows and deter them from seeking health care.”","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) moved late Monday to make it easier for immigration officers to deny green cards to those who use public benefits like Medicaid or food stamps.

The latest iteration of the so-called public charge rule would strike down the Biden-era version of the rule, which returned the country to long-standing criteria that allowed rejections of green cards for those “primarily dependent” on government assistance, such as those who received cash assistance or help with nursing home care.

The rule does not revert to the 2019 rule crafted under the first Trump administration that allowed immigration officers to reject applicants who used any number of public programs.

But critics say the lack of guidance opens the door to immigration officers arbitrarily rejecting applicants while discouraging immigrants from asking for assistance.

The Monday proposed rule described former President Biden’s policy as a “straitjacket [on] DHS officers,” barring them from considering “all factors and information relevant to an alien’s likelihood at any time of becoming a public charge.”

“Consideration of these, in the totality of the circumstances, will allow officers to more accurately assess an alien’s likelihood at any time of becoming a public charge using their good judgment,” the rule states.

The proposed rule was widely panned by health care groups and immigration advocates.

“By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law. The proposal’s invitation to political bias, coupled with the administration’s out-of-control enforcement assault on immigrant families, make this proposal even more dangerous,” said Adriana Cadena, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition, in a statement.

“The chaos and fear that drive the chilling effect are much worse than last time, so the impact could be even bigger.”

Roughly 1 in 5 Americans are enrolled in Medicaid, while about 12 percent receive food stamps.

The programs are available only to those who are lawfully present in the United States, and with Medicaid, migrants are only able to receive care if their state has agreed to cover the cost.

“The administration is forcing lawfully present immigrant families with low incomes to make impossible choices between preserving their immigration status and ensuring that their kids have what they need to grow and thrive. We know from experience that this policy will reach far beyond those directly covered, harming countless U.S. citizen children,” said George Kelemen with Share Our Strength, which runs the No Kid Hungry Campaign.

“Many families will withdraw from the programs for which they’re eligible for—programs that help feed, house and keep them healthy. This means more kids in America will be at risk of hunger, of losing stable housing, of getting sick.”

The proposed rule says the Trump administration will promulgate a new public charge rule at a later date.

But advocates argue the lack of clear guidance will prompt those reviewing green cards to unnecessarily reject applicants.

“This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty. The courts have determined that public charge has a very narrow meaning and that it does not apply to benefits like health care that everyone inevitably needs at some point in their life. But now, immigration officials are sure to make inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, forcing families to guess at what programs may or may not count,” said Sarah Grusin, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program, in a statement.

Kate WhannelPolitical reporter

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has defended sweeping changes to the UK's asylum system, telling MPs the current situation is ""out of control and unfair"".

Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: ""If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.""

Under the plans, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped ""safe and legal routes"" into the UK will be created.

Some Labour MPs expressed concerns, with Nadia Whittome calling the plans ""dystopian"" and ""shameful"", but the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the proposals were ""positive baby steps"". However, she warned that unless the UK left the European Convention on Human Rights, Mahmood's efforts would be ""doomed to fail"".

Badenoch urged the home secretary to work with the Conservatives, saying she may find their votes would ""come in handy"" if Labour backbenchers did not support the changes.

Over the past year, the government has been forced to backtrack on some of its policies - including cuts to welfare and the winter fuel payment - after objections from its own MPs.

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson welcomed the introduction of new safe and legal routes - but accused the home secretary of ""stoking division by using immoderate language"".

Mahmood hit back angrily, telling the MP: ""I wish I had the privilege of walking around this country and not seeing the division that the issue of migration and the asylum system is creating across this country.""

She said she regularly faced racist abuse - using a racial slur she said is used against her - as well as being told to ""go back home"".

So far, around 20 Labour MPs have criticised the plans. Whittome, the MP for Nottingham East, accused the government of ""ripping up the rights and protections of people who've endured unimaginable trauma"".

Folkestone and Hythe MP, and immigration lawyer, Tony Vaughan said making refugee status temporary would create a ""situation of perpetual limbo and alienation"".

Richard Burgon said the measures were ""morally wrong"" and would ""push away Labour voters"".

""Why not recognise that now rather than in another few months and have to make a U-turn,"" the MP for Leeds East said.

Other Labour MPs expressed support for Mahmood. Chris Murray told BBC Radio 5 Live the system had to be fair ""otherwise it'll collapse, and there's nothing progressive about letting that happen"".

MP for Blackley and Middleton South, Graham Stringer, said the home secretary was ""going down the right track"".

He said she would reach a ""compromise"" with Labour MPs but added: ""It might all be for naught if we don't get out of the European Convention on Human Rights.""

Speaking to the BBC later, Mahmood said changing the system was a ""moral mission"" for her.

""If we don't win this argument… we will lose public support for having an asylum system at all and therefore we'll lose something brilliant about this country.

""I'm not willing to put public support for having an asylum system at risk.""

She acknowledged that some Labour MPs had concerns but insisted ""the vast majority of my colleagues agree with me"".

So far this year 111,800 people have claimed asylum in the UK - 39% arrived in a small boat, while 37% arrived by legal means before claiming asylum.

The government says its plans are aimed at reducing the number of people coming to the UK and increasing removals of people who do not have a legal right to be in the country.

The Home Office published the changes in a 30-page document and a few hours later Mahmood presented them to the House of Commons.

Under the proposals, people granted refugee status will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months - half the current time period.

People could be returned to their home country, when it is deemed safe to do so.

The amount of time refugees will have to be in the UK before being allowed to apply for permanent residence will be quadrupled from five years to 20.

Families with children who have been refused asylum will be offered incentives to leave but could be forcibly removed if they refuse to go voluntarily.

Asylum seekers with income or assets would have to contribute to the cost of their stay in the UK.

Mahmood told MPs this would ""end the absurdity where an asylum seeker receiving £800 a month from his family and an Audi was receiving free housing at the taxpayer's expense and the courts judged we could do nothing about it"".

Home Office sources have pushed back against suggestions asylum seekers could have items of sentimental value, such as wedding rings, confiscated to pay for their accommodation.

In order to make it easier to remove failed asylum seekers, the government intends to change the way the European Convention of Human Rights and Modern Slavery Act is applied.

Mahmood also threatened to stop granting visas to people from three African countries - Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia - unless those governments improved co-operation on deportations.

Setting out her plans for capped safe and legal routes, Mahmood said voluntary and community organisations would be given ""greater involvement"" in receiving and supporting new arrivals.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4064/live/42051ef0-c3ee-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 15:58:07.840201

A new national survey of immigrants in the country — both documented and undocumented, and varying widely in how and when they arrived — found that about half of all immigrants say they feel less safe since President Trump took office. The survey was done by The New York Times and KFF, a nonprofit that conducts polling and research about health policy.

Among the immigrants surveyed — whether they are here legally or not, or have been naturalized as citizens — concern that they or a family member could be detained or deported has risen significantly since before Mr. Trump’s return to power.

Still, large majorities also say their own future, and that of their children, remains bright, with the concept of the American dream retaining its powerful appeal. About 70 percent said that if they could go back in time, they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States.

The survey captured a snapshot of immigrant life against a backdrop of enormous change in the United States, with many people standing by their choice to come — sometimes illegally — even as their image of the country as a welcoming place has been shaken. Immigrants feel that, across every measure, they are better off in the United States compared with the living conditions that propelled them to leave their homelands.

The survey, of 1,805 immigrants across the country, is a broad look at a group for which there is often very little data to understand their views and experiences, given that the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask specifics about immigration status. The group is also a small share of the population and too difficult to reach to be measured with accuracy by most surveys.

[Read more about how this survey was conducted here and see all the questions that were asked here.]

The poll reflected the breadth of immigrants in the United States, including a significant share who find Mr. Trump’s immigration policies “necessary” and some who are “proud” of increased enforcement. For many Americans, the archetype of an immigrant may be someone who has recently arrived in the country. But a vast majority of immigrants living in the United States — more than 70 percent — have been in the country for 10 or more years, according to the available data from the Census Bureau. A little more than half are U.S. citizens, and 53 percent say they speak English exclusively or at least very well.

The survey found that 60 percent of immigrants, including a majority of those with legal status, say that the United States used to be a “great place” for immigrants but no longer is — a view that is especially common among those from Latin America and Asia. European immigrants were likelier to say that the United States was a great place for immigrants.

Marcos Herrera, 42, moved to Florida from Chile in 2009 to join his Puerto Rican girlfriend. He hoped to continue his studies in mechanical engineering but could not afford to finish his degree and now works as a custodian at Walt Disney World.

Though he became a legal permanent resident and feels mostly safe, he said that he has watched with terror and sadness as other Latinos in Florida have been picked up and deported after years of working hard in the country.

“In the past, there was no fear like there is now,” he said. “Families should not be separated.”

Even as the current view of the country has dimmed for many — amid raids, anti-immigrant rhetoric and masked agents that now permeate American life — their commitment to stay has not.

The share of immigrants, 70 percent, who said that they would still make the choice to migrate to the United States is largely unchanged from two years ago, before Mr. Trump’s push for mass deportations.

For most, especially those who escaped violence, poverty and repression, their view appears to be a matter of perspective.

Large majorities say that their financial situation is better in the United States than the country they left (70 percent), their employment situation is better (65 percent) and educational opportunities are better for themselves and their children (74 percent). Slightly fewer, though still about half, say that their safety is better because they came to the United States.

Most immigrants expressed optimism about their future in the United States, regardless of Mr. Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement. Nearly 80 percent, including a majority of those who are undocumented, said that they were on their way to achieving the American dream or had achieved it already.

“People often compare their decision about moving, or not, compared to where they were,” said Pawan H. Dhingra, a professor at Amherst College who researches immigration and was not affiliated with the survey. So it was not necessarily surprising, he said, that immigrants were both “feeling less safe and still feeling like the American dream is possible.”

Mr. Trump has moved decisively — and divisively — to fulfill his campaign promise to impose a hard-line immigration agenda, after winning in 2024 with support from voters who shifted to the right amid scenes of disorder at the border and an influx of migrants in large cities.

The president has ended paths to asylum, deported people to countries where they are not from and deployed agents in a made-for-TV display of force. The scope of the crackdown has already tested voters who support Mr. Trump’s deportation goals but believe that his methods have been too aggressive.

The share of immigrants who worry that a family member could be detained or deported jumped significantly, to 41 percent, up from 26 percent two years ago, during more lenient Biden-era immigration policies. Concern about deportation has grown since 2023 among citizens and noncitizens, among those here legally and those who are not.

Roughly half of immigrants — including 82 percent of undocumented immigrants — said that they were afraid about what was happening with immigration enforcement; a similar share said they felt angry.

“I feel we had the American dream, until everything in January started to fall apart,” said Leticia Anaya, 60, a Mexican mother who became a U.S. citizen in 2001 and lives in Aurora, Colo.

Ms. Anaya, whose father crossed the border in the 1970s and sponsored her for a green card in 1990, said that her family had made a plan when they heard of U.S. citizens being detained by federal agents. They stored all their documents, including naturalization papers, birth certificates and passports, in a “special box” tucked in a closet at home, she said.

“It’s not like I am very afraid, but it could happen,” said Ms. Anaya, who said she lost her job with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs because of Mr. Trump’s mass layoffs. “I look Hispanic. I have an accent.”

Still, 40 percent of immigrants say that they feel Mr. Trump’s enforcement tactics are necessary, and 15 percent say that the tactics made them feel proud.

Roughly 30 percent of undocumented immigrants say increased enforcement is necessary.

Those who say increased enforcement is needed are disproportionately U.S. citizens, many of whom have been here for decades, the survey found.

“Trump is trying to make this country more valuable instead of bringing anybody that wants to come in and do whatever they want,” said Gustavo Rojas, 42, a citizen who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1990 and lives in Boston. “I just think that Biden was slipping too much. Way too much.”

Mr. Rojas, who is unemployed and identifies as a Republican, said that he had struggled to start a career after high school and tried to join the Marines but was discharged because of a schizophrenia diagnosis. He said he believed that he was better off in the United States because of what he described as generous government assistance.

“I think the country’s going in the right direction,” Mr. Rojas said of the immigration crackdown. “It’s not affecting me at all.”

Other surveys have shown that Americans have grown skeptical about the future of the American dream, with 53 percent of respondents in a 2024 Pew Research Center survey saying that it is still possible.

The new survey found that most immigrants — regardless of their immigration status — feel that their children will have a better life. A similar share expressed this in 2023, before Mr. Trump took office.

Sami Takieddine, 46, was born in Britain to parents who fled Lebanon’s civil war in the 1970s. The family moved to the United States in 1980, when Mr. Takieddine was an infant, and found a foothold in New Jersey and Georgia.

Over four decades, Mr. Takieddine notched one milestone after another: He became a citizen, bought a home, sent his two teenage children to good schools and climbed the ranks to become a director at a technology company in Atlanta.

“I think that America stands for, ‘Do good things, be good at what you do, be good to other people and you can really succeed,’” Mr. Takieddine said, adding that the American dream still exists.

Huayun Geng, 49, a software engineer living in Washington State, said that although he had found success in the United States, he worried about the future of his two children, ages 16 and 8.

Mr. Geng, who emigrated from China in 2012 on an H-1B visa and became a legal permanent resident in 2020, said that the country had been made politically unstable by the divide between Democrats and Republicans.

He also worried that the United States had isolated itself as its education system weakened, dulling the nation’s global competitive edge.

“I’m living a better life myself now in U.S. over when I was in China, but I feel like it’s getting harder and harder for people who just came in to achieve the same kind of dreams as I did,” Mr. Geng said. “Now, when I’m looking at my kids, I feel like it will be very hard for them.”

Here are the key things to know about the The New York Times/KFF survey of immigrants:

The survey was conducted among 1,805 adult immigrants nationwide from Aug. 28 to Oct. 20.

The poll includes immigrants who are U.S. citizens, those with visas or permanent residency and those who are likely undocumented, who were identified as not being citizens or having valid visas.

The survey was conducted on the telephone, via the mail and online, and could be taken in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Haitian-Creole. The survey was designed by researchers at KFF in collaboration with The Times, and was administered by SSRS, a public opinion research company. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked here.

To further ensure that the results reflect all immigrants, not just those willing to take a poll, the poll gives more weight to respondents from demographic groups that would otherwise be underrepresented among survey respondents, like immigrants without a college degree and those who do not speak English proficiently.

The margin of sampling error for all immigrants is about plus or minus three percentage points. In theory, this means that the results should generally reflect the views of the overall population of immigrants, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. The margin of error is larger for subgroups.

Can a city like Charlotte restrict ICE or Border Patrol from accessing city data?","Federal Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Charlotte have sparked widespread concern, especially after reports of racial profiling, detentions, and property damage.

Why it matters: Cities have little authority to intervene. North Carolina's Dillon Rule limits their ability to curb federal enforcement, even as community fear grows.

Charlotte leaders met Monday to clarify what local government can legally do and what limits state law imposes.

What legal authority does the city have over ICE and Border Patrol?

The city has limited authority to restrict federal operations due to state preemption under North Carolina's Dillon Rule structure.

""All of the power originates from the General Assembly,"" Charlotte city attorney Andrea Leslie-Fite said at Monday's city council meeting. ""City Council only has as much power as is explicitly granted or inherently granted by state law.""

That means cities like Charlotte cannot issue executive orders or create ""sanctuary"" policies like some Home Rule cities, such as Chicago.

What is the difference between a Dillon Rule and Home Rule city?

A Dillon Rule city like Charlotte can only take actions that the state government explicitly allows by law.

A Home Rule city like Chicago, however, has broad authority to govern itself unless the state specifically prohibits something.

In short, Dillon Rule limits local power; Home Rule grants it.

Can the city block ICE or Border Patrol from using city property?

Not entirely.

Restricted city areas (like offices or secured zones) require a judicial warrant to access.

Public areas (like lobbies or meeting rooms) remain open.

Can a city like Charlotte restrict ICE or Border Patrol from accessing city data?

No. Most city records are public under state law.

What should residents do if confronted by agents or if someone impersonates them?

CMPD is not involved in federal immigration operations and does not assist ICE with civil warrants.

Residents can call 911 or CMPD if they are unsure whether someone is a legitimate federal agent.

What about North Carolina's new immigration law?

House Bill 318, which took effect Oct. 1, 2025, requires sheriffs to determine the immigration status of people arrested for certain crimes and to hold them up to 48 hours for ICE pickup.

""It codifies that relationship and creates an expectation for jail administrators … not the city,"" Fite said

That means CMPD and the city have no role in enforcing detainers — that's under Mecklenburg County Sheriff Gary McFadden.

What's next: On Nov. 24, Charlotte City Council will vote on a measure directing the city manager to quickly deploy short-term funding, in coordination with Mecklenburg County, to local organizations helping residents affected by ICE and Border Patrol activity.

In addition to the funding motion, the committee also voted unanimously to direct the city attorney to develop an educational campaign to inform residents of their rights and available resources.",https://images.axios.com/oHrD2JW_2Mx9SgkmG2KQroAH0eQ=/0x39:3446x1978/1366x768/2025/11/17/1763421035447.jpeg,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:11.961158

Mayor Jonathan Varden said ICE contacted the city two weeks ago to notify officials of a joint operation with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency that included multiple driver’s license checkpoints across Chilton County. ICE also asked whether Jemison’s City Hall Auditorium could be used to process individuals if necessary.

“The city has historically cooperated with local, state, and federal agencies,” Varden said in a statement. “All our laws should be enforced equally across the board, without prejudice, with grace and humility.” Police confirmed the operation took place Tuesday, Nov. 11, and is no longer active.

The mayor acknowledged a protest scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 18. He said the city supports residents’ right to peacefully protest and is working with organizers to ensure the safety of all participants.

Organizers say the protests have led to division and threats within the community. Protest organizer Irbin Hernandez said, “Once we started it, we started to see so much division in the city, like the racist people came at us, death threats all types of stuff and this isn't just a racial problem, this is a people problem. This is a problem we have imbedded in the south.”

Co-organizer Stacy Serrano said some residents are now fearful of contacting police. “There's a lot of community who is scared to even call the police department because they're scared, they're like they're working with ICE. If I call because somebody is breaking into my house what if they come and get me?” she said.

The mayor called the online threat “appalling” and said there is “zero tolerance for such threats and intimidation tactics.” An investigation is underway, and the city plans to release a full statement once the case concludes.

Despite the tension, organizers say the protest is intended to promote unity. Hernandez said, “We just want to create peace and unity in the town and the state and every city and hopefully everybody hears us.”",https://abc3340.com/resources/media/88820eb4-45e3-4667-b4df-5f803f85d37a-jemison_municipal_complex.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 11:00:17.873517

The federal law doesn’t create a mandate for information sharing or honoring civil detainer requests, according to the motion.","A Trump administration attempt to strike down Boston’s sanctuary city law can’t overcome constitutional hurdles protecting localities from federal incursions, the city said in filings asking a judge to toss the government’s lawsuit.

“Here, Boston has declined” the invitation to assist the federal government’s immigration crackdown, “and the Tenth Amendment protects the City’s authority to do so,” Boston said in its Monday filing.

The Justice Department had said Boston’s Trust Act raised its own constitutional issues, arguing in the complaint that the non-cooperation amounted to illegal obstruction of immigration efforts by strictly limiting the city’s cooperation with federal authorities. The lawsuit is part of the administration’s broad immigration enforcement efforts and push to accelerate the rate of deportations from the US.

The bid to spike the Department of Justice’s sanctuary city lawsuit urged the court to find the local ordinance is protected by the Tenth Amendment, which says all powers not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved to the states. A federal judge invoked that protection in July when dismissing a similar action filed against Illinois, the city of Chicago and Cook County.

The DOJ has also targeted New York City, Los Angeles, and Rochester, NY with sanctuary city lawsuits.

Boston said the Trump administration is wrong in arguing that the federal Immigration and Nationality Act mandates local participation in enforcement efforts. The city’s ordinance, known as the Boston Trust Act, also doesn’t stand as an obstacle to federal authorities conducting enforcement actions.

Trust Act

Boston enacted the Trust Act in 2014, limiting what information city police will share and denying federal officers access to suspects in city custody who are thought to be in the country illegally. The measure was designed to promote trust between local police and immigrant communities.

The ordinance preceded the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s 2017 Lunn v. Commonwealth ruling that found municipalities have no authority to honor civil detainer requests that immigration officials issue asking localities to detain people until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities.

The Trust Act says local police also can’t ask people their immigration status, give detainees’ release dates to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, make arrests based on ICE administrative warrants or perform functions of an immigration officer.

The law does allow police to provide criminal history information to the Department of Homeland Security Investigations division of ICE and collaborate on investigations related to human trafficking, child exploitation, drug and weapons trafficking, and cybercrimes.

In 2024, Boston police denied 15 civil immigration detainer requests and neither detained nor transferred any individuals to ICE custody, according to city records.

No Obligation

Boston told the court that the Immigration and Nationality Act doesn’t oblige states or localities to help the government in its immigration duties, and courts have ruled that invitations to assist in those federal duties can be declined without amounting to obstruction.

The federal law doesn’t create a mandate for information sharing or honoring civil detainer requests, according to the motion. The city’s decision to not engage in either “reflects its choice of how to deploy limited resources and is not an obstacle to the enforcement of federal law.”

The city also rejected the Trump administration’s claim that the ordinance amounts to illegal regulation of the federal government.

In an emailed statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said the city will not “participate in mass deportation.”

“Boston will continue to work with state and federal law enforcement to protect our residents,” Wu added, “but we are challenging this meritless and unconstitutional attack on our local authority.”

Representatives for the DOJ weren’t immediately available for comment.

The city is represented by in-house attorneys and the Public Rights Project.

It is our job – [political content redacted] – to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is.","I will make a statement about how we restore order and control to our borders. I do so as this government publishes the most significant reform to our migration system in modern times.

This country will always offer sanctuary to those fleeing danger, but we must also acknowledge that the world has changed and our asylum system has not changed with it.

Our world is a more volatile, and more mobile, place. Huge numbers are on the move. While some are refugees, others are economic migrants seeking to use, and abuse, our asylum system. Even genuine refugees are passing through other safe countries searching for the most attractive place to seek refuge.

The burden that has fallen on this country has been heavy. 400,000 have sought asylum here in the last 4 years. Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, and over half of refugees remain on benefits 8 years after they have arrived.

To the British public, who foot the bill, the system feels out of control and unfair. It feels that way, because it is. The pace and scale of change has destabilised communities. It is making our country a more divided place.

There will never be a justification for the violence and racism of a minority, but if we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger, and ends in hatred.

I have no doubt about who we really are in this country. We are open, tolerant and generous. But the public rightly expect that we can determine who enters this country, and who must leave.

To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.

[Political content redacted]

My predecessor as Home Secretary picked up this [political content redacted] inheritance, and rebuilt the foundations of a collapsed asylum system.

Decision making has been restored, with a backlog now 18% lower than when we entered office. Removals have increased – reaching nearly 50,000 under this government.

Immigration enforcement has hit record levels, with over 8,000 arrests in the last year.

The Border Security Bill is progressing through Parliament, and my predecessor struck a historic agreement with the French, which means small boat arrivals can now be sent back to France.

These are vital steps, but we must go further. Today, we have published ‘Restoring Order and Control’, a new statement on our asylum policy.

Its goals are two-fold: firstly, to reduce illegal arrivals into this country, and secondly, to increase removals of those with no right to be here.

It starts by accepting an uncomfortable truth: while asylum claims fall across Europe, they are rising here, and that is because of the comparative generosity of our asylum offer when compared to so many of our European neighbours.

This generosity is a factor that draws people to these shores, on a path that runs through other safe countries. Nearly 40 percent come on small boats and over perilous channel crossings, but a roughly equal number come here legally, via a visitor, work or study visa, and then go on to claim asylum.

They do so because refugee status is the most generous route into this country. An initial grant lasts 5 years, which is then converted, almost automatically, into permanent settled status. In other European countries, things are done differently.

In Denmark, refugee status is temporary, and they provide safety and sanctuary until it is possible for a refugee to return home. In recent years, asylum claims have hit a 40-year low, and now, across Europe, countries are tightening their systems in similar ways.

We must act too. We will do so by making refugee status temporary, not permanent. A grant of refugee status will last 2 and a half years, not 5. It will be renewed only if it is impossible for a refugee to return home. Permanent settlement will now come at 20 years, not 5.

I know this country welcomes people who contribute. For those who want to stay, and are willing and able to, we will create a new ‘work and study’ visa route, solely for refugees, with a quicker path to permanent settlement.

To encourage refugees into work, we will also consult on removing benefits for those who are able to work but choose not to.

Outside of the most exceptional circumstances, family reunion will not be possible, with a refugee only able to bring family over if they have joined a work and study route, and if qualifying tests are met.

While over 50,000 were granted refugee status in the last year, more than 100,000 claimants and failed asylum seekers remain in taxpayer-funded accommodation, and we know that criminal gangs use the prospect of free bed and board to promote their small boat crossings.

We have already announced that we will empty asylum hotels by the end of the Parliament, and we are exploring a number of large military sites as an alternative.

We will now also remove the 2005 legislation that created a ‘duty’ to support asylum seekers, reverting to a legal ‘power’ to do so instead. While we will continue to support those who play by the rules, those who do not – be that through criminality or antisocial behaviour – can have their support removed. We will also remove our duty to support those who have a right to work.

It is right that those who do receive support, pay for it if they can, so those with income or assets will have to contribute to the cost of their stay. This will end the absurdity that we currently experience. Where an asylum seeker receiving £800 each month from his family, and who had recently acquired an Audi, was receiving free housing at the taxpayers’ expense, and the courts judged we could do nothing about it.

These measures are designed to tackle the pull factors that draw people to this country, but reducing the number of arrivals is just half of the story. We must also enforce our rules and remove those who have no right to be here. This will mean restarting removals to countries where they have been paused.

In recent months, we have begun voluntary removal of failed asylum seekers to Syria once again; however, there are still many failed asylum seekers here from Syria, most of whom fled a regime that has since been toppled. Other countries are planning to enforce removals, and we will follow suit. Where a failed asylum seeker cannot be returned home, we will also continue to explore the possibility of return hubs, with negotiations ongoing.

We must remove those who have failed asylum claims, regardless of who they are. Today, we are not removing family groups – even when we know that their home country is perfectly safe. There are, for instance, around 700 Albanian families living in taxpayer-funded accommodation having failed their asylum claims.

This is true despite an existing returns agreement, and that Albania is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. So, we will now begin the removal of families. Where possible, we will encourage a voluntary return, but where an enforced return is necessary, that is what we will do.

Where the barrier to a return is not the individual, nor the UK Government, but the receiving country, we will take action.

I can announce today that we have told Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Namibia that if they do not comply with international rules and norms we will impose visa penalties on them. And I am sending a wider message here: unless other countries heed this lesson, further sanctions will follow.

Much of the delay in our removals, however, comes from the sclerotic nature of our own system. In March of this year, the appeals backlog stood at 51,000 cases. This government has already increased judicial sitting days, but reform is required, so we will create a new appeals body, staffed by professional independent adjudicators, and we will ensure there is early legal representation available to advise claimants and ensure their issues are properly considered.

Cases with a low chance of success will be fast-tracked, and claimants will have just one opportunity to claim and one to appeal, ending the merry-go-round of claims and appeals that frustrate so many removals.

While some barriers to removal are the result of process, others are substantive issues related to the law itself. There is no doubt that the expanded interpretation of parts of the European Convention on Human Rights has contributed.

This is particularly true of Article 8: the right to a family life. The courts have adopted an ever-expanding interpretation of this right.

As a result, many people have been allowed to come to this country, when they would otherwise have had no right to, and we have been unable to remove others when the case for doing so seems overwhelming.

This includes cases like an arsonist, sentenced to 5 years in prison, whose deportation was blocked on the grounds that his relationship with his sibling may suffer.

More than half of those detained are now delaying or blocking their removal by raising a last-minute rights claim.

Article 8 is a qualified right: that means we are not prevented from removing individuals or refusing an application to move to the UK if it is ‘in the public interest’. To narrow Article 8 rights, we will therefore make 3 important changes, in both domestic law and our immigration rules.

Firstly, we will define what, exactly, a family is – narrowing this down to parents and their children.

Secondly, we will define ’the public interest’ test so the default becomes a removal or refusal, with Article 8 rights only permissible in the most exceptional circumstances.

Thirdly, we will tighten where Article 8 claims can be heard, ensuring only those who are living in the UK can lodge a claim, rather than their family members overseas, and that all claims are heard first by the Home Office and not in a courtroom.

We will also pursue international reform of a second element of the European Convention: the application of Article 3 – the prohibition on torture and inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.

We will never return anyone to be tortured in their home country, but the definition of ‘degrading treatment’ has expanded into the realm of the ridiculous.

Today, we have criminals we seek to deport, but discover we cannot because the prisons in their home country have cells that are deemed too small, or even mental health provision that is not as good as our own.

As Article 3 is an absolute right, a public interest test cannot be applied. For that reason, we are seeking reform at the Council of Europe, and we do so alongside international partners who have raised similar concerns. But it is not just international law that binds us.

According to data from 2022, over 40% of those detained for removal claimed they were modern-day slaves. This well-intentioned law is being abused by those who seek to frustrate a legitimate removal.

So, I will bring forward legislation that tightens the modern slavery system to ensure that it protects those it was designed for, and not those who seek to abuse it.

Taken together Madam Deputy Speaker, these are significant reforms. They are designed to ensure our asylum system is fit for the modern world, and that we retain public consent for the very idea of providing refuge.

We will always be a country that offers protection to those fleeing peril, just as we did, in recent years, when Ukraine was invaded, when Afghanistan was evacuated, and when we repatriated Hong Kongers.

For that reason, as order and control is restored, we will open new, capped, safe and legal routes into this country. These will make sponsorship the primary means by which we resettle refugees, with voluntary and community organisations given greater involvement, to both receive refugees and support them, working within caps set by government.

We will also create a new route for displaced students to study in the UK, and another for skilled refugees to work here. Of course, we will always remain flexible to new crises, across the world, as they happen.

I know the British people do not want to close the doors. But until we restore order and control, those who seek to divide us will grow stronger.

It is our job – [political content redacted] – to unite where there is division, so we must now build an asylum system for the world as it is. One that restores order and control. One that opens safe and legal routes to those fleeing danger across the world, and one that sustains our commitment to providing refuge for this generation, and those to come.

I know the country we are. We are open, tolerant and generous. We are the greater Britain that those on this side of the House believe in. Not the littler England that some would wish we would become. These reforms are designed to bring unity, where others seek to divide.

The lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.
California Democratic state senators pushed for the passage of these bills in June, in response to federal agents wearing face coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations across California.","The Department of Justice is suing California over two recently enacted laws that would prohibit federal agents from wearing facial coverings and require them to identify themselves while conducting their duties.

The lawsuit filed Monday argues California's laws violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, under which federal laws take precedence over state laws. The Trump administration also claims the laws threaten the safety of federal officers.

The federal government said in court documents that it ""does not intend to comply.""

""Today we filed a lawsuit to strike down California's unconstitutional law aimed at unmasking the faces of our federal agents, which will allow criminals to dox them,"" Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, wrote on X. ""Unconstitutional laws such as this one further endanger our brave men and women protecting our community.""

A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News.

""If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people's rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,"" spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo wrote. ""We'll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.""

In September, Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act into law. The measure bans federal, state and local officials from concealing their identity with face coverings while conducting operations.

The California Highway Patrol is exempt, as well as undercover operatives, members of SWAT teams, and people who have health issues or who need masks for medical reasons such as preventing smoke inhalation.

The lawsuit against California argues the state is discriminating against federal agents as it exempts some state officials from the mask ban.

Newsom also signed the No Vigilantes Act in September, which will require non-uniformed federal agents operating in California to visibly display identification that includes their agency and either a name or badge number starting in January.

California Democratic state senators pushed for the passage of these bills in June, in response to federal agents wearing face coverings while conducting immigration enforcement operations across California.

Both laws will impose criminal penalties on federal law enforcement officers for noncompliance in some cases.

Critics of the facial covering ban, including the California Association of Highway Patrolmen, argue it puts officers and their families' lives and well-being at risk by prohibiting them from protecting their identity when needed. State-level critics also say it only serves to punish local law enforcement for the actions of federal agents.

The Department of Homeland Security called on Newsom to veto the bills in September and, upon passage, stated it would not comply.

""To be clear: We will NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,"" DHS posted on X in September, calling the law a ""PR stunt.""

In June, a federal version of the No Secret Police Act was introduced by New York Democratic Reps. Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat. This act would also ban facial coverings and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining individuals.

Nothing led her to believe that, just a few hours later, she would be walking out the door with all her belongings and an order never to return. At 3:30 p.m., as she headed to her office during a break in the asylum case she was judging, a terse, three-sentence email from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) brought her career to an end.

“I didn’t expect not to be able to finish the hearing that day. I felt sad to be leaving a job I had dedicated so much effort and care to. And, of course, I felt uncertain about what would happen next in my life,” she recalls in a telephone interview with EL PAÍS. She had an hour and a half to gather her belongings and leave the courthouse. Dillon was her family’s main source of income, and they had health insurance thanks to her job. She still doesn’t understand why she was fired, as the email offered no explanation.

Hers is not an isolated case. In San Francisco alone, the Justice Department has fired seven judges since April, 25% of the total, and in the Sacramento court, only around half of the 11 judges remain. This area of California has been hit hard by the unexplained dismissals ordered by the Trump administration, which have occurred throughout the country. Of the nearly 800 immigration judges, 139 have been fired, taken an early-out offer, or been involuntarily transferred, according to recent estimates from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI).

The pattern has been similar in many cases. In early September, the day before her two-year term at the Annandale immigration court in Virginia was set to expire, Judge Anam Petit received the notification on her computer. After seeing the message, she briefly left the courtroom where she was presiding over a hearing, then returned to the bench and, with a trembling voice and shaking hands, delivered a complex ruling without revealing what had happened, she told this newspaper via email. She cannot say for sure what the reason for her dismissal was, because she was never told, but she emphasizes that many of the judges who were terminated had experience defending immigrants.

In addition to firing officials responsible for immigration cases, in its first months the Trump administration also eliminated protections against deportation, canceled grants that provided legal representation to minors, and transferred detainees to remote locations, including prisons outside U.S. jurisdiction, thus transforming the immigration justice system to suit its purposes. All of this was done in the name of achieving the largest deportation in history.

“The Trump administration’s policies, including expedited removal procedures and politicized interpretations of asylum laws, have resulted in a lack of due process,” says Dana Leigh Marks, who was an immigration judge in San Francisco for 35 years and is now retired.

Marks has been advocating for years for the independence of immigration judges who, contrary to popular belief and unlike the rest of the country’s judiciary, fall under the power of the executive branch. Although judges have always demanded independence from the government, they had never before denounced the politicization of their work. But since Trump took office the administration has sent them directives forcing them to expedite proceedings and dismiss asylum cases.

“Judges are supposed to act independently and not receive instructions or orders on how to rule in cases. That was the policy during the previous administration: to rigorously exercise judicial independence and rule in each case according to the facts and the law. That’s why it’s confusing to receive so many memos and directives that give clear instructions on how judges should rule in particular cases,” Dillon explains.

The mass firings of judges, amid a backlog of 3.4 million cases in immigration courts, defy practical explanation. From within the judiciary, however, it is understood as a way to remove judges who disagree with the anti-immigration policies imposed by the Trump administration. “It appears that the vast majority of the judges who have been fired were hired during the Biden administration or had experience in private law practice or with non-governmental organizations that assisted immigrants, rather than coming from a Department of Homeland Security prosecutorial background,” Marks posits.

The work of immigration judges is very complex, and in the past, to practice it, one had to have at least 10 years of experience in the field of immigration. The dismissed judges are being replaced by others without experience and even by U.S. army lawyers.

On October 24, the Department of Justice announced the hiring of 11 permanent and 25 temporary immigration judges. Most of those with immigration experience gained it as prosecutors or worked for the Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agencies responsible for arrests and deportations.

Among the temporary staff there are military lawyers from the Marine Corps, Navy, Army and Air Force. Earlier this summer, the Pentagon authorized about 600 military lawyers to work for the Justice Department, which changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, eliminating the need for prior experience in immigration law.

Express deportations

One of the most radical changes to the immigration justice system concerns expedited deportations. Before Trump, these were reserved for migrants who entered the country illegally and were apprehended at the border. Their deportation can now be ordered by an immigration officer; that is, they are not required to go through a full legal process with a lawyer before a judge.

Additionally, these deportations have extended to people who have been living in the country for years and — contrary to the government’s claims that they are expelling criminals — the majority of those deported have no criminal record. Many of them lack legal status, but they could be eligible for immigration benefits if they were allowed to stay while their cases are resolved, which was the practice followed by immigration judges before Trump. Now, for example, if someone entered on a student visa and overstayed, they can be deported even if they have married a U.S. citizen and are eligible for residency.

“The Trump administration is changing the interpretation of certain legal terms that have been well established in the past, and by doing so, it is preventing people from having full removal proceedings. Instead, it is subjecting them to expedited removal proceedings,” Marks explains.

Previously, individuals who were undocumented or even had deportation orders were not a government priority for deportation. They regularly attended their immigration court appointments for routine check-ins. Now, court visits to comply with immigration requirements have become ambushes. ICE agents wait outside and detain people who arrive for their appointments. Scenes of masked officials forcibly taking people away and separating parents from their desperately crying children have become commonplace.

Detentions in immigration courts have also changed the way lawyers work. “This is something new we’re seeing across the country: immigration lawyers who need to prepare habeas corpus petitions for their clients who attend their regular reviews with ICE are concerned that those interviews could end in detention,” explains Cristina Vélez, director of law and policy at Asista, an organization that advises and trains professionals, including lawyers who defend migrants who have been victims of abuse and domestic violence.

“Because the scope of detention law enforcement has expanded enormously and reached people who previously would not have been detained, our members and professionals, who previously did not specialize in federal court litigation, now have to train, expand their skills, and find funding to do that work,” she adds.

Another radical change in immigration justice is the elimination of the possibility for ICE detainees to be released on bond. Instead, they are sent to detention centers in often remote locations, where access to family and lawyers is nearly impossible.

Adding to all this is the lack of funding for the immigration court system, something highlighted in an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute published this week. While immigration enforcement agencies have received massive budget increases in recent decades — most recently, $170 billion over four years through Trump’s tax reform — immigration courts have received a tiny fraction of that total: $844 million this year, just 2.5% of what ICE and the Border Patrol receive.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/ICZLFO5HI5AFRNHKS6VSXUBFIY.jpg?auth=061e858765a3549b3ae2fb93d4177dbff77ef8af253a34e2684652427f9fe1f7&width=1200,N,,2025-11-18 08:56:20.723846

This article was produced as a project for the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism’s National Fellowship Fund for Reporting on Child Well-being.

As 16-year-old Lily Martinez was heading home from her job at the local hospital this summer, her mother called urgently and told her not to come home, instructing her to go to a friend’s house instead.

“She told me that ICE was outside, and it was just her and my brother at home. She didn’t want to open the door for anyone,” Martinez said. “I didn’t know what to do, and I was really scared at that moment.”

Martinez and her brother were born and raised in Queens, New York. Her parents are undocumented immigrants from Mexico who have lived in the U.S. for two decades. Earlier this year, her uncle in Texas was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while driving and deported to Mexico. She’s afraid this could happen to her parents too.

“Sometimes I get so anxious that I’m distracted even when I’m with my friends,” she said.

Millions of U.S.-born children live in “mixed-status” households, families in which at least one member is undocumented or under threat of deportation. Though these children are citizens, the fear that they will lose their parents and caregivers defines their daily lives and has profound consequences for mental health.

“You can’t not consider the issue of immigration as a child well-being issue,” said Mayra E. Alvarez, the president of The Children’s Partnership, a California-based advocacy organization.

In California, nearly half of all children have at least one immigrant parent. Nationwide, it’s 1 in 4. Yet children’s mental health often remains invisible in policy debates framing immigration as a security issue rather than one of public health.

In February, 11-year-old Jocelynn Rojo Carranza, a U.S. citizen from Gainesville, Texas, died by suicide after enduring persistent bullying that included threats of immigration enforcement against her family. In interviews, her mother said classmates told her that the family would be reported to ICE, leaving her “all alone.” The case became a flashpoint for how aggressive enforcement rhetoric and peer hostility around immigration can dramatically elevate risk for children living in mixed-status families.

Researchers studying 547 U.S.-born adolescents found that having a detained or deported family member was associated with higher risks of suicidal ideation, externalizing behaviors, and alcohol use. The report, published in July in Psychiatric News, found that even the persistent threat of family separation generates toxic stress, affecting memory, emotion regulation, and impulse control into adulthood.

Claudia Santos, 17, from Santa Maria, California, has experienced similar fears. Her parents are undocumented strawberry farmworkers, and she worries they could be picked up and deported like so many in her community.

“In middle school, I had suicidal thoughts. But I always thought about what that would do to my parents and my little sisters,” Santos said.

The landscape has grown more perilous under the second Trump administration. Earlier this year, the president signed a budget reconciliation bill that allocated $145 billion toward immigration enforcement and border security. According to recent data released by ICE, over half a million people have been deported. Children are witnessing their parents and caregivers being arrested from places considered safe, such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

Experts and advocates say that children are showing visible signs of stress.

“I have parents asking for support from their little ones,” said Dr. Sandra Espinoza, an associate professor at Alliant International University in Los Angeles and a psychiatrist working with Latinx immigrant communities. “Children bite their nails, they are scared at night.”

That fear ripples across entire communities, affecting everyday activities, including even leaving the homes. Leisy Abrego, a sociologist and professor of Chicana/o and Central American Studies at UCLA, recalled that graduation last academic year was missing the usual scores of immigrant families.

“It’s always standing-room only. This time, there were empty rows,” Abrego said. “Imagine what is happening as children are observing this.”

Children of undocumented Latinx parents in the U.S. are at greater risk for long-term mental health struggles, especially when a parent is suddenly taken away, according to Espinoza’s co-authored 2024 study in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy. Researchers found that many of these children grow up carrying invisible scars—feelings of loss, mistrust, fear of separation, and shame—that often resurface later in life, especially in their closest relationships.

Although the research is still sparse, it’s beginning to show that the fear children carry growing up with an undocumented parent doesn’t simply fade away once they become adults. One 2021 national study of nearly 1,800 U.S.-born Latinx adults found that those who had a parent deported during childhood had more than twice the odds of exhibiting post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms years later. Experiences such as a loved one being deported, living with the constant fear that a parent could be taken, or witnessing an immigration raid were all linked to adult PTSD.

“A child can learn to think, ‘My caregiver, who was the most safe person in my world, was taken from me. And so I’m going to adapt by not trusting people anymore or by not getting close to people anymore,’” Espinoza said.

Pregnant people under constant fear of deportation also show higher levels of cortisol, stress hormones that can affect fetal development. “These are babies pulling their hair out, babies with stomach aches,” Alvarez said, referring to research conducted by The Children’s Partnership. “It starts that early.”

Chronic stress impairs the immune system, delays cognitive development, and increases vulnerability to mental illness. For children of immigrants, stress may also begin with the trauma carried over from their home countries and can involve poverty, war, or political persecution. It then continues through the instability of U.S. immigration enforcement. This intergenerational trauma echoes through families, as parents struggling with depression or post-traumatic stress may become emotionally unavailable.

“Even when parents are present,” Espinoza said, “if they’re living in a constant state of hypervigilance caused by a broken legal and political system, it’s going to be difficult to be fully present with your child. That’s not the parent’s fault. It’s the environment’s fault.”

For Woojung Park, a 26-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient from South Korea, that environment has felt like a lifelong sentence.

As the only member of her family without permanent legal status—her parents now have green cards and her younger sister is a citizen—Park has lived with a constant sense of isolation.

“It’s like carrying a dirty secret,” Park said. “When I found out we’d overstayed our visa, my mom told me not to tell anyone. … I felt deceived by her. It took years to rebuild that trust.”

Park was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD as a teenager. “I don’t know if being undocumented correlates to it, but it probably was a factor because there’s so much anxiety that comes with it.”

Herlin Soto Matute, 28, a Nicaraguan-born immigrant, grew up in northern California in a mixed-status family. While her two younger sisters are U.S. citizens, Matute and her parents received Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which offers temporary legal protection to immigrants from countries facing war, natural disasters, or political instability.

TPS allowed Matute and her parents to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation—but only for as long as the program is renewed. Under Donald Trump’s first term, the administration tried to end TPS protections for thousands of recipients, but federal courts ultimately delayed those terminations. When Trump returned to office this year, his administration again began rolling back protections. For families like Matute’s, it felt like a cycle of dread repeating itself, keeping her up at night.

“It has been not only about mental and emotional state, but how do these systems have everything to do with how you view yourself, how you behave, how you respond, your psychological state, your physical symptoms?” she said. “Everything is intertwined with every person in power, all of those systems together make our identity.”

Motivated by those experiences, Matute pursued a doctorate in psychology and now works to support Latinx and immigrant communities through her private practice. Still, the precarity of TPS continues to shape her life. Her parents have grown tired and are accepting of the idea of being deported.

For Martinez, who is a high school senior, the future looks different from what she once imagined. She always wanted to leave New York for college and live on her own in a dorm.

“But now I don’t really want to do that anymore,” she said. “With everything that’s been going on, I feel like I can be of some use here at home.”

The fear of losing loved ones also extends far beyond undocumented communities. Across the country, refugee families are feeling the same collective anxiety that undocumented families have long endured. More than 90,000 Bhutanese people in the U.S.—most of them from a Nepali-speaking minority who were resettled after fleeing ethnic cleansing and surviving years in refugee camps since 2008—now find themselves facing a new wave of fear. Since March, ICE has arrested at least 60 Bhutanese in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, and other states, deporting 27 of them. Most are still missing, unreachable to their families.

“We were very much caught off guard,” said Angel Bista, a 26-year-old Nepali-speaking interpreter and community advocate in Michigan.

Advocates say children raised in such environments don’t easily outgrow that fear.

“No matter how good a therapist I am, no intervention in the world is going to make these real problems disappear,” Espinoza said. “Until we have true immigration reform, are my clients ever really going to be able to rest?”

On 15 October 2025, more than 40 legal and migration professionals, including judges, prosecutors, lawyers and employees of the General Inspectorate for Migration attended the Launch event of the Council of Europe HELP course on “Refugee and Migrant Children”. The course provides an overview of the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and aims to strengthen the knowledge, practical skills, and decision-making capacity of participants to apply child-rights standards in migration and asylum cases.

On 21–22 October 2025, 15 representatives from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, including the General Inspectorate for Migration and the General Inspectorate of Border Police, as well as the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Republic of Moldova participated in a two-day Study Visit to Bucharest and Galati, Romania. The visit aimed to provide an in-depth understanding of Romania’s legal and regulatory framework for migrant and refugee integration, to facilitate the exchange of good practices, including on gender-responsive policies and approaches, and to strengthen cooperation between Moldovan and Romanian practitioners working in the field of migration and integration.

From March to September 2025, the Council of Europe supported three grassroot projects in Armenia to promote social and economic inclusion of refugee women and girls. Implemented by For Equality Human Rights, Hub Artsakh, and Armenian Progressive Youth NGOs, the initiatives combined entrepreneurship training, skill-building workshops, mentoring, and awareness-raising on labour rights and gender-based violence. In total, 158 women and girls in vulnerable situation, including 66 refugee women and girls, enhanced their professional skills, confidence, and resilience. As a result, one in four secured employment, while half engaged in self-employment or home-based work. The projects also created safe spaces for psychological and social support and strengthened cooperation among local authorities, civil society, and professionals.

These initiatives contribute to the Council of Europe’s ongoing efforts to advance gender equality, prevent violence against women, and empower women across Armenia.

They didn’t leave.

For two weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors sat guard in the hospital lobby 24 hours a day, working in shifts to monitor her movements, her attorney Ming Tanigawa-Lau said.

ICE later transferred the Salvadoran woman to Anaheim Global Medical Center, against her doctor’s orders and without explanation, her attorney said. There, Tanigawa-Lau said, ICE agents were allowed to stay in Solis-Portillo’s hospital room round-the-clock, listening to what should have been private conversations with providers. Solis-Portillo told her attorney that agents pressured her to say she was well enough to leave the hospital, telling her she wouldn’t be able to speak to her family or her attorney until she complied.

“She described it to me as feeling like she was being tortured,” Tanigawa-Lau said.

Legal experts say ICE agents can be in public areas of a hospital, such as a lobby, and can accompany already-detained patients as they receive care, illustrating the scope of federal authority. Detained patients, however, have rights and can try to advocate for themselves or seek legal recourse.

Earlier this year, California set aside $25 million to fund legal services for immigrants, and some local jurisdictions — including Orange County, Long Beach, and San Francisco — have put money toward legal aid efforts. The California Department of Social Services lists some legal defense nonprofits that have received funds.

Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law, said law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, can guard and even restrain a person in their custody who is receiving health care, but they must follow constitutional and health privacy laws regardless of the person’s immigration status. Under those laws, patients can ask to speak with medical providers in private and to seek and speak confidentially with legal counsel, she said.

“ICE should be stationed outside of the room or outside of earshot during any communication between the patient and their doctor or medical provider,” Genovese said, adding that the same applies to a patient’s communication with lawyers. “That’s what they’re supposed to do.”

ICE Guidelines

When it comes to communication and visits, ICE’s standards state that detainees should have access to a phone and be able to receive visits from family and friends, “within security and operational constraints.” However, these guidelines are not enforceable, Genovese said.

If immigration agents arrest someone without a warrant, they must tell them why they’ve been detained and generally can’t hold them for more than 48 hours without making a custody determination. A federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order in a case in which a man named Bayron Rovidio Marin was monitored by immigration agents in a Los Angeles hospital for 37 days without being charged and was registered under a pseudonym.

In the past, perceived violations by agents could be reported to ICE leadership at local field offices, to the agency’s headquarters, or to an oversight body, Genovese said. But earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security cut staffing at ombudsman offices that investigate civil rights complaints, saying they “obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles.”

The assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said that agents arrested Marin for being in the country illegally and that he admitted his lack of legal status to ICE agents. She said agents took him to the hospital after he injured his leg while trying to evade federal officers during a raid. She said officers did not prevent him from seeing his family or from using the phone.

“All detainees have access to phones they can use to contact their families and lawyers,” she said.

McLaughlin said the temporary restraining order was issued by an “activist” judge. She did not address questions about staffing cuts at the ombudsman offices.

DHS also said Solis-Portillo was in the country illegally. The department said she had been removed from the United States twice and arrested for the crimes of false identification, theft, and burglary.

“ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” McLaughlin said. “It is a long-standing practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This includes access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.”

Protections in California

Anaheim Global Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Dignity Health, which operates Glendale Memorial Hospital, said it “cannot legally restrict law enforcement or security personnel from being present in public areas which include the hospital lobby/waiting area.”

California enacted a law in September that prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters. But many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have involved detained patients brought in for care.

Erika Frank, vice president of legal counsel for the California Hospital Association, said hospitals have always had law enforcement, including federal agents, bring in people they’ve detained who need medical attention.

Hospitals will defer to law enforcement on whether a patient needs to be monitored at all times, according to association spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea. If law enforcement officers overhear medical information about a patient while they’re in the hospital, it doesn’t constitute a patient-privacy violation, she added.

“This is no different, legally, from a patient or visitor overhearing information about another patient in a nearby bed or emergency department bay,” Emerson-Shea said in a statement.

She didn’t address whether patients can demand privacy with providers and attorneys, and she said hospitals don’t tell family and friends about the detained patient’s location, for safety reasons.

Sandy Reding, who is president of the California Nurses Association and visited the Glendale facility when Solis-Portillo was there, said nurses and patients were frightened to see masked immigration agents in the hospital’s lobby. She said she saw them sitting behind a registration desk where they could hear people discuss private health information.

“Hospitals used to be a sanctuary place, and now they’re not,” she said. “And it seems like ICE has just been running rampant.”

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Nov. 18 on a proposal to provide more protections for detainees at county-operated health facilities. These include limiting the ability of immigration officials to hide patients’ identities, allowing patients to consent to the release of information to family members and legal counsel, and directing staff to insist immigration agents leave the room at times to protect patient privacy. The county would also defend employees who try to uphold its policies.

Solis-Portillo’s lawyer, Tanigawa-Lau, said her client ultimately decided to self-deport to El Salvador rather than fight her case, because she felt she couldn’t get the medical care she needed in ICE custody.

“Even though Milagro’s case is really terrible, I’m glad that there’s more awareness now about this issue,” Tanigawa-Lau said.

Republicans in the House could be on track today to approve the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a vote that follows President Donald Trump's unexpected blessing for a measure that has driven rancor through the party and its base.

The bipartisan effort, which has been led by Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was long fought by Trump and Republican leadership from reaching the House floor. As recently as last week, White House officials met with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., about her support for releasing the files, but her position was unchanged after the meeting.

Trump has also attacked Republicans for pushing the measure, including Massie and most recently Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

However, Trump did an about face over the weekend as it became clear a vote in the House was likely to succeed, and said Republicans should approve the bill.

On Monday, Trump told reporters at the White House that the Senate can take up the bill as well, and that he would sign it if it passes. The measure, if passed, would compel the Justice Department to release all of its files on the convicted sex offender within 30 days.

""I'm all for it,"" Trump said from the Oval Office, but maintained it was a ""hoax"" that he didn't want to ""detract"" from his party's success.

Trump does not need legislation in order to approve the files for release, but he told reporters that Congress ""can do whatever they want"" on the vote.

His remarks came after a simple majority of House members signed onto what is known as a discharge petition – a workaround that forces votes without leadership or committee approval. Last week, the chamber's newest member, Rep. Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., became the decisive 218th signature on the petition.

Grijalva's swearing in was delayed for seven weeks after her election, galvanizing Democrats who accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., of stalling in order to put off the vote. Johnson rejected that claim, saying her oath of office would not be taken until the government shutdown fight was resolved. He also committed to not block the vote on the House floor.

Tuesday's expected vote also comes after a wave of Epstein files were released last week by members on the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. Democrats first released a set of three emails, followed by thousands of pages of new files released by the panel's chairman, James Comer, R-Ky. The documents triggered new questions about the extent of Trump's relationship with the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender before his death in 2019.

Ahead of the vote, Massie and Khanna plan to gather with survivors and their families and friends. They last appeared together in September on Capitol Hill to lobby for the release of the Epstein files, saying transparency was the path to holding those involved fully accountable.

Survivors reiterated that position in a Friday letter to Congress in which they urged the release of files relating to Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving time at a Texas facility after her conviction on trafficking charges.

""Epstein and Maxwell's crimes exposed a double standard of justice, where rich and powerful men and women evade repercussions,"" they wrote.

Americans will likely face higher prices on items for their Thanksgiving dinners this year.

Turkey, typically the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving meal, will be one of the biggest sticker shocks for consumers. Wholesale prices for a turkey have jumped 40% from a year ago, according to the Department of Agriculture. Outbreaks of avian influenza, or bird flu, and increased demand have contributed to these higher prices.

Those opting for beef instead of turkey should also prepare to pay more. Beef prices are nearly 15% higher than they were last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Canned vegetables are 5% more expensive compared to last year, due to higher packaging costs from the steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump administration put in place earlier this year.

President Trump announced Friday that he would be rolling back tariffs he imposed on beef, coffee, tropical fruits and other commodities, in an effort to combat high prices at grocery stores.

David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, said those rollbacks won't lower prices completely, as tariffs aren't the only cause of increasing prices.

""By removing the tariffs, what we're doing is we're slowing down the increase in the price of many of these goods,"" Ortega said. ""So while we may not see prices go down for the holidays, it helps in terms of moderating the price increases that we've been accustomed to at the grocery store.""

Some grocery items have seen some price decreases in time for the holiday season. Egg prices have seen a decline from earlier this year, and domestic wine prices are down about 1.2% from last year due to a steady supply and softening demand.

Ortega says buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits or vegetables is one way consumers can avoid higher prices from aluminum packaging. He also recommends shoppers plan their meals out in advance, look for private label or store brands over name brands, and shop early for certain items to take advantage of sales or promotions grocery stores might have.

""It really pays off to plan ahead and create a shopping list, making sure you're sticking to it and avoiding impulse purchases,"" Ortega said.

This story was originally published by Boyle Heights Beat on Nov. 17, 2025.

After a report revealed federal immigration agents are allowed to interfere in medical decisions at Adventist Health White Memorial, the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network is calling for hospital administrators to uphold patient privacy and ensure that staff can advocate for patients without retaliation.

The article, published by LAist on Oct. 9, reported that hospital administrators are blocking doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care. Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist.

Community demands stronger protections

Since then, community stakeholders who are part of the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network presented demands at a Nov. 5 meeting with hospital leaders, including Kerry Heinrich, the president and chief executive officer of Adventist Health System, and John Raffoul, president of Adventist Health White Memorial.

As part of those demands, the network — which is made up of residents and community leaders from organizations like Legacy LA, InnerCity Struggle and Centro CSO — wants immigration agents out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures. Many in the network have deep ties to White Memorial, including having friends who were born there or taking their children for care at the hospital.

Hospital issues memo in response to community concerns

In response, White Memorial, in a Nov. 12 memo, thanked community leaders for sharing their concerns and outlined the following five points:

“Every patient’s privacy is protected and respected. We follow the laws that keep people’s medical information private, and we take that responsibility very seriously.

Doctors and nurses make care decisions together with their patients. No outside groups tell them how to treat a patient.

When there is a medical reason to contact a family, our team can do that through the right process. There are rules we must follow, but our goal is always to support care and connection whenever possible.

Law enforcement officers cannot interfere with medical care or put anyone’s safety at risk. Our hospital protects the privacy and safety of everyone here — patients, families, and staff.

We stand by our care teams. They are supported and protected as they care for every person with kindness and respect.”

“We know trust takes time to build and can be lost quickly. Many of you told us that trust has been broken, and we understand that. We want to keep earning your trust through open communication, transparency, and action, not just words,” the memo reads.

The memo — signed by Juan De La Cruz, president of the Adventist Health White Memorial Charitable Foundation — does not specifically address the network’s demand that agents be kept out of patient rooms during medical consultations and procedures.

Leaders say the memo falls short of key demands

Raquel Roman, executive director of Proyecto Pastoral, which operates the Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network, said White Memorial’s memo is a “good first attempt.” But, she added, “it doesn’t meet the demands we presented.”

“There is still opportunity to continue dialogue,” Roman said.

“Ultimately, we want to make sure our community and the doctors treating our community feel safe being at White Memorial, whether they go in there on their own or if somebody gets detained by ICE,” she said.

Lucy Herrera, executive director of Legacy LA, said the memo contained “a lot of gray area.”

“The way they [White Memorial] responded in the memo makes it seem like they’ve already been doing all of these things, when we’ve been hearing the opposite,” said Herrera.

Herrera said an open dialogue with White Memorial can be beneficial. “As a coalition, I want to stay vigilant to ensure that they comply with our demands,” she said.

For Henry Perez, executive director of InnerCity Struggle, the memo “signals that they have heard the community’s concerns.” However, he said, the hospital’s response is doing the “bare minimum.” As a hospital, “they already should be protecting patients’ privacy,” he said.

“White Memorial has the opportunity to fully stand with our immigrant communities … and it falls short of really communicating and conveying that they understand the horrors that our community is going through at the hands of ICE agents,” Perez said.

Sol Márquez, with the social justice group Centro CSO, wants White Memorial to make specific assurances that hospital staff won’t be punished when advocating for patients. In the memo, Marquez said, “I don’t think that they’re actually saying anything concrete.”

“We just really don’t want any of the staff to be reprimanded for asking ICE to leave the room, and for trying to make a rightful connection with the detainees and their families,” Márquez said.

Network presses for concrete changes in ongoing talks

As part of efforts to call attention to the issue, Centro CSO launched a petition soon after the LAist article was published, calling for White Memorial to uphold HIPAA, the federal law that safeguards patient privacy, and to bar U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from making medical decisions for patients.

It urges White Memorial not to retaliate against or reprimand doctors and nurses “for asking ICE to leave examination rooms.”

Sammy Carrera with Centro CSO said the petition has garnered more than 300 signatures so far.

The petition highlights the role of White Memorial in Boyle Heights.

“White Memorial is situated in a working-class neighborhood made up of predominantly Chicano, Latino, and undocumented people. ICE is bringing detainees to this hospital knowing their presence threatens the very community they are attacking and deporting,” the petition reads.

The Boyle Heights Immigrant Rights Network is meeting to discuss next steps. De La Cruz notes in the memo that the hospital is “committed to keeping the conversation going.”

“We are opening our doors for guided visits to help you see how care works inside the hospital. We are also creating new ways for you to be part of hospital discussions and advisory groups,” the memo reads.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting agreed Monday to fulfill a $36 million, multi-year contract with NPR that it had yanked after pressure from the Trump White House.

The arrangement resolves litigation filed by NPR accusing the corporation of illegally yielding to President Donald Trump's demands that the network be financially punished for its news coverage. The argument, part of a broader lawsuit by NPR and several stations against the Trump administration, focused on CPB funding for NPR's operation of a satellite distribution system for local public radio stations. NPR announced Monday it would waive all fees for the stations associated with the satellite service.

The judge in the case had explicitly told CPB's legal team he did not find its defense credible. CPB lawyers had argued that the decision to award the contract to a new consortium of public media institutions was driven by a desire to foster digital innovations more swiftly.

""The settlement is a victory for editorial independence and a step toward upholding the First Amendment rights of NPR and the public media system in our legal challenge to [Trump's] Executive Order,"" Katherine Maher, President and CEO of NPR, said in a statement. ""While we entered into this dispute with CPB reluctantly, we're glad to resolve it in a way that enables us to continue to provide for the stability of the Public Radio Satellite System, offer immediate and direct support to public radio stations across the country, and proceed with our strong and substantive claims against this illegal and unconstitutional Executive Order. We look forward to our day in court in December.""

In its submission Monday evening to the court, CPB did not concede that it had acted wrongfully — nor that it had yielded to political pressure from the administration.

Instead, in a statement posted on its website, CPB asserted its side ""prevails"" as a result of the settlement.

""This is an important moment for public media,"" said Patricia Harrison, President and CEO of CPB. ""We are very pleased that this costly and unnecessary litigation is over, and that our investment in the future through [Public Media Infrastructure] marks an exciting new era for public media."" CPB had awarded a rival contract to PMI, a newly created consortium of public radio organizations including several major stations, to ensure the digital distribution system functions properly. That contract will continue, CPB said.

Federal subsidies for public broadcasting stopped on Oct. 1 as a result of a party-line vote over the summer by Congress, called a rescission. Only a skeleton crew remains at CPB, which was created as a nonprofit corporation more than a half-century ago to funnel federal subsidies to public media. While PBS has had layoffs and NPR is monitoring its own finances, many local stations across the country have been hit hard.

Over the course of the litigation this fall, mounting evidence appeared to demonstrate that CPB's board chair and executives had acted against NPR in what turned out to be a futile attempt to salvage the corporation's own future.

In hearings last month in Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss told CPB's legal team they had not made a credible case for why the corporation reneged on the contract just a day after a top White House official warned senior CPB leaders against doing business with NPR. A trial had been set to start on Dec. 1.

CPB's change of mind — and NPR's ensuing lawsuit — sparked consternation and unease within the larger public media ecosystem. The two organizations had served as partners for decades. But that relationship frayed earlier this year, as the system came under attack from the Trump administration.

Trump's public campaign against NPR and PBS started in earnest soon after he returned to the White House. Trump kicked it into high gear in late March with a series of social media posts.

In early April, CPB leaders sought to get money out the door before Trump took action against public media. On April 2, CPB's board approved the extension of a contract with NPR to distribute public radio programs, including those not produced by NPR. The arrangement stretched back four decades. The amount included millions still due on the then-current contract.

The next day, CPB's board chair and two senior executives met with a top White House budget official who attested to her ""intense dislike for NPR."" The budget official told them CPB didn't have to ""throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" according to a deposition from CPB executive Clayton Barsoum submitted as part of NPR's legal filings.

And the day after that — just 48 hours after that board vote — CPB reversed itself. CPB executive Kathy Merritt informed NPR's top official over the satellite and distribution service that it had to be spun off: it could not be part of NPR. NPR refused to do so. CPB revised the scope of the contract and solicited new bids. NPR's submission proved unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, the White House was ramping up the pressure. It accused NPR and PBS of bias. On April 14, for example, it issued a formal statement that called their offerings ""radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news'."" NPR and PBS's chief executives have rejected the accusations of bias.

On May 1, Trump issued an executive order that no federal money should go to the two public broadcasting networks. NPR and three Colorado public radio stations then filed suit against the White House, saying they were being unlawfully punished because the president did not like their news coverage. They contended the executive order represented a violation of First Amendment protections. Their suit names CPB as a defendant as well for, in their characterization, bending to the president's will. In Monday's legal filing, CPB agreed that the executive order was precisely the sort of government interference that Congress sought to prevent in establishing CPB as it did.

In the summer, Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress, urged on by Trump, pulled back all $1.1 billion for future public broadcasting that had already been approved and signed into law by the president.

Throughout the legal battle, NPR has said, regardless of the outcome of the case, it would work with Public Media Infrastructure.

NPR's broader constitutional case against Trump's executive order purporting to ban federal funding of public media continues. A hearing on its merits is scheduled for December.

And they’re like: “We’re being transferred.” She said: “We’re going to transfer you to Maine.” I was like: Maine?
I don’t feel like this was a mistake.","I was reapplying for my work visa in the immigration office. I was doing everything completely legally. I came to the U.S. legally 11 and a half years ago. I was granted asylum. Then I got a notice to appear in one of ICE’s offices in June for what they called a routine check-in. We went to Cancún for vacation with my family. When we came back, got out of the plane, they pulled me aside and I didn’t understand why. They said: “You need to reapply through the consulate and we need to send you back to Canada.” And in my head, I thought that meant: OK, I’m just getting on a plane and going home. I was never concerned. I had a green card. I traveled multiple times before out of the country. I was sitting there, looking for flights to go home, and I was taken. They were like: “We have to detain you.” I was under arrest. With no explanation. It felt like I had been kidnapped. You’re kidnapping me. They said they are detaining and deporting people who are here illegally and criminals. I was never in the country illegally. I did not come here illegally. I was legal from day one. Having a mother taken away from her kids, I felt like a knife was just like — it’s like stabbing my heart. I never expect this in America. I was taken to the first detention center in chains. When I got there, I was like: Where am I? It looks like a prison. They took us to the booking. We’re asked to strip naked in front of each other. There were 30 of us in one cell, just like a line of bunks and then open showers and toilets. And you are supposed to use this toilet in front of 12, 14 other people. If I wanted to use the bathroom, I feel violated. What did we do to be treated this way? That is inhumane. I was treated like a criminal, like I killed somebody. And every single time I asked a question, it was: “I’m not your case officer. I don’t know. I’m just doing my job.” They said, “Listen, I know every one of you will say, ‘I left my kids at home with no one to take care of them.’ I don’t care. You will say that you haven’t eaten anything all day long. I don’t care. You will say that you’re terrified, you are here unjustly. I don’t care.” Super cold. Freezing, freezing. They nicknamed them the ICE boxes. I don’t think it’s more than 30 degrees. We’re huddled, trying to stay warm, wrapped in these aluminum foils, looking like dead bodies. There’s no window that you can look outside. I never was able to breathe fresh air. Fluorescent lights are shining 24/7. I couldn’t sleep. We kept hearing rats squeal, like, scream. One of the girls had her period, and there was blood everywhere. They knew I was on my menstrual cycle, but I was not offered to shower for five days. This nurse comes in, and she’s like: “Pregnancy test.” She made us pee in front of each other into these Dixie cups. We’re all just standing there in a circle, holding our open urine, and she’s plopping these pregnancy tests in and then being like: “OK, you guys are good. Chuck it back in the toilet.” The food was horrible. It was disgusting. I ended up getting very sick. I lost a lot of my weight. Twenty pounds. My body was really starting to shut down. I felt like, oh, my goodness, am I going to die here? I worked as a journalist in Egypt and I was persecuted and detained and tortured. My experience at the Butler County Jail was more traumatizing than my detention in Egypt. I got woken up in the middle of the night, and they’re like: “Jasmine, you’re leaving.” I jumped up. I’m like: I’m going home? And they’re like: “We’re being transferred.” She said: “We’re going to transfer you to Maine.” I was like: Maine? “You’re going to Arizona.” I’m like: Why am I going to Arizona? I begged every single guard for help. Can you please tell anyone, your supervisor, that I would love to pay for my flight home? Just get me out of here. ICE issued a statement saying I was was “detained for not having legal documentation to be in the U.S.” I do not support anyone being in a country illegally. I had all my paperwork. I was in the immigration office. I was never in the country illegally. It says “a green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation’s laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if a law is broken and abused.” In my early 20s, I was young. I was in college. I got in trouble for possession of marijuana. I was pardoned. It was dismissed. It’s been years. And I have renewed my green card twice. Never had an issue with immigration. “U.S.C.I.S. obtained evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier 3 terrorist organization.” I volunteered with a nonprofit that took care of orphans and poor and sick people in Egypt. So basically, they tried to link this nonprofit which is a most reputable, respected nonprofit to a Tier 3 undesignated terrorist organization. This is how they framed it. I don’t feel like this was a mistake. I feel like this was on purpose. That is not a rare case. This is systematic. They are just grabbing anyone that they can. They’re trying to find ways to deport as many people, even if these people were here legally. Not knowing what’s going to happen to me, it felt like that was the worst because I wanted just to call my husband. I wanted to hear my kids, that my kids are OK. During the time that I was there, it was also my daughter’s birthday. I feel like they took that away from me. I was scared they were going to forget me. I was put on solitary confinement for six days for advocating for myself and the other Muslim inmates to have a quiet space to pray. That’s when my mental health started to deteriorate too fast. “It’s just a matter of time. You will get deported and get killed in Egypt.” That was the thing that I couldn’t get out of my mind. I’ll just get deported and get killed. I had a medical check, and I had to go visit this nurse. She could tell that I was distraught and confused, and she looked at me. And she goes: “Can I pray for you?” And she said this beautiful prayer in Spanish that I have no idea what she was saying. I just cried, and I cried. And I cried. And she just held my hands, and I was like: OK, I’m going to get through this. An officer called and said, “Pack your stuff.” Where am I going? “Just pack your stuff.” I was transferred back to the San Diego prison. It was a two-hour drive. Someone just grabbed me and said: “You’re coming with me this way.” She’s like: “Yeah, Uncuff her. She’s being released today.” My eyes just like: What? He said, “You are released.” I actually forget what the word ‘released’ mean in English, to be honest. It just, I didn’t — “What do you mean by released?” I was in shock. They stripped the chains off of me quickly, snuck me into the airport, escort me onto the plane, sit me down, and they’re like: “OK, you’re free. You can use your cellphone now. Take care.” And they’re kind of like, “Outside.” And I did not know where to go. I didn’t have a phone. An officer said, “We just got this letter today. The Department of Homeland Security reinstated your asylum status. It was the happiest moment of my entire life. [ARABIC SPEAKING] “Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allah.” So the first thing we did was to drive to the mosque. Then we went out to eat in a Palestinian restaurant. I ate a lot. I was happy to see my husband. I was more happy to see my girls, no offense. The youngest one was having nightmares and kept waking up. So I knew they needed me and just reassure them I’m OK, even though it’s still hard for me. It’s still fragile. I am a different person than the person that got detained. I lost my job that I love. I lost my health insurance. I was not able to finish my degree all because I got detained for 73 days. I was so lucky to have only been in there for two weeks. Can you imagine someone in the system that doesn’t have my privilege, all the lawyers, all the money, all my connections? The majority of the women that I met have been in there for months. I received a five-year ban from America. Everyone asked me, they’re like: “Well, you’re never going to go back, are you?” I’m appealing. I want to go back. I love America. I am in the process now of getting my citizenship. I still love the American people. But I’m doubting if I’ll ever feel safe and call the United States my home. I don’t think this government will stop. Your government is funding a system that doesn’t follow any rules. Immigrants will be the first target. After that, they will target any opposition. Violating due process this time means they will violate it again and again and again.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/13/arts/17op-ice-detention-clean-thumb/17op-ice-detention-clean-thumb-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay,N,,2025-11-18 03:56:38.090865

(AP) — Federal immigration authorities will expand their enforcement action in North Carolina to Raleigh as soon as Tuesday, the mayor of the state’s capital city said, while Customs and Border Protection agents continue operating in Charlotte following a weekend that saw arrests of more than 130 people in that city.

Mayor Janet Cowell said Monday that she didn’t know how large the operation would be or how long agents would be present. Immigration authorities haven’t spoken about it. The Democrat said in a statement that crime was lower in Raleigh this year compared to last and that public safety was a priority for her and the city council.

“I ask Raleigh to remember our values and maintain peace and respect through any upcoming challenges,” Cowell said in a statement.

U.S. immigration agents arrested more than 130 people over the weekend in a sweep through Charlotte, North Carolina’s largest city, a federal official said Monday.

The movements in North Carolina come after the Trump administration launched immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago. Both of those are deep blue cities in deep blue states run by nationally prominent officials who make no secret of their anger at the White House. The political reasoning there seemed obvious.

But why North Carolina and why was Charlotte the first target there?

Sure the mayor is a Democrat, as is the governor, but neither is known for wading into national political battles. In a state where divided government has become the norm, Gov. Josh Stein in particular has tried hard to get along with the GOP-controlled state legislature. The state's two U.S. senators are both Republican and President Donald Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on North Carolina because of so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local authorities and immigration agents.

But maybe focusing on a place where politics is less outwardly bloody was part of the equation.

The White House “can have enough opposition (to its crackdown), but it's a weaker version"" than what it faced in places like Chicago, said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies local government, immigration and federalism.

“They’re not interested in just deporting people. They’re interested in the show,” he said.

The crackdown

The Trump administration has made Charlotte, a Democratic city of about 950,000 people, its latest focus for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime — despite local opposition and declining crime rates. Residents reported encounters with immigration agents near churches, apartment complexes and stores.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Border Patrol officers had arrested “over 130 illegal aliens who have all broken” immigration laws. The agency said the records of those arrested included gang membership, aggravated assault, shoplifting and other crimes, but it did not say how many cases had resulted in convictions, how many people had been facing charges or any other details.

The crackdown set off fierce objections from area leaders.

“We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color,” Stein said in a video statement late Sunday. “This is not making us safer. It’s stoking fear and dividing our community.”

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Monday she was “deeply concerned” about videos she’s seen of the crackdown but also said she appreciates protesters’ peacefulness.

“To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: You are not alone. Your city stands with you,” she said in a statement.

The debate over crime and immigration

Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County have both found themselves part of America’s debates over crime and immigration, two of the most important issues to the White House.

The most prominent was the fatal stabbing this summer of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train, an attack captured on video. While the suspect was from the U.S., the Trump administration repeatedly highlighted that he had been arrested previously more than a dozen times.

Charlotte, which had a Republican mayor as recently as 2009, is now a city dominated by Democrats, with a growing population brought by a booming economy. The racially diverse city includes more than 150,000 foreign-born residents, officials say.

Lyles easily won a fifth term as mayor earlier this month, defeating her Republican rival by 45 percentage points even as GOP critics blasted city and state leaders for what they call rising incidents of crime. Following the Nov. 4 election, Democrats are poised to hold 10 of the other 11 seats on the city council.

While the Department of Homeland Security has said it is focusing on the state because of sanctuary policies, North Carolina county jails have long honored “detainers,” or requests from federal officials to hold an arrested immigrant for a limited time so agents can take custody of them. Nevertheless, some common, noncooperation policies have existed in a handful of places, including Charlotte, where the police do not help with immigration enforcement.

In Mecklenburg County, the jail did not honor detainer requests for several years, until after state law effectively made it mandatory starting last year.

DHS said about 1,400 detainers across North Carolina had not been honored since October 2020, putting the public at risk.

For years, Mecklenburg Sheriff Garry McFadden pushed back against efforts by the Republican-controlled state legislature to force him and a handful of sheriffs from other urban counties to accept ICE detainers.

Republicans ultimately overrode a veto by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper late last year to enact the bill into law.

While McFadden has said his office is complying with the law’s requirement, he continued a public feud with ICE leaders in early 2025 that led to a new state law toughening those rules. Stein vetoed that measure, but the veto was overridden.

Republican House Speaker Destin Hall said in a Monday post on X that immigration agents are in Charlotte because of McFadden’s past inaction: “They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city.”

Last month, McFadden said he'd had a productive meeting with an ICE representative.

“I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,” McFadden said in a statement.

But such talk doesn't calm the political waters.

“Democrats at all levels are choosing to protect criminal illegals over North Carolina citizens,” state GOP Chairman Jason Simmons said Monday.

Rutilio Vázquez, who lives in the East Valley Farms neighborhood, says federal agents arrived at 5:30 a.m. Thursday, with bright lights, drones, and loud commands as they ordered people to exit one of the properties.

“When they talk, they say that we are federal police or something like that. ‘We want you to come out with hands on your head,’” he told KSBY News in Spanish.

ICE reports that three undocumented people from Mexico and one U.S. citizen were arrested. Investigators allege a labor recruiter named Jorge Vasquez collected illegal fees – in one case up to $8,000, including a $1,000 upfront deposit – in exchange for the opportunity to work in the U.S. under H-2A visas.

According to ICE, the money was deducted from the farm workers’ wages and the workers were threatened with violence or deportation if they failed to comply or complained to government inspectors.

During the raid, multiple community members arrived, attempting to confront law enforcement. Federal agents deployed flash-bangs in an attempt to disperse the crowd.

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell confirmed to ABC11 that federal agents will be in Raleigh on Tuesday.

""As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays, and learns in Raleigh feels safe,"" Cowell said in a statement. ""We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh.

Other Democrats, including Durham Mayor Leo Williams and Gov. Josh Stein also reacted to the news of federal action.

""We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety,"" Williams said. ""Durham does not operate from fear. We lead with compassion, justice and determination. Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.""

Stein said, ""Our office is aware of reports that the Border Patrol is bringing its operation to Raleigh. Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations. Stop targeting people simply going about their lives because of the color of their skin, as you are doing in Charlotte. To the people of Raleigh: remain peaceful, and if you see something wrong, record it and report it to local law enforcement. Let's keep each other safe.""

In Morrisville, Councilmember Steve Rao said he was already getting messages from people wondering what documentation they should carry with them.

""Uncertainty about paper work, what kind of paperwork should I have in my car if I'm driving, do I need to have my immigration status, my visa, am I waiting for a green card?"" said Rao.

Agents spent the weekend in Charlotte. Protests were held across Charlotte before and during the agents' presence.

While many of the raids in Charlotte targeted Hispanic-owned businesses, Rao also worried about the possible effects on Morrisville's large South Asian population.

""So there is this fear and uncertainty about how you're treated, how you're handled,"" Rao said. ""I think many Indian-Americans are here legally on skilled immigration visas. There's been concerns about fees being increased to $100,000 from $5,000 for applying for those. And if there are people here illegally, whether their paperwork has transpired or whatever, these people need to know their rights.""

On Sunday in Raleigh, hundreds of people marched from Moore Square to the State Capitol in downtown Raleigh to protest what they saw happening in Charlotte.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

Green Party MP for North Herefordshire Ellie Chowns said she was ""really worried"" about Monday's announcement.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood detailed sweeping reforms of the UK's immigration policy, meaning anyone granted asylum will be returned home if their country is deemed safe in the future.

Addressing the House of Commons, the minister said she had a ""moral duty"" to fix the ""broken asylum system"" and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Chowns responded: ""The right to seek asylum for someone fleeing violence in their home country... is a basic principle of international law and it's also a basic principle of our shared humanity.

""And it appears what the government is trying to do is really lean into this whole narrative that all of the problems in the country are to do with people coming over in small boats.

""It's completely false and it's deeply, deeply concerning.""

Under the government's plans, a refugee would have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

There are also plans to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied.

It would mean only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, would be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will also join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9b0f/live/617f15c0-c3de-11f0-bbb8-f506e20a7d44.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 02:56:36.734055

Durham leaders denounce Border Patrol actions

In Durham, Mayor Leo Williams opened Monday night’s City Council meeting with a joint statement from him; Nida Allam, chair of the Durham County Board of Commissioners; and Bettina Umstead, chair of the Durham school board.

“We’re deeply troubled by recent news accounts of increased presence of immigration officers in and around North Carolina,” Williams read. “We want to assert a courageous stance on behalf of our immigrant communities that are essential to the fabric of our state and city. We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights and compromises safety.

“Durham does not operate from fear,” he added. “We lead with compassion, justice, determination. Our schools, neighborhoods and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages and experiences that define Durham.”

Concerns about who will be targeted

State Democratic leaders representing Charlotte said earlier Monday that the arrests amounted to racial profiling, The N&O reported. Mecklenburg County Democratic Rep. Carolyn Logan denounced the tactics of “reaching and grabbing ... for whoever they can see and grabbing them off the street. They don’t know if they’re criminals, they’re just looking to skin color.”

Later Monday, after news about Raleigh broke, State Sen. Lisa Grafstein, a Wake County Democrat, said in a text to The N&O that she shares concerns raised by Stein after the Border Patrol deployment in Charlotte “about the methods being used and the violent targeting of people who are simply living their lives peacefully.”

“We saw in Chicago that the vast majority of people being targeted have no criminal history,” Grafstein said. “Many of the actions we are seeing are unconstitutional and are bringing violence and chaos. I hope and believe that the people of Wake County — a welcoming and diverse community — will look out for each other.”

Rep. Phil Rubin, a former federal prosecutor and a Wake County Democrat, said the conduct in Charlotte was “unacceptable, un-American, and dangerous.” In a news release, he urged residents — including immigrants, who have rights — to know their rights ahead of federal agents’ expected presence in Raleigh.

“During my service as a federal prosecutor right here in Raleigh, I worked with federal agents — people who used their immense power carefully, targeted dangerous offenders to keep our communities safe and lived their oath to uphold the Constitution,” Rubin said. “What we’ve seen from federal agents in Charlotte is not the work of the federal law enforcement I knew. It would not have been tolerated then, and we should not tolerate it now.”

Asked about the Triangle deployment, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson shared a statement about the people arrested in Charlotte over the weekend, “who have all broken the immigration laws of our country.”

“Criminal records of those arrested include known gang membership, aggravated assault, possession of a dangerous weapon, felony larceny, simple assault, hit and run, possession of stolen goods, shoplifting, DUI, DWI, and illegal re-entry after prior deportation, a felony,” the Homeland Security statement says.

The Observer reported that federal immigration agencies have not released names or paperwork, or said where those arrested are being detained, so the claim about records could not be verified.

“We will not stop enforcing the laws of our nation until every criminal illegal alien is arrested and removed from our country,” the Homeland Security statement says.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched at around 10:40 p.m., according to a news release.
The teenager and his family, who are all U.S. citizens, “were already scared to begin with” before the incident, Kirakosian said.
Rodriguez interrogated him, asking where he and his family were from and demanded identification, Kirakosian said, for nearly 20 minutes.
Kirakosian said this incident likely resulted in an arrest because the agent was off duty.","An off-duty law enforcement officer was arrested in Riverside County last week after pulling a firearm on a 17-year-old and detaining him on the side of the road.

Gerardo Rodriguez, 46, was known by neighbors to be an agent employed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Patrol, said Greg Kirakosian, a lawyer representing the teenager.

An ICE spokesperson wrote that Rodriguez is not employed by the agency. A CBP spokesperson said in a statement: “This matter is under investigation.”

The teenager had driven by Rodriguez’s home in Temecula to drop friends off at a nearby house at around 10 p.m. on Nov. 10, Kirakosian said. When he drove back he was stopped by Rodriguez, who pulled a gun. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department was dispatched at around 10:40 p.m., according to a news release.

Rodriguez was taken into custody without incident the next day and charged with assault by a public officer, child endangerment and assault with a deadly weapon, the Sheriff’s Department said. He posted bail the same day and his next court date is scheduled for Dec. 26.

The teenager and his family, who are all U.S. citizens, “were already scared to begin with” before the incident, Kirakosian said.

“They’re Mexican Americans, you know, in Southern California right now, and there’s ICE raids happening left and right,” he said.

Security camera footage from a neighbor shows Rodriguez “in the middle of the street, kind of marching down with a gun in his hand,” Kirakosian said.

“It’s not like he pulled it out in an emergency. He had it out. He was walking down the street with a gun in his hand,” he said.

As he sees the truck approach, Rodriguez walks toward the middle of the street, pulls out a gun and points it at the vehicle.

“Stop, stop. Slow down. Freeze. Police,” Rodriguez yells.

The teenager feared he would be shot, Kirakosian said, so he stopped. Rodriguez ordered him to park, again identifying himself as police, then approached the driver’s side and pointed his gun at the teenager. Rodriguez interrogated him, asking where he and his family were from and demanded identification, Kirakosian said, for nearly 20 minutes.

In the video, Rodriguez argues with the teenager, claiming he was speeding down the street. He repeatedly claims the teenager almost ran him over.

The teenager’s friends, who were still at a house nearby, saw the incident and notified parents who were also at the home and approached Rodriguez, eventually persuading him to let the teenager go, according to Kirakosian. They called the teenager’s mother, who immediately grabbed her son’s passport to prove his citizenship, he said. By the time the mother had arrived, Rodriguez had left, and they then called the police.

Police obtained a search warrant and confiscated Rodriguez’s security camera footage and the gun when they arrested him, Kirakosian said.

The incident is the latest in a growing number of armed confrontations involving ICE agents or people posing as them confronting people and demanding identification. An ICE agent was confronted by local police when he pulled a gun on a woman in Fullerton this month, and multiple ICE and Border Patrol shootings have taken place in and outside Southern California in recent months.

Kirakosian said this incident likely resulted in an arrest because the agent was off duty.

“You got ICE agents who apparently feel so emboldened by what they do on a day-to-day basis, they’re essentially treating their own neighborhoods as an area they need to start investigating,” Kirakosian said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/937907a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fef%2Fee6ba1ba44218b788e7ac2e7984a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2195569366,N,,2025-11-18 02:56:48.688886

Activists said they were concerned that the Department of Homeland Security operations that started in North Carolina's largest city could expand across the Tar Heel State.

""The damage is done in all 100 counties of North Carolina. I live in Raleigh. I have folks in Sanford, Chatham County, and Wilson. We're talking about families who are not leaving their homes and children who are not going to school,"" said Iliana Santillan with Brava NC. ""We have elderly folks who are not getting medical help they need because they are afraid,""

On Monday evening, Sen. Graig Meyer, a Democrat who represents Caswell, Person, and Orange counties, told ABC11 that federal agents will be in Raleigh as early as Tuesday this week.

Grassroots advocacy organizations such as Brava NC are partnering up, as they believe the effects of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Charlotte are already being felt across the state.

Santillan recommended that people who are concerned seek legal advice.

""I'm a naturalized citizen myself, and I have considered carrying my passport with me as a precautionary measure because right now we know they have questioned and harassed American citizens. So, nobody is really safe,"" she said.

This comes as the DHS launched Operation Charlotte's Web, an effort aimed at targeting people with criminal records who are in the country illegally. DHS said it is surging law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.

""We're seeing an increase in street stops and workplace stops,"" said Eisha Jain, the Henry P. Brandis Distinguished Professor of Law at UNC-Chapel Hill.

Jain said these efforts are similar to those in Chicago and Los Angeles. Though immigration enforcement efforts are in Charlotte now, she wouldn't rule out ICE's presence in other parts of the state, such as the Triangle, later.

""In terms of how areas are chosen, I think there's a lot of discretion on the part of the government in terms of where to concentrate immigration enforcement actions,"" she said.

Jaine told ABC11 that there's a lot of uncertainty as to why people are stopped and what happens during that interaction.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said.
As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer.
KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.","RIVERSIDE COUNTY, Calif. (KTLA) – A 45-year-old California man who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.

The Nov. 10 incident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, played out at around 10:30 pm outside a home in Temecula, California.

Lawyer Greg Kirakosian, who represents the boy and his family, told Nexstar’s KTLA that the 17-year-old was driving home after dropping a friend off down the street when he saw the suspect, identified by investigators as Gerardo Rodriguez, pointing a gun at his vehicle and demanding he pull over.

“In the moment, I think he was just scared for his life. He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” Kirakosian explained, referring to the teen. “Then that same person came up to his driver’s side door and pulled him out at gunpoint.”

In footage of the incident obtained by KTLA, the 45-year-old is seen pulling a gun from his waistband as he walks up the street, pointing it at the teen’s truck and demanding he stop the vehicle while reportedly brandishing his badge.

“Freeze, police,” Rodriguez shouts. “Put the car in f****** park. Get out of the car. Turn it off, get out. You’re speeding in the f****** neighborhood. Come over here, sit down, get your a** down. You have a driver’s license?”

The 45-year-old, who is known to residents on the street as an ICE agent and also reportedly told the boy he worked for ICE, then began interrogating the Mexican American teen, asking him who he was, where he is from and demanding documentation, eventually drawing the attention of others who live on the street.

“By the time our client’s parents showed up, the neighbors had essentially come to the rescue and stopped him from doing what he was doing, calming him down and forcing him to go back inside his house and leaving the boy alone,” Kirakosian said.

The teenager’s parents had been alerted by a friend to what was happening, prompting them to rush over from their home with their son’s passport, fearing the incident could be some type of immigrant enforcement operation. They called 911 after they arrived.

Responding deputies turned the investigation over to RCSD’s Investigation Bureau, who contacted Rodriguez later the same night, arrested him and conducted a search of his house “where evidence related to the investigation was collected,” the department said in a news release.

“I think right now, a lot of Mexican Americans, whether they are in a situation like this or not, who are angry upset and scared, and this just really came close to home for them,” Kirakosian said when asked how the family was doing after the harrowing ordeal.

The L.A.-based civil rights attorney added that he believes the 45-year-old has become emboldened by what he does and sees other ICE agents doing on a day-to-day basis.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said. “I don’t know how much worse the situation is going to get, honestly. This kid could’ve been shot.”

This incident comes after several others in which federal law enforcement agents have pulled their firearms on citizens.

On Nov. 9, video captured an ICE officer pointing his gun at a woman behind him in an intersection in Santa Ana, California, witnessed by a Fullerton police officer returning from the Santa Ana Jail facility, who refused to get involved if no crime had been committed.

Federal officials later claimed the woman was following the agent.

On Oct. 30, a 24-year-old Ontario man was shot by a federal agent who was reportedly trying to notify officers involved in an enforcement operation that there were children across the street.

In that instance, federal officials claimed the agent fired “defensive shots” while fearing the 24-year-old was attempting to run over officers.

As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center on allegations of assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer. Jail records show he posted bond and was released the same night.

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.

The proposals have been brought forward by Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan and Minister of State Colm Brophy.

The minister stressed that changes to the UK asylum laws ""can have an impact in Ireland"" and ""have had an impact in the past"".
""But that's not to say that the UK can't change their asylum laws.","The Coalition leaders are meeting in Dublin and are expected to sign off on a further tightening of migration rules, relating to the criteria for family reunifications.

The proposals have been brought forward by Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan and Minister of State Colm Brophy.

If passed by Cabinet next week, it will likely result in a reduction in the total number arriving under the family reunification policy which stood at 22,000 last year.

Applicants seeking family reunification will also have to be self sufficient and not owe accommodation costs.

Separately, the Coalition leaders are also discussing plans to change the current requirement that people who are granted refugee status may apply for naturalisation after three years' resident.

The new proposal would increase that to five years.

It comes as Minister O'Callaghan said earlier that Ireland will need to be ""nimble"" and may need to change its own laws and provisions in order to respond to a proposed overhaul in UK asylum laws.

Britain is set to overhaul its approach to human rights' laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive illegally, in a major shake-up of asylum policy.

Mr O'Callaghan said he expects the proposed changes to UK asylum laws will have an impact on Ireland and that the Government may have to change the law here in response.

In a statement this evening, the minister said he and the Government are aware that changes to the UK's asylum practices or laws can result in changes to the flow of asylum seekers between the UK and Ireland.

""I am committed to ensuring that Ireland is not viewed more favourably than the UK by those seeking to claim asylum,"" he said.

Mr O'Callaghan said he will closely monitor the changes proposed by the UK government and will ""respond to those proposals having considered them fully and discussed them with Government colleagues"".

""I will be publishing a new International Protection Bill to reform Ireland's asylum system later this year and any necessary changes arising from the UK’s change of policy can be included in that Bill,"" he said.

""Prior to the changes proposed by Home Secretary Mahmood, I had already directed a separate review of Ireland's rules on family reunification and will shortly bring proposals to Government in respect of this issue.""

The minister also spoke earlier at Farmleigh House following the British Irish-Intergovernmental Conference where he and Tánaiste Simon Harris met British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Hilary Benn and Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Matthew Patrick.

Mr O'Callaghan said ""every country has a right to introduce its own migration policy"".

""The British government has every right to bring forward its own proposals, but we would ask and are grateful for close engagement, because we clearly have interdependencies here because of the contract here,"" he said.

The minister stressed that changes to the UK asylum laws ""can have an impact in Ireland"" and ""have had an impact in the past"".

""But that's not to say that the UK can't change their asylum laws. They're perfectly entitled to change their asylum laws, and I thank them again for giving us a heads up in respect of it, however, what it does indicate is that I suppose we need to be nimble in Ireland as we may need to change our laws and our provisions as well to respond to any changes that have taken place in the UK,"" he said.

Mr Benn said he did not believe any of the new proposals would put the UK at odds with its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.

""The British government is absolutely committed to the European Convention of Human Rights, unlike other parties in Britain who want to take us out of it, and that really would undermine the Good Friday Agreement, which has seen so much progress take place in Northern Ireland,"" he said.

Mr Benn said there is a debate going on in the Council of Europe about the interpretation and application of various aspects of the ECHR, adding that ""there is a great deal of public concern about illegal migration to the United Kingdom"".

""This is undoubtedly the case, and that's why it's vital we have a system that everyone can have confidence in, that can distinguish between those who are trying to move for other reasons by claiming asylum, when, in fact, the sovereign system is there for people who are fleeing persecution,"" Mr Benn said.",https://www.rte.ie/images/00237e88-1600.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 22:56:15.963627

This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty

“This move is designed to create confusion and uncertainty. The courts have determined that public charge has a very narrow meaning and that it does not apply to benefits like health care that everyone inevitably needs at some point in their life. But now, immigration officials are sure to make inconsistent and arbitrary decisions, forcing families to guess at what programs may or may not count,” said Sarah Grusin, Senior Attorney at the National Health Law Program. “This is yet another breach of trust that will push families back into the shadows and deter them from seeking health care. NHeLP and our partners will fight to stop these harmful changes to public charge, just as we did during Trump’s first term.”

The current Biden-era rule’s definition of “public charge” assures families that immigration officials will not count most public benefits. Under the current rule, only cash assistance for income maintenance and government-funded long-term institutional care are considered in public charge determinations, meaning use of programs like most Medicaid, nutrition assistance, and housing support do not threaten an individual’s immigration status.

During the previous Trump administration, changes to the definition of public charge went well beyond the settled, historic understanding of public charge, causing widespread fear in immigrant communities and leading many to withdraw from or avoid enrolling in public programs, even when they or their children were fully eligible.

Refugee status

In a document outlining the changes, the government warns being granted refugee status ""is to essentially receive the ability to live in this country, forever"" - and must change to ""reflect our changing times"".

Refugee status will become temporary and subject to review every two and a half years under a ""core protection"" offer, way down from five years of initial right to remain currently offered.

Anyone granted refugee status will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe, while the wait for permanent status will be quadrupled to 20 years.

How UK and Denmark's immigration policies compare

Safe and legal routes

Refugee charities often claim the reason so many people cross the Channel in small boats is because there are not enough safe and legal routes asylum seekers can take to the UK.

The government has said it will introduce new routes. For those arriving on these for work and study, they could be offered long-term status in 10 years, subject to consultation.

Local communities will be able to sponsor individual refugees granted asylum, like the Homes for Ukraine scheme.

More families to be deported

The government says a ""hesitancy"" to deport families can lead to ""particularly perverse incentives"", such as people risking bringing their child to the UK illegally on the assumption that this will make them less likely to be removed.

To change this, there will be no automatic right to family reunion for refugees unless they successfully enter the ""protection work and study"" route and become eligible to sponsor family members.

Children won't be separated from the parents during deportations, though, it is understood.

Financial support not guaranteed

Currently, the government has a legal obligation to provide support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be ""destitute"", but the document says the government will remove this.

Housing and weekly allowances will be discretionary and no longer be guaranteed.

Those with a right to work in the UK who can support themselves but don't may be denied housing and benefits, while those with income and assets such as cars will have to contribute to their costs.

A new body to speed up appeals

A new appeals body will be created to speed up the time it takes to decide whether to refuse an asylum application, allowing those who fail to be deported sooner.

It will be staffed by ""professionally trained adjudicators"", the document states.

Human rights law changes

The Tories and Reform have advocated leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something the prime minister - who was a human rights lawyer - is reluctant to do.

But new legislation will be brought forward to ensure the ECHR's ""right to family life"" clause is balanced against the public interest, as it has been used to prevent deportations.

Ministers will also work with international partners to reform part of the treaty designed to prohibit torture and inhuman treatment, which they say has allowed foreign criminals to stay in the UK because of how it is interpreted.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/11/1600x900/skynews-shabana-mahmood-small-boats_7084629.jpg?20251118000216,N,,2025-11-17 20:57:01.907920

Burns has been using artificial intelligence to generate audio recordings of his courtroom decisions at the New York Broadway Immigration Court, according to internal Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) records obtained by Migrant Insider.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by:

“That seems highly unusual,” said a senior Justice Department official familiar with EOIR operations, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. The official could not confirm whether Burns employs the AI to draft full written decisions or only to read his written rulings aloud using text‑to‑speech software, according to audio files reviewed by Migrant Insider.

A Test Case for AI in the Immigration Courts

The concern comes months after Acting EOIR Director Sirce E. Owen circulated Policy Memorandum 25‑40, which acknowledged that the immigration courts have “neither a blanket prohibition on the use of generative AI in its proceedings nor a mandatory disclosure requirement regarding its use.”

The August memo—distributed internally to all immigration judges and court administrators—permitted individual courts to adopt local standing orders on AI use but did not require them to disclose when such technologies are applied in adjudications.

The memo’s omission of any restriction on text‑to‑voice or AI‑generated decision delivery appears to leave it to individual judges’ discretion. Burns appears to be among the first to take advantage of that gap. His courtroom assistants said the use of “voice rendering” software began earlier this year and is now a regular feature of his decisions.

One of the Nation’s Most Restrictive Judges

Burns’ use of AI tools comes amid controversy over his record as one of the most restrictive immigration judges in the country. According to data compiled by

, Burns approved just 2 percent of asylum claims between fiscal 2019 and 2025—compared with a national average of 57.7 percent. Pathfinder data show the same 2 percent benchmark, placing him among the lowest nationwide.

The numbers have fueled criticism from immigration advocates, who say the fusion of extreme denial rates with opaque AI‑assisted adjudication threatens defendants’ faith in the system. “When a person’s freedom depends on a judge’s voice, there needs to be certainty that it’s the judge’s own reasoning being rendered—not a synthesized layer of technology,” said one immigration lawyer who practices before the Broadway court.

A Highly Controversial Appointment

Internal EOIR emails released through the memos show that Burns’ path to the bench was unusually political. Initially interviewed in May 2020, he was rated “highly qualified” by two Assistant Chief Immigration Judges for his litigation experience but ranked overall as “Not Recommend.” Senior EOIR leadership later overrode that ranking—reclassifying him as “Highly Recommended” in September 2020, just as Trump‑era DOJ officials accelerated appointments of judges with prosecutorial backgrounds.

At the time of his selection, Burns served as an Assistant Chief Counsel for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in New York, where he represented the government in removal proceedings and appeals. His résumé and military record were cited in his eventual appointment announcement that December, one of 14 judges named by the outgoing administration. Nearly all came from government enforcement roles, according to EOIR data logs.

Pattern of Political Replacement

The Burns memos form part of a broader DOJ paper trail indicating a systematic reshaping of the immigration judiciary. Recent EOIR correspondence references the removal—through firings and resignations—of more than 125 judges since January, replaced with politically aligned appointees.

An August rule further loosened hiring standards, allowing the Attorney General to appoint “any licensed attorney” as a temporary immigration judge.

Broader Due Process Implications

EOIR declined to comment on Burns’ use of text‑to‑voice technology or his designation history. A Justice Department spokesperson responded only that “immigration judges apply the law to the facts of each case.”

But as AI applications quietly enter immigration courtrooms without disclosure requirements or oversight, experts warn of an accelerating shift. “We’re witnessing the automation of adjudication in a system that already struggles with fairness,” said one former EOIR official. “When the human element fades, so does accountability.”

The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.

Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”","In an interview with Fox News last week, Vice President JD Vance downplayed the significance of rising inflation and costs for consumer goods in the U.S., claiming that any price increases are not the result of Trump administration policies.

Unlike President Donald Trump, Vance recognized that costs are up compared to last year. But he blamed former President Joe Biden for the increases.

The Trump White House “inherited this terrible inflation crisis from the Biden administration,” Vance said.

The vice president then blamed immigrants for the administration’s lack of action to make housing more affordable. (A new report from the National Association of Realtors, published earlier this month, notes that the median age of homebuyers in the U.S. is now 40 years old — the highest age ever recorded by the organization.)

“A lot of young people are saying, ‘Housing is way too expensive.’ Why is that? Because we flooded the country with 30 million illegal immigrants who are taking houses that ought, by right, go to American citizens,” Vance said.

This claim — frequently peddled by Vance and Trump to deflect blame for the state of the economy — is blatantly false, housing and immigration experts say.

There is “no significant relationship between unauthorized immigrants and general house price growth for each state in the U.S.,” said a joint study from researchers at Texas A&M and the University of Maine published earlier this year.

The National Immigration Forum similarly blasted such reasoning in an explainer on the subject last month, stating:

While immigrants do contribute to rising housing demand, they are not the primary drivers of increasing housing costs. Instead, factors such as housing shortages, restrictive zoning laws, and shifts in housing preferences in the wake of the pandemic are the more dominant forces behind rising prices. Furthermore, immigrant workers are essential to the housing supply, making up a crucial segment of the construction workforce that can address shortages and improving housing stock.

Christopher J. Calton, a research fellow at a nonpartisan think tank called The Independent, condemned the administration in May for blaming immigrants for rising prices.

“The simple truth is that we would have a severe housing shortage even if President Trump were to deport every undocumented immigrant tomorrow,” Calton said, adding that, “the longer we scapegoat immigrants for America’s self-imposed housing shortage, the longer it will take us to solve it.”

Beyond his bigoted remarks about immigrants, Vance’s other claim in the interview — that inflation is the fault of the previous administration — is also flawed.

While inflation was high under the Biden administration, most economists attributed it at the time to the reopening of the economy following the COVID pandemic, as demand for products went up and disruption in supply chains affected prices. “Greedflation” — when corporations use the effects of inflation to justify raising prices higher than is necessary in order to make more profits — also played a role in costs going up.

Even so, year-over-year inflation shrank slightly from 3.0 percent in 2023 to 2.9 percent in 2024. So far in 2025, it appears that inflation is on track to rise by 3.0 percent again.

While not a significantly huge increase, the rate change suggests that Vance’s arguments about an “inherited” inflation problem are false — if prices were getting better under Trump’s watch, that number would be lessening, not growing.

What’s more, studies demonstrate that Trump’s various tariffs have indeed contributed to a rise in retail prices for consumers, amounting to an effective tax rate of about 18 percent on American shoppers, the highest level since 1934.

Trump repeatedly promised to lower prices on the campaign trail last year, vowing to do so “on day one” of taking office. However, just weeks after he won his second term, Trump admitted that he might not be able to keep his pledge.

“I’d like to bring them down. It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard,” Trump said.

Presently, Trump is deflecting from concerns about affordability. In response to off-year elections earlier this month that saw huge wins for Democrats across the country, Trump insisted that voters were not casting their ballots based on concerns about affordability, describing the concept as a “con job” by Democrats. Instead, Trump said he and Republicans “are the ones that have done great on affordability.”

“Our groceries are way down. Everything is way down, and the press doesn’t report it,” Trump said during a White House event nearly two weeks ago.

But that claim is false: Grocery store prices, similar to inflation overall, have increased by 2.7 percent since Trump won the 2024 presidential election.

Trump also disregarded rising prices in a lengthy Truth Social post over the weekend, writing that he and Republicans “are winning BIG” on “the Economy” and “Affordability.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117-vance.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 19:56:45.859852

“UTEP’s embrace of right-wing politics in the last few years has been alarming and is unreflective of El Paso. As a loving, welcoming community, the invitation of Tom Homan is contrary to the values most El Pasoans hold dear.

“Homan has been one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s cruel, hardline mass deportation tactics. Despite promises to go after the ‘worst of the worst,’ their efforts have done little but terrorize families, including mixed-status families, households with immigrants who have been in the country for decades, parents of U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizens themselves. And all of it has come with a significant emotional and financial cost to Americans.

“While I believe in productive debate and genuine conversation, I’m disappointed and ashamed that the leadership at UTEP is amplifying someone who is actively engaged in demonizing many of those who attend UTEP like DREAMERs, individuals in mixed-status families and first generation Americans, all of whom have long considered UTEP to be a safe place. Attendees should expect a white-washed, ugly rewriting of recent history.”

The university’s invitations of figures like former Vice President Mike Pence and Tom Homan have conspicuously occurred after senior leadership at UTEP intensely pushed back on hosting an event with Congresswoman Escobar and the Biden administration to celebrate the institution’s National Science Foundation grant award in 2024, claiming it would be a ‘political' event.

About Tom Homan

Tom Homan has a dishonorable history. Recent reporting details a lack of ethical judgement, corrupt behavior, and an eager willingness to execute the Trump administration’s cruel, un-American agenda. He played a central role in lobbying Republicans in Congress to syphon billions in taxpayer dollars to fund astronomically high levels for ICE, including the $1.24 billion detention camp in El Paso, which houses immigrants in inhumane conditions.

In February 2025, it was reported that Homan met several times with a right-wing activist with ties to the Proud Boys about the Trump administration’s deportation plans in Chicago. He was also a consultant for GEO Group, one of the private prison companies that has received millions in federal contracts from the Trump administration for the immigration enforcement. Most recently, Tom Homan was recorded by the FBI as part of an undercover operation accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help the undercover agents — who were posing as business executives — win government contracts in a second Trump administration. The investigation was shut down by the FBI and Justice Department after a Trump Justice Department appointee called the case a “deep state” probe in early 2025. He also attacked the Catholic church – including El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz – for the criticism of his inhumane deportation tactics.

The Trump administration estimated that the government would save $8.97 billion annually because people would drop out of Medicaid and other benefit programs — including “aliens as well as U.S. citizens who are members of mixed-status households.”

The announcement also notes that the rule “might result in reduced revenues for healthcare providers, such as hospitals and nonprofits, participating in Medicaid” and hit the bottom line of “companies that manufacture medical supplies or pharmaceuticals.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F97%2Fd7%2F63c9180a4d25b978fe329045a536%2Ftrump-fifa-wcup-06555.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 18:57:40.266260

These laws cannot stand.” In its 16-page complaint, the Trump administration says that it “will not comply” with the state statutes.
“If enforced against the Federal Government, the laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the lawsuit says.
And it appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents,” Newsom said during an interview with podcaster Justin Kanew.
California has also joined an Oregon lawsuit against Trump’s attempt to use National Guard soldiers to control anti-ICE protests in Portland.","Supporters of the laws say they are needed to provide accountability for immigration agents who have used excessive force, made unlawful arrests and threatened citizens exercising their First Amendment rights to protest Trump’s mass deportation campaign. Opponents, including top Trump administration officials, say the laws are aimed at making it easier for activists to intimidate federal law enforcement personnel.

“Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe, and they do not deserve to be doxed or harassed simply for carrying out their duties,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents. These laws cannot stand.”

In its 16-page complaint, the Trump administration says that it “will not comply” with the state statutes. However, Justice Department lawyers say the measures — which take effect Jan. 1 — “have the purpose and likely effect of impeding federal law enforcement in the State of California” by causing federal officers to fear they could face prosecution in state courts.

“If enforced against the Federal Government, the laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the lawsuit says.

“If the Trump administration cared half as much about public safety as it does about pardoning cop-beaters, violating people’s rights, and detaining U.S. citizens and their kids, our communities would be much safer,” a spokesperson for Newsom said. “We’ll see the U.S. Department of Justice in court.”

“It’s problematic when Californians can’t tell the difference between a law enforcement officer who is charged with protecting them and a criminal who is attempting to cause them harm,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said. “The FBI itself has warned that the practice of ICE agents wearing masks to obscure their identity has led to a rise in copycats committing crimes, threatening public safety and eroding trust in law enforcement. My office is responsible for defending the laws of California, and we will do so here.”

The Trump administration’s complaint notes that in June Newsom cast doubt on the legal validity of the legislation under discussion at that time. “We’re looking at the constitutionality of it. And it appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents,” Newsom said during an interview with podcaster Justin Kanew.

California and federal officials have been at loggerheads in court over immigration-related policies for years. Earlier this year, Newsom sued unsuccessfully to block Trump from deploying National Guard troops to protect immigration enforcement operations and federal buildings in Los Angeles.

California has also joined an Oregon lawsuit against Trump’s attempt to use National Guard soldiers to control anti-ICE protests in Portland. That case has effectively halted use of the troops for weeks, reportedly prompting the administration to move to return 200 California troops to their home state.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5f%2Fb8%2Fe43f9fb34fa39d64f6a3d203fecd%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2220424107,N,,2025-11-17 18:57:44.459781

Federal immigration authorities carried out nearly 100 arrests in the Charlotte area on Saturday, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner.

Local officials, including Mayor Vi Lyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing ""unnecessary fear and uncertainty"" in the community.

Since Trump's return to office, he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago to deliver on his promise of ""the largest deportation programme"" in US history.

The DHS announced ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" on Saturday, saying ""criminal illegal aliens"" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.

Several church members tending to the front garden of a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor.

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there were ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said it was carrying out the operation because North Carolina had failed to adhere to requests to keep nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees in custody, who had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - which have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a ""certified welcoming city"". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.

""President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,"" the DHS said.

Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US.

DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing.

Earlier in the week, US representative and Democrat Alma Adams said she was informed of the operation and was ""extremely concerned"" about Border Patrol and ICE agents arriving in North Carolina.

The next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed there.

The two men sought to represent a class of detainees, but the class-action status needed approval from a judge.
But Gettleman found that the plaintiffs overcame that hurdle, while also meeting requirements around numbers of potential class members.

The complaint, filed in October, accused Department of Homeland Security officials of cramming people into dirty holding cells and not providing enough food and water, among other problems, as they sought to boost immigration arrests during the Operation Midway Blitz enforcement operation. It also claims that officials blocked attorney access at the site and coerced people into signing voluntary deportation forms.

The Tribune got a rare look inside Broadview’s ICE processing center in 2009. Here’s what we saw.

It was filed on behalf of Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, who were detained there for several days in October. The two men sought to represent a class of detainees, but the class-action status needed approval from a judge.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman on Monday handed the win to the plaintiffs, even though the government argued that detainees had differing experiences there, given that some were only held for a few hours.

But Gettleman found that the plaintiffs overcame that hurdle, while also meeting requirements around numbers of potential class members.

“Plaintiffs state that, according to ICE data, ICE detained 5,202 individuals at Broadview between January 1, 2025, and July 28, 2025,” Gettleman’s order said. “These figures are from the period prior to the announcement of ‘Operation Midway Blitz,’ which caused a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.”

The class is likely more than 1,000 people, the judge found.

The class certification came days after a federal magistrate judge and a cadre of attorneys became some of the only outsiders in recent months to tour the facility, which is now under a temporary restraining order that requires the government to improve conditions there.

After a full-day hearing earlier this month during which detainees described overcrowded cells and scant food, Gettleman found that conditions at the facility — which was not built to house people overnight — did not “pass constitutional muster.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-broadview-black-caucus118_243497542_92295b.jpg?w=1024&h=735,N,,2025-11-17 20:57:05.500194

""As pastors, we, the bishops of the United States, are bound to our people by ties of communion and compassion in our Lord, Jesus Christ. We are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.""

""We are saddened by the state of contemporary debate and the vilification of immigrants. We are concerned about the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care.""
